For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-21\">Petitioner applied for disability retirement annuity benefits in 1980 on the ground of mental disability. His application was initially denied by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), but OPM\u2019s decision was reversed by the Board. Petitioner then applied to the Board for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1). On May 3, 1982, the presiding official granted him an award of $1,717.50, which became final when it was neither appealed by the Government nor reopened by the Board\u2019s own motion within the 35-day period mandated by regulation. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-22\">OPM subsequently failed to comply with the Board\u2019s order. Petitioner therefore filed a petition to the Board for enforcement of its order in July 1982. This petition was denied by the presiding official, who held, based on the MSPB\u2019s recently issued decision, <em>Vergagni v. OPM, </em>11 MSPB 125, 12 M.S.P.R. 494 (1982), that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g) does not entitle employees to attorney\u2019s fees in employee-initiated disability retirement cases. The full Board affirmed but modified this decision, relying instead on a recently issued decision of this court, <em>Williams v. OPM, </em>718 F.2d 1553 (Fed.Cir.1983), to hold that it lacked jurisdiction to grant petitioner attorney\u2019s fees. In <em>Williams, </em>the court held that the Board lacks authority to grant attorney\u2019s fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) in voluntary physical disability retirement cases, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>cause the United States had not waived its sovereign immunity in this type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Subsequent to the Board\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Lin-dahl v. OPM, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985). This decision overruled the decision of this court, reported at 718 F.2d 391, which was in turn relied on as part of the basis for its decision in <em>Williams. </em>In <em>Simmons v. MSPB, </em>768 F.2d 323 (Fed.Cir.1985), this court ruled that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lindahl, </em>together with this court\u2019s jurisdictional holding in another recent case <em>(Bronger v. OPM, </em>740 F.2d 1552 (Fed.Cir.1984)), \u201csufficiently undermine the foundations of <em>Williams\u201d </em>as to call for the conclusion that <em>Williams </em>is no longer good law. After examining these cases, as well as MSPB procedures, the court concluded that the Board has jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees in voluntary disability retirement cases under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Petitioner here contends that his claim for disability retirement was involuntary, and therefore covered by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(2). If we were to accept this argument, the Board would without question possess the authority to award petitioner attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(2); <em>Williams, </em>718 F.2d at 1555. Even if we reject this argument, however, and accept the Government\u2019s contention that petitioner voluntarily sought disability retirement under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(1), our decision in <em>Simmons </em>establishes that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal, and that this court has jurisdiction over his appeal from the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Consequently, the decision of the MSPB, holding that it lacked the authority to enforce its award of attorney\u2019s fees, must be reversed. This case is therefore remanded to the Board for enforcement of its original award, and for the allowance of any additional attorney\u2019s fees to which petitioner is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
