He petitions for review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals denying his request for asylum and withholding of deportation. Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision, we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">Lopez contends that the Board erred in requiring him to establish his asylum claim by a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d rather than by a standard of \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">Section 208(a) of the Refugee Act of 1980, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (1982), allows \u201crefugees\u201d to be granted asylum in this country. The Act defines \u201crefugee\u201d as including a person having a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (1982). We have held that the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard of section 208(a) is \u201cmore generous\u201d and \u201cmore liberal\u201d than the \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d test. <em>Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1277, 1282-83 (9th Cir.1985) (amending 749 F.2d 1316); <em>see INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 2498, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">The \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d test applies to petitions for withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) (1982). That provision</p>\n<p id=\"apq-dedup-1\">prohibits the Attorney General from deporting any alien who can show that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted if returned to his country. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2498; <em>Sarvia-Ouintanilla v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1387, 1392 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">An asylum request must be distinguished from a petition for withholding of deportation and the governing standards of evidence are significantly different. However, in this case, the Board of Immigration Appeals expressly stated that \u201cour conclusion is the same whether we apply the standard of \u2018clear probability\u2019 or a <em>lesser standard, </em>such as a \u2018good reason\u2019____\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree that Lopez has simply failed to establish substantive evidence of fear of persecution under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-17\">Asylum applicants must present \u201cspecific facts\u201d through objective evidence to prove either past persecution or \u201cgood reason\u201d to fear future persecution. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1448, 1453 (9th Cir.1985), <em>citing Carvajal-Munoz v. INS, </em>743 F.2d 562, 574 (7th Cir.1984). The only evidence on the asylum issue was the application and Lopez\u2019 uncorroborated testimony before the immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-18\">Lopez departed El Salvador before the outbreak of civil war hostilities and admitted in testimony that he left for economic reasons. Although he testified that close relatives in El Salvador have been killed and injured, he disclaimed any knowledge as to the circumstances of their deaths. He failed to provide any evidence that these were civil war casualties as opposed to common criminal violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-19\">He argues that his political neutrality will place him in danger from opposing forces on both sides in the civil war. However, Lopez did not make an affirmative choice of political neutrality. <em>Compare Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1286-87 &amp; n. 18 (asylum applicant was aware of contending political forces and made a conscious and deliberate choice not to join ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>ther warring faction) <em>with Saballo-Cortez v. INS, </em>761 F.2d 1259, 1264 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.1985) (asylum applicant had simply failed to take any political position). Rather his testimony evinces apathy, saying he does not oppose the government nor support the rebels and has no opinion on how the country should be governed. Nor has Lopez set forth any specific evidence indicating that he has any reason to believe he might be persecuted for failing to take sides. <em>See Chavez v. INS, </em>723 F.2d 1431, 1434 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">Finally, Lopez argues that he would be subject to persecution for religious views as an active member of the Catholic church. That issue simply was never raised below. Neither his application nor his testimony indicated any fear of religious persecution. He merely acknowledged that he was a Catholic communicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">In sum, the fear Lopez expressed was not of the possibility of individual persecution but rather of the dangers inherent in the general conditions of upheaval in El Salvador. <em>See Chavez, </em>723 F.2d at 1434. As the immigration judge noted, under Lopez\u2019 theory, nearly the entire population of El Salvador would qualify for asylum in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Lopez additionally asserts that he was denied due process by virtue of ineffective assistance of counsel. Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. <em>See Paul v. INS, </em>521 F.2d 194, 198-99 (5th Cir.1975). The fact that counsel represented several aliens simultaneously at a preliminary hearing where no merits evidence was presented simply does not rise to the level of significance. The record clearly shows that the attorney consulted with each person individually before entering pleas. At the merits hearing, Lopez\u2019 counsel asked him open-ended questions giving him a full opportunity to present his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
