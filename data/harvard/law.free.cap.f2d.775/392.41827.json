(\u201cCitizens\u201d) appeals from a decision of the Federal Communications Commission rejecting without a hearing its petition to deny the application of Riverside Broadcasting Company, Inc. (\u201cRiverside\u201d) for a radio broadcasting license renewal. The case presents the question of the proper standard to be used by the Commission in determining whether a petition to deny on the basis of licensee misrepresentation presents \u201ca substantial and material question of fact\u201d and therefore must be set for hearing, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d)(2) (1982); and the question whether that standard was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">On July 24, 1978, Viacom International, Inc. (\u201cViacom\u201d) and the former owner of Riverside, Sonderling Broadcasting Corporation (\u201cSonderling\u201d), filed with the Commission an application to transfer the control of Riverside from Sonderling to Viacom. In that application, Viacom stated that it would continue the station\u2019s jazz format, under which approximately sixty percent of the air time was devoted to jazz music. The application was granted on November 28, 1979, and transfer was effected on March 25, 1980. Just under six months later, on September 8, 1980, the entertainment format of the station was changed from jazz to country-and-western music.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-18\">When Riverside\u2019s broadcasting license came up for renewal, Citizens, on April 29, 1981, filed a petition to deny the renewal application, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Viacom had misrepresented its programming intentions in the transfer application. As direct evidence of this charge, Citizens submitted the affidavit of Carole Lee, a former station employee, who stated that Roy Son-derling, Vice President of Sonderling, and David Meyer, an attorney for Viacom, had told her before the granting of the transfer application that Viacom would be changing the programming format. Citizens also pointed to the following circumstantial evidence: the fact that the day after the transfer two executives of Viacom\u2019s country-and-western stations were appointed National Program Director and President <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>of Viacom\u2019s Radio Division; the practical difficulties of arranging a million-dollar advertising campaign and establishing a new identity and format as quickly as Viacom did <em>{viz., </em>in less than a month) after the date Viacom asserted the decision to change format was made (August 4, 1980); and public statements by the station\u2019s general manager and Viacom\u2019s new Radio Division President explaining that the reason for the change was poor audience ratings going back to 1977, which were known by Viacom before the transfer application was filed. In response, Riverside filed affidavits of Sonderling and Meyer denying having made such statements to Lee, and denying any knowledge of a format change at the time of the alleged statements. Riverside also filed affidavits of its Radio Division President and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stating that format changes were not even proposed until June of 1980, and that no commitment to change was made until August of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">By opinion and order issued April 15, 1983, the Commission rejected Citizens\u2019 petition to deny and, without evidentiary hearing, granted Riverside\u2019s renewal application. <em>Riverside Broadcasting Co., </em>53 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 1154 (1983). On July 18, 1984, by further opinion and order, it denied Citizens\u2019 petition for reconsideration. <em>Riverside Broadcasting Co., </em>56 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 618 (1984). Citizens appeals under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)(6) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Petitioner\u2019s principal contention is that, as a matter of law, the facts set forth in the petition to deny raised a substantial and material question of fact requiring an evidentiary <em>hearing </em>\u2014 i.e., that any judgment to the contrary would be so irrational as to be arbitrary and capricious, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982). Because all parties agree that allegations of misrepresentation are material to license renewal, <em>see, e.g., Leflore Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>636 F.2d 454, 461 (D.C.Cir.1980), the dispute centers on the question of \u201csubstantiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ank-dedup-0\">The statutorily prescribed process for the Commission\u2019s factual evaluation of challenges to broadcast licenses embodies three separate determinations, which \u2014 though often made concurrently rather than successively \u2014 are quite distinct. <em>First, </em>the Commission must determine whether the petition to deny sets forth \u201cspecific allegations of fact sufficient to show that ... a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with [the public interest, convenience, and necessity].\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d)(1). If it does not meet this threshold requirement, it can form no basis for an evidentiary hearing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. FCC, </em>652 F.2d 72, 90 (D.C.Cir.1980). Even if it does meet the requirement, however, the Commission must determine, <em>second, </em>whether \u201con the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which [the Commission] may officially notice,\u201d \u201ca substantial and material question of fact is presented.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d)(2). If not, no evidentiary hearing need be held. <em>Third, </em>whether or not an evidentiary hearing is held, the Commission must make the ultimate determination of whether the facts establish that the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity will be served by the granting [of the application].\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a). As our subsequent discussion will show, petitioner\u2019s position in this case tended to confuse the first and second determinations; and the Commission\u2019s the second and third.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Citizens asserts that \u201c[i]f a petitioner ... \u2018alleges facts which, if established, raise a substantial [question] ... he must have a hearing.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner at 11 (quoting <em>Hecksher v. FCC, </em>253 F.2d 872, 873 (D.C.Cir.1958)). Not so. That was the law at the time <em>Hecksher </em>was decided, but reversing it was one of the principal purposes of the 1960 amendments that produced the currently governing provisions. <em>See generally </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1800, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 9-12, <em>reprinted in </em>1960 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3516, 3517-20. Under these provisions, a protestant\u2019s allegations are regarded as \u201cif established\u201d for purposes of the first determination described above \u2014 whether a prima facie case has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>been made by the petition to deny. <em>See, e.g., Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, </em>505 F.2d 320, 323-24 (D.C.Cir.1974) (quoting <em>West Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. FCC, </em>396 F.2d 688, 691 (D.C.Cir.1968)). But for purposes of the second determination \u2014 whether there exists, by reason of a valid petition or otherwise, \u201ca substantial and material question of fact\u201d requiring a hearing \u2014 the Commission may, and indeed must, weigh against the allegations of the petition the other evidence before it, including opposing affidavits filed pursuant to \u00a7 309(d)(1). On the basis of <em>all </em>those materials it must decide whether the ultimate question of fact placed in issue (in this case, the question of conscious misrepresentation by the transferee) is a \u201csubstantial\u201d <em>one </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>whether the totality of the evidence arouses a sufficient doubt on the point that further inquiry is called for. <em>See, e.g., Columbus Broadcasting Coalition, </em>505 F.2d at 330; <em>Broadcast Enterprises, Inc. v. FCC, </em>390 F.2d 483, 485 (D.C.Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The factual question whose substantiality is at issue for purposes of the determination regarding evidentiary hearing is the <em>ultimate </em>fact and not the proximate ones that are ordinarily the \u201cspecific allegations of fact\u201d set forth in the petition to deny and supported by affidavits on the basis of personal knowledge. <em>See, e.g., Stone v. FCC, </em>466 F.2d 316, 327 (D.C.Cir.1972). In this case, for example, it is not whether Meyer told Lee in 1978 that the format would be changed. Rather, the relevant factual question, which this proximate factual allegation bears upon, is whether the transferee intentionally misled the Commission. If the proximate rather than the ultimate facts were the focus of the \u201csubstantial question\u201d inquiry, then simply by admitting the proximate facts an applicant could deny a petitioner the opportunity to elicit in discovery and cross-examination the further facts necessary to elevate its case from one which merely raises a serious question of disqualifying behavior to one which establishes it by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 or, as the Commission said was required for a finding of misrepresentation, by \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d evidence. <em>Riverside Broadcasting Co., </em>53 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) at 1157 (quoting <em>Overmyer Communications Co., </em>56 F.C.C.2d 918, 925 (1974)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">It is for this reason that we cannot agree with the statement in respondent\u2019s brief that \u201cwhere the disposition of a petition to deny turns on a determination of \u2018inferences to be drawn from facts already known,\u2019 an evidentiary hearing is not required.\u201d Brief for Respondent at 12 (quoting <em>Anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith v. FCC, </em>403 F.2d 169, 171 (D.C.Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 930, 89 S.Ct. 1190, 22 L.Ed.2d 459 (1969)). It is true that it is not <em>invariably </em>required; but not true (as respondent implies) that it is <em>never </em>required. A weak inference can no more raise a substantial question regarding the ultimate fact than can a weak factual showing; but a strong inference assuredly can. If, to take an example based on the facts of the present case, it were known or admitted that one week before the transfer application was filed, the president of Viacom issued instructions that a plan for shifting from jazz to country-and-western programming be readied for immediate implementation, it seems to us inconceivable that the Commission could decline to hold a hearing on the question of misrepresentation, at which further evidence could be elicited concerning that ultimate fact. The drawing of inferences from undisputed proximate facts, like the balancing of disputed proximate facts, is a matter for the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>mission\u2019s judgment. But no more for the one than for the other can that judgment be sustained if it is so irrational as to be arbitrary or capricious. <em>See California Public Broadcasting Forum v. FCC, </em>752 F.2d 670, 679 (D.C.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The uncontested facts in the present petition to deny consisted of the promotion within the Viacom organization, immediately after the transfer, of two executives with special background in country-and-western programming; the temporal proximity of the format change to the transfer; and the low audience ratings of the jazz format at the time of transfer. While, for the reasons just stated, we reject Commission counsel\u2019s automatic dismissal of these allegations as a basis for a required eviden-tiary hearing simply because they were uncontested and only the inferences from them were in dispute; we nonetheless do not find them to be such strong circumstantial evidence of misrepresentation as to justify reversing the Commission\u2019s, judgment that that ultimate question was not a substantial one. None of them is necessarily inconsistent with an innocent view of events, and the inference of guilt was directly refuted by sworn affidavits of no intent to change format, which the Commission was required to weigh in the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">As to the factual allegations that were contested, contained in the affidavit of Carole Lee: In view of the fact that neither of the individuals asserted to have told Lee of a planned format change was remotely responsible for making such plans (one was Vice President of the transferor and the other a lawyer for the transferee); the fact that both of them, who at the present time have no apparent interest in the transferee, categorically deny the alleged statements; and the fact that those who <em>were </em>responsible for the station\u2019s programming immediately after the transfer deny the existence of any planned format change; we find it impossible to hold that these statements, together with the weak inference from the uncontested facts, required a finding that a substantial question concerning misrepresentation was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Petitioner also raised, though only in passing, an argument that goes not to whether the Commission\u2019s action was permissible under the applicable criteria, but to whether the applicable criteria were in fact used. To say, as we just have, that the Commission <em>could </em>lawfully reach the judgment that no substantial question of fact was presented is not to say that it <em>did </em>so. Citizens asserts, in essence, that the Commission applied to the second determination in the proceeding (whether an evidentiary hearing should be held) the standard that was only appropriate for the third determination (whether the application should be <em>granted) </em>\u2014 i.e., that it required the evidence to establish \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d proof of misrepresentation, instead of merely to raise a \u201csubstantial question\u201d concerning that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">As we have noted earlier, all three determinations relevant to a petition to deny are typically made concurrently: Whether the petition to deny meets the statutory requirements, whether the application under consideration raises a factual issue substantial enough to call for a hearing, and (if not) whether the license should be granted, are discussed in the same opinion \u2014 if, indeed, they are discussed separately <em>at all, </em>which is rarely, since a negative resolution of the second question alone makes the first question moot and the answer to the third one (insofar as the particular issue raised in the petition is concerned) foreordained. But even making due allowance for normal ellipsis and imprecision, we must agree with petitioner that, at least as far as its expressed reasoning is concerned, the Commission in the present case applied the third-determination standard to the second-determination issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The analysis in the Commission\u2019s initial opinion began with the statement that proof of misrepresentation requires evidence that is \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d; proceeded to a discussion of why the evidence in this case did not meet that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>standard; and concluded that \u201c[a]ccordingly, the petitioners\u2019 allegations of misprepresentation <em>[sic </em>] fail to raise a substantial and material question of fact.\u201d <em>Riverside Broadcasting Co., </em>53 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) at 1157. When petitioner raised the same objection it has presented here, the Commission\u2019s opinion on reconsideration persisted in the same analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">Citizens also charges that the standard of evidence applied in the Commission Order \u2014 that the burden is on the accuser to show misrepresentation by evidence that is \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d\u2014 is actually the standard to be applied during a hearing, not before. However, in order to raise a substantial and material question of fact necessitating such a hearing, the petitioner must provide specific allegations of fact which are capable of meeting such a burden. The \u201cevidence\u201d submitted by petitioners did not constitute such a showing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>Riverside Broadcasting Co., </em>56 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) at 620 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We agree with petitioner that this was error. <em>After </em>denying a request for an evi-dentiary hearing, the Commission is assuredly entitled to apply the merits decision standard (whether it be the normal \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d or the \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d test) to the evidence before it and, when the standard is not met, to reject the petition to deny and grant the application. But satisfaction of that standard is <em>not </em>the criterion for determining whether a hearing should be held before the final judgment is made. Rather, the criterion is, as the statute provides, whether the material properly before the Commission presents \u201ca substantial and material question of fact.\u201d It would be peculiar to require, as a precondition for a hearing, that the petitioner fully establish (in the face of the applicant\u2019s contrary affidavit evidence) what it is the very purpose of the hearing to inquire into; and the statutory requirement of a \u201csubstantial question\u201d is a particularly inapt choice of language to convey that peculiarity. The statute in effect says that the Commission must look into the possible existence of a fire only when it is shown a good deal of smoke; the Commission has said that it will look into the possible existence of a fire only when it is shown the existence of a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The intervenor seeks to justify this lapse in the Commission\u2019s reasoning by asserting that the Commission was not mistakenly applying the standard for the <em>third </em>(merits) determination, but was rather correctly applying the standard for the <em>first </em>determina<em>tion </em>\u2014 i.e., it concluded that no hearing had to be held because the petition to deny did not meet the statutory requirement of setting forth \u201cspecific allegations of fact sufficient to show that ... a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with [the public interest, convenience, and necessity].\u201d Brief for Intervenor at 8. That cannot be so, for several reasons. First, the \u201cprima facie sufficiency\u201d determination is to be made on the assumption that the specific facts set forth are true, and without reference to evidence on the other side; but the Commission\u2019s rejection here rested upon the implausibility of the asserted proximate facts (because of contradicting affidavits) and upon direct evidence regarding the ultimate fact submitted by the applicant. And second, \u201cpri-ma facie sufficiency\u201d means the degree of evidence necessary to make, <em>not </em>a fully persuasive case, but rather what a reasonable factfinder <em>might </em>view as a persuasive case \u2014 the quantum, in other words, that would induce a trial judge to let a case go to the jury even though he himself would (if nothing more were known) find against the plaintiff. <em>See </em>Ballentine\u2019S Law Dictionary 987 (3d ed. 1969). It may be that the existence of a higher-than-usual proof requirement (the \u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d standard) at the merits determination stage entails some augmentation of the demonstration needed to meet the \u201cprima facie sufficiency\u201d requirement (as well as the demonstration needed to establish a \u201csubstantial question of fact\u201d). If so, however, it surely does not augment it to a level identical to that of the merits determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>nation, which is the standard the Commission applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We emphasize that nothing in our opinion is meant to cast doubt upon the validity of past Commission decisions denying evidentiary hearings, or to establish a new and more stringent standard for such denials. To the contrary, we merely reaffirm the standard that the Commission and the courts have applied in the past and that the present Commission opinion either ignores or misdescribes. It remains a standard, as we discussed in Part II of this opinion, which leaves it to the Commission to determine when a factual question is substantial enough to justify the burden of an evidentiary hearing. And our review of that determination is particularly deferential, not only because it is, as we have said, inherently the sort of judgment akin to the \u201cprobable cause\u201d determination made by prosecutors, <em>see Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>425 F.2d 543, 546 (D.C.Cir.1969), but also because \u201cCongress intended to vest in the FCC a large discretion to avoid time-consuming hearings in this field whenever possible,\u201d <em>Southwestern Operating Co. v. FCC, </em>351 F.2d 834, 835 (D.C.Cir.1965) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">But the determination must at least be <em>made </em>\u2014 and since, as far as we can tell from the Commission\u2019s expression, it was not made here, we must remand for further consideration (and, if the Commission finds it necessary, further proceedings) consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. The Commission did not observe that the standard set forth in the quoted ALJ opinion in <em>Overmyer </em>was disapproved (in favor of the \u201cpreponderance-of-the-evidence\u201d standard) by the Review Board. <em>See Overmyer Communications Co., </em>54 F.C.C.2d 1045, 1060 (1975). However, since petitioner has not challenged this application of a higher-than-usual standard of proof to the merits determination, we assume, without deciding, that it is valid. <em>But see, </em>in addition to the Review Board opinion in <em>Overmyer, Lewel Broadcasting, Inc., </em>86 F.C.C.2d 896, 914 (1981). <em>Cf. Steadman v. SEC, </em>450 U.S. 91, 101 S.Ct. 999, 67 L.Ed.2d 69 (1981). <em>See generally </em>Murchison, <em>Misrepresentation and the FCC, </em>37 Fed.Com.L.J. 403, 446-50 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
