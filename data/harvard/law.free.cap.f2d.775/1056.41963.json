We find prejudicial error in the district court\u2019s allowance of cross-examination directed at Lester\u2019s affiliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>with an East Oakland drug ring called \u201cthe mob.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">This case arose from an incident on February 17, 1984. Oakland police approached a car on a side street. The appellants were in the front seat and LaVonne Henderson, a juvenile, sat in the back. The police testified that as they approached, they flashed their badges and the defendants fled in the car. The defendants\u2019 testimony was that the police were not in uniform, and they brandished large guns which frightened the defendants. In either event, a high speed chase ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">The police testified that at one point during the chase, they saw Lester, the driver, attempt to throw out a plastic bag, but that the car\u2019s swerving prevented him from doing so. Once the ear regained its equilibrium, the police said, Dickens, Lester\u2019s co-defendant, successfully tossed the bag out from the passenger side. After the arrest, the police testified, they retrieved from the sidewalk a bag that contained heroin in 110 balloons. Defendants denied there ever was a bag. When arrested, Lester had a ring valued between $2000 and $5000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-29\">During cross-examination of Lester, the prosecutor asked whether he had been given the ring by someone named Felix Mitchell. Lester\u2019s denials prompted further questions about Lester\u2019s relationship with Mitchell and Mitchell\u2019s \u201cbusiness.\u201d When Lester denied that Mitchell led a group called \u201cthe mob,\u201d the government asked Lester about an earlier trial of Lester\u2019s brother, at which, according to the prosecutor, a witness identified Lester as \u201cbelonging to \u2018the mob.\u2019 \u201d After Lester denied the identification, the prosecutor pursued further questions about Mitchell, including questioning which brought out that the \u201cmob\u201d was in the business of selling drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-30\">Defendants made all appropriate objections and moved for a mistrial contending, as they do now on appeal, that the cross-examination discrediting defendants by associating them with organized crime should not have been permitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>admits that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Lester\u2019s identification at his brother\u2019s trial was premature, but contends that the remainder of the questioning about Mitchell and \u201cthe mob\u201d was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">A defendant\u2019s guilt may not be proven by associating him with unsavory characters. <em>United States v. Pritchett, </em>699 F.2d 317, 319-20 (6th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Romo, </em>669 F.2d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>628 F.2d 54, 56-57 (D.C.Cir.1980). It is error for the prosecutor to draw a connection to a group engaged in criminal activity when it serves no purpose and is without foundation. <em>See United States v. Marques, </em>600 F.2d 742, 749 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1019, 100 S.Ct. 674, 62 L.Ed.2d 649 (1980); <em>United States v. Love, </em>534 F.2d 87, 88-89 (6th Cir.1976). No direct evidence was offered or admitted which connected Lester or Dickens with \u201cthe mob,\u201d nor is it contended that such evidence has any probative value in proving commission of the crimes charged. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <em>United States v. Bailleaux, </em>685 F.2d 1105, 1109 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">The prosecution argues that its questions were probative as impeachment for the purpose of undermining credibility. Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) controls the extent of cross-examination, allowing examination into \u201cspecific instances\u201d of a witness\u2019 conduct if probative of the witness\u2019 truthfulness or untruthfulness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The extent of such questioning is a matter within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Miranda-Uriarte, </em>649 F.2d 1345, 1353-54 (9th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>536 F.2d 1278, 1282 (9th Cir.1976). Evidence of association with others affiliated with the \u201cmob,\u201d even though the others may have been engaged in criminal activity, did not bear on Lester\u2019s truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">Even if Lester had actually previously been convicted of a drug related crime, the conviction would have been admissible for credibility impeachment purposes only if the crime had been punishable by more than one year and after the district court had carefully weighed its probative value against prejudice. Fed.R.Evid. 609. Lester\u2019s association with a group engaged in criminal conduct is not itself a crime, and is, standing alone, not admissible for credibility impeachment purposes under Fed.R. Evid. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-14\">The government relies upon <em>United States v. Able, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984), where the Supreme Court held that cross-examination of a witness\u2019s membership in a group pledged to lie was permissible in order to show bias and motive to commit perjury. The prosecutor in <em>Able </em>brought out in cross-examination of a defense witness that both the witness and the defendant were members of a \u201csecret prison gang that required its members always to deny the existence of the organization and to commit perjury, theft, and murder on each member\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 467. The Court held that the common membership of the defendant and the witness in a group pledged to protect each other by any available means showed \u201ca powerful motive to slant his testimony towards [the defendant], or even commit perjury outright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470. <em>See also United States v. Sommerstedt, </em>752 F.2d 1494, 1499 (9th Cir.1985) (holding that evidence that defense witnesses were members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>the same organization of tax protesters as defendant was properly admitted to show bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">The cross-examination in this ease shows nothing of the sort. Defendant\u2019s association with \u201cthe mob\u201d does not demonstrate any motive for lying or indicate any bias in connection with this trial. Indeed, since it was the defendant himself who was being cross-examined, rather than a witness, as in <em>Able, </em>the defendant\u2019s bias in his own behalf was self-evident. That the witness in <em>Able </em>was only a witness and not the defendant was part of the rationale of the Supreme Court decision. <em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">The government also suggests that Lester opened the door on direct examination to inquiry about Mitchell\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d when on direct, he denied dealing in drugs. But Lester never mentioned Mitchell or \u201cthe mob\u201d on direct examination. It was error to permit the entire line of questioning concerning \u201cthe mob.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">\u201cWe reverse [a conviction] for non-constitutional error only if it was more probable than not that the error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>747 F.2d 1273, 1277 (9th Cir.1984). With respect to the issue of prejudice, we observe that the trial was very short, lasting only a day and a half. The defendants\u2019 testimony was corroborated by Henderson, the third person in the car. There were no fingerprints or other physical evidence linking appellants to the contraband, so the case rested solely on the credibility of the witnesses. The questioning was prejudicial error as to both defendants because the case for and against both was identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">Since we conclude that the convictions must be reversed, we need not address appellants\u2019 contentions with respect to Lester\u2019s testifying about a prior juvenile conviction. The issue is not likely to recur in a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">We have reviewed defendants\u2019 other contentions and they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">.
