A related suit against the Credit Bureau, Inc. (CBI) is' not affected by this order. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of both actions. Since we find that this suit was frivolous, we also impose SANCTIONS of double costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for Macy\u2019s and the FTC against appellants under Fed.R.App.P. 38, and we REMAND to the district court for the award of costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to Macy\u2019s and the FTC under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">I. Facts and proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-6\">The Credit Bureau, Inc. (CBI) maintains credit records on consumers, the Rushes among them. On one such report the Rushes, residents of New Jersey, found an \u201cR-9\u201d credit rating (the lowest possible) next to the entry for their Macy\u2019s account, although the report showed that their Macy\u2019s balance was zero. This poor credit rating allegedly caused the Rushes to be denied credit on several occasions. In 1984 they filed the complaint at issue in this case charging that in generating this report Macy\u2019s and CBI willfully and negligently failed to comply with the FRCA, which regulates credit reporting, and, further, that appellees\u2019 conduct violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \u201csince they [the Rushes] have a property interest in their credit standing in the community.\u201d Appel-lees also sought a writ of <em>mandamus </em>under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361 against the FTC to compel it to deliver to them copies of other court orders against Macy\u2019s and to require it to take up the Rushes\u2019 cause against both other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-7\">The district court, 596 F.Supp. 1540, granted motions to dismiss by Macy\u2019s and the FTC against the Rushes for failure to state a claim, with prejudice. Appellants filed no opposition to these motions, but after the order was entered they now appeal the dismissal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-9\">II. Issues and discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-10\">There is considerable confusion in the briefs for both parties as to what precisely is being appealed. Courts ordinarily look first to the parties that file the appeal \u2014 the Rushes, in this case \u2014 to discover what is at issue, understandably assuming them to know why and what they are appealing. In this case that assumption is perhaps too generous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-11\">The Rushes appear to ask this Court for permission to amend their complaint to allege \u201cdefamation, invasion of privacy or negligence as to false and misleading information furnished with malice or with willful intent to injure the customer\u201d pursuant to FCRA \u00a7 1681h(e). Alternatively, the Rushes seem to argue that the district court should be made to hear their \u201cstate claims\u201d on diversity grounds, even if their federal cause of action is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-12\">The latter argument is frivolous: the court cannot hear state claims if there are not any, and none is alleged at any point in the Rushes\u2019 complaint. Thq^ former request to amend is simply misdirected. \u201cIt is generally agreed that when an actual judgment has been entered dismissing the action, the plaintiff\u2019s right to amend as a matter of course is terminated and he may thereafter amend only upon leave of court. The procedure for so amending is to move to set aside or vacate the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\u201d 27 Fed Proc, L Ed \u00a7 62:256 (1984). There is nothing in the record to suggest that at any time appellants petitioned the district court either to amend their complaint before judgment or to vacate the orders to dismiss. Clearly frivolous claims such as those raised here do no more than waste judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-13\">Macy\u2019s and the FTC assume that the Rushes are appealing the dismissal against them on the merits. If this is true, the standard for review by this Court is whether \u201cbeyond a doubt\u201d the plaintiff could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>\u201cprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-5\">The lower court rejected the Rushes\u2019 argument that their \u201c5th and 14th Amendment rights to credit\u201d were violated, finding \u201cneither statutory nor case authority supporting this position.\u201d This was undoubtedly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-6\">Appellant\u2019s FCRA claim was similarly unsupported. Under that statute civil liability for improper use and dissemination of credit information may be imposed only on a consumer reporting agency or user of reported information who willfully or negligently violates the FCRA. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n and 1681o. Macy\u2019s cannot be held liable for any FCRA violation in this case for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-7\">First, appellants\u2019 complaint did not (and could not) allege that Macy\u2019s is a credit reporting agency or user of reported information. Section 1681a(f) of the FCRA defines a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALQ6\">any person which, for monetary fees, dues or on a cooperative non-profit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1615-8\">Macy\u2019s does not fall within this definition. It did no more than furnish information to a credit reporting agency. <em>See Mitchell v. First National Bank of Dozier, </em>505 F.Supp. 176 (M.D.Ala.1981) (motion to dismiss FCRA claim granted to party who simply furnished information to credit reporting agencies). <em>See also Todd v. Associated Credit Bureau Services, Inc., </em>451 F.Supp. 447 (E.D.Pa.1977) (retail department store that supplied credit information about consumer\u2019s account was not a credit reporting agency under the FCRA). Further, Macy\u2019s is not alleged to be a \u201cuser of reported information\u201d as to the Rushes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-9\">Second, the information provided to CBI by Macy\u2019s was not a \u201cconsumer report\u201d under the FCRA. A consumer report is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1615-10\">any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, or (2) employment purposes, or (3) other purposes authorized under Section 1681(b) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1615-11\">15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1681a(d). This section further provides that the term \u201cconsumer report\u201d does <em>not </em>include \u201cany report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The information that Macy\u2019s provided to CBI was such a report, based solely on its own credit records of store transaction; thus, it cannot constitute a \u201cconsumer report\u201d under the FCRA. <em>See Freeman v. Southern National Bank, </em>531 F.Supp. 94 (S.D.Tx.1982) (FCRA complaint dismissed where bank conveyed only information based on its own credit experience with consumer).</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-12\">Third, appellants\u2019 complaint alleged no facts tending to show that Macy\u2019s \u201cwillfully\u201d or \u201cnegligently\u201d failed to comply with the FRCA. Courts that have considered this issue have held that a plaintiff must contest the accuracy of the \u201ccredit report\u201d (assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that there was one) to prove willfulness or negligence. <em>Middlebrooks v. Retail Credit Company, </em>416 F.Supp. 1013 (N.D.Ga.1976). <em>See also Todd, supra </em>at 449. In fact, the information supplied by Macy\u2019s appears simply to have been the Rushes\u2019 \u201czero balance\u201d; it was CBI that attached the credit rating. Thus, the accuracy of the Macy\u2019s \u201creport\u201d is not called in question and no willfulness or negligence was properly alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>In sum, the complaint against Macy\u2019s clearly failed to state a cause of action and was appropriately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">Appellants also sought <em>mandamus </em>to compel the FTC to provide them with copies of an earlier consent agreement with Macy\u2019s. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that <em>mandamus </em>might be available, it is inappropriate and unnecessary to issue such a writ here where (1) the complaint does not specify when any request for such documents was made, nor does the FTC have any record of a request; (2) the consent decrees are public records available in the FTC\u2019s public reference room; and (3) this \u201ccause of action\u201d is for all practical purposes moot since, as soon as the suit was filed, counsel for the FTC simply mailed appellants a copy of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">Appellants further sought <em>mandamus </em>to compel the FTC to intervene in their private dispute with Macy\u2019s and CBI. This is equally implausible. <em>Mandamus </em>is available only when a government agency has a duty to act on the part of an individual. It is not available to review the discretionary acts of government officials. <em>Rush v. Parham, </em>625 F.2d 1150, 1154 (5th Cir.1980). Appellants do not allege and could not prove any such duty to act on the part of the FTC. The FTC exercises its enforcement powers at its own discretion. <em>Moog Industries, Inc. v. FTC, </em>355 U.S. 411, 78 S.Ct. 377, 2 L.Ed.2d 370 (1958). As the Supreme Court said recently in <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 1656, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1616-8\">an agency decision not to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise. Thus, the agency must not only assess whether a violation has occurred, but whether an agency\u2019s resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits the agency\u2019s overall policies, and indeed, whether the agency has enough resources to undertake the action at all. <em>An agency generally cannot act against each technical violation of the statute it is charged with enforcing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOne\">On these grounds, the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the Rushes\u2019 actions against Maey\u2019s and the FTC was eminently correct, and we AFFIRM that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-11\">III. Sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-12\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1616-13\">If a court of appeal shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1616-14\">Although we are normally reluctant to impose such sanctions, we must do so in the case of patently frivolous appeals if the civil rules are not to be rendered impotent. We find that this appeal was patently frivolous. Appellants had no colorable legal claim against Macy\u2019s or the FTC, much less any plausible issues for appeal. If the Rushes indeed have a grievance, it clearly lies with the CBI. Thus, pursuant to Fed. R.App.P. 38, we award double costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by reason of this appeal to be paid by appellants to Macy\u2019s and the FTC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties are to present to the Clerk of this Court by affidavits and documents, if available, evidence as to the costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by reason of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-15\">Further, we REMAND this case to the district court to consider the imposition of sanctions against appellants\u2019 trial attorney for reasonable expenses by both Macy\u2019s and the FTC in the lower court and reasonable attorney's fees under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1616-9\">. The Rushes\u2019 motion to dismiss the FTC from this appeal comes too late. Appellants reargued the <em>mandamus </em>issue in their brief on appeal, forcing the FTC to prepare to respond in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
