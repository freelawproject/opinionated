The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Transport, holding Chicago primarily liable. Chicago appeals, asserting on appeal that the driver of the vehicle was an insured under both policies and therefore, that the insurance companies should be treated as co-primary insurers. This Court agrees. The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AKcK\">On October 28, 1983, the plaintiff, Bur-nell Gaskin, Jr., was a passenger in a vehicle which was struck from the rear by a 1978 Peterbilt truck driven by Hiram Jow-ers. The truck (a tractor-trailer combination) was owned by Ed Jowers Trucking Company. Hiram Jowers is the sole owner of Ed Jowers Trucking Company. Ed Jow-ers Trucking Company leased the tractor-trailer combination pursuant to ICC regulations to Monroe Warehouse Company, the holder of an ICC Certificate. At the time of the accident, the tractor-trailer combination was identified by placards bearing Monroe Warehouse\u2019s ICC permit number. Chicago insured the tractor owned by Ed Jowers Trucking Company, while Transport insured Monroe Warehouse Company under a comprehensive occupational liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">Burnell Gaskin and his wife Annette Gas-kin sued in Louisiana state court seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained in the accident. The case was removed to federal district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chicago and Transport brought cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of primary coverage. Chicago contended that Chicago and Transport were both primary insurers of Hiram Jowers, the driver of the truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Transport, on the other hand, argued that its insurance provided excess coverage only.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Because the district court found that Hiram Jowers was not an insured under Transport\u2019s policy, the district court held that Chicago\u2019s policy provided primary coverage for the accident. Nevertheless, because of the public policy behind the applicable ICC regulations, the district court held that Transport would be liable for any liability exceeding Chicago\u2019s coverage. The district court entered final judgment on this claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and Chicago appeals. For the reasons stated below, the judgment of the district court is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The primary issue on appeal is whether Hiram Jowers, the driver of the truck, was an insured under one or both of the insurance policies. In support of the district court\u2019s judgment, Transport relies on this Court\u2019s jurisprudence holding that a lessee\u2019s policy does not necessarily provide primary coverage as a matter of law solely because of the applicable ICC regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In <em>Carolina Casualty Insurance Co. v. Underwriters Insurance Co., </em>569 F.2d 304 (5th Cir.1978), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">Therefore, assuming without deciding that the Underwriters [lessee\u2019s insurer\u2019s] policy contains an ICC endorsement, we hold that the endorsement does not make Underwriters [the lessee\u2019s insurer] the primary insurer as a matter of law. Williamson [the driver] was a paid employee of JRJ [the lessor] at the time of the accident, and the leasing agreement granted Williamson permissive use of JRJ\u2019s equipment. Carolina [the lessor\u2019s insurer] insured the risk that a JRJ permissive user might incur liability. Carolina cannot disavow its primary insurer status on the theory that public policy demands that this be pushed off onto Underwriters. ICC policy factors are frequently determinative where protection of a member of the public or a shipper is at stake, but those factors cannot be invoked by another insurance company which has contracted to insure a specific risk and which needs no equivalent protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">569 F.2d at 313 (footnotes omitted). Thus, Transport, in the instant case, is not the primary insurer as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Nevertheless, our inquiry does not end here. The determination that the ICC regulations do not make the Transport policy primary as a matter of law does not resolve the issue of whether the driver (Hiram Jowers) is an insured under the Transport policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>This Court\u2019s analysis of Hiram Jowers\u2019 status does not begin with a clean slate. Rather, the disposition of this case is controlled by two prior Fifth Circuit cases. <em>See Carolina Casualty Insurance Co. v. Underwriters Insurance Co., </em>569 F.2d 304 (5th Cir.1978); <em>Transport Indemnity Co. v. Paxton National Insurance Co., </em>657 F.2d 657 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 982, 102 S.Ct. 1490, 71 L.Ed.2d 692 (1982). In both <em>Carolina Casualty v. Underwriters </em>and <em>Paxton, </em>this Court held that the driver of the leased vehicle was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the lessee\u2019s insurance policy. The instant case is not distinguishable from <em>Paxton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In <em>Carolina Casualty v. Underwriters, </em>the lessee\u2019s insurance policy contained a permissive user clause. The permissive user clause, or omnibus clause, coupled with existing ICC regulations led this Court to conclude that the driver of the truck was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the lessee\u2019s policy. This Court specifically adopted the reasoning of the district court on this point. 569 F.2d at 313. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU0i\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Simmons v. King, </em>478 F.2d 857 (5th Cir.1973), held that an ICC certificated carrier, as is [the lessee], must assume liability for the actions and negligence of a driver operating a vehicle under its certificate of authority. That obligation is imposed by 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.4 which mandates the inclusion of certain provisions in the lease agreement and creates a statutory employment relationship between driver and carrier. The required lease provision which is contained in the lease agreement in question recites that for the duration of the lease the leased equipment is \u201cin the exclusive possession, control and use of the lessee ...\u201d Consequently, Williamson\u2019s [the driver\u2019s] admittedly authorized use of the vehicle in question must, of necessity, have been with the permission of [the lessee] and the Underwriters [the lessee\u2019s insurer\u2019s] policy, by its terms, covers [the driver].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">569 F.2d at 309 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">In <em>Paxton, </em>this Court also held that the driver of the truck was an insured under the lessee\u2019s insurance policy. In <em>Paxton, </em>Transport argued that the contractual omnibus clause in <em>Carolina Casualty v. Underwriters </em>provided the only basis for primary liability on the lessee\u2019s part. This court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">Under its ICC endorsement Transport [the lessee\u2019s insurer] contracted to insure Chem Haulers [the lessee] for any negligence of a driver operating a vehicle under Chem Haulers\u2019 Certificate of Authority. Further, the Transport policy provides coverage \u201cto any person who would not otherwise be covered under the underlying policy except by virtue of the application of the provisions of a motor vehicle financial responsibility law or other similar law.\u201d Transport argues that absent an omnibus clause it can only be vicariously liable, and therefore has a right of indemnity against Weibley [the driver], who in turn may proceed against Watts [the lessor] and ultimately against Paxton [the lessor\u2019s insurer]. On this premise, Transport urges that holding its coverage to be excess avoids circuity of action. <em>Our finding that Weibley [the driver]is an insured under Transport\u2019s contract collapses this theory, </em>as an insurer may not be subrogated against its insured. <em>Carolina [Casualty v. Underwriters], </em>569 F.2d at 314. Transport\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Carolina </em>is unpersuasive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">657 F.2d at 660 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Transport makes essentially the same arguments to this Court in the instant case, and Transport\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Carolina Casualty v. Underwriters </em>and <em>Paxton </em>are equally unpersuasive here. This court notes first that the operative ICC regulations applicable in the instant case are virtually identical to those regulations applicable in <em>Paxton </em>and <em>Carolina Casualty v. </em>Underwriters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, if a dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ferent result in this case is commanded, it must be by virtue of the language of the Transport policy. But this Court finds no material difference in the policy language in the instant case that distinguishes this case from <em>Paxton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Transport asserts that the policy language found controlling in <em>Paxton </em>was actually an omnibus clause. Brief of Appel-lee at 6. Transport contrasts that language with the language in the instant policy and argues that the language in the instant policy is materially narrower. Therefore, Transport argues that the instant policy does not confer insured status upon Hiram Jowers. This Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The policy in the instant case provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">The word \u201cINSURED\u201d shall mean the NAMED INSURED and <em>any other person, </em>firm, or organization <em>to whom insurance protection has been extended </em>under the policy or made so <em>by any provision of law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Record Vol. 1 at 104 (emphasis added). The language in the policy in the <em>Paxton </em>case provided coverage</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB9P\"><em>\u201c[T]o any person who would not otherwise be covered </em>under the underlying policy <em>except by virtue of the application of the provisions of a motor vehicle financial responsibility law or other similar law.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">657 F.2d at 660 (emphasis added). These provisions do not differ in any material way, and this Court finds that the instant policy falls squarely within the holding of the <em>Paxton </em>case. Consequently, this Court holds that Hiram Jowers, as driver of the vehicle, was an insured under the terms of the Transport policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Other circuits have taken different approaches to the issue presented here. For example, the Tenth Circuit arguably interprets the lessee\u2019s coverage to be primary as a matter of law; the lessor\u2019s insurance provides excess coverage as a result of that Circuit\u2019s construction of the ICC regulations. <em>See, e.g., Hagans v. Glens Falls Insurance Co., </em>465 F.2d 1249 (10th Cir.1972); <em>Argonaut Insurance Co. v. National Indemnity Co., </em>435 F.2d 718 (10th Cir.1971). On the other hand, the Fourth Circuit has held that the lessee\u2019s coverage is excess and the lessor\u2019s coverage is primary. <em>See Carolina Casualty Insurance Co. v. Transport Indemnity Co., </em>533 F.Supp. 22 (D.S.C.1981), <em>aff'd by unpublished opinion, </em>676 F.2d 690 (4th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 829, 103 S.Ct. 65, 74 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Transport asserts that this Court should adopt the analysis of the South Carolina district court in the <em>Carolina Casualty v. Transport </em>case. In that case, the district court held that under policy language essentially identical to the language involved in the instant case, the driver of the truck was not an insured under Transport\u2019s policy. The district court reasoned that the purpose of the ICC regulations is to protect the public and not to define the relationship between insurance companies. Therefore, under that analysis, the lessee is liable only in the event that the injured member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>public is unable to receive satisfaction from other sources. The district court in the instant ease largely followed that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">No matter how appealing this argument may be, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Paxton, </em>interpreting very similar language, cannot be ignored. This Court finds that <em>Paxton </em>controls the disposition of the instant case. Under that decision, Hiram Jowers, as driver of the vehicle, is an insured under the Transport policy issued to Monroe Warehouse Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Given that Hiram Jowers is an insured under the Transport policy, this Court must next determine which of the two policies affords primary coverage. In the instant case, both Chicago\u2019s and Transport\u2019s policies contain excess insurance clauses as well as apportionment clauses. In <em>Carolina Casualty v. Underwriters, </em>this Court applied Georgia law to determine the effect of the excess insurance clauses at issue there because the lease agreement provided that Georgia law governed. In <em>Paxton, </em>Mississippi law was applied to determine the issue of primary coverage. In the instant case, Chicago asserts and Transport does not dispute that Louisiana law governs this issue. Louisiana reconciles mutually repugnant \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses by apportioning liability among the insurers. <em>Graves v. Traders &amp; General Insurance Co., 252 </em>La. 709, 214 So.2d 116 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Transport\u2019s policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">H. OTHER INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">(1) EXCESS INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">If at the time of an OCCURRENCE to which this insurance applies there is any other valid and collectible insurance, ... then the insurance provided by this policy with respect to that OCCURRENCE shall be excess of any such other insurance____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">(2) CONTRIBUTION BY EQUAL SHARES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">If other valid and collectible insurance applicable to the same OCCURRENCE provides for contribution by equal shares or stipulates that it shall be excess of any other valid and collectible insurance ... then the insurance provided by this policy shall contribute by equal shares.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-14\">The contribution made by this Company shall not be for a greater proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability under any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid. With respect to any amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurers then continue to contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each such insurer has paid its limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afc-dedup-0\">Record Vol. 1 at the reverse of page 106.</p>\n<p id=\"ALP\">Chicago\u2019s policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-16\">B.

When two or more policies cover on the same basis either excess or primary, we will pay only our share. Our share is the proportion that the limit of our policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies covering on the same basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-20\">Record Vol. 1 at 93, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\">According to <em>Graves, </em>this Court\u2019s first task is to determine whether the excess insurance provisions are mutually repugnant. We conclude that they are. . Under <em>Graves, </em>mutually repugnant excess insurance clauses are ineffective. 214 So.2d at 118. The next inquiry is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>apportionment clauses are incompatible. <em>Graves </em>did not reach the question of what result would obtain if the apportionment clauses also were incompatible, because .the clauses were not incompatible in that case. Our cursory review of Chicago\u2019s apportionment clause indicates that liability is to be apportioned based on the proportion that Chicago\u2019s policy limit bears to the total limit available under both Chicago\u2019s and Transport\u2019s policies. On the other hand, Transport\u2019s policy appears to require equal division of liability until one or the other policy limit is exhausted. Our initial view is that these apportionment clauses are also incompatible, and they both cannot be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Because the issue of how Louisiana would apportion liability under these facts has not been briefed to this Court, this Court declines to speculate on the proper allocation. On remand, the district court is to entertain arguments and briefing on this issue, and to take any evidence necessary to initially determine this issue. As stated by the Third Circuit in an analogous situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">Under these circumstances, in this diversity case, this court will not indulge in the <em>pre-Erie </em>fallacy of looking to some \u201cbrooding omnipresence in the sky\u201d for a general law governing the interpretation of these insurance contracts. Nor should we risk adding yet another inconsistent judicial interpretation of the terms of art on which insurers rely, by plunging into a detailed exegesis of these contracts with only schematic indications of the parties\u2019 own understanding thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>Carolina Casualty Insurance Co. v. Insurance Company of North America, </em>595 F.2d 128, 143 (3d Cir.1979) (citations omitted). Here, as there, this Court remands this case to the district court so that the district court may initially determine the facts and law applicable to the analysis of these contracts and to construe the above referenced provisions in light of Louisiana law to determine what duties the parties to this action undertook by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">This Court holds that Hiram Jowers, in his capacity as driver of the truck, is an insured under Transport\u2019s policy issued to Monroe Warehouse Company. Consequently, both Chicago\u2019s and Transport\u2019s policies cover Jowers\u2019 negligence. Under Louisiana law, the excess coverage clauses of both policies are mutually repugnant; therefore, they are ineffective. Nevertheless, the apportionment clauses of the policies also appear to be irreconcilable. Therefore, the judgment of the district court, insofar as it held that Hiram Jowers was not an insured under the Transport policy, is reversed. The case is remanded so that the district court may first consider the effect of the apportionment clauses on the distribution of liability in this case. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-14\">. The case was removed to federal district court by the United States, the employer of another individual involved in the accident, who had been made a third party defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-18\">. It appears that the Gaskins\u2019 claims have not been adjudicated. Therefore, this Court must assume that the parties assume for purposes of this appeal that Hiram Jowers, the driver of the truck, was negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">. The. regulations primarily at issue here provide that the ICC carrier-lessee (Monroe Warehouse Co.) shall have exclusive control over the equipment and shall assume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment during the duration of the lease. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.-12(d)(1). Moreover, the regulations provide that the carrier-lessee (Monroe Warehouse Co.) must maintain insurance coverage for the protection of the public. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.12(k). Provisions to this effect are to be contained in the written lease agreement between the lessee (Monroe Warehouse Co.) and the lessor (Ed Jowers Trucking Co.). 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">. Holding the lessee\u2019s (Monroe Warehouse Co.\u2019s) insurance policy primary as a matter of law would arguably entail holding the lessee liable for the lessor\u2019s negligence as well, at least as an initial matter. That approach was rejected in <em>Carolina Casualty v. Underwriters. </em>Nevertheless, the lessee\u2019s policy could name the lessor as an insured. It is important to emphasize that whether the lessor is an insured under the lessee\u2019s insurance contract presents a different question than the question of whether the driver is an insured under the lessee's contract. That distinction is important, as the facts emphasize in <em>Carolina Casualty Insurance Co. v. Insurance Company of North America, </em>595 F.2d 128 (3d Cir.1979). In that case, the jury found that the driver of the truck was not negligent, although it found that both the lessor and lessee were actively negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">In an attempt to avoid the holding of <em>Paxton, </em>discussed <em>infra, </em>Transport focuses on Hiram Jowers\u2019 status as a lessor, because Hiram Jow-ers is the sole owner of Ed Jowers Trucking Company, and argues that Transport\u2019s policy does not provide that the lessor is an insured under the policy. This Court need not determine whether the lessor is an insured under the Transport policy because the plaintiff Gaskin alleges only that Hiram Jowers, as driver, was negligent. This Court points this out to highlight that it is Hiram Jowers\u2019 status as driver that leads this Court to the conclusion that Hiram Jowers is an insured under Transport\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b710-5\">. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1043.1(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArP\">(1) No common or contract carrier subject to [these regulations] ... shall engage in inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>state or foreign commerce, and no certificate or permit shall be issued to such a carrier or remain in force unless and until there shall have been filed with and accepted by the Commission ... certificates of insurance ... conditioned to pay any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for bodily injuries ... resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance or use of motor vehicles in transportation subject to [these regulations] ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">This regulation is promulgated pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10927.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.12 mandates certain written provisions in the lease between the carrier-lessee and the lessor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-15\">(d) <em>Exclusive possession and responsibilities </em>\u2014(1) The lease shall provide that the authorized carrier lessee shall have exclusive possession, control, and use of the equipment for the duration of the lease.
