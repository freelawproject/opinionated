GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1021-18\">Roger Flittie, following the beating death of his stepmother, Ruth Flittie, was convicted in South Dakota state court of conspiracy to commit murder but acquitted of the charge of murder. After a second trial based on the same events, Flittie was convicted as an accessory after the fact to murder. Flittie brought this habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1982) challenging his second conviction. He claimed his conviction of conspiracy to commit murder and acquittal of murder barred his trial on the accessory charge under double jeopardy and collateral estoppel theories. He further argued that the admission of a videotape recording of a discussion between him and a government informer violated his constitutional rights. A divided panel of this court affirmed the judgment of the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denying Flittie relief. <em>Flittie v. Solem, </em>751 F.2d 967 (8th Cir.1985). We granted rehearing en banc to consider whether the panel correctly ruled on these issues. We now affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-19\">The original information charged Flittie and Tommy Downs with murder<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>spiracy to commit murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The charges arose from the death of Flittie\u2019s stepmother on October 10, 1975. Downs pleaded guilty to murder and received a life sentence. On April 26, 1978, a jury convicted Flittie on the conspiracy charge and acquitted him of murder. Eight months later, Flittie was charged with first-degree burglary and accessory after the fact to murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After considering evidence substantially similar to that presented in the first trial, the jury convicted Flittie on both charges. On appeal, a divided panel of the South Dakota Supreme Court reversed the burglary conviction on collateral estoppel grounds. The accessory conviction was upheld. <em>State v. Flittie, </em>318 N.W.2d 346, 348-49 (S.D.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The evidence at both trials showed that Flittie hired Downs to kill his stepmother and make her death look like an accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Roger Flittie obtained a key to his mother\u2019s house from his brother, Bruce, and through Willie Harris delivered the key and a diagram of the house to Downs. Downs testified that he entered Ruth Flittie's residence and struck her twice with a lamp. Flittie was on a hunting trip at the time of the murder. Downs stated that Harris later gave him $200 and told him to go to Tucson, where arrangements would be made to take care of his expenses. Downs and his companion, Lori Kaprelian, traveled to Tucson and contacted one of Flittie\u2019s friends, Larry Brandon. Several money orders were sent to Brandon by Flittie; they were cashed and the proceeds given to Kapreli-an. Several other money orders were sent to Tucson and picked up by Kaprelian. At the second trial, Downs testified that he was finally paid $6,000 to $7,000 of the $10,000 he had been promised by Flittie, but that the money Flittie sent to Tucson was not a part of this payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">The fifth amendment provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V; <em>see also Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794-96, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2062-63, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969) (double jeopardy clause applied to the states). The Supreme Court has recognized three situations that implicate double jeopardy concerns: retrial for the same offense following acquittal; retrial for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for conviction of a single offense. <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 413, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2263, 2264, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980); <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2089, 2096, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). In addition, the fifth amendment embodies the federal rule of collateral estoppel. <em>Ashe v. Swen-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number><em>son, </em>397 U.S. 436, 442-43, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1193-94, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">The first question is whether Flit-tie\u2019s acquittal of the murder charge or conviction on the conspiracy charge prevented a trial on the accessory count. The second trial was permissible if neither murder nor conspiracy to murder is the \u201csame offense\u201d as accessory to murder. Two offenses are not the same if one requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). This test focuses on the statutory elements of the offenses, rather than the evidence presented at trial, <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 416, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2265, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980), and applies \u201cnotwithstanding a substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes.\u201d <em>Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1293 n. 17, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975). <em>See </em>Note, <em>The Double Jeopardy Clause as a Bar to Reintroducing Evidence, </em>89 Yale L.J. 962, 966 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">There can be no doubt that murder and accessory to murder are not the same offense. While the former requires proof that the defendant kill another human being, the latter only requires evidence that the defendant knowingly has rendered assistance to one who has committed such a killing. <em>Compare </em>S.D.Codified Laws Ann. \u00a7 22-16-4 (1979) (murder) <em>and </em>note 1 <em>supra with id. </em>\u00a7 22-3-5 (accessory) <em>and </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>Similarly, conspiracy to commit murder is not the same offense as accessory to murder. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 22-3-5 <em>and </em>note 3 <em>supra with id. </em>\u00a7 22-3-8 (conspiracy) <em>and </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>Conspiracy requires proof of an agreement; a defendant may render assistance to a felon without necessarily having reached an agreement to commit a felony. <em>See State v. Johns, </em>184 Conn. 369, 378-79, 439 A.2d 1049, 1053-54 (1981). Thus, under <em>Blockburger </em>and <em>Vi-tale, </em>acquittal of the murder charge and conviction on the conspiracy charge did not prevent a second prosecution on the accessory count.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">The jury charges in both prosecutions, enumerating the elements of these crimes, highlights this conclusion. <em>Cf. Garrett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 2415-16, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985) (proper analysis of successive prosecution issue requires examination of not only statutes but also specific charges constituting basis of prosecutions). A conviction of conspiracy required a finding that Flittie and another had conspired to commit murder and that an overt act was committed by one of them. A murder conviction required findings that Flittie as an accomplice caused the infliction of an injury from which Ruth Flittie died, and that he did so with premeditated design to effect the death. Conviction as accessory after the fact required findings that Flittie concealed or aided Downs after the murder knowing that Downs had murdered Ruth Flittie and that he did so with the intent that Downs avoid arrest, trial, conviction or punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">The statutes and jury charges make evident that conspiracy involves an agreement to commit an offense that of necessity must be pre-offense, and that conduct punished as conspiracy is quite different from concealing or assisting a person post-felony. It is true that a conspiracy charge may be proved, as in this case, by evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>of overt acts that occurred after the underlying felony. Looking only to the evidence at trial, however, is misleading. The elements of the two crimes are substantially different. Each charge requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not. Conspiracy does not require a finding of aid and concealment. Accessory after the fact does not require a finding of agreement. While the proof offered to establish the crimes may overlap, the crimes are separate and distinct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Iannelli, </em>420 U.S. at 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. at 1293 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">The Supreme Court in <em>Vitale </em>left open the possibility that under certain circumstances, two offenses might be considered the \u201csame offense,\u201d despite dissimilar statutory elements, where the same evidence proves both offenses. 447 U.S. at 419-20, 100 S.Ct. at 2266-67. <em>Vitale </em>held that a second prosecution was not automatically barred by the double jeopardy clause because the defendant\u2019s failure to slow, which was the basis of the first prosecution, was not <em>necessarily </em>a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter, the charge in the second prosecution; the two offenses would be \u201cthe same\u201d only if the reckless conduct required for the manslaughter charge was always a failure to slow. <em>Id. </em>The Court did suggest, however, that if the manslaughter conviction actually rested on proof of a failure to slow as the reckless conduct, the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim would be \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 100 S.Ct. at 2267.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\"><em>Vitale </em>does not suggest that it is necessarily a constitutional violation to offer the same evidence at a second prosecution. The Court was concerned that the same evidence would be offered at retrial solely to prove conduct that was a necessary element of the offense of which the defendant had already been convicted. The Court, therefore, saw the issue as whether, in retrospect, the state had merely proven a lesser (or greater) included offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 420-21, 100 S.Ct. at 2267 (citing <em>Harris v. Oklahoma, </em>433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977); <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">In the present case, the conduct punished by the second prosecution was hiding Downs and providing him with aid to avoid detection. Evidence of this conduct was introduced at the first trial, along with evidence of the defendant\u2019s acts before the murder, to prove that there was a conspiracy to murder. The defendant\u2019s conduct after a crime may well be relevant to prove an agreement made before the crime. This conduct, however, was not a necessary element of the conspiracy charge \u2014 the basis of that charge was the defendant\u2019s premurder conduct. Therefore, these two offenses, although proved by much the same evidence, required proof of different ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>ments and penalized different conduct. <em>Vi-tale </em>does not bar successive prosecutions of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Initially developed in civil cases, the doctrine of collateral estoppel dictates that an issue of ultimate fact determined by a valid final judgment cannot be litigated again between the same parties. <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The following test is applied in criminal cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-7\">Where a previous judgment of acquittal was based upon a general verdict, as is usually the case, this approach requires a court to \u201cexamine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194 (quoting Mayers &amp; Yarbrough, Bis Vexari: <em>New Trials and Successive Prosecutions, </em>74 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 38-39 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">Flittie argues that collateral estoppel should have prevented trial on the accessory count. The panel held that any preclusive effect must flow from Flittie\u2019s acquittal on the murder charge, reasoning that the conviction on the conspiracy charge could not bar later proceedings by the state because the <em>Ashe </em>rule refers only to acquittals. 751 F.2d at 971. The court relied on cases in this circuit that have held collateral estoppel to be a good defense only as to ultimate issues determined at the first trial in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. DeCoteau, </em>516 F.2d 16, 18 (8th Cir.1975); <em>United States v. Friedman, </em>506 F.2d 511, 517 (8th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1004, 95 S.Ct. 2407, 44 L.Ed.2d 673 (1975); <em>Moton v. Swenson, </em>488 F.2d 1060, 1062-63 (8th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 957, 94 S.Ct. 3086, 41 L.Ed.2d 675 (1974); <em>United States v. Haley, </em>452 F.2d 398, 404 (8th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 977, 92 S.Ct. 1205, 31 L.Ed.2d 253 (1972); <em>Percy v. South Dakota, </em>443 F.2d 1232, 1235 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 886, 92 S.Ct. 223, 30 L.Ed.2d 169 (1971); <em>Fernia v. United States, </em>340 F.2d 837, 839 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 902, 85 S.Ct. 1446, 14 L.Ed.2d 284 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">On rehearing, however, Flittie argues that the court en banc should hold that collateral estoppel must be applied to bar relitigation of ultimate facts that have been decided in the government\u2019s favor in a pri- or trial. He urges that we reject the long line of precedents adverse to this position on the ground that these cases were wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">We find no support for Flittie\u2019s argument. To the contrary, all relevant Supreme Court decisions support the panel\u2019s holding. First, <em>Ashe </em>itself strongly implies that collateral estoppel is invoked only upon a prior acquittal. The Court stated: \u201cThe single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been one of the robbers. And the jury by its verdict found that he had not. The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a second prosecution * * wholly impermissible.\u201d 397 U.S. at 445, 90 S.Ct. at 1195. Under Flittie\u2019s theory, it would have been unnecessary for the Court to relate the fact of prior acquittal; the mere presence of the issue before the jury would have been enough to invoke estoppel. This mention of the fact of acquittal implies that it was necessary to the result. Later in the opinion, the Court observed that the fifth amendment \u201cprotects a man who has been acquitted from having to \u2018run the gauntlet\u2019 a second time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 90 S.Ct. at 1195 (quoting <em>Green v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 190, 78 S.Ct. 221, 225, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, the facts in <em>Ashe </em>concerned a prior acquittal. If anything in the decision intimates that pri- or convictions invoke estoppel, it is dictum.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Finally, the only express mention of this issue in <em>Ashe </em>is unfavorable to Flittie. In a concurring opinion joined by two members of the Court, Justice Brennan stated flatly: \u201c[0]f course, collateral estoppel would not prevent multiple prosecutions when the first trial ends in a verdict of guilty.\u201d 397 U.S. at 459 n. 13, 90 S.Ct. at 1209 n. 13 (Brennan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Many Supreme Court decisions applying estoppel do so in the context of prior acquittals. We have found none, however, that involve convictions and estoppel. <em>See, e.g., One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 93 S.Ct. 489, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972); <em>Turner v. Arkansas, </em>407 U.S. 366, 92 S.Ct. 2096, 32 L.Ed.2d 798 (1972); <em>Harris v. Washington, </em>404 U.S. 55, 92 S.Ct. 183, 30 L.Ed.2d 212 (1971); <em>Simpson v. Florida, </em>403 U.S. 384, 91 S.Ct. 1801, 29 L.Ed.2d 549 (1971); <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). The Court addressed this issue in <em>Sealfon v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 575, 68 S.Ct. 237, 92 L.Ed. 180 (1948). The accused had been acquitted of conspiring to defraud the government. He was retried on the underlying substantive offense. No double jeopardy attached because the two offenses were not the same. The Court recognized, however, that collateral estoppel could apply to successive criminal prosecutions for different offenses. The only issue was framed as \u201cwhether the jury\u2019s verdict in the conspiracy trial was a determination <em>favorable to petitioner </em>of the facts essential to conviction of the substantive offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578-79, 68 S.Ct. at 239 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court found that a favorable determination had been made and invoked estoppel. This case has been interpreted, and correctly so, to require an acquittal before estoppel is invoked. <em>See, e.g., Haley, </em>452 F.2d at 404; <em>United States v. Cowart, </em>118 F.Supp. 903, 906 (D.D.C.1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Finally, any doubt left after <em>Sealfon </em>was resolved in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>341 U.S. 58, 71 S.Ct. 595, 95 L.Ed. 747 (1951). <em>Williams </em>involved a defendant who raised a defense of estoppel based on a prior conviction. The Court responded: \u201c[Williams] can, of course, claim no bar against prosecution on a theory of estoppel since the facts in the former trial, if applicable to the subsequent one, were found against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64 n. 3, 71 S.Ct. at 598 n. 3. This case plainly shows that Flittie\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See </em>C. Whitebread, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 24.04, at 509 (1980) (\u201cOnly when ultimate issues are <em>positively </em>resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor at the previous trial (e.g. there is an acquittal) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>does collateral estoppel apply as it is traditionally interpreted.\u201d) (footnote omitted); Note, <em>supra </em>p. 937, at 973 (\u201cThe irony is that while criminal collateral estoppel is rooted in the barren clay of acquittals, it is fenced off from the fertile soil of convictions.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Thus, the issue narrows to whether the jury which acquitted Flittie of murder rationally could have grounded its verdict on an ultimate fact essential to an accessory conviction. The acquittal on the murder charge implied that the jury resolved some issues in Flittie\u2019s favor. Under <em>Ashe, </em>then, the next step is to determine what issues were resolved in Flittie\u2019s favor and whether any of these issues are elements of the accessory charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">We begin by examining the charges to the juries. In the first trial, Flittie was convicted of conspiracy. The jury had to find that: (1) two or more persons conspired to commit murder; (2) one of these persons was Flittie; and (3) either Flittie or his conspirator committed an overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">To find Flittie not guilty of murder, the first jury had to find that one or more of the following elements were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) Flittie as an accomplice caused to be inflicted an injury or injuries upon the deceased from which the deceased died; (2) Flittie did so with premeditated design to effect the death of the deceased; and (3) the killing was without authority of law and without justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">To convict Flittie as an accessory after the fact, the second jury had to find that: (1) Downs murdered Ruth Flittie; (2) Flittie concealed or aided Downs after the murder; (3) at the time Flittie concealed or aided Downs he knew that Downs had murdered Ruth Flittie; and (4) Flittie concealed or aided Downs with the intent that Downs would avoid or escape arrest, trial, conviction, or punishment. The South Dakota Supreme Court found the jury that acquitted the defendant on the murder charge \u201ccould not have rationally grounded its verdict on an issue other than whether [Flittie] * * * had aided or abetted Downs.\u201d 318 N.W.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">Flittie argues that the first jury could have decided that his post-murder conduct was sufficient to support a murder conviction, and that the acquittal on the murder charge indicated that the jury found Flittie was not an after-the-fact participant. Consequently, this issue should have been barred in the second trial as resolved in Flittie\u2019s favor at the first. This argument is unconvincing. The guilty verdict on the conspiracy charge belies the contention that the first jury thought Flittie was not guilty of after-the-fact participation. The South Dakota Supreme Court found it \u201cevident that the jury in the first trial convicted defendant on the conspiracy charge based on his post-murder conduct.\u201d 318 N.W.2d at 349.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even the dissenting justices agreed that the first jury found that Flittie had aided Downs after the murder. <em>See id. </em>at 350-51 (Fosheim, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">An instruction from the first trial helps to harmonize the verdicts: \u201cSo in this case if you should find beyond a reasonable doubt that Tommy Edward Downs was a principal and Roger George Flittie an accessory <em>before the fact </em>to the commission of the murder, the defendant Flittie would be guilty thereof.\u201d 1st Trial Record at 119 (emphasis added). The first jury could have found that Flittie had engaged in culpable conduct after the murder and based the conspiracy conviction on this finding. The acquittal on the murder count may rationally reflect the jury\u2019s belief that Flit-tie had not acted as an accessory before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>fact. A finding that Flittie did not act as an accessory before the fact does not preclude trying him as an accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Flittie contends that collateral estoppel should have prevented the trial court from allowing the introduction of any evidence admitted during the first trial. This argument\u2019s success depends on whether the <em>Ashe </em>doctrine extends to bar relitigation of evidentiary facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">The fact central to this issue is whether Flittie acted as an accessory to the murder before the fact. This fact was an essential (ultimate) fact in the trial on the murder charge. The conviction on the accessory after the fact count, however, did not depend on finding whether Flittie was an accessory before the fact. Thus, the same fact was only evidentiary in the second trial. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>Collateral Estoppel Effect of Prior Acquittals, </em>46 Brooklyn L.Rev. 781, 788-90 (1980) (difference between evidentiary and ultimate facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">The law in this circuit is that collateral estoppel does not bar relitigation of facts that are evidentiary in the second prosecution. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>684 F.2d 542, 546 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1111, 103 S.Ct. 742, 74 L.Ed.2d 962 (1983); <em>see King v.

Harris was a good friend of Flittie; they had been acquainted for ten years, and it was Harris who had first introduced the defendant to Downs. Prior to December 5, 1977, Harris had been arrested on two forgery charges. On January 9th of the next year, Harris entered into an agreement with state officials that provided for dismissal of the forgery charges. The terms required Harris to cooperate with law enforcement officials in \u201cattempting to illicit [sic] incriminating statements\u201d from Roger Flittie. 2d Trial Record at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">That evening, Harris was taken to the state penitentiary to visit the defendant, who was incarcerated on a conviction unrelated to his mother\u2019s death. Although not compelled to do so by prison policy or practice, Flittie agreed to see and converse with Harris. The defendant was unaware, however, that Harris and the visiting room had been equipped to make audio and video recordings of the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">During the conversation, Harris made several statements that he conceded at trial were lies. He misrepresented to Flittie that Downs had been requesting more money for his role in the murder and falsely implied that Downs intended to satisfy his demands out of Flittie\u2019s property. In response to these false comments and other discussion, Flittie made several arguably incriminating statements. A videotape re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>cording of these statements was played for the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The first argument is that admission of the tape violated the fourth amendment. Flittie had a full and fair opportunity to litigate this issue in the South Dakota courts. We cannot, therefore, set aside the conviction on this ground. <em>See Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 494, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3052, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976); <em>Gregory v. Wyrick, </em>730 F.2d 542, 543 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">Second, Flittie argues that admission of the tape violated his sixth amendment right to counsel. At the time the tape was made, Flittie was neither under arrest for nor charged with his stepmother\u2019s murder. Therefore, he had no sixth amendment right to counsel. <em>See Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 398-99, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1239, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977); <em>Massiah v. United States, 377 </em>U.S. 201, 205, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 1202, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964); <em>United States v. Grego, </em>724 F.2d 701, 702-03 (8th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Dobbs, </em>711 F.2d 84, 85 (8th Cir.1983). The record shows that the defendant was arrested and charged within several hours after the tape was recorded. Flittie argues that the arrest was delayed solely to deprive him of his <em>Massiah </em>rights. Intentional and unnecessary delay by the government in bringing an indictment may invoke the sixth amendment right to counsel. <em>Dobbs, </em>711 F.2d at 85 n. 1 (dictum). This case, however, is not within the <em>Dobbs </em>exception to the <em>Massiah </em>rule. Although Flittie had become a primary suspect when the tape was recorded, the government\u2019s delay was not unnecessary. Prior to the day when the tape was made, law enforcement officials felt that there was not enough evidence to support the charge against Flittie. Most important was the arrest of Downs and his subsequent confession to murdering Ruth Flittie. <em>See </em>Suppression Hearing Transcript at 4-5, <em>South Dakota v. Flittie, </em>No. 78-2011 (Mar. 30, 1978). Thus, the timing of the arrest is consistent with the accumulation of evidence implicating Flittie. <em>Cf. Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 310, 87 S.Ct. 408, 417, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966) (\u201cThe police are not required to guess at their peril the precise moment at which they have probable cause to arrest a suspect, risking a violation of the Fourth Amendment if they act too soon, and a violation of the Sixth Amendment if they wait too long.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-16\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-17\">Flittie\u2019s final claim with respect to the tape is that its admission violated fifth amendment guarantees against self-incrimination. The first issue is whether Flittie\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Without reaching the merits of this claim,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>elude that admission of the tape was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe admission of statements obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>may constitute harmless error when there remains overwhelming independent evidence as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Packer, </em>730 F.2d 1151, 1157 (8th Cir.1984) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1979, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (reviewing court must consider the record as a whole and ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Flittie\u2019s taped statements were not the key to the state\u2019s case. Less than fifteen minutes in length and often inaudible, the tape contained only a few marginally incriminating statements. Most of the statements did not relate to the accessory after the fact charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Four different witnesses testified concerning Flittie\u2019s aid to Downs after the fact, including Downs, Harris, Kaprelian, and Brandon. Physical evidence, in the form of phone records and cancelled money orders, added support. To counter this evidence, the defendant chose only to attack the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. It is unlikely that the videotape had a major impact on the jury in determining whether these witnesses were believable. The whole record shows overwhelming independent evidence to support the conviction. <em>See also Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972) (admission of confession related by accused to undercover police officer posing as cellmate found harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The second fifth amendment issue is whether the statements were coerced. The tape would be inadmissible unless the totality of circumstances shows that Flit-tie\u2019s statements were the product of a free and rational choice. <em>See Greenwald v. Wisconsin, </em>390 U.S. 519, 521, 88 S.Ct. 1152, 1153, 20 L.Ed.2d 77 (1968) (per curiam).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The basis of any fifth amendment claim must be some kind of compulsion. <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 304, 87 S.Ct. 408, 414, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966). Flittie raises a number of grounds to support his coercion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">The first is that he was in the South Dakota penitentiary when the statements were taken. The Supreme Court recognized in <em>Miranda </em>the compelling pressures upon incarcerated persons. 384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624. Flittie was in custody, but on an unrelated matter. Incarceration does not ipso facto make a statement involuntary. <em>See Cervantes v. Walker, </em>589 F.2d 424, 427 (9th Cir.1978). While Flittie may have been constrained within the penitentiary walls, he was not forced to remain in the visitors\u2019 room with Harris. Thus, the imprisonment did not produce a coerced statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Second, Flittie maintains that Harris\u2019s hidden link to law enforcement officials was a form of coercion. At the time of the encounter, Flittie was unaware that Harris was cooperating with the state. The use of a secret informer, however, is not unconstitutional per se. <em>Hoffa, </em>385 U.S. at 311, 87 S.Ct. at 418. \u201cWhere a defendant\u2019s conversations with an informant are voluntary and the informant\u2019s presence was wholly voluntary, admissions made by the defendant do not violate the * * * privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>646 F.2d 1298, 1302 (8th Cir.) (footnote and citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>ted), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 868, 102 S.Ct. 333, 70 L.Ed.2d 170 (1981). Flittie agreed to see Harris of his free will, and he was equally free to terminate the conversation at his pleasure. That the statement was secretly recorded does not itself vitiate the consent. <em>See id. </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Finally, Flittie urges that his responses were coerced because they were prompted by Harris\u2019s statements, some of which, Flittie argues, were untruthful and possibly threatening. Misrepresentations on the part of the government do not make a statement per se involuntary. <em>See Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969); <em>United States ex rel. Galloway v. Fagg, </em>403 F.Supp. 248, 252 (S.D.N.Y.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">The totality of circumstances shows that Flittie\u2019s statements were the product of a free and rational choice. It was not, therefore, a violation of the fifth amendment to admit the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">.

The state was permitted to and did prove, however, that Downs was hired to go to Brookings for some purpose and that a murder was committed there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">. Flittie maintains that the double jeopardy clause was violated by the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the second jury that Flittie had been found not guilty of murdering Ruth Flittie. No authority is offered to support this argument. The omission of an instruction is grounds for habeas relief only if it infected the whole proceeding such that the defendant was denied a fair trial. <em>Tyler v. Wyrick, </em>635 F.2d 752, 753 (8th Cir.1980) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 942, 101 S.Ct. 3089, 69 L.Ed.2d 958 (1981). The absence of the proferred instruction did not deprive Flittie of a fair trial. Considerable evidence was presented concerning the murder because the state had to prove the event to sustain the accessory charge. The state never contended, however, that Flittie murdered his mother in the sense that he was present at the scene and beat her to death. Thus, there was no error in refusing to instruct the jury that Flittie was not guilty of murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">. Our resolution of the question whether these statutory provisions are the \"same offense\u201d under <em>Blockburger </em>necessarily decides any question of legislative intent. <em>See Garrett, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2411. In <em>Garrett, </em>the same \"single act\u201d for which the petitioner was first convicted served as partial proof of his violation of the second offense. It was therefore necessary to determine if Congress had intended that the same act be punished under two separate offenses or if it had intended that the provisions be substitutes for one another, before proceeding to the constitutional question. In the present case, we deal with more than a \"single act\u201d, <em>cf. id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 2416-17, and it seems obvious that the legislature did not intend murder or conspiracy to murder to be merely a substitute or exclusive alternative for accessory after the fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">. Judge Arnold argues that because the conspiracy charge included post-murder conduct, the accessory charge constitutes a lesser included offense. He concludes that Flittie was prosecuted twice for the same conduct, only the label having changed, as post-murder conduct was one of the elements of conspiracy. This reasoning overlooks the fact that conspiracy and accessory after the fact each includes an element that the other does not. Even though post-murder conduct may, under the unique circumstances of this case, have been evidence relevant to the conspiracy, the conspiracy charge required proof of an agreement to commit the murder. The accessory after the fact charge did not. Similarly, post-felony concealment, a required element of the accessory after the fact charge, was not part of the conspiracy charge. Judge Arnold\u2019s argument based on <em>Vitale, </em>and its emphasis on the lesser included offense, thus contains a critical weakness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">. In <em>Ashe, </em>six men had been robbed by four individuals. The defendant was acquitted of robbing one of the victims. He was then indicted for robbing one of the other six men. The Supreme Court held that the first acquittal was based on the jury finding that the defendant had not participated in the robbery. Because the ultimate fact of participation was resolved in the defendant's favor at the first trial, collateral estoppel precluded retrial of that fact. 397 U.S. at 446, 90 S.Ct. at 1195.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">. Other passages show that acquittal was the keystone to the Court\u2019s opinion. <em>See, e.g., </em>397 U.S. at 447, 90 S.Ct. at 1196 (expressing concern over State's concession that \"following the petitioner\u2019s acquittal, it treated the first trial as no more than a dry run for the second prosecution\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">. The same is true of language in <em>United States v. Oppenheimer, </em>242 U.S. 85, 37 S.Ct. 68, 61 L.Ed. 161 (1916), to the effect that a prior adjudication may be pleaded as a bar \u201cwhether it takes the form of an acquittal or conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 37 S.Ct. at 69 (quoting <em>Reg. v. Miles, </em>24 Q.B.D. 423, 431). The facts in <em>Oppenheimer </em>involved a prior acquittal. Moreover, the language from <em>Miles </em>does not support Flittie's position even if we were bound by dictum. The court there referred to final adjudication of a <em>charge </em>as invoking a bar; there is no mention of ultimate fact issues supporting a bar. This reasoning is consistent with double jeopardy law as we understand it: if an accused is retried on the same <em>offense, </em>double jeopardy applies whether the prior adjudication resulted in acquittal or conviction. If, however, the same offense (or \"charge\") is not involved, estoppel applies only if the prior adjudication resulted in acquittal. Expanding estoppel to follow conviction would read the \"same offense\u201d language out of the fifth amendment and substitute \"same issue\u201d or \"same ultimate fact.\u201d We decline to do this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">. <em>Sealfon </em>did not arise in a constitutional context, for it was decided before <em>Ashe </em>held that the fifth amendment embodied collateral estoppel. It is no less instructive for this reason, though. <em>See Ashe, </em>397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194 (adopting <em>Sealfon </em>test to determine whether issue was necessarily decided in the prior adjudication).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">. There is no convincing contrary analogy to civil estoppel because in a civil case it is doubtful that a party would raise a prior adverse adjudication as a bar against himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">. The court noted that: (1) the information on the conspiracy count was based in part on Flit-tie\u2019s overt acts in paying money to Downs after the murder; and (2) \"[cjonsiderable evidence\" was introduced in the first trial showing that Flittie sent Downs to Tucson and forwarded money to him there. 318 N.W.2d at 349.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">. The court in the second trial was not insensitive to Flittie\u2019s double jeopardy concerns. The following exchange took place in chambers before opening statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-9\">Well, as we discussed off the record, it\u2019s the court\u2019s opinion that you cannot go into facts, ultimate facts which were previously determined by a jury in the murder trial of the defendant Roger Flittie, and that you can have your witnesses testify concerning the contacts between the defendant and Tommy Downs and the conversations between them short of the statement by the defendant Roger Flittie that he wanted Downs to go to Brook-ings to kill his mother. And that you can prove the contact and the furnishing of the key and you can prove the conversations relative to Roger Flittie wanting Tommy Downs to go to Brookings and that the defendant furnished him with maps concerning the location of his mother\u2019s house. I think that\u2019s about as far as you can go.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">2d Trial Transcript at 18.

An argument can be made that Flittie was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He was in custody and Harris, his one-time friend, deliberately elicited incriminating information from him. The government had entered into a written agreement with Harris and supervised the taping session. <em>See United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 270-73, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 2186-88, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980); <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>Mathis v.

I therefore join the dissenting opinions of Judge Heaney and Judge Arnold on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the district court and grant the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1031-16\">HEANEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao83\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-17\">The dissent to the panel opinion is incorporated here by reference, <em>see </em>751 F.2d at 975-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-18\">The en banc majority reiterates the position that a criminal defendant may only invoke collateral estoppel based upon a pri- or acquittal. There is no doctrinal explanation for this view in the majority opinion, nor in the cases cited therein. I remain convinced that the prior acquittal requirement is an unintended quirk in the case law and defeats the purpose of the double jeopardy clause and Ashe.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A party should clearly be able to raise defensively the determination of an issue of ultimate fact from a prior adverse adjudication if it is to his or her advantage in a subsequent proceeding, whether that proceeding is civil or criminal. In this case, the same parties litigated the identical issue concerning Flit-tie\u2019s post-murder conduct a second time, and consequently he was twice-tried and twice-punished for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-19\">There is an alternative ground supporting Flittie\u2019s double jeopardy claim. The Supreme Court has stressed in several recent decisions that whether the same conduct may be prosecuted under separate offenses is a question of legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Garrett v. United States, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>U.S. -, -, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 2411, 85 L.Ed.2d 764, 771 (1985); <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368, 103 S.Ct. 673, 679, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). If the court determines that the legislature clearly intended that the same conduct be punished twice under separate offenses, there is no violation of the double jeopardy clause. In <em>Garrett, </em>for example, the Supreme Court analyzed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse, Prevention, and Control Act of 1970 and determined that Congress intended that a defendant could be prosecuted for both continuing criminal enterprise and the underlying predicate offense of conspiracy. \u2014 U.S. at----, 105 S.Ct. at 2412-16, 85 L.Ed.2d at 772-76. In this case, it is inconceivable that the South Dakota legislature intended that Flittie\u2019s post-murder conduct be punished as both \u201cconspiracy\u201d and \u201caccessory-after-the-fact.\u201d Conspiracy is defined in the statute in terms of an agreement to commit an offense in the future, S.D.Codified Laws Ann. \u00a7 22-3-8, and accessory-after-the-fact is defined in terms of assistance to another person who has already committed an offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 22-3-5. Under either a legislative intent or collateral estoppel analysis, the state subjected Flittie to double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">I also am of the view that the admission of Flittie\u2019s conversation with Harris violated the fifth amendment guarantee against self-incrimination and Flittie\u2019s rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The majority all but concedes that Flittie\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated, <em>see supra </em>n. 17, but contends that the admission of the video tape was harmless error. The majority concludes that the tape contained only a few marginally incriminating statements which did not relate to the aceessory-after-the-fact charge. I disagree. I find that the video tape contains numerous incriminating statements which focused almost entirely on Flittie\u2019s post-murder conduct and the accessory-after-the-fact charge. As required by his agreement with the state, Harris misrepresented to Flittie that Downs had been requesting more money for his role in the murder. This exchange was obviously conceived by the state to elicit incriminating statements from Flittie concerning his payments to Downs, and as the following excerpts indicate, it was entirely successful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-10\">I paid him pretty square, as far as I am concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-13\">I don\u2019t see how he [Downs] can say anything * * * because he\u2019s gonna be the one to get fingered worse than anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-15\">I put out quite a few bucks to get him down to Tucson, to get him out of the area, and * * * I covered for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-17\">I know I paid him over seven grand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-19\">There ain\u2019t nothing I can tell him until I get a job or something. I think three [thousand dollars more] is a little * * * high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-20\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-21\">I can\u2019t see where he\u2019d be so stupid to risk a * * * murder rap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-22\">Although the state also called several witnesses to testify concerning Flittie\u2019s aid to Downs after the murder, I cannot conceive of evidence more damaging in terms of its impact on the jury than Flittie\u2019s own admissions on video tape. Certainly this evidence buttressed the rest of the state\u2019s case. Thus, admitting the video tape was clearly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-23\">Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">. I note that this is not a case involving <em>nonmu-tual </em>collateral estoppel, which would involve other complicating factors if extended to criminal cases. <em>Cf. Standefer v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 21-25, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 2006-08, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980) (rejection of aider and abettor\u2019s collateral estoppel argument in relation to acquittal of principal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1032-24\">ARNOLD, Circuit Judge, with whom LAY, Chief Judge, and HEANEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AhS\">join, dissenting.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-25\">I agree fully with Judge Heaney that the admission of Flittie\u2019s conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Harris violated the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Therefore, even if the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar this prosecution, Flittie is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">As to the double-jeopardy argument, I agree with the Court that the collateral-es-toppel component of this doctrine applies only when the first trial has ended in an acquittal. See <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 459 n. 13, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1202 n. 13, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). I therefore do not subscribe to the position taken in Judge Heaney\u2019s original opinion dissenting from the decision reached by the panel. 751 F.2d at 975-77. I do believe, however, for substantially the same reasons given by Judge Heaney as an alternative ground in his present dissent, that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars Flit-tie\u2019s prosecution as an accessory after the fact. I add a few words of explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">As the Court says, <em>ante </em>at 936, the Double Jeopardy Clause envisages a number of distinct situations in which prosecution or punishment may be barred. Among these are retrial for the same offense after conviction and a federal rule of collateral estoppel. These two situations are distinct one from the other. Even if <em>Ashe v. Swen-son </em>does not apply, a second prosecution is barred if the second trial is for the same offense of which Flittie was convicted in the first trial. This aspect of the case is discussed in part IA of the Court\u2019s opinion, <em>ante </em>at 936-937, and the conclusion is reached that conspiracy to murder is not the same offense as accessory after the fact to murder, since each crime requires proof of a fact that the other does not, <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). This line of analysis is based on the statutory elements of the two offenses rather than the evidence at trial, <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 416, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2265, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980). Therefore, Flittie\u2019s \u201cconviction on the conspiracy charge did not prevent a second prosecution on the accessory count,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">This is true as far as it goes \u2014 as the two offenses are not statutorily the same, there is no automatic bar under <em>Vitale </em>to <em>trying </em>Flittie separately on both charges. However, he still may not be <em>convicted </em>on both if the basis of the second is essentially identical to that of the first. Very similiar facts, but a significantly different procedural posture, were presented in <em>Vitale. </em>The defendant there, who had pleaded guilty to failing to reduce speed to avoid an accident, challenged the state\u2019s subsequent attempt to prosecute him for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the same accident. The Supreme Court held that because a manslaughter conviction <em>might </em>be based on evidence other than defendant\u2019s speed, the second prosecution could proceed. However, the Court added, if the manslaughter prosecution actually \u201crelies on and proves a failure to slow ... as the reckless act ..., Vitale would have a substantial claim of double jeopardy,\u201d 447 U.S. at 421, 100 S.Ct. at 2267, a claim the four-member minority characterized as \u201cdispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 100 S.Ct. at 2270. Unlike Vitale, Flittie has already been convicted twice, apparently on the same grounds. It is to deal with precisely this situation that <em>Vitale </em>left open the possibility that double jeopardy might exist even when two offenses are statutorily not \u201cthe same\u201d if the convictions are based on the same evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">Even if <em>Vitale </em>had not provided for this situation, an inquiry into the evidence presented in this case should be permitted to determine Flittie\u2019s double-jeopardy claim because the conspiracy statute was embellished by indictment and by jury charge to include conduct subsequent to the substantive crime. The usual concept of conspiracy, both at common law and under modern statutes, is that two or more persons make an agreement to commit a crime. Some statutes, <em>e.g., </em>S.D. Codified Laws Ann. \u00a7 22-3-8, also require that one or more of the conspirators commit some overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy. Conceptually, the gist of the offense remains focused on conduct occurring before the commission of the substantive crime. Af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>ter that crime has been committed, the agreement to commit it has obviously been carried out, and there can no longer be any act to effect the object of this agreement, the object having already been attained. Normally, therefore, if only the words of the statute are to be looked at, I would agree that the offense of conspiracy is completely separate from the offense of accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Here, however, both the indictment charging Flittie with conspiracy and the opinion of the Supreme Court of South Dakota affirming his accessory conviction, <em>State v. Flittie, </em>318 N.W.2d 346 (1982), give the statute meaning going beyond the traditional concept of conspiracy. The indictment charges that Flittie and Downs conspired to kill Ruth Flittie \u201c[djuring the week immediately preceding the 10th day of October, 1975, and thereafter until on or about the 10th day of May, 1976.\u201d Mrs. Flittie was killed on October 10, 1975, so a good deal of the time period covered by this alleged conspiracy occurred after the crime of murder had been completed. In addition, as the Supreme Court of South Dakota has stated, \u201cthe jury in the first trial convicted defendant on the conspiracy charge based on his post-murder conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">It is this same post-murder conduct that is the basis of the conviction on the accessory charge. This means that in the special circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court of South Dakota has interpreted the state\u2019s conspiracy statute as embodying the same offense as the accessory statute, or, at the very least, that the accessory charge is a lesser included offense of the conspiracy charge. All of the evidence introduced against Flittie on the accessory charge had already been considered by the jury in the first trial, and it was this very evidence that persuaded the first jury to convict Flittie of conspiracy. Thus, although normally what one does after the completed crime is no part of a conspiracy charge, here the offense of conspiracy, as actually charged in the indictment, included post-murder conduct as one of its elements, thereby making the conspiracy offense fully inclusive of the later accessory charge. See also <em>State v. Flittie, supra, </em>318 N.W.2d at 350-51 (Fosheim, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">A standard aspect of Supreme Court double-jeopardy doctrine holds that a defendant once convicted cannot be thereafter prosecuted for a lesser-ineluded offense. See <em>Garrett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 2416-17, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985). To this rule there seems to be an exception, namely that the second prosecution is permitted if the legislature that defined the offenses in question clearly manifested an intention that both offenses be separately punishable. <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368, 103 S.Ct. 673, 679, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). As Judge Hea-ney says, it is simply inconceivable that the South Dakota legislature intended that Flit-tie\u2019s post-murder conduct be punished as both \u201cconspiracy\u201d and \u201caccessory after the fact,\u201d and the opinion of the Supreme Court of South Dakota does not so hold. The point becomes clear, I think, if one considers what would have happened if, in the original indictment, Flittie had been charged as an accessory after the fact, as well as with murder and conspiracy. Suppose the first trial had gone exactly as it actually did; the jury acquitted Flittie of murder but convicted him of conspiracy on the basis of post-murder conduct. The same jury would necessarily have had to convict Flittie as an accessory after the fact, because the same post-murder conduct underlies this charge. Would the trial court then have been authorized to impose separate punishments on Flittie for both conspiracy and being an accessory? The answer, I think, is clearly \u201cno.\u201d It must follow that a separate punishment cannot be imposed after a second trial. The reasons for double-jeopardy protection become, if anything, greater when multiple trials are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">This case involves the very kind of governmental oppression that the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to prohibit. The State\u2019s decision to prosecute Flittie a second time is obviously based upon its disappointment at the first jury\u2019s verdict of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>quittal on the murder charge. Not satisfied with the punishment obtained on the conspiracy charge, the State has now prosecuted Flittie for exactly the same conduct, changing only the legal label technically describing the offense. For these reasons, I would hold the second prosecution barred, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1032-8\"> Judge BRIGHT joins the portion of this opinion concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause requires that Flittie\u2019s conviction be set aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
