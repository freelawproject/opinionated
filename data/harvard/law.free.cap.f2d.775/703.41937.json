Woodward and Brewer each own 50 of the 101 shares of stock. The remaining share is owned by Woodward\u2019s brother, Evan. Wendall Woodward and Arnold Brewer jointly manage the business. Major decisions are made only after the two have reached an agreement. One area of sufficient importance to be subject to joint control is the hiring and firing of office personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Woodward met Blalock through John Ro-thacker, a self-described \u201capostle.\u201d Ro-thacker testified that his mission as an apostle is to \u201cestablish the church\u201d and to \u201cestablish Christians in the foundations of the faith as it is properly presented from the scriptures and the prophets and the apostles that wrote in the New Testament as well as the prophets of the Old.\u201d Woodward described Rothacker as his spiritual shepherd, but consistently maintained that although Rothacker \u201ccan give me advice ... it\u2019s up to me to make up my mind how I have to handle it myself.\u201d Similarly, Rothacker testified that although \u201cin spiritual matters\u201d Woodward was \u201cin submission\u201d to Rothacker, he only offers advice in other areas and \u201cthe decisions ultimately reside with him [Woodward].\u201d At the time of the events in question, Rothacker and Woodward regularly met in a prayer group. Members of the group introduced their personal problems to the group\u2019s discussion and prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">Blalock met Rothacker in 1972 or 1973 and became interested in his work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ro-thacker knew that Blalock had an engineering background and that he was interested in sales. In early 1974, Rothacker learned that Woodward was looking for a salesman with some engineering experience. Following a prayer meeting, Rothacker introduced Blalock and Woodward and suggested to Woodward that Blalock might fulfill his needs. In March 1974, Woodward hired Blalock.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">It is undisputed that when Blalock began working for Metals Trades, he was told it was a \u201cChristian company.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Blalock assumed this meant that the company conducted its business with ethical standards consistent with biblical commands. Blalock did not believe that there were any specific religious requirements attendant to the job and Woodward testified that there were, in fact, no religious requirements. At the time, Blalock was eager to work for a Christian company and requested and received permission to \u201cwitness\u201d his faith to clients who expressed an interest in religious matters. Woodward was happy to have \u201ca Christian, a good, moral, ethical man\u201d working for Metals Trades.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Soon after Blalock started working at .Metals Trades, he and Rothaeker had a parting of the ways. The basis of their disagreement is undisputed. Blalock felt that Rothaeker wanted him to submit to his authority, which he was unwilling to do. Rothaeker, being an apostle, felt Blalock owed him a certain amount of obedience, which was not forthcoming. Blalock testified that during work hours Woodward relayed acrimonious messages and accusations from Rothaeker to him. According to Blalock, Woodward also quoted bible verses to him, arguing that he was in doctrinal error in parting with Rothaeker. Woodward acknowledged that he may have passed on some information from Rothacker to Blalock, but he could not remember the content.</p>\n<p id=\"AFq0\">Arnold Brewer testified that he became disenchanted with Blalock soon after he started working at Metals Trades and Woodward confirmed Brewer\u2019s testimony. Woodward testified that he asked Brewer to give Blalock some more time. Brewer\u2019s specific complaints against Blalock were a perceived patronizing attitude, a habit of spending too much time agonizing over insignificant mechanical tolerances, leaving a mess on Brewer\u2019s desk and failing to call in to tell Metals Trades when he would be working.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Blalock testified, on the other hand, that Brewer asked him only two weeks before his discharge if he would consider working full time.</p>\n<p id=\"ACq6\">Blalock was fired in September 1974. Brewer had been unhappy with Blalock for some time and when Woodward reached a decision to fire Blalock, Brewer readily assented. Blalock and Woodward\u2019s versions of the actual firing are generally consistent. Woodward told Blalock he wanted to talk to him. Blalock asked if it concerned Rothacker and Woodward responded that it did. Blalock said he did not want to discuss it if it concerned Rothaeker. According to Woodward, Blalock immediately left the room. Woodward admitted that he told Blalock \u201cuntil he got things straightened with John [Rothaeker], he was discharged.\u201d According to Blalock, he did not leave immediately, but instead stated that while he would discuss work matters, he would not talk about Rothaeker. Blalock testified that although Woodward agreed to talk about work only, he never mentioned any work-related problems, but instead kept referring back to the biblical reference to \u201cfeigned obedience.\u201d After this went on for some time, according to Blalock, he told Woodward he was leaving. Blalock testified that at that point Woodward said, \u201cconsider yourself laid off ... until the situation with you and John Rothaeker is settled.\u201d Woodward testified, however, that his statement about Rothaeker was \u201csimply my reaction to his reaction\u201d and that he never meant to condition employment on Blalock\u2019s relationship with Re-thaeker. Blalock subsequently telephoned Woodward in an attempt to recover his job. Blalock testified that he asked Woodward to talk only about their business relationship and leave religion out of it, but that Woodward refused to do so. Woodward\u2019s testimony was entirely consistent with this account.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Y\">Two letters from Woodward to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission were introduced into evidence. In the first, Woodward stated that \u201cwe were generally satisfied\u201d with Blalock\u2019s performance of his sales duties, The letter expressed some displeasure, however, with Blalock\u2019s attitude and his engineering practices. A second letter states that Blalock was laid off because of the failure to notify Woodward which days he would be working and because Woodward asked him \u201ca question and he refused to answer.\u201d Woodward testified that this referred to Blalock\u2019s refusal to discuss Ro-thaeker when he was discharged. The letter then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVH4\">Larry was hired with the full knowledge and understanding that Metals Trades is a Christian Company and our rule book is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the word of God, or the Bible. He was in full accord and very excited. He said he wanted to work for a Christian Company and, being a salesman contacting new accounts, he wanted to witness to them; in which I encouraged him. Larry is a fine young man and he has my respect in many areas. I hated to lay him off as there are all too few men willing to commit themselves to Jesus \u2014 especially salesmen. Larry\u2019s problem is that he refuses to submit himself to those in authority over him and the Bible makes it clear that we are to be in submission. Larry was let go for strictly secular reasons but the root of his problem is spiritual, as the scriptures will show____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The letter closed by quoting several biblical passages.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The district court accepted Blalock\u2019s contention that the precise analysis of <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) and <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) does not apply in this case. \u201c[T]his is a case in which the plaintiff has offered direct evidence that defendant intentionally discriminated against him.\u201d The court did \u201cnot agree, however, with plaintiff\u2019s assertion that he has proved his case by direct evidence that the defendant discharged him because of religious differences.\u201d The court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbYb\">[t]he personal relationship between plaintiff and Mr. Woodward that motivated Mr. Woodward to tolerate plaintiff\u2019s poor performance as an employee was rooted in their shared religious experience. When this personal relationship broke down, Mr. Woodward no longer felt motivated to close his eyes to plaintiff\u2019s attitudes and behavior as an employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The court held that \u201cplaintiff has not proved that defendant fired him because of his religion or because of any particular religious beliefs he may have held\u201d and that \u201cthere was no discriminatory intent in violation of Title VII.\u201d Further, \u201cplaintiff has failed to prove that in terminating him, defendant intentionally discriminated against plaintiff because of his religion or religious beliefs.\u201d On appeal, Blalock contends first that the district court clearly erred in finding that Blalock had not established by direct evidence that Metals Trades acted with discriminatory intent, and, second, that, in light of its clearly erroneous findings, the district court erred in apportioning the burden of proof with respect to establishing the \u201ccause\u201d of Blal-ock\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Preliminarily, we note that we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Jackson v. RKO Bottlers of Toledo, Inc., </em>743 F.2d 370, 374 (6th Cir.1984); <em>Geisler v. Folsom, </em>735 F.2d 991, 995 (6th Cir.1984); <em>Sones-Morgan v. Hertz Corp., </em>725 F.2d 1070, 1071 (6th Cir.1984); <em>Fields v. Bolger, </em>723 F.2d 1216, 1219 (6th Cir.1984). There are no distinctions between ultimate and subsidiary findings of fact, the predominant issue of intent in Title VII cases is factual, and the deferential standard of Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 52 does not apply to questions of law. <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 287, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1789, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). In <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985), the Court reiterated that a reviewing court may only overturn the district court\u2019s findings when the court \u201cis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). \u201cThe reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty under Rule 52 if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1511.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">If the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1512. Further, \u201c[w]hen findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, Rule 52 demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>even greater deference to the trial court\u2019s findings; for only the trial judge can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener\u2019s understanding of and belief in what is said.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Prerequisite to examination of the district court\u2019s factual findings is a review of the legal standards applicable to this case. Two factors influence our determination of these standards: first, that plaintiff attempted to prove his case of discrimination by direct evidence, and, second, that the evidence suggests the possibility of dual motives for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">First, we note, in agreement with the district court, that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test and its shifting burdens are \u201cinapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 613, 622, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985), citing <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 358 n. 44, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866 n. 44, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (\u201cthe <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>formula does not require direct proof of discrimination\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Thompkins v. Morris Brown College, </em>752 F.2d 558, 563 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Miles v. M.N.C. Corp., </em>750 F.2d 867, 875-76 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Bell v. Birmingham Linen Service, </em>715 F.2d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2385, 81 L.Ed.2d 344 (1984) <em>(McDonnell Douglas </em>\u201cis not intended to be a Procrustean bed within which all disparate treatment cases must be forced to lie.\u201d); <em>Perryman v.

Direct evidence and the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>formulation are simply different evidentiary paths by which to resolve the ultimate issue of defendant\u2019s discriminatory intent. <em>But see Zebedeo v. Martin E. Segal Co., </em>582 F.Supp. 1394, 1412 n. 7 (D.Conn.1984). \u201cWhere the evidence for a prima facie case consists ... of direct testimony that defendants acted with a discriminatory motivation, if the trier of fact believes the pri-ma facie evidence the ultimate issue of discrimination is proved; no inference is required.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>684 F.2d at 774; <em>Miles, </em>750 F.2d at 875-76; <em>Perryman, </em>698 F.2d at 1143.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201cWhen direct evidence of discrimination has been introduced, the lower court must, as an initial matter, specifically state whether or not it believes plaintiffs proffered direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>752 F.2d at 564. The district court found that \u201cthere was no discriminatory intent in violation of Title VII.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Recognizing our deferential standard of review, we respectfully disagree with this conclusion of the district court. This conclusion draws on other findings of fact made by the district court. The district court made a crucial finding, adequately supported by the record, which indicates that discrimination was at least a factor in Blalock\u2019s discharge. The district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">The shared beliefs of plaintiff and Mr. Woodward was an aspect of their personal relationship with one another. In fact, it was in part because of this shared experience that <em>Mr. Woodward tolerated conduct and attitudes on the part of plaintiff that he may not have tolerated with any employee with whom he did not share such a personal relationship.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">The personal relationship between plaintiff and Mr. Woodward that motivated Mr. Woodward to tolerate plaintiff\u2019s poor performance as an employee was rooted in their shared religious experience. <em>When this personal relationship broke down, Mr. Woodward no longer felt motivated to close his eyes to plaintiffs attitudes and behavior as an employee. </em>It was at this point that Mr. Woodward decided to capitulate to Mr. Brewer\u2019s position that plaintiff should be asked to leave their company____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">It is clear that Messrs. Woodward and Blalock voluntarily spun an entangled web of work, religion and personal relationships. It is not, therefore, surprising that a break in their religious ties caused the entire web, including their once positive relationship, to collapse. <em>Plaintiff could then no longer rely upon Mr. Woodward\u2019s enhanced tolerance to save his job. </em>Regardless of the fact that religion was an important aspect of the personal relationship between plaintiff and Mr. Woodward, plaintiff has not proved that defendant fired him because of his religion or because of any particular religious beliefs he may have held,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akk-dedup-0\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">The district court adequately captured the situation that existed at Metals Trades, but simply drew the wrong conclusion as to the effect of the situation. It is no doubt true that \u201cWoodward tolerated conduct and attitudes on the part of plaintiff that he may not have tolerated with an employee with whom he did not share such a personal relationship,\u201d and that it was only when \u201cthis relationship broke down [that] Woodward no longer felt motivated to close his eyes to plaintiff\u2019s attitudes and behavior.\u201d These findings, however, reveal that religion played a role in Blalock\u2019s discharge. The district court found that Woodward treated Blalock differently at different times depending upon Blalock\u2019s current religious views. This is the essence of discrimination. Woodward was willing to give special consideration to those persons who shared his religious views, but, when Blal-ock\u2019s religious views changed, Woodward no longer gave Blalock this special consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">In addition to the district court\u2019s own findings, other evidence in the record reveals that religious discrimination played at least a role in the employment decision. Blalock was not actually fired until he refused to discuss Rothacker. In a letter to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, Woodward asserted that one reason for the discharge was Blalock\u2019s refusal to answer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>question. Woodward testified, however, that this referred to Blalock\u2019s refusal to discuss his situation with Rothacker. Woodward admitted telling Blalock that he should consider himself discharged until he reconciled himself with Rothacker. When Blalock attempted to regain his job, Woodward refused to discuss the matter separately from religion. All of these factors make it very clear that Blalock\u2019s change in his religious views was at least a factor in the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The district court may have been lead astray by the fact that Woodward and Brewer found Blalock\u2019s work performance problematic at the time of discharge. There is certainly sufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion that at the time of discharge Blalock was not meeting the level of work performance then expected of him. The problem is that this same level of performance was acceptable to Metals Trades until Blalock\u2019s and Woodward\u2019s religious differences became exacerbated. When an employer expresses an enhanced tolerance of an employee\u2019s performance because of his religion, but lowers its level of tolerance when the employee\u2019s previously agreeable religious views change, the employer has engaged in intentional differential treatment based on religion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The district court\u2019s opinion fails to articulate the standard of causation required of Blalock, perhaps because of its conclusion that no discriminatory intent was implicated in the case. The Court has not held \u201cthat the Title VII plaintiff must show that he would have in any event been rejected or discharged solely on the basis of his race, without regard to the alleged deficiencies; ... no more is required to be shown than that race was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause.\u201d <em>McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., </em>427 U.S. 273, 282 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 2574, 2580 n. 10, 49 L.Ed.2d 493 (1976); <em>Bibbs v. Block, </em>749 F.2d 508, 511 (8th Cir.1984) (reh\u2019g en banc granted, March 8, 1985); <em>Jack v. Texaco Research Center, </em>743 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Lewis v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>725 F.2d 910, 915 (3d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 266, 83 L.Ed.2d 202 (1984); <em>Sumler v. City of Winston-Salem, </em>448 F.Supp. 519, 528 (M.D.N.C.1978). This \u201cbut for\u201d causation is satisfied when the plaintiff establishes that the defendant\u2019s discriminatory intent more likely than not was the basis of the adverse employment action. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095; <em>Furnco, </em>438 U.S. at 577, 98 S.Ct. at 2949; <em>Bibbs, </em>749 F.2d at 511. The Court, however, has not expressly explained causation requirements in a Title VII dual motive case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Blalock contends that the district court should have applied the causation analysis of <em>Mt. Healthy School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), a case in which the plaintiff alleged that he was terminated due to exercise of his First Amendment rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-12\">A rule of causation which focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a part, \u201csubstantial\u201d or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire, could place an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ployee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing____ The constitutional principle at stake is sufficiently vindicated if such an employee is placed in no worse a position than if he had not engaged in the conduct. A borderline or marginal candidate should not have the employment question resolved against him because of constitutionally protected conduct. But that same candidate ought not to be able, by engaging in such conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire on the basis of that record, simply because the protected conduct makes the employer more certain of the correctness of its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">429 U.S. at 285-86, 97 S.Ct. at 575. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d \u2014 or to put it in other words, that it was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent\u2019s reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APsz\"><em>Id. </em>at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576 (footnote omitted); <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 416-17, 99 S.Ct. 693, 697, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979). The Court has applied this causation standard (sometimes called the \u201csame decision\u201d test) to Fourteenth Amendment claims, <em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 270 n. 21, 97 S.Ct. 555, 566 n. 21, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and more recently, to unfair labor practices, <em>NLRB v.

It is fair that he bear the risk that the influence of legal and illegal motives cannot be separated, because he knowingly created the risk and because the risk was created not by innocent activity but by his own wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 103 S.Ct. at 2475. Further, we have applied the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>standard to an action under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 after initially applying the <em>Burdine </em>test. <em>Boich v. Federal Mine Safety &amp; Health Review Commission, </em>704 F.2d 275, <em>vacated, </em>719 F.2d 194 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">The Court has implicitly, at least, approved application of the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>standards in Title YII cases. In <em>East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. 395, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 52 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977), the Court, citing <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>held that \u201c[e]ven assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the company\u2019s failure even to consider the applications was discriminatory, the company was entitled to prove at trial that the respondents [plaintiffs] had not been injured because they were not qualified and would not have been hired in any event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. at 1897 n. 9. <em>See Easley v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em>758 F.2d 251, 262 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>(8th Cir.1985); <em>King v. Trans World Airlines, </em>738 F.2d 255, 257-58 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Further, the Court\u2019s decisions in \u201cpattern or practice\u201d cases and class actions suggest that the burden of persuasion may in some cases properly be placed on the employer with respect to whether the same decision would have been reached even in the absence of discriminatory animus. In <em>Teamsters, </em>the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">By \u201cdemonstrating the existence of a discriminatory hiring pattern and practice\u201d the plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case of discrimination against the individual class members; the burden therefore shifted to the employer \u201cto prove that individuals who reapply were not in fact victims of previous hiring discrimination.\u201d ... The <em>Franks </em>case thus illustrates another means by which a Title VII plaintiff\u2019s initial burden of proof can be met. The class there alleged a broad-based policy of employment discrimination; upon proof of that allegation there were reasonable grounds to infer that individual hiring decisions were made in pursuit of the discriminatory policy and to require the employer to come forth with evidence dispelling that inference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">431 U.S. at 359, 97 S.Ct. at 1866 (footnote omitted). This shift is justified because \u201cthe finding of a pattern or practice changed the position of the employer to that of a proved wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359-60 n. 45, 97 S.Ct. at 1867 n. 45; <em>Lee v. Washington County Board of Education, </em>625 F.2d 1235, 1239 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Mims v.

Healthy </em>causation standard finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALh\">[r]ather than requiring proof that race was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d factor in the decision, we find that a plaintiff proves his claim of unlawful discrimination by showing that \u201ca discriminatory reason more likely [than not] motivated the employer.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095.... Nothing more is required of a plaintiff to establish liability under Title VII. Once the trier of fact has found that race was a factor influencing the decision, we find it error to attempt to quantify race as a minor factor____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">We find it inherently inconsistent to say that race was a discernable factor in the decision, but the same decision would have been made absent racial considerations. Thus, we think that once race is shown to be a causative factor in the employment decision, it is clearly erroneous to find that racial considerations did not affect the outcome of the decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqPT\"><em>Bibbs, </em>749 F.2d at 511-12. The court apparently relied on <em>Burdine </em>in refusing to shift the burden of proof to defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">For two reasons, we decline to follow <em>Bibbs. </em>First, the court in <em>Bibbs </em>assumed that the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>standard places a greater burden on a plaintiff than does <em>Burdine. </em>We disagree. Under <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that his race or religion was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s decision to discharge him. Under <em>Burdine, </em>a plaintiff must show that the discharge was more likely than not motivated by race or religion. We discern no meaningful difference in these burdens. Second, the court in <em>Bibbs </em>indicated that if race was a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s decision, it would be \u201cinherently inconsistent\u201d to find that the same decision would have been made even in the absence of the unlawful motivation. We likewise disagree. Certainly, in some fact situations, a finding that an employment decision was motivated by discriminatory animus would effectively preclude an employer from contending that the same decision would have been made regardless of the employer\u2019s motivation. However, as the cases reveal, employment decisions are often complex, and, where dozens of factors are involved in evaluation of an employee, the fact that one such factor is impermissible does not necessarily preclude the contention that the adverse employment action would have been taken regardless of the impermissible factor. Of course, the fact that plaintiff\u2019s case has already been established before the burden shifts, emphasizes the difficulty of the employer\u2019s burden. Beyond this, we leave further elucidation of how an employer can meet his burden to the concrete facts of future cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Accordingly, we hold that in order to prove a violation of Title VII, a plaintiff need demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer\u2019s decision to take an adverse employment action was more likely than not motivated by a criterion proscribed by the statute. Upon such proof, the employer has the burden to prove that the adverse employment action would have been taken even in the absence of the impermissible motivation, and that, therefore, the discriminatory animus was not the cause of the adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">As noted above, the district court did not clearly articulate its allocation of the burden of proof. Since Blalock has demonstrated that religious discrimination was a motivating factor in his discharge, the burden of proving that even in the absence of discrimination Blalock would still have been discharged falls upon Metals Trades. That is, Metals Trades may avoid all liability by showing that even had Blalock maintained his initial religious views, his work performance was so intolerable to Metals Trades that he still would have been discharged.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is Reversed and Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-11\">. Rothacker testified that Blalock had sought training from him in the method of his ministry.

It has, of course, long been recognized that the decision in <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>\u201cdid not purport to create an inflexible formulation.\u201d <em>Teamsters, </em>431 U.S. at 358, 97 S.Ct. at 1866; <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253 n. 6, 101 S.Ct. at 1094 n. 6; <em>Furnco Construction Corp. v.

The <em>McDonnell Douglas/Burdine </em>allocation of the presentation of evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-12\"><em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 252-53, 101 S.Ct. at 1093 (citations omitted).

This distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence raises the issue of what constitutes \u201cdirect\u201d evidence. <em>Dybczak v.

However the evidence is characterized, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>formulation is applicable when it is helpful in resolving the ultimate issue of intentional discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\">. We recognize that this statement could be construed as a conclusion that, even though there may have been some discriminatory intent, that intent did not cause the discharge, and, therefore, was not in violation of Title VII.

If it seems harsh to conclude that an employer discriminates by evaluating an employee under normal standards when the employer had previously evaluated the employee under more lenient standards, it should be pointed out that Metals Trades created a high potential for discrimination when it hired Blalock. That is, from what appears in the record, Woodward never had a great need for an employee with Blalock's background and it seems doubtful the Blalock ever would have been hired had he been, for example, a Moslem. Similarly, during the initial phase of Blalock\u2019s tenure at Metals Trades, other employees who did not share Woodward\u2019s religious views were apparently held to a higher standard of performance. Had one of them been discharged for misconduct of a severity comparable to that engaged in by Blalock, he or she would have had a potential claim of religious discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b795-15\">. The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test, while considering other reasons for the discharge as articulated by the defendant, is designed to ascertain the \"true\u201d reason for the discharge. \"In a mixed-motive context such as this, the challenged employment decision presumably was motivated by <em>both </em>pre-textual (unlawful) and nonpretextual (lawful) reasons.\u201d <em>Bibbs, </em>749 F.2d at 511 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">.

This analysis is not inconsistent with the burden-shifting provisions of <em>Burdine. League of United Latin American Citizens, Monterey Chapter 2055 v. City of Salinas Fire Department, </em>654 F.2d 557, 558-59 (9th Cir.1981). Burdine does not assume that the employer is a wrongdoer, and, therefore, only requires that the employer produce evidence relative to the reason for discharge. To the contrary. <em>Transportation Management, Mt. Healthy, </em>and the instant case all involve proven wrongdoers \u2014 those who acted at least in part based on discriminatory intent. Accordingly, to require the employer to prove that he would have reached the same decision even in the absence of consideration of impermissible factors does not, as rejected in <em>Burdine, </em>require an employer to prove, in the first instance, that its decision was lawful. 450 U.S. at 257, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. In <em>Transportation Management, </em>the Court noted that <em>Burdine </em>\"is inapposite\u201d to the dual motive issue. The Court held that, in <em>Burdine,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">the question was who had \"[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff....\u201d 450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. at 1093.

On the issue of discriminatory intent, the employer need only <em>produce </em>evidence of legitimate business purposes for the discharge to combat any inferences of discriminatory intent that might be drawn from plaintiff's proof. However, once plaintiff has established that the discharge was likely motivated by discriminatory animus, plaintiff has established his case, and it is defendant's burden to <em>prove </em>that the discharge would have occurred despite the proven discriminatory animus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">.

Since it is unclear both how the district court allocated the burden of proof and whether it concluded that Blalock\u2019s work performance, standing alone, was causally sufficient for his discharge, we must remand. We therefore have no occasion to pass on whether the current record would support a finding that Blalock would have been discharged on the date of his actual discharge even absent religious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-26\">Because of our disposition of this case, we need not address Blalock\u2019s contention that the district court, after rejecting his claim based on the direct evidence, should also have evaluated the circumstantial evidence under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
