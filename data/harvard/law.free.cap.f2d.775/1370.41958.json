We affirm the denial of withholding of deportation, but reverse and remand the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-19\">Garcia is a twenty-one year old native and citizen of El Salvador. He came to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>United States in 1979,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the INS brought deportation proceedings against him, charging him with entry without inspection. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) (1982). He conceded deportability, but requested asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">In his asylum application and his testimony before the immigration judge (\"IJ\u201d), Garcia contended that he feared persecution by the Salvadoran government. He had belonged to the Frente Popular de Liberaci\u00f3n (the Popular Front for Liberation or \u201cFPL\u201d), a leftist political group opposed to the government. He and other group members distributed propaganda, painted slogans on buildings, and stole food to distribute to the poor. He planted fake bombs to divert the attention of government troops so that the group\u2019s activities could be carried out, and he also acted as an armed guard or lookout during some FPL activities. Garcia never wore a mask during these activities, which were performed during daylight hours. In addition, he participated in several large public demonstrations protesting the government and its policies. He was active in the FPL for approximately four months, immediately prior to his departure for the United States. Garcia was never arrested or charged for his activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">Garcia left El Salvador at his parents\u2019 urging; they feared that his activities had endangered his and their safety. They gave him money so he could leave the country. He obtained a passport by bribing a government official and left El Salvador without difficulty. His parents and three sisters still live in El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">In addition to his testimony, Garcia presented at the hearing several articles discussing the conditions and tutmoil in El Salvador. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-12\">The IJ considered the \u00e9vidence and denied Garcia\u2019s request for asylum or withholding of deportation and denied voluntary departure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The IJ also found that Garcia\u2019s testimony was not credible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision and concluded that Garcia had failed to shot^ a likelihood of persecution even assuming dll his testimony to be true. Garcia timely appealed the BIA decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-13\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-15\">Although the BIA and the IJ considered and rejected Garcia\u2019s asylum and section 243(h) claims together, they are in fact separate and distinct remedies. We address them discretely, considering first the more stringent showing required under section 243(h) and then turning to the more generous standard applicable for section; 208(a) asylum. <em>Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1277, 1283 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-16\">\n<em>A. Withholding of Deportation under Section 243(h)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-17\">Section 243(h) <em>of </em>th\u00e9 Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) (1982), prohibits the Attorney Genetdl from deporting an alien wh\u00f3s\u00e9 life of fr\u00e9bddm would be threatened cm account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a' particular social group, or \u00a1political opinion. Section 243(h) withholding of deportation is a mandatory form of relief, <em>see Espinoza-Martinez v. INS, </em>754 F.2d 1536, 1539 (9th Cir.1985), available if a petitioner establish-1 es a \"clear probability\u201d of Jmrsecutioh, <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 104 S.Ct. 2489, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>2492, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). The clear probability standard requires the petitioner to show that it is \"more likely than not that, [he] would be subject to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 104 S.Ct. at 2498. We review a denial of section 243(h) relief under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1282 n. 8; <em>Zepeda-Melendez v. INS, </em>741 F.2d 285, 289 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">Even assuming the truth of all of Garcia\u2019s testimony, we conclude that he has not met his burden of establishing a clear probability of persecution. Although Garcia may have engaged in extensive political activity in El Salvador, and may have been identified as a member of the government opposition, he was never harrassed, arrested, or charged, and his family have remained in El Salvador without incident. Garcia has not presented any evidence that the government was aware of his political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-7\">Garcia's evidence does not rise to the degree of probability of persecution we have held to be sufficient for section 243(h) relief in other cases. <em>See, e.g., Argueta v. INS, </em>759 F.2d 1395, 1397 (9th Cir.1985) (petitioner showed that direct threats had been made against him and that his brother-in-law had been tortured and killed by the same persons who threatened petitioner); Bol<em>anos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1280 (petitioner, a former member of a right-wing political party, was threatened by guerrillas after he refused to join them; guerrillas had used similar tactics to recruit petitioner's brother and had killed five of petitipner\u2019s friends); <em>McMullen v. INS, </em>658 F.2d 1312, 1317-18 (9th Cir.1981) (petitioner deserted from the British army to join the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA); he had been imprisoned for PIRA activities and intimidated, threatened, and kidnapped for refusing to participate in PIRA activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-11\">Garcia's evidence may establish a <em>possibility of </em>persecution, but section 243(h) requires a showing of a <em>probability </em>or <em>likelihood of </em>persecution. <em>See Bolanos-Her-nandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1281. The BIA\u2019s denial of Garcia\u2019s section 243(h) claim is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-12\">\n<em>B. Asylum under Section 208(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-13\">Under section 208(a) of the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 101, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (1982), asylum is a discretionary form of relief, available if an alien meets the definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>Espinoza-Martinez, </em>754 F.2d at 1539. A refugee is one who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion____\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (1982). We apply a two-part standard of review to an asylum decision, first evaluating whether there is substantial evidence of a well-founded fear of persecution, and then applying an abuse of discretion standard to the ultimate decision granting or denying asylum. <em>Espinoza-Martinez, </em>754 F.2d at 1539.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-16\">We have held that the well-founded fear standard is \"more generous\u201d than the clear probability standard. <em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1282; <em>accord Arqueta, </em>759 F.2d at 1396-97.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>we concluded that the phrase \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d embodies both subjective and objective elements. 767 F.2d at 1283. The word \u201cfear\u201d connotes subjective considerations, <em>see </em>United Nations High Commission for Refugees, <em>Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status </em>\u00b6 37 (1979), thus requiring evaluation of an applicant\u2019s state of mind, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number><em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1283 n. 11. That the fear must be \"well-founded\u201d implicates a requirement of objective reasonableness. In other words, there must be some basis in reality or reasonable possibility that a petitioner would be persecuted. <em>See Stevic, </em>467 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 2498. In this regard, the \" 'conditions in the country of origin, its laws, and the experience of others\u2019 \u201d are relevant factors to consider. <em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1283 n. 11 (quoting <em>Stevic v. Sava, </em>678 F.2d 401, 406 (2d Cir.1982), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub. nom, INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">If Garcia\u2019s testimony is believed, we conclude that he has shown sufficiently that he fears persecution and that his fear is well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">Garcia testified that he participated in a number of FPL activities. He participated in public demonstrations, distributed propaganda, and painted political slogans on buildings. He helped to rob grocery trucks to obtain food for the poor, and he planted fake bombs to divert the attention of government officials. He also acted as an armed guard for people engaged in a hunger strike, who were hiding in a church. Most of these activities occurred during the day and he never wore a mask or disguise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-7\">Garcia testified that he fears persecution because his identity and affiliation with the FPL might have become known to government officials. He also testified that his parents gave him money tp leave El Salvador, because they too feared for his safety. We conclude that these fears are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-10\">The government argues, however, that Garcia has not shown that he and his family were harrassed or harmed for his political activities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Obviously, such evidence would lend considerable strength to a claim that one fears persecution, but such evidence is not essential to an asylum claim. A well-founded fear of persecution can be established by other evidence, such as Garcia\u2019s evidence of his membership in a persecuted political organization, his extensive activities while a member of that organization, and his reasons to believe that he might have been identified as a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-11\">The government also relies heavily on the fact that Garcia obtained a passport to leave El Salvador. Some of our cases suggest that an alien\u2019s ability to obtain a passport or exit visa may be an indication that his native government would not persecute him. <em>See Espinoza-Martinez, </em>754 F.2d at 1540. Here, however, Garcia obtained his passport by paying a bribe to a government official: his ability to obtain a passport may have little or no relevance to his claim of possible persecution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Saballo-Cortez, </em>761 F.2d at 1266, (discussing <em>McMullen, </em>658 F.2d at 1314, And emphasizing that\u2019 McMullen obtained a visa by using An Assumed name).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-12\">Finally, the government asserts that GAf-cia came to the United StateA not for fear of persecution, but for economic reasons, to avoid the draft, and to Avoid criminal prosecution for hiS political activities. HoW\u00e9ver, if we credit G\u00e1rcia'S t\u00e9St\u00edtt\u00edohy, A Aignifi-' cant reason for his fleeing El fealvaddr ivas his fear of petsecutioh. W\u00e9 dd not find it inconsistent with A claimed feAf \u00f3f b\u00e9fs\u00e9cUtion that a refugee, After he fle\u00e9S hi\u00e1 homeland, goes to the country Where he believes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>his opportunities will be best. Nor need fear of persecution be an alien\u2019s only motivation for fleeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">Because Garcia\u2019s testimony, if believed, is sufficient to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we remand this case to allow the BIA to review the record in light of the proper standards, to correct any factual errors,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and to make credibility findings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Argueta, </em>759 F.2d at 1397-98 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">We affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of deportation but remand for further consideration of the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-8\">AFFIRMED in part, and REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">. The precise dale of Garcia\u2019s entry is not clear. He testified that he left Ei Salvador on December 24, 1979 and came directly lo the United States, but he also admitted the allegations contained in the Order to Show Cause, which charged him with entry in 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">. In accordance with its regulations, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(b), (1984), the INS treated the asyluiii application as also constituting a request for withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1430-18\">. Garcia docs not contest the denial Of voluntary departure on this SppcSl. \u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1430-19\">. The IJ based his credibility determination bri two grounds: first, that Garcia \"had fathered child out of wedlock in the United States,\u201d ihuS demonstrating Ills \u2019\u2019dlsHispectt J of (h\u00e9 \u00bfIvll Idtvs of the United States\"; and, second, that there were discrepancies between Garcia'S testimony \u00e1nd hiS \u00e1sylum application cohc\u00e9fh\u00edtig tli\u00e9 date he \u00e9nter\u00e9d Ih\u00e9 United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">. Our cases have not yet fleshed out the precise meaning of the phrase \"well-founded fear\u201d of persecution. <em>See Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1283 n. 11. In all our recent cases, we have decided either that the evidence supports relief under both sections 243(h) and 208(a), <em>see, e.g., Argueta, </em>759 F.2d at 1397-98; <em>Bolanos-Hernan-dez, </em>767 F.2d at 1288; <em>Zavala-Bonilla v. INS, </em>730 F.2d 562, 563-64 nn. 1 &amp; 2, 567 (9th Cir.1984), or that the evidence supports neither form of relief, <em>see, e.g., Saballo-Cortez v. INS, </em>761 F.2d 1259, 1262 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Espinoza-Martinez, </em>754 F.2d at 1540; <em>Chavez v. INS, </em>723 F.2d 1431, 1433 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1432-8\">. Garcia did assert in his asylum application that his cousin had been killed by government troops, but be did not mention this at the hearing, and he failed to explain in any respect why his cousin was killed, or how his death might be related to Garcia\u2019s activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1432-9\">. Additionally, we doubt whether such evidence should be entitled to much weight in any asylum case. If a government considered an individual to be a troublemaker, it tnight actually prefer to have him leave the country. The Cuban \"Freedom Flotila\u201d is an illustration. <em>See </em>United Rations High Commission for Refugees, <em>Handbook on Procedures and Criteria Determining Refugee Status </em>\u00b6 48 (1979) (\"Rost\u00f3slbrt of A passport cannot ... \u00e1lwayi be fconildertd as ... an Indication of (lie absence of fear, A \u2022 passport may .., be Issued to a person who Is undesired in bis country of origin, with the Sole purpose of securing his departure, and there may also be cases where \u00e1 pASspoirt has been obtained surreptitiously..., \u00a1T]h\u00e9 mer\u00e9 possession of a valid national passport (S no bar to refugee Status.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1433-18\">. The BIA\u2019s finding that \"[Garcia] took pains to avoid being identified as a guerrilla symphathizer while he was in El Salvador\" is in error. The record reflects, rather, that Garcia's activities were open and notorious. This mistake may have been a significant factor in the BIA\u2019s decision. ;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1433-27\">. As we noted above, <em>see supra </em>note 2, the IJ made only two express credibility findings. The BIA rightly criticized one of those findings when it stated that \"fathering a child out of wedlock is not relevant to a determination of credibility.\" The other finding lacks probity; the inconsistency between papers Garcia filed and his testimony concerning his entry date are likely no more than a typographical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
