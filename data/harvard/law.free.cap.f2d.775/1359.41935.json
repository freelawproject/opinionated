The district court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm, in part on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">In August 1974, the County of Santa Clara Sheriff\u2019s Department (the County) hired Trujillo to work on a federally-funded project (the project) to study the control, custody and care of jail inmates. The County hired Trujillo for the position of Administrative Analyst II on a six-month provisional basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-15\">In order to advance to the status of permanent employee, Trujillo was required to pass a civil service examination. He failed the examination and, as a result, the County terminated his employment in February 1975. Had Trujillo passed this examination and a further oral examination, he would have continued in his position until the project\u2019s termination in August 1977. After a successful probationary period, Trujillo would then have been eligible to transfer to another county position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-16\">The examination in question was subsequently submitted for review to the Technical Advisory Committee (the Advisory Committee) of the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission (the Commission). The Advisory Committee found that the test violated its testing guidelines because it had an adverse impact on persons of Mexican origin and was not shown to be job-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-17\">On August 22, 1975, Trujillo filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in violation of Title VIL As required by section 706(c) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(c), Trujillo also filed a state complaint with the Fair Employment Practice Commission, the Commission\u2019s predecessor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging violations of section 1420 of the California Fair Employment Practices Act, Cal.Lab.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1410-1433 (West 1971), which was superseded in 1980 by the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 12900-12996 (West 1980 &amp; Supp.1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-18\">Under the FEHA, an individual has a right to employment opportunities free from discrimination on numerous grounds, including race, Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12921 (West 1980) (former section 1412), and such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>discrimination is against public policy, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12920 (West 1980) (former section 1411), and unlawful. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12940(a) (West Supp. 1985) (former section 1420). An individual claiming discrimination in employment must file a complaint with the Commission, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12960 (West Supp.1985) (former section 1422), the function of which is to investigate, conciliate and seek redress for aggrieved individuals. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 12930 (West Supp.1985) (former section 1419). After a complaint is filed, the Commission must investigate, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12963 (West 1980) (former section 1421), and if it finds the claim to be valid it must seek conciliation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12963.7 (West 1980) (former section 1421). If conciliation fails, it must issue an accusation to be heard by the Commission at an administrative hearing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12965(a) (West Supp.1985) (former section 1423). If an accusation is not issued within 150 days after the filing of a complaint, or if the case is otherwise closed by the Commission, the Commission must issue a right-to-sue letter to the complainant. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12965(b) (West Supp.1985) (former section 1422.2(b) ).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only upon receipt of a right-to-sue letter may an individual then file a civil action in a California Superior Court. <em>Id. </em>The EEOC deferred to the state agency according to Title VII\u2019s scheme. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">The Commission decided to proceed to accusation against the County in June 1979. An Administrative Law Judge (AU) held a hearing, with counsel for the Commission presenting the case for Trujillo, as directed by the statute, <em>see </em>Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12969 (West 1980) (former section 1425). Prior to the hearing, Trujillo had consulted an attorney to discuss the procedures for pursuing his claims. At the hearing itself, however, he appeared without counsel. Nevertheless, he was permitted to make a statement to the AU and to file two lengthy briefs by stipulation of the Commission and the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-7\">The AU subsequently found that the County had discriminated against Trujillo by terminating his employment on the basis of the examination. In his proposed decision, the AU awarded Trujillo back pay from the date of his discharge (February 1975) through the date of the project\u2019s termination (August 1977). In August 1980, the Commission adopted the AU\u2019s proposed order but extended the period of back pay up to the time of its decision, reasoning that but for the examination, the County would have hired Trujillo as a permanent employee. The Commission, however, refused to order reinstatement. Both parties then petitioned the Commission for reconsideration of its order, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-8\">In January 1981, the County filed a petition for a writ of mandate under Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 1094.5 (West Supp.1985) in the Superior Court of Santa Clara County to set aside the Commission\u2019s decision. The Commission\u2019s attorney and Trujillo\u2019s independent counsel opposed the County\u2019s petition. Trujillo\u2019s attorney filed a memorandum in opposition both to the County\u2019s petition and to portions of the Commission\u2019s decision which failed to award Trujillo reinstatement. He also requested attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">The trial court overturned the Commission\u2019s decision on the ground that there was no evidence of discrimination surrounding Trujillo\u2019s termination. <em>Trujillo did not appeal the trial court\u2019s adverse determination. </em>The Commission, however, appealed to the California Court of Appeal. That court reversed the trial court, but modified the Commission\u2019s decision essentially to reinstate the AU\u2019s award to terminate the County\u2019s back pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>liability as of the date of the project\u2019s completion. The appellate court held that the assumption that Trujillo would continue to be employed by the County after the project had terminated was too speculative to support liability for further back pay or to require reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-4\">In August 1982, before the conclusion of the state proceedings, Trujillo filed this action seeking reinstatement, full back pay and attorneys\u2019 fees. His complaint alleges violations of both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983. The district court held that his claims were precluded. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal on summary judgment de novo. <em>Lojek v. Thomas, </em>716 F.2d 675, 677 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Section 1738 provides that the \u201cjudicial proceedings of any court of any ... State ... shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States ... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State ... from which they are taken.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738. Trujillo concedes that section 1738 applies to his claims under the civil rights statutes. We agree. <em>See Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, </em>465 U.S. 75, 104 S.Ct. 892, 898, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984). Trujillo argues, however, that because Title VII requires a plaintiff to bring a claim to the attention of a state agency before suing in federal court, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(c), Congress did not intend section 1738 to apply to Title VII claims, at least not in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">The district court held that section 1738 applies to Trujillo\u2019s Title VII claim in light of <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982) <em>(Kremer). </em>In <em>Kremer, </em>the Court held that section 1738 applies to a Title VII action after an <em>employee </em>appeals a state agency\u2019s decision regarding his employment discrimination claim to the state courts. <em>See id. </em>at 473-78, 102 S.Ct. at 1893-95. Although Trujillo concedes that Kremer\u2019s language is broad enough to control this ease, he argues that we should not apply <em>Kremer </em>because it was the County rather than the employee who initiated the state court proceedings. He contends that to preclude a Title VII claim in a situation in which an employee was in state court only because he was forced to defend a state administrative decision \u201cwould have dire consequences for Title VII\u2019s scheme of deferral of employment discrimination claims to state agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-10\">We must decide, therefore, whether <em>Kremer </em>applies when it is the <em>employer </em>rather than the <em>employee </em>who seeks judicial review of an adverse state administrative decision in the state courts. In <em>Kremer, </em>the employee filed a complaint with the EEOC, which referred the complaint to the New York Division of Human Rights. 456 U.S. at 463-64, 102 S.Ct. at 1887-88. That agency concluded that there was no probable cause to believe that the employer engaged in the alleged discriminatory practices. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 102 S.Ct. at 1888. The employee then unsuccessfully appealed the case in the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>The EEOC subsequently issued the employee a right-to-sue letter after ruling that reasonable cause did not exist to believe the discrimination charges. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 102 S.Ct. at 1888. The employee then brought a Title VII action in federal district court. The district court dismissed the suit as barred by res judicata, and the Second Circuit affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 102 S.Ct. at 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-11\">The Supreme Court held that the Title VII action was precluded by the state court judgment. In reaching this holding, the Court found that Title VII creates neither an express nor an implied partial repeal of section 1738 because it is not manifestly inconsistent with that section. <em>See id. </em>at 468-76, 102 S.Ct. at 1890-94. The Court further observed that nothing in Title VII\u2019s legislative history indicated \u201cthat Congress intended to override the historic respect that federal courts accord state court judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471-72, 102 S.Ct. at 1892 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-12\">In order to determine the merits of Trujillo\u2019s arguments, it is necessary to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>the remedial framework of Title VII and related California discrimination law and procedure. An individual claiming discrimination in employment practices must first file his federal claim with the EEOC. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b). If the state in which the claim arises provides additional remedies for discrimination plaintiffs, however, the aggrieved individual must pursue those state remedies for at least sixty days before filing his claim with the EEOC. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(e). Once the state remedy has been adequately pursued, the EEOC conducts an investigation, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(b). The investigation culminates in one of two ways: (1) the EEOC brings a civil enforcement action; or (2) the EEOC issues a right-to-sue letter permitting the aggrieved .employee to bring a civil action. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l). If the employee has been issued a right-to-sue letter, <em>see </em>29 C.P.R. \u00a7 1601.28 (1984), he may choose to sue in either state or federal court. We point out, however, that we recently held that Title VII claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>See Valenzuela v. Kraft, Inc., </em>739 F.2d 434, 436 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">Trujillo claims that if preclusive effect is given to the state appellate court determination, he will be denied his choice of forum contrary to the scheme of Title VII. Thus, he argues, in this situation, unlike the situation in <em>Kremer </em>in which the employee pursued a state court remedy, Title VII and section 1738 cannot be read consistently. Trujillo concludes that Title VII has therefore \u201ceffected an implied partial repeal of section 1738.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Kremer </em>did not discuss whether the result in that case would have been different if it had been the employer who had invoked state court review. It is significant, however, that the Court focused on the <em>existence </em>of the state court judgment and indicated that the finality of state court judgments should not \u201cdepend on which side prevailed in a given case.\u201d <em>Kremer, </em>456 U.S. at 470, 102 S.Ct. at 1892 (footnote omitted). More recently, the Court has described <em>Kremer </em>in broad terms as holding that Title VII does not implicitly repeal section 1738. <em>See Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1327, 1332, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985) (Marrese).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\"><em>Marrese </em>holds that the preclusive effect of a state court judgment is determined solely by reference to the applicable state law principles. <em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 1331-32. Even if the federal action lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts, state law principles of preclusion must first be applied to determine whether the state would preclude a subsequent federal claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1332. Only if the federal claim would be precluded under state law must the district court then \u201cdetermine if an exception to \u00a7 1738 should apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335. While observing that in the resolution of this issue \u201cthe primary consideration must be the intent of Congress,\u201d the Court cited <em>Kremer </em>as an example of a case in which the statute (Title VII) did not create an implied exception to section 1738. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-10\">Two circuits have already faced the issue before us, and in both instances have interpreted <em>Kremer </em>as precluding any subsequent federal action if state law would find the plaintiffs subsequent federal claim precluded by the initial state proceedings under the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel. <em>See Hickman v. Electronic Keyboarding, Inc., </em>741 F.2d 230 (8th Cir.1984) (Hi<em>ckman); Gonsalves v. Alpine Country Club, </em>727 F.2d 27 (1st Cir.1984) <em>(Gonsalves).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-11\"><em>Hickman </em>presents a fact pattern identical to that presented by Trujillo. The employee filed a complaint with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, which subsequently held a hearing on his claim. 741 F.2d at 231. The agency adopted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation, which had found for the employee. <em>Id. </em>at 232. The employer appealed to the local Missouri trial court, which reversed. <em>Id. </em>The agency appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals, but later withdrew its appeal. <em>Id. </em>The employee then filed suit in federal court. <em>Id. </em>Throughout the state proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>ings, only the agency pursued the employee\u2019s complaint; the employee\u2019s independent counsel did not. <em>Id. </em>at 232-38. The Eighth Circuit held that the employee\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Kremer </em>lacked merit because \u201cthe preclusive effect federal courts must give state-court decisions under \u00a7 1738 does not depend on whether the plaintiff or the defendant sought state-court review,\u201d unless state res judicata principles themselves \u201cdr[a]w such a distinction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">In <em>Gonsalves, </em>two employees were forced to defend an administrative award in their favor when their employer appealed to a Rhode Island trial court. 727 F.2d at 27-28. The court reversed the award, and although the Rhode Island Supreme Court initially granted the employees\u2019 writ of certiorari, that court later quashed the writ for lack of prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 28. The employees then brought a Title VII action in federal district court, which held that the action was precluded. <em>Id. </em>The First Circuit affirmed, holding that the employees\u2019 attempt to distinguish <em>Kremer </em>was \u201ca distinction without a difference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court stated that \u201ca fair reading of <em>Kremer </em>shows that its rationale rests on neutral principles, not on the happenstance of which party \u2014 employer or employee\u2014 brings the state court action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">We find those cases persuasive, particularly in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Kremer </em>in <em>Marrese. </em>The cases on which Trujillo relies to support his position precede <em>Kremer. See Smouse v. General Electric Co., </em>626 F.2d 333, 335-36 (3d Cir.1980) (per curiam); <em>Gunther v. Iowa State Men\u2019s Reformatory, </em>612 F.2d 1079, 1083-84 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 966, 100 S.Ct. 2942, 64 L.Ed.2d 825 (1980). Trujillo concedes, however, that the Third Circuit has discredited <em>Smouse </em>on the basis of <em>Kremer. See Davis v. United States Steel Supply, </em>688 F.2d 166, 178 (3d Cir.1982) (en banc) (Garth, J., concurring) (\u201call of those views are now \u2018water under the bridge\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1014, 103 S.Ct. 1256, 75 L.Ed.2d 484 (1983) <em>(Davis). </em>The First Circuit has also concluded that <em>\u201cGunther </em>can no longer be considered good law after <em>Kremer.\u201d Hickman, </em>741 F.2d at 232 n. 3. <em>See also Unger v. Consolidated Foods Corp., </em>693 F.2d 703, 710 n. 11 (7th Cir.1982) (questioning precedential value of <em>Smouse </em>and <em>Gunther </em>after <em>Kremer </em>because \u201cit should be immaterial whether [the] plaintiff or defendant initiated the state court review\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1102, 103 S.Ct. 1801, 76 L.Ed.2d 366 (1983). Moreover, the Supreme Court cited <em>Smouse </em>and <em>Gunther </em>as two of the cases holding contrary to the rule it adopted in <em>Kremer. Kremer, </em>456 U.S. at 466 n. 5, 102 S.Ct. at 1889 n. 5. Thus, these cases fail to provide support for Trujillo\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">Trujillo relies primarily on language in <em>Kremer </em>to the effect that \u201c[n]o provision of Title VII requires claimants to pursue in state court an unfavorable state administrative action.\u201d 456 U.S. at 469, 102 S.Ct. at 1891. We conclude that a narrow reading of <em>Kremer </em>on the basis of the distinction Trujillo suggests would be unreasonable, particularly in light of <em>Marrese. </em>Here, there is no question that the County would be foreclosed from challenging the issue of discrimination in the federal suit under principles of collateral estoppel. Indeed, Trujillo takes this very position in his brief. No different result should come about with regard to Trujillo\u2019s claims simply because he did not initiate the state court proceedings in the same dispute. More importantly, as Judge Garth observed in his concurrence in <em>Davis, see </em>688 F.2d at 178, the Court in <em>Kremer </em>must have been aware that a situation such as that facing Trujillo might arise, in light of the concerns expressed by Justice Blackmun in his dissent, <em>see Kremer, </em>456 U.S. at 504 n. 18, 102 S.Ct. at 1909 n. 18 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), and the Court\u2019s citation of <em>Smouse </em>and <em>Gunther, </em>456 U.S. at 466 n. 5, 102 S.Ct. at 1889 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-9\">Trujillo\u2019s argument that he has an absolute right to his choice of judicial forum once he has abided by the state administrative procedures was rejected by the Court in <em>Kremer: </em>\u201cNothing in the legislative history of [Title VII] suggests that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>considered it necessary or desirable to provide an absolute right to relitigate in federal court an issue resolved by a state court.\u201d 456 U.S. at 473, 102 S.Ct. at 1893. Thus, the mere presence of a federal cause of action in Title VII does not necessarily entitle a plaintiff to a trial de novo in federal court. <em>See id. </em>at 472 n. 10, 102 S.Ct. at 1892 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">Unless the state court\u2019s decision is final, there would be little \u201cincentive for States to work towards effective and meaningful antidiscrimination systems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 102 S.Ct. at 1896. Title VII was enacted not to preempt state discrimination law, but rather to supplement it if state law was inadequate. <em>See id. </em>at 470-73, 102 S.Ct. at 1891-93. <em>Accord New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 65, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 2031, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980) <em>(Carey). </em>Indeed, the whole scheme of Title VII is \u201cdirected toward administrative cooperation\u201d between state and federal systems, with \u201cno evidence of congressional intent to compromise or circumscribe the validity of state <em>judicial </em>proceedings.\u201d <em>Kremer, </em>456 U.S. at 470 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. at 1892 n. 8 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">Having concluded that state principles of preclusion govern the outcome of this case, we now must determine, as directed by <em>Marrese, </em>whether California law would accord preclusive effect to the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. We first examine whether Trujillo\u2019s claims are precluded by res judicata. We must address Trujillo\u2019s Title VII claim separately from his claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">The Title VII issue is easily disposed of. We have held that California courts will not apply res judicata to claims not raised in prior proceedings unless the court rendering the prior judgment had jurisdiction to hear such claims. <em>See Eichman v. Fotomat Corp., </em>759 F.2d 1434, 1437 (9th Cir.1985). In <em>Valenzuela, </em>we held that Title VII claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. 739 F.2d at 436. Thus, Trujillo\u2019s Title VII claim is not precluded by res judicata. <em>See Hirst v. State of California, </em>770 F.2d 776, 777 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">Trujillo\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983, however, survive this threshold jurisdictional issue, since both claims could have been brought in state court. We must, therefore, address the res judicata issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-10\">In California, res judicata precludes a plaintiff from litigating a claim if: the claim relates to the same \u201cprimary right\u201d as a claim in a prior action, the prior judgment was final and on the merits, and the plaintiff was a party or in privity with a party in the prior action. <em>See Slater v. Blackwood, </em>15 Cal.3d 791, 795, 543 P.2d 593, 594, 126 Cal.Rptr. 225, 226 (1975); <em>Busick v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, </em>7 Cal.3d 967, 974, 500 P.2d 1386, 1391-92, 104 Cal.Rptr. 42, 47-48 (1972); <em>see also </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1908 (West 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-11\">Trujillo\u2019s sections 1981 and 1983 claims both relate to the same \u201cprimary right\u201d\u2014 the right to be free from employment discrimination based on race or national origin \u2014 as his state-adjudicated claim under the FEHA. <em>See Johnson v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>157 Cal.App.3d 427, 431-33, 203 Cal.Rptr. 638, 640-41 (1984). Furthermore, a decision on a petition for writ of mandate seeking review of an administrative order is considered a final decision on the merits for res judicata purposes under California law. <em>See Hollywood Circle, Inc. v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>55 Cal.2d 728, 733, 361 P.2d 712, 715, 13 Cal.Rptr. 104, 107 (1961); <em>People v. Western Air Lines, Inc., </em>42 Cal.2d 621, 630, 268 P.2d 723, 728, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>348 U.S. 859, 75 S.Ct. 87, 99 L.Ed. 677 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-12\">Trujillo essentially offers three arguments against the application of res judica-ta to his sections 1981 and 1983 claims: (A) he argues that he should not be bound by the California judgment because he was neither a party nor in privity with a party to that litigation; (B) he contends that his due process rights would be violated if the present action is precluded because his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>terests were insufficiently represented by the Commission and because he exercised no control over the administrative hearing or the state court proceedings; and (C) he argues that preclusion would violate due process because he was deprived of a full opportunity to present his claim. The district court ruled against him and we review the district court\u2019s determination of state law de novo. <em>In re McLinn, </em>739 F.2d 1395, 1397 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">Hearings under the FEHA are conducted according to the procedures outlined in the California Government Code, Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 11500-11528 (West 1980 &amp; Supp. 1985). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 12972 (West 1980). Under section 11500(b), the word \u201c \u2018Party\u2019 includes the agency, the respondent [the County] and any person ... who has been allowed to appear or participate in the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11500(b) (West 1980). Although Trujillo was permitted to make a statement at the hearing and to present briefs, the record reflects that neither the Commission, the County nor the AU considered Trujillo a full party of record at the administrative hearing. <em>See Crumpler v. Board of Administration, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 567, 575, 108 Cal.Rptr. 293, 299 (1973) (person may intervene with the approval of the agency and become a proper party).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-8\">Privity, however, exists when \u201ca person [is] so identified in interest with another that he represents the same legal right.\u201d <em>Zaragosa v. Craven, </em>33 Cal.2d 315, 318, 202 P.2d 73, 75 (1949), <em>quoting </em>30 Am.Jur. \u00a7 225, at 957. Moreover, when statutory authority to sue has been given specifically to a public entity, a judgment in such a suit is res judicata as to all those \u201cfor whose benefit it is prosecuted.\u201d <em>Coachella Valley County Water District v. Stevens, </em>206 Cal. 400, 410-11, 274 P. 538, 542 (1929); <em>see Rynsburger v.

Hartford Insurance Co., </em>22 Cal.3d 865, 875, 151 Cal.Rptr. 285, 289, 587 P.2d 1098, 1102 (1978) (Clemmer). The circumstances must be \u201csuch that the party to be [precluded] should reasonably have expected to be bound by the prior adjudication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This requires a contextual approach based on the need to avoid repetitive litigation, <em>see id., </em>rather than an approach based on mere formalities with regard to the parties. <em>See Rynsburger, </em>266 Cal.App.2d at 278, 72 Cal.Rptr. at 107-08; <em>Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., </em>55 Cal.App.2d 720, 739, 132 P.2d 70, 83 (1942) (\u201cWhere a situation arises which so obviously calls for application of the doctrine of res judicata ... definitions of \u2018privies\u2019 and \u2018privity\u2019 drawn from other situations do not constitute an obstacle to reaching a sound result.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 U.S. 774, 63 S.Ct. 1435, 87 L.Ed. 1721 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">Here, the Commission was clearly authorized to proceed against the County on Trujillo\u2019s behalf under Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12969 (West 1980). <em>Cf. </em>Cal.Civ.Proc. Code \u00a7 369 (West 1973) (permitting civil action by \u201ca person expressly authorized by statute\u201d on behalf of the real party in interest). Indeed, the Commission initiated its proceedings only at Trujillo\u2019s request. Trujillo unquestionably had an interest in the outcome of the administrative proceedings, an interest that was \u201csufficiently close\u201d to the interest of the Commission in pursuing his claim to permit the invocation of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">More importantly, Trujillo was a party to the proceedings in the California Superior Court. Although he now contends that he was erroneously identified as a respondent to the County\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate, he nevertheless responded to the County\u2019s petition as the real party in interest and filed a memorandum in support of his objections to both the County\u2019s petition and the Commission\u2019s decision. Thus, we find no error in the district court\u2019s finding that Trujillo had a sufficient nexus with the Commission to preclude this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">A person in privity with a party to a prior action is only bound by the earlier action if his interests were adequately represented. <em>E.g., Clemmer, </em>22 Cal.3d at 875, 151 Cal.Rptr. at 289, 587 P.2d at 1102. Trujillo argues that his interest in reinstatement significantly diverged from the interests of the Commission, which were centered on establishing the invalidity of the County\u2019s examination. He relies on language in <em>Carey </em>suggesting that attorneys employed by state agencies to handle employment discrimination complaints represent the state\u2019s interest rather than those of the aggrieved employee. <em>See </em>447 U.S. at 68-70, 100 S.Ct. at 2033-2034. <em>Carey, </em>however, was concerned solely with awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to a plaintiff who had employed independent counsel. We decline to interpret <em>Carey </em>as a broad holding regarding the relationship between state agency attorneys and aggrieved employees in the context of an attempt to invoke res judicata principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">California courts have characterized the state agency\u2019s role in FEHA proceedings as representing the interests of the alleged victim of discrimination. <em>E.g., Commodore, </em>32 Cal.3d at 218, 185 Cal.Rptr. at 274, 649 P.2d at 916 (the Commission \u201cacts on the victim\u2019s behalf and absorbs the cost of pursuing his claim\u201d); <em>Kerrigan v. Fair Employment Practice Commission, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 43, 47, 154 Cal.Rptr. 29, 32 (\u201cAn FEPC attorney represented [the claimant].\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>444 U.S. 930, 100 S.Ct. 273, 62 L.Ed.2d 187 (1979) <em>(Kerrigan). </em>When the Commission filed its accusation, it sought the same remedies on Trujillo\u2019s behalf as he now seeks. Trujillo\u2019s only claim of diverging interests centers on the County\u2019s appeal of the Commission\u2019s award. He claims the Commission was no longer interested in his reinstatement, but only in upholding its invalidation of the County\u2019s examination. At this point in the proceedings, however, Trujillo was represented by independent counsel who advanced his objections to the award. Throughout the administrative process, when only the Commission represented Trujillo, he was provided with adequate representation. The fact that the Commission went on to appeal the Superior Court\u2019s decision adverse to Trujillo, even when Trujillo himself failed to take any appeal, is sufficient evidence that the Commission\u2019s representation was on behalf of Trujillo\u2019s interests. Otherwise, the issue of discrimination would have been settled in the County\u2019s favor for purposes of collateral estop-pel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">Finally, Trujillo contends that he was deprived of a full opportunity to present his claim for reinstatement because the Commission refused to offer certain evidence he believed relevant at the hearing. Under Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 11513(b) (West 1980), only parties are permitted to introduce evidence. <em>E.g., Crumpler, </em>32 Cal.App.3d at 574-75, 108 Cal.Rptr. at 299. The record does not reflect, however, either that Trujillo made any formal attempt to intervene in the proceedings to introduce his evidence or that he gave any indication to the AU that he wished to introduce such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">Regardless of whether Trujillo was actually prevented from presenting evidence before the AU, he had a full opportunity to present his claims in the Superior Court. Although he states that a respondent to a petition for a writ of mandate cannot ask for affirmative relief in his response, he concedes that nothing prevented him from filing his own petition for a writ of mandate after the County filed its petition. Rather, as he puts it, \u201che chose to pursue [reinstatement] in federal court rather than state court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-10\">As a person with a beneficial interest in the Commission\u2019s award, Trujillo was entitled to seek his own writ of mandate to counter the County\u2019s petition. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1086, 1094.5 (West 1980 &amp; Supp.1985); <em>Ault v. Council of City of San Rafael, </em>17 Cal.2d 415, 417, 110 P.2d 379, 380 (1941); <em>e.g., Kerrigan, </em>91 Cal. App.3d at 48-49, 154 Cal.Rptr. at 33. Be- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>, ppuse-.employment is considered a fundamenta) right jn California, review of the .gward would be subject to a limited trial de novo in the Superior Court under the independent judgment test, <em>see id. </em>at 51, 154 Cal.Rptr. at 35. Trujillo could then have sought to introduce his evidence on the ground that it had been improperly excluded from the administrative hearing, in order to supplement the administrative r\u00e9cord before the trial court. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1094.5(e) (West Supp.1985); <em>Bixby v. Pierno, </em>4 Cal.3d 130, 143 &amp; n. 10, 93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 243 &amp; n. 10, 481 P.2d 242, 251 &amp; n. 10 (1971). Thus, we cannot say that he was deprived of a full opportunity to present his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"aud-dedup-1\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">Although Trujillo\u2019s Title VII claim is not precluded by res judicata, collateral estoppel nevertheless may preclude full litigation of the claim. In California, a party will be estopped from relitigating an issue if: the issue raised in the present action is identical to that decided previously, the pri- or judgment was final and on the-merits, and the person against whom estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior action. <em>Clemmer, </em>22 Cal.3d at 874, 587 P.2d at 1101-02, 151 Cal.Rptr. at 288-89; <em>see also </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1908 (West 1983). Of course, collateral estoppel may be invoked only if the .party against whom it is being asserted received \u00e1 full and fair opportunity to litigate his claim in the first proceeding. <em>See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 95, 101 ,S.Ct. 411, 415, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">The state appellate court determined that Trujillo\u2019s employment would not have continued beyond the date of the project's completion. We hold that Trujillo is collaterally estopped form reliligating this issue in his Title VII action. As we ruled above, the prior judgment was both final and on the merits. Similarly, we incorporate by reference our above discussion (part III. A., B., and C.) to reject Trujillo\u2019s contentions that he was neither a party nor in privity with a party to the state litigation, that his interests were insufficiently represented, and that he was deprived of a full opportunity to present his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">Because Trujillo is estopped from relit-igating the state court\u2019s determination that his employment would not have continued beyond the date of the project\u2019s completion, he is precluded from seeking both back pay beyond this period and reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-11\">We now consider whether Title VII entitles Trujillo to seek his remaining remedies \u2014 back pay to the date of the project's completion and attorneys' fees \u2014 in federal court. <em>Carey </em>provides our primary guidance in considering when a claimant in state administrative and judicial proceedings may seek \u201csupplemental relief\u201d in federal court. In <em>Carey, </em>an employee prevailed on her discrimination claim after pursuing an administrative remedy. 447 U.S. at 57-59, 100 S.Ct. at 2027-29. At the same time, she had been pursuing a federal action under Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 58-59, 100 S.Ct. at 2028-29. When the New York Court of Appeals denied the employer\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, the parties agreed that the federal suit could be dismissed except for the employee\u2019s prayer for attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>id., </em>which were not recoverable under state law. <em>Id. </em>at 67 n. 7, 100. S.Ct. at 2032 n. 7. The Court stated that, under Title VII, proceedings in federal court were \"supplements to available state remedies for employment discrimination. Initial resort to state and local remedies is mandated, and recourse to the federal forums is appropriate only when the State does not provide prompt or complete relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 100 S.Ct. at 2031. Since an award of attorneys\u2019 fees was not authorized under state law, the Court held that Title VII permitted the employee to \u201c \u2018supplement\u2019 the state remedy\u201d in federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 100 S.Ct. at 2033.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\"><em>Carey </em>does not assist Trujillo. An award of back pay is not only authorized under California law, but Trujillo has received such an award. Since state law authorized an award of back pay, we hold, pursuant to <em>Carey, </em>that Title VII does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>allow Trujillo to seek a back pay remedy in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Similarly, state law authorized an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the state proceeding to which Trujillo resorted. <em>See </em>Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12970(a) (West 1980 &amp; Supp.1985); <em>State Personnel Board v. Fair Employment and Housing Commission, </em>39 Cal.3d 422, 433-34, 703 P.2d 354, 361, 217 Cal.Rptr. 16, 23 (1985) (interpreting section 12970(a) to authorize award of attorneys\u2019 fees). Trujillo clearly sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees before the California Superior Court, but he failed to appeal its decision in favor of the County. He thus waived his right to any fee award under state law. His waiver does not entitle him to seek attorneys\u2019 fees in federal court under <em>Ca.rey. </em>On the contrary, since state law authorized an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, Title VII does not permit Trujillo to seek the remedy in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">Res judicata precludes Trujillo from pursuing his claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983. Collateral estoppel and <em>Carey </em>together prevent Trujillo from obtaining further relief in federal court on his Title VII claim. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Trujillo's action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1419-13\">. Because the functions of the new Fair Employment and Housing Commission with regard to employment discrimination claims are essentially the same as those of the old Fair Employment Practice Commission, we will refer to both throughout the opinion as \"the Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1419-19\">. Although Trujillo\u2019s claim is governed by former Cal.Lab.Code \u00a7 1420, the procedures for processing that claim after 1980 were governed by the new FEHA. We will therefore cite the appropriate sections of the new FEHA unless a particular section of the former Labor Code is relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">. When Trujillo first filed his complaint with the Commission, there was no explicit statutory right enabling him to bring suit in Superior Court if the Commission failed to redress his grievance. However, California courts implied a private cause of action after the complainant exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See Hollon v. Pierce, </em>257 Cal.App.2d 468, 476, 64 Cal.Rptr. 808, 813 (1967). In 1977, before the Commission held its hearing in this case, the legislature added a private cause of action in Labor Code section 1422.2(b). <em>See </em>Act of Sept. 30, 1977, ch. 1188, \u00a7 34, 1977 Cal.Stat. 3895, 3911. Thus, Trujillo had a statutory right to demand a right-to-sue letter before the Commission proceeded to the hearing stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
