Wausau, as Cross-Appellee against Auto Owners Insurance Company, also asks us to find that the transaction in which the vehicle was made available to Wausau\u2019s insured was a \u201cloan,\u201d not a \u201clease,\u201d and thus not excluded from coverage and, therefore contribution, by the terms of the \u201chired automobile endorsement\u201d contained in Auto Owners\u2019 policy covering Appellee, Ann Arbor Tire. For the reasons set out below we decline to so hold, affirming the District Court as to the first issue and reversing as to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">This case involves a custom tire-servicing truck designed for use on construction sites. The truck was owned by Firestone and leased to a Firestone distributor, Ann Arbor Tire, with the understanding that it would be used to install and service Firestone tires on the construction site of an Ann Arbor customer, a joint venture of Holloway Construction and Holloway Sand and Gravel. This was done. While being operated by an employee of the joint venture, the truck collided with an auto driven by Bradley Dixon, leaving him severely injured. The joint venture\u2019s insurer, Wau-sau, settled the claim and filed suit in federal district court for the Western District of Kentucky for contribution and indemnity against Firestone, Auto Owners, and Ann Arbor Tire. The District Court found no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>basis for liability on the part of Firestone. In applying the hired automobile endorsement of Auto Owners\u2019 policy covering Ann Arbor, however, the court characterized the transaction between Ann Arbor and the Holloway joint venture as a \u201cloan\u201d rather than a \u201clease,\u201d so that the truck was not excluded from coverage by the endorsement. Accordingly, Auto Owners was ordered to pay one-half of the settlement amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">A. <em>The Self-Insurance Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Wausau maintains that the Kentucky statutes cited <em>supra </em>impose a primary duty of indemnity on Firestone as owner of the truck. We disagree. The primary purpose of the Kentucky statutory scheme is the protection of the travelling public. <em>See </em>K.R.S. 304.39-010. <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Kentucky No-Fault: An Analysis and Interpretation, </em>65 Ky.L.J. 466, 473-74 (1976). The statute defines the required \u201csecurity covering the vehicle\u201d as \u201cinsurance or other security\u201d consisting of \u201ca contract, self-insurance, or other legal means\u201d of securing benefits. Self insurance consists of certifying to the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">(a) A continuing undertaking by the owner or other appropriate person to pay tort liabilities or basic reparation benefits, or both</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">(b) Evidence that appropriate provision exists for prompt and efficient administration of all claims, benefits, and obligations provided by this subtitle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-10\">(c) Evidence that reliable financial arrangements exist providing assurance, substantially equivalent to that afforded by a policy of insurance, complying with this subtitle, for payment of tort liabilities, basic reparation benefits, and all other obligations imposed by this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">K.R.S. 304.39-080.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">We find no support in the Kentucky statutory scheme for Wausau\u2019s contention that Firestone, as a self-insurer, is primarily liable for costs arising out of accidents involving its vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Kentucky scheme is designed to provide assurance of a vehicle owner\u2019s ability to satisfy judgments against him or her. In this case there was no judgment against Firestone, nor did Wausau show any reason why Firestone might have been liable in contract or tort. We see no reason to infer that Kentucky intended to afford the insurer of a vehicle\u2019s driver the right to proceed against that vehicle\u2019s owner in the absence of some sort of contractual or tort liability. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s decision on this point is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">B. <em>The Truck Lease/Loan</em></p>\n<p id=\"apc-dedup-0\">Ann Arbor Tire\u2019s insurance policy with Auto Owners carried a \u201chired automobile endorsement\u201d which provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-17\">The definition of \u201cInsured\u201d in the policy applies to the insurance afforded under this endorsement, except to the owner or any lessee, other than the named insured, of the hired automobile, or to any agent or employee of such owner or lessee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">The District Court held that this provision excluded coverage if the vehicle had been \u201cleased\u201d to the Holloway venture, but not if the vehicle had been \u201cloaned.\u201d After scrutinizing the transaction, the District Court found that it was a \u201cloan\u201d rather than a lease because it lacked mutuality of obligation, and hence was covered under the Auto-Owners policy. Upon examination we find that this distinction is illusory, and that the transaction was a lease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">The agreement between Ann Arbor and the Holloway venture was a sales tool, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>which Ann Arbor made the truck available in exchange for the lucrative right to fill Holloway\u2019s tire needs. Ann Arbor clearly benefited from this arrangement, as did Holloway. That the contract was terminable at will makes it no less a contract, notwithstanding the District Court\u2019s finding of insufficient mutuality of obligation. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7 79. Thus Holloway was a \u201clessee\u201d of the truck within the meaning of the clause in question and was expressly excluded from coverage as an \u201cinsured.\u201d Wausau cannot recover contribution from Ann Arbor\u2019s insurer on the theory that the latter provided dual or concurrent coverage for Holloway too under Ann Arbor\u2019s policy. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s judgment against Auto Owners is reversed. The judgment in favor of Firestone is affirmed. Costs are taxed against Wausau.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\">.
