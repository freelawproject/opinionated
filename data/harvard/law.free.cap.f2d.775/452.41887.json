The relevant contract essentially provided that Uehlinger would distribute a two-record set of Willi-sau Jazz Festival performances by Roach (drums) and Archie Shepp (tenor saxophone). Uehlinger would pay Roach $10,-000 (plus a percentage after the first six thousand sales) for the rights to distribute the recording. The paragraph of the agreement most directly in issue said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-16\">You [Roach] represent that you have full authority to grant to [Uehlinger] the rights contained herein, that [Uehlinger] has and shall have no financial obligation to anyone other than you in connection with the grant of such rights (including SHEPP) and that you will satisfy and pay to SHEPP any sums due and payable to him from the production, distribution and sale of recordings hereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">Just before releasing the records, Ueh-linger told Roach that Shepp had complained that he had never actually agreed with Roach about how much money he would receive. There followed various negotiations among Uehlinger, Roach and Shepp. But, the upshot was discord: Shepp wanted nearly half the money; Roach thought Shepp could not possibly (as a customary or equitable matter) be entitled to more than one-third.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">Uehlinger put the records out anyway, looking to Roach to hold him harmless. Shepp then sued Uehlinger for copyright infringement. Uehlinger brought a third party complaint against Roach. Uehlinger settled with Shepp for $7,500. And, the Uehlinger-Roach case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-19\">Uehlinger argued to the jury that Roach did not possess Shepp\u2019s permission to allow Uehlinger to make the record. He claimed that Roach thereby breached the contractual term quoted above. He said that the contractual language gave Uehlinger the right to damages flowing from the breach, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>in particular, to the money Uehlinger had paid to Shepp (along with attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses). The jury, for the most part, agreed, awarding Uehlinger about $8000. Roach appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">1. Roach argues that the jury\u2019s verdict as to the key fact \u2014 whether Shepp had, or had not, given Roach the necessary authority \u2014 impermissibly rests upon hearsay evidence. We agree that the fact was key and contested. (Roach, for example, testified that Shepp said, \u201cMax [Roach], anything you do is okay with me\u201d \u2014 a phrase that in the context of industry practice arguably meant that Shepp would simply look to Roach for a fair payment.) We also agree that Uehlinger largely relied upon hearsay to establish the lack of authority. For example, Shepp\u2019s lawyer (testifying as a witness) said that Shepp never gave Roach the necessary authority, and he read to the jury the Uehlinger-Shepp settlement agreement, which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">Mr. Shepp acknowledges that he did not authorize Mr. Roach to act as his agent with respect to Mr. Shepp\u2019s rights____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Several letters in evidence contained supporting hearsay evidence, such as a letter written by Uehlinger, which said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">Archie [Shepp] came now back to me in saying that he agreed about a release, but that the exact amount of money involved has never been discussed or decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">We do not agree, however, that jury reliance upon this hearsay evidence was \u201cimpermissible.\u201d For one thing, Roach\u2019s attorney did not object to the admission of this evidence when it was offered. Indeed, he explicitly said that he had no objection to the admission of several of the documents. And, he himself elicited certain evidence that arguably rested upon hearsay, as in the following interchange between Roach\u2019s attorney and Shepp\u2019s attorney (testifying as a witness):</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Q. But was it your understanding, Mr. Howland, that Mr. Shepp, your client, had not given any authority to Mr. Uehlinger to go ahead and cut this record \u2014 is that your understanding when you filed the suit?</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">A. Yes, that is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">Although Roach\u2019s counsel eventually objected to \u201cthe letters, the documents ... [being] admitted for their truth,\u201d that objection came too late. He objected on the second day of the three-day trial, the day after the evidence had been admitted and after Uehlinger had presented most of his case. It is hornbook law, followed in this circuit, that counsel</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">must object to the admission of evidence as soon as the ground becomes apparent ... [usually] as soon as the question is asked____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 52, at 113 (Cleary ed. 1972); <em>Reagan v. Brock, </em>628 F.2d 721, 723 (1st Cir.1980). It would be particularly undesirable to allow a lawyer to wait until other evidence is introduced, assess its impact, and then make a tardy objection. Here, the ground for objection was apparent when the evidence was first presented; and Roach provides no justification for failure to make his objection timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">For another thing, the jury was legally free to rest its determination on this properly admitted hearsay evidence. Roach points to several older New York cases holding that hearsay evidence alone cannot support a verdict; there must be a \u201cresiduum\u201d of nonhearsay evidence. <em>In re Carroll v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., </em>218 N.Y. 435, 440, 113 N.E. 507, 509 (1916); <em>cf. Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). Aside from the fact that counsel made no such argument in the district court (and therefore, in fairness, might be taken to have waived the point), the \u201cresiduum\u201d rule is inapplicable. The rule arose in the context of administrative proceedings where counsel has no general right to object to the admission of hearsay evidence. To our knowledge, no court has ever applied the rule outside the limited context where counsel has no right to object to the admission of hearsay. <em>Cf. Levins v. Bucholtz, </em>2 A.D.2d 351, 155 N.Y.S.2d 770 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>(1956) (although hearsay is generally admissible in New York small claims court, judgment may not rest solely on hearsay). And, recent cases repudiate the \u201cresiduum\u201d rule even in the field of administrative law. <em>Eagle v. Paterson, </em>57 N.Y.2d 831, 833, 442 N.E.2d 56, 455 N.Y.S.2d 759 (1982); <em>300 Gramatan Ave. Ass\u2019n v. State Division of Human Rights, </em>45 N.Y.2d 176, 180, 379 N.E.2d 1183, 408 N.Y.S.2d 54 (1978); <em>see also Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>628 F.2d 187 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In any event, here a \u201cresiduum\u201d of non-hearsay exists. Evidence, such as Shepp\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement quoted above, for example, may rest <em>partly </em>upon hearsay <em>(e.g., </em>Shepp\u2019s out-of-court statement to his counsel), but it may also rest upon inferences drawn from counsel\u2019s own conduct (his not having granted Shepp\u2019s permission to Roach) along with his own observation of the conduct of others (for example, the negotiations among the various parties). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(a) &amp; Advisory Committee note. Indeed, insofar as Roach\u2019s counsel made authorized statements during such out-of-court negotiations, they are \u201cadmissions,\u201d which, under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), are <em>not </em>considered hearsay. Letters by Roach\u2019s counsel offer a similar nonhearsay basis for such inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">2. Roach argues that Uehlinger failed to present enough evidence for the jury reasonably to conclude that the claim that Uehlinger settled, namely Shepp\u2019s copyright infringement claim, was valid. Roach cites, in support, for example, <em>Feuer v. Menkes Feuer, Inc., </em>8 A.D.2d 294, 187 N.Y.S.2d 116 (1959), a New York state indemnity case, which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">If [upon notice] the indemnitor declines to defend the proceeding ... then the indemnitor is conclusively bound by any reasonable good faith settlement the in-demnitee may make____ [I]f the indem-nitee fails to notify the indemnitor, or having notified him, refuses to accept proffered assistance, he proceeds at his own risk with regard to any judgment or settlement which may ultimately ensue. Then, in order to recover reimbursement, he must establish that he would have been liable and that there was not a good defense to the liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">187 N.Y.S.2d at 121-22. Since Uehlinger notified Roach (the indemnitor) of Shepp\u2019s suit (and for reasons set forth in subsection 3 below), we are not certain that this case supports Roach\u2019s assertion that Uehlinger was, as a matter of New York law, obligated to prove his liability to Shepp in order to collect from Roach. <em>See H.S. Equities, Inc. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>609 F.2d 669, 674 n. 8 (2d Cir.1979) (questioning validity of <em>Feuer). </em>But, in any event, Uehlinger produced sufficient evidence of his copyright liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The jury received in evidence Shepp\u2019s complaint, which had copies of Shepp\u2019s copyright registration forms (for both composition and performance copyrights) attached. The fact of Uehlinger\u2019s use of both was undisputed. And, the jury had evidence sufficient to find that Shepp had not given Uehlinger the necessary permission. ' Moreover, Uehlinger testified that, after talking to his lawyers, he believed that Shepp\u2019s claim was a \u201cproper one\u201d which he could not \u201cdefend ... against.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Roach here says that Uehlinger might have argued certain technical failings in Shepp\u2019s copyright registration form as a defense to Shepp\u2019s infringement count; and, Roach adds, Uehlinger failed to show the absence of such a defense. Roach, however, made no specific mention of these points before the district court. They are not so obvious that either court or jury would have thought of them on its own without some effort to bring the issue to its attention. And, without some such effort, we suspect an inference of the nonexistence of a fairly esoteric and questionable defense was reasonable. Regardless, the court\u2019s jury instructions, to which Roach did not object, permitted the jury to find liability without reference to the potential existence of this technical defense. <em>Moomey v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>429 F.2d 1184, 1187 (10th Cir.1970) (jury instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>not objected to at trial are \u2018law of the ease\u2019). This fact, along with defendant Roach\u2019s failure to call anyone\u2019s attention to this issue; amounts to a waiver of the point. 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2558, at 670 (1971); <em>Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. v. Checkers, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">3. Roach notes that Uehlinger submitted the case to the jury on <em>two </em>theories: a \u201cbreach of contract\u201d theory <em>and </em>an \u201cindemnity\u201d theory. He says that if the evidence was insufficient to support <em>either </em>of these theories, there must be a new trial, for we cannot know which theory the jury used as a basis for its judgment. <em>Brochu v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>642 F.2d 652, 662 (1st Cir.1981). Roach goes on to claim that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he was obliged to indemnify Uehlinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Roach\u2019s argument here is complex. It depends upon the fact that the judge instructed the jury it could find an indemnity obligation \u201cbased upon either an express or an implied contract for indemnification.\u201d Roach says that New York requires very explicit contractual wording (absent here) to find an <em>express </em>promise to indemnify. <em>Margolin v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em>32 N.Y.2d 149, 297 N.E.2d 80, 344 N.Y.S.2d 336 (1973); <em>Emery v. Depot Construction Co., </em>75 A.D.2d 102, 429 N.Y.S.2d 54 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>53 N.Y.2d 971, 424 N.E.2d 556, 441 N.Y.S.2d 669 (1981); <em>see also Mostyn v. Delaware, L. &amp; W.R. Co., </em>160 F.2d 15, 19 (2d Cir.) (L. Hand, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 U.S. 770, 68 S.Ct. 82, 92 L.Ed. 355 (1947). He adds that the New York standard for implied indemnification permits an application of indemnity only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIZ\">[to allow] one who was compelled to pay for the wrong of another to recover from the wrongdoer the damages paid to the injured party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>D\u2019Ambrosia v. City of New York, </em>55 N.Y.2d 454, 460, 435 N.E.2d 366, 450 N.Y.S.2d 149, 151 (1982). And, he says, the evidence here was insufficient to allow a jury to infer wrongdoing by Roach or the \u201cinnocence\u201d of Uehlinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">There is nothing in the record indicating that the first of these arguments was called to the district court\u2019s attention. And, after reading the record, we disagree with the latter, \u201cinsufficient evidence,\u201d point. Regardless, a complete (though perhaps redundant) answer to Roach\u2019s argument is as follows: Uehlinger did not succeed in presenting to the jury the theory of \u201cimplied indemnification\u201d \u2014 a theory that bases the obligation not upon a contract, but upon the relationship of the parties. <em>Id. </em>Uehlinger offered a jury instruction embodying this theory, but the judge, in omitting part of the instruction, in effect tied the indemnification obligation to breach of the Roach-Uehlinger contract. Thus, \u201cindemnification implied from status\u201d is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">New York\u2019s \u201cexpress indemnification promise\u201d cases are also, in a sense, beside the point, for Uehlinger never argued that there existed a separate, express agreement to indemnify Uehlinger. Rather, as presented to the jury, the judge\u2019s instructions effectively collapsed the \u201cindemnification\u201d and \u201cbreach of contract\u201d theories into one single basis for liability, namely a breach of the promises contained in the contract language we have quoted above. <em>See Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., </em>350 U.S. 124, 130, 76 S.Ct. 232, 235, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956). To have found an obligation to indemnify under the judge\u2019s \u201cindemnification\u201d instruction, the jury, as a practical matter, would have also had to find a failure to fulfill expressed or implied promises contained in that contractual language.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Similarly, in context, the damage remedies under either theory were identical. We do not see how this jury, given the evidence and argument, could have found that Roach owed Uehlinger $7,917.87 in damages as \u201cindemnification\u201d without also concluding that those same damages flowed from a violation of the obligations imposed by the contract. Thus, in context, the \u201cindemnification\u201d theory added nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>significant to the \u201ccontract breach\u201d theory. To have found liability under the indemnification theory, the jury, as instructed, would have had to find liability under the \u201cbreach of contract\u201d theory; thus, even if we assume some error of presentation as a matter of New York indemnification law (and if we assume a proper objection), any error of the sort here claimed was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">4. Roach also argues in his brief that the judge should have instructed the jury that Uehlinger might have mitigated his \u201ccontract\u201d damages by rescinding the contract and not distributing the record, thereby avoiding liability to Shepp. But, the judge\u2019s decision not to give this instruction was correct. There was virtually no evidence that \u2018rescission\u2019 was possible, that Roach would have been willing to give back his advance of $5000 or that Uehlinger\u2019s business decision to release the album was an unreasonable exacerbation of damages. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 350(2) comment h (1979). Given the absence of any evidence to support a jury finding that rescission was a course open to Uehlinger, the court properly refused the proffered instruction. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Penn Central Co., </em>420 F.2d 560, 564 (1st Cir.1970); <em>see also McKinnon v. Skil Corp., </em>638 F.2d 270, 274 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">5. Roach says that the court should not have told the jury that certain union regulations (governing the relative pay for a \u201clead man\u201d and a \u201cside man\u201d) were \u201cimmaterial.\u201d The court, in fact, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">[T]he only question in this Court is the contract, if any, between the Plaintiff [Uehlinger] and Mr. Roach and whether or not Mr. Roach is bound by any Union regulations or not is immaterial as far as this case is concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">This statement of the law, in the context of the case, seems correct. The fact that Roach might have put himself in a position where he could not fulfill both his union obligations and his obligations under the Uehlinger-Roach contract does not excuse his breach of the latter and is immaterial. If Roach wanted to show that the union regulations somehow constituted part of the contract and that this fact somehow made a difference, the judge\u2019s statement allowed him ample opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
