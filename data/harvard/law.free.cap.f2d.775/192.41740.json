The ALJ\u2019s opinion seems to indicate that he found Look not to be disabled because he did not suffer from a \"severe\u201d impairment. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s determination appears to have been made on the second step of SSA\u2019s regulatory test for disability. SSA\u2019s regulations prescribe a sequential inquiry to be followed in determining whether a claimant is disabled. The following steps are addressed in order: (1) Is the claimant presently unemployed? (2) Is the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>impairment \"severe\"? (3) Does the impairment meet or exceed one of a list of specific impairments? (4) Is the claimant unable to perform his or her former occupation? (5) Is the claimant unable to perform any other work within the economy? An affirmative answer leads either to the next step or, on steps 3 and 5, to a finding that the claimant is disabled. A negative answer at any point, other than step 3, stops inquiry and leads to a determination that the claimant is not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"Av8\">The AO, however, made further findings to the effect that: (1) \u201cThe claimant\u2019s impairments do not meet or equal the listings of Impairments;\u201d and (2) \u201cThe evidence fails to establish a degree of pain which would preclude substantial gainful activity.\u201d Although the precise basis for the AO\u2019s determination under the SSA\u2019s regulations is therefore somewhat unclear, we need not attempt to resolve this ambiguity in the present case. Regardless of the step on which the AO reached his decision, his failure to discuss sufficiently the claimant\u2019s evidence of severe headaches requires a remand in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>FLAUM, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"As2\">Plaintiff-appellant Richard Look appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming a final decision by defendant-appellee Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) denying Look\u2019s application for Social Security disability benefits and Supplemental Security income (\u201cSSI\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for the Secretary to reconsider Look\u2019s disability claim,</p>\n<p id=\"aza-dedup-1\">I-</p>\n<p id=\"AKX\">Richard Look submitted an application for disability benefits and SSI on February 16, 1982, claiming that he had been disabled since October 1, 1981. After two initial decisions by the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) finding him not to be disabled and denying him benefits, Look timely requested a hearing <em>de novo </em>before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) on the disability claim. Such a hearing was held on October 28, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">At the time of this hearing, Look was thirty years old, divorced, and unemployed. He had held various jobs between 1969 and 1981, including jobs as a bartender and a packager of computer discs. In 1967, Look had sustained skull fractures and other injuries as a result of an automobile accident. Look testified at the hearing that he could no longer work because he suffered from both severe headaches and back pain. He described his headaches in some detail, stating that when they occur, the \u201cwhole left side of my face just knots up, my teeth hurt and my vision gets blurred. I get nauseous sometimes and I\u2019m just unable to function ... the headaches just leave me immobile____\u201d He also testified that: \u201cThe migraine headaches keep me from daily activities and I have no idea when they\u2019re going to occur. I get them almost every day, sometimes twice a day____\u201d Look explained that the headaches usually last about twenty minutes, and that he relieves them by taking specific medication prescribed for the headaches. As to his back pain, Look explained that he sometimes experiences an ache in the lower part of his back that \u201cmakes it difficult even \u00b0^en times to get out of the bathtub.... Even putting my socks on sometimes is a rea^ difficult chore.\u201d He further related that when his back hurts at night, he is unable to sleep and therefore unable to function the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"ARv\">Look\u2019s complaints concerning his headaches were corroborated by several written reports by Dr. Charles W. Docter that were introduced as exhibits at the hearing. Dr. Docter explained that he had known Look for a number of years as a friend of Look\u2019s family, and had recently begun treating Look for his headaches. Dr. Docter stated that Look had been previously diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic as suffering from \u201ccluster headaches \u2014 a type of vascular headache,\u201d and that Dr. Docter agreed with this diagnosis. Further, Dr. Docter said that he had prescribed for Look a \u201cmedication which is fairly specific for this ailment,\u201d and that this medication \u201cprovides partial control of the condition.\u201d With regard to khe frequency of Look s headaches, Dr. Docter stated that they sometimes occur eveiT day&gt; but at other times occur only every few days- Nevertheless, when Look does have one of the cluster headaches, according to Dr. Docter, \u201cit tends to literal- ^ knock him out for several days. Based on these observations, Dr. Docter offered the opinion that: The frequency and severity of these headaches restrict his ability t\u00b0 perform work related functions and render him disabled.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"aae-dedup-0\">The only other medical evidence presented at the hearing related to Look\u2019s claim of back pain. Prior to the hearing, SSA had referred Look to a consulting physician, Dr. A. Hamid Kahn, for an orthopedic examination. Dr. Kahn compiled a written report describing the results of various x-rays and neurological examinations that he performed on Look, and this report was introduced as an exhibit at the hearing, Dr. Kahn ultimately concluded from his observations that when Look\u2019s back was not sore he could walk about 2-3 miles and lift up to 100 pounds, and that even when his back was sore he could walk at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>2-3 blocks and lift about 15-20 pounds. Dr. Kahn also found that Look could stand intermittently for 10-15 minutes. Dr. Kahn did not mention Look\u2019s headaches in his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The final witness at the hearing was Look\u2019s friend and roommate, Terry Barby. Barby, a twenty-two year old practical nurse, testified that Look had first moved in with her only a few months prior to the hearing, but that she had known him since 1976. She confirmed that she had frequently observed Look to be suffering from severe headaches, and that when he suffers from these headaches, \u201c[h]e can\u2019t do anything.\u201d When one of the headaches occurs, Barby related, Look takes two of the pills prescribed by Dr. Docter, and the headache usually goes away within twenty minutes. Barby added, however, that sometimes the headaches do not respond so quickly to the medication, and that Look therefore has to take additional doses of the medication. ' Barby also related that Look sometimes experiences \u201cmild\u201d headaches, but that even these headaches- leave him immobilized for a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The AU issued an opinion denying Look\u2019s disability claim on November 29, 1982. In this opinion, the AU stated that he had \u201cconsidered all of the evidence of record and can find no impairment of severity which would preclude the claimant from doing any type of work that he has ever done in the past.\u201d With respect to the evidence of Look\u2019s headaches, the AU stated: \u201cThe claimant has some discomfort from headaches, which have not limited his activities significantly, according to the evidence of record.\u201d The AU responded to Look\u2019s complaints of disabling pain as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">The undersigned recognizes that the claimant experiences some degree of pain and discomfort. However, mild to moderate pain is not, in itself, incompatible with the performance of sustained work activity. It is true that pain is a subjective matter and that direct medical evidence of a cause and effect relationship between a specific physical impairment and a claimant\u2019s subjective pain is not required. However, insufficiency of objective findings simply means that the particulars of the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints and the credibility thereof must bear a greater share of the burden of persuasion. In this case, neither the objective medical evidence nor the testimony of the claimant \u2014 although carefully considered \u2014 establishes that ability to function is so severely impaired by pain as to preclude work at levels of exertion elsewhere herein indicated to be within the claimant\u2019s capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Presumably referring to Dr. Kahn\u2019s report, the AU noted that: \u201cThe evidence fails to indicate any restriction in motion or neurological abnormalities. The x-rays do not show any significant changes at all.\u201d While the AU\u2019s opinion summarized the testimony of Look and alluded to the fact that Barby had testified at the hearing, it did not specifically mention the medical reports of Dr. Docter.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The AU\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Secretary on March 19, 1983, when the Appeals Council of SSA denied Look\u2019s request for review of the AU\u2019s decision. On May 17, 1983, Look commenced the present action in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982) to obtain judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision. The district court entered an order affirming the Secretary's decision on February 22, 1984. After summarizing and quoting from the hearing record developed before the AU, including Dr. Doc-ter\u2019s reports, the district court concluded that: \u201cThis case represents a classic example of conflicting medical reports, together with testimony of a claimant which is not readily accepted by the AU.\u201d While noting Look\u2019s claims of severe pain, the district court stated: \u201cAs previously indicated, however, the AU did not accept the severity of that pain to which the plaintiff and his friend [Barby] testified. It is within the ability of the trier of fact to reject credibility and to make the determination that the claimant has no impairment of severity whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Look now appeals the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">This court has consistently held that an AU must offer some minimal level of articulation of his assessment of the evidence when the claimant provides considerable evidence to counter the agency\u2019s position. <em>See, e.g., Rousey v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 1065, 1069 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Stephens v. Heckler, </em>766 F.2d 284, 287 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Zalewski v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 160, 166 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Halvorsen v. Heckler, </em>743 F.2d 1221, 1226 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Garfield v. Schweiker, </em>732 F.2d 605, 609 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Zblewski v. Schweiker, </em>732 F.2d 75, 78-79 (7th Cir.1984). Notwithstanding any question concerning the precise extent to which AUs must discuss conflicting evidence in their opinions in order to facilitate our review of their disability determinations, <em>compare Stephens v. Heckler, </em>766 F.2d at 287-88 (majority opinion) <em>with id. </em>291-92 (Flaum, J., concurring), it is beyond dispute that: \u201cThis court insists that the finder of fact explain why he rejects uncontradicted evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287. The AU in this case completely failed to explain his reasons for rejecting the uncontradicted evidence that Look suffered from severe and possibly disabling headache pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Our prior description of the evidence adduced at the hearing and the AU\u2019s opinion largely speaks for itself in demonstrating the inadequacy of the AU\u2019s stated rationale for rejecting Look\u2019s disability claim. If believed, Look\u2019s and Barby\u2019s hearing testimony, along with Dr. Docter\u2019s medical reports, establish that Look suffered from very severe, temporarily immobilizing, vascular cluster headaches. The report of Dr. Kahn, while perhaps undercutting Look\u2019s complaints of disabling back problems, says nothing to contradict Dr. Docter\u2019s report concerning Look\u2019s headaches. The medical reports therefore are not conflicting on the subject of these headaches. In the face of this evidence, the AU merely asserts that \u201cmild to moderate pain is not, in itself, incompatible with the performance of sustained work activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Recognizing that, as the Secretary\u2019s counsel admitted in oral argument before this court, the AU\u2019s opinion is not a \u201cmodel of clarity,\u201d the Secretary has offered several grounds for affirming the AU\u2019s determination beyond those that are explicitly stated in the AU\u2019s decision. The Secretary\u2019s primary contention is that we should affirm on the ground that the AU found the testimony and reports concerning Look\u2019s headaches to be incredible. The Secretary stresses that both Look and Bar-by were not disinterested witnesses, and that even Dr. Docter might have been considered biased in favor of Look because of Dr. Docter\u2019s lengthy social relationship with Look\u2019s family. The obvious problem with this line of argument is that the AU failed to make an express credibility finding concerning any of the evidence supporting Look\u2019s disability claim. While we cannot, sitting as an appellate court, affirmatively determine that this evidence was credible, <em>see Halvorsen v. Heckler, </em>743 F.2d at 1226, neither can we presume that the AU disbelieved all of this evidence without any explicit findings to that effect. In sum, \u201c[wjhile we must defer to the credibility determinations of the fact-finder,\u201d as the district court emphasized below, \u201cwe must be sure that the AU has indeed made a credibility determination.\u201d <em>Zblewski v. Schweiker, </em>732 F.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The AU\u2019s opinion also may be read to conclude that, even crediting the evidence concerning Look\u2019s headaches, the headaches were not so severe as to prevent him either from doing the work he had done in the past or from performing any other kind of substantial gainful activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The reasoning provided in the AU\u2019s opinion, however, is also inadequate to support this determination. Because of the severity, frequency, and unpredictability of Look\u2019s headaches as described in the hearing testimony and Dr. Docter\u2019s reports, the record fails to demonstrate clearly that these headaches would not preclude Look from working. Moreover, the evidence is ambiguous- about the extent to which Look\u2019s headaches can be controlled through medication. Nevertheless, the AU\u2019s opinion does not explain in concrete terms why these headaches would not disable Look from performing particular kinds of jobs. While the ALJ might have had perfectly sound reasons for concluding that these headaches were not disabling, this conclusion is not so evident on the record in this case that we can reach it ourselves without further analysis by the AU. <em>See Zblewski, </em>732 F.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly reversed with instructions to remand the case to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
