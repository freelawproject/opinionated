Compensation for work performed in the administrative phase must be determined separately by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-27\">The claimant\u2019s attorney applied to the district court for approval of fees attributable to representation not only before the court but in administrative proceedings as well. The district judge awarded compensation for professional services in court, concluding that the claimant\u2019s counsel must direct an application for fees arising from the administrative activity to the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-28\">Claimant retained counsel after the Social Security Administration had denied her request for disability benefits. Following two hearings before an AU and two pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ceedings in the district court, she received the award she had sought. Her counsel submitted an itemization of work performed, and asked for fees of $5,042.45 to be paid from past due benefits. The district judge approved only the $2,937.50 attributable to court representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">On appeal, the claimant\u2019s counsel contends that the district court has the authority to set compensation for services in both court and administrative proceedings. The Secretary responds that the district court\u2019s order represents the majority view on this unsettled question. This case squarely presents the issue reserved in <em>Reid v. Heckler, </em>735 F.2d 757, 761 n. 3 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Social Security Act authorizes a court to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for claims under Title II, \u201c[wjhenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant ... represented before the court by an attorney ... for such representation....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The statute also directs that when the Secretary makes a determination favorable to the claimant, \u201che shall ... fix ... a reasonable fee to compensate such attorney for the services performed\u201d in presenting the claim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a). The total amount awarded by both the court and the Secretary may not exceed 25 percent of the claimant\u2019s recovery of past due benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406; <em>Morris v. Social Security Admin., </em>689 F.2d 495, 497 (4th Cir.1982); <em>Webb v. Richardson, </em>472 F.2d 529, 536 (6th Cir.1972); <em>Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The statute clearly permits the court and the Secretary to set fees for an attorney\u2019s representation in their respective bailiwicks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue of whether either has the authority to approve allowances for services in the other\u2019s forum, however, has resulted in a split among the courts of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In <em>Webb v. Richardson, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that a court could set fees for an attorney\u2019s work in both tribunals. Although clear statutory direction on that point was lacking, the panel reasoned that the policy of using a single petition would further enforcement of the 25 percent limitation and would also eliminate the redundancy of separate requests. The position taken by the Sixth Circuit is not without merit; however, that court stands alone in adopting the single petition approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The Courts of Appeals for the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have decided that the courts have no statutory authority to award counsel fees for representation before the agency. <em>See Gardner v. Menendez, </em>373 F.2d 488 (1st Cir.1967); <em>Whitt v. Califano, </em>601 F.2d 160 (4th Cir.1979); Fe<em>nix v. Finch, </em>436 F.2d 831 (8th Cir.1971); <em>MacDonald v. Weinberger, </em>512 F.2d 144 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">In <em>Chernock v. Gardner, </em>360 F.2d 257 (3d Cir.1966), this court held that the Secretary\u2019s determination of a reasonable <em>fee </em>for services during the administrative process could not be appealed to the district court. We found that Congress had committed that decision to the discretion of the Secretary, and therefore, \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009, precluded judicial review. <em>See generally Pepe v. Schweiker, </em>565 F.Supp. 97 (E.D.Pa.1983). Although the <em>Chernock </em>case might be construed as an implicit rejection of the claimant\u2019s contention in the case at hand, as noted previously, we have not directly decided the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">In this circuit, district court decisions are in conflict. <em>Compare Donovan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>598 F.Supp. 120 (D.Del.1984) (court may not award fees for services before the agency) <em>and Oroshnik v. Schweiker, </em>569 F.Supp. 399 (D.N.J.1983) (court lacks authority to allow fees for services before Secretary), <em>with Kemp v. Schweiker, </em>587 F.Supp. 778 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>(W.D.Pa.1984) (court may award fees for attorneys\u2019 services before either tribunal).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Analysis of the statutory language does not conclusively resolve the issue, but it provides greater support for the majority position than for that of <em>Webb v. Richardson. </em>In granting authority to order compensation in the administrative phase, the statute states that the Secretary may by \u201crule and regulation, prescribe the maximum fees ... in connection with any claim before the Secretary.\u201d The statutory authorization of fee awards by the court refers to the situation where a claimant \u201cwas represented before the court by an attorney,\u201d and provides, \u201cthe court may ... allow ... a reasonable fee for such representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The statute does not explicitly grant either court or agency the authority to set fees in the other\u2019s jurisdiction, and it is unlikely that this omission is inadvertent. We have no indication that when Congress enacted the fee provisions in 1965 and 1968 it believed that the Secretary had any particular expertise in determining reasonable fees for courtroom representation. Congress itself set a ceiling of 25 percent, but did not fix a maximum hourly rate as it did later in the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) (regulating attorneys\u2019 fees in cases against the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In 1965, when Congress added the statutory provision permitting courts to award attorneys\u2019 fees, it was aware of the judicial interpretation of the existing statute restricting the Secretary to an award of fees only for administrative representation. <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Hobby, </em>213 F.2d 68 (1st Cir.1954); <em>Carroll v. Celebrezze, </em>228 F.Supp. 24 (N.D.Iowa 1964); <em>Sheppard v. Flemming, </em>189 F.Supp. 571 (S.D.W.Va. 1960). Had Congress disagreed with that line of eases, it could have made its contrary intent clear when it amended the statute. Taken together, these considerations undercut the argument that Congress intended the Secretary to determine what fee should be awarded for attorneys\u2019 services in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Likewise the statute limits the court\u2019s authority to award counsel fees. In our view, the appearance of the phrase \u201crepresented before the court\u201d in the clause immediately preceding the reference to the allowance of a reasonable fee for \u201csuch representation\u201d, supports the conclusion that the court\u2019s authority does not extend to agency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">In addition, subparagraph 2 of section 406(b) refers to attorneys\u2019 fees for services \u201crendered in connection with proceedings before a court to which paragraph 1 of this subsection is applicable.\u201d This passage reinforces our conclusion. Therefore, just as we find no indication that Congress empowered the Secretary to set fees for courtroom work, we also find that Congress did not authorize the courts to determine fees for administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Finally, as noted by the district court in <em>Donovan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>598 F.Supp. 120 (D.Del.1984), a court of appeals cannot review a fee determination by the Secretary; however, one fixed by the district court is appealable. Thus, if the Secretary could determine compensation for court work, that determination would be final, but an award for similar services by a district court could be appealed. That same anomaly would be present if a court could set the charges for administrative work. It is not improbable that lawyers would seize the opportunity to present all of their fee requests to the courts where they would have the hope of bettering a possible disappointing result on appeal. From the public interest standpoint, the burden of the potential additional workload on the court far outweighs the inconvenience to the lawyer of presenting separate petitions to each tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">In addition to these considerations, we must not overlook the desirability of uniformity among the circuits, particularly in adopting this purely mechanical, administrative, procedure. We have found no persuasive reason to disagree with the majority, and we therefore elect to join it.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>As noted earlier, <em>Webb v. Richardson\u2019s </em>elimination of petition redundancy is commendable but not consistent with the statutory separation of agency and judicial authorization. However, no such difficulty is presented with respect to counsel\u2019s compensation in the district courts and court of appeals. We perceive no reason why the district court should not set the fees for work in both courts when representation in each was required. That practice reduces the time and effort required of counsel and also simplifies judicial oversight of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Accordingly, we hold that a district court may set a fee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) only for services performed in courts \u2014 trial and appellate. The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">. Claimant\u2019s counsel has assured us that in fact the Secretary does routinely set fees for administrative agency representations after the district court has determined the fee for court representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
