His ribs were either broken or seriously injured. He was unable to return to work for about eight weeks. At the second trial he testified that at that time he ivas unable to do any work that required lifting. His doctor, who was the family physician of the defendant, testified that the plaintiff had developed an enlargement of the heart as the result of the accident.
