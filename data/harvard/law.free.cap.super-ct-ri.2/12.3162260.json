While it is true that the plaintiff is not obliged to account for what Emma Forest did with the money which he alleges was loaned to her, it would be very natural under the circumstances that the plaintiff should have what she was to do with the money. We think it is extremely probable that the known or had some idea from her of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>story told by the defendants is true: that the plaintiff was seeking to protect himself to the amount of the other note for substantially the same sum, on which the man Lavasseur had received the money on the original loan.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOE\">For plaintiff: Fitzgerald and Higgins and H.
