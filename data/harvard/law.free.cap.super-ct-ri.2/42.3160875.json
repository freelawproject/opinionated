His knowledge is direct and it cannot be said his story is so inherently improbable that it must be rejected. If he lay out drunk, other members would be likely to be frozen. The same is more or less true if he was frozen in bed. There is no testimony of inflammation in head, throat or lungs whieh would be likely to result from long continued exposure in a passive state.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
