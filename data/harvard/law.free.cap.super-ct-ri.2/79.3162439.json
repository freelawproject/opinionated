Neither do we \u2022 think from the testimony that he can do any kind of light work. We are not satisfied that in the ordinary labor market for light work he would be received except as a favor. The testimony does not show that the respondent is willing to employ him at light labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-21\">For this reason we think the petitioner is entitled to receive one-half his weekly wage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
