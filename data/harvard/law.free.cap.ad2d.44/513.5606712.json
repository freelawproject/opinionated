For loss of services and medical expenses: Abraham Ortiz \u2014 $3,500. If the plaintiffs-respondents consent to the reductions, the judgment as so amended and reduced, including the apportionment of damages, is affirmed, without costs and without disbursements. The amounts awarded by the jury were excessive and a judgment exceeding the amounts indicated is not warranted on this record. Concur \u25a0\u2014Markewich, J.
