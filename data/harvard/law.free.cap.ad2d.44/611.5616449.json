This court does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief requested in the petition insofar as it seeks removal of a Justice of the Supreme Court, nor is the court empowered by the Constitution to request the convening of a Court on the Judiciary for the purpose of transferring the matter to that forum (see N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 22, subd. d). We note that petitioner\u2019s application to the Presiding Justice in this regard has been denied. Insofar as the proceeding seeks a determination, pursuant to CPLR (art. 78) that respondent failed to perform the duties of his office and proceeded in excess of his jurisdiction, it is dismissed <em>sua \u00edjponte </em>since nothing alleged in petitioner\u2019s papers indicates any improper or illegal conduct on the part of respondent. Petitioner\u2019s application to proceed as a poor person is dismissed as academic. J. Sweeney, Kane and Main, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
