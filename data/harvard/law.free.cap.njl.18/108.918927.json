By this cer-* tilled case, it appears that Strader the plaintiff before the justice, was driving carefully over a bridge in that county, the abutments of which, being defective, one of his horses fell off and was killed. The only question made below was whether the Board of Freeholders were responsible, or the Overseers of the Highway. The justice below gave judgment for the defendants; but the Common Pleas, upon appeal, reversed that judgment, and gave judgment for the plaintiff for seventy dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Upon the first argument had in this court, the same question substantially was presented as in the court below. But the. counsel on behalf of the freeholders, when about closing his argument, suggested a doubt whether an action could be maintained at all against the board, in such a case. At the moment, it was supposed there was nothing in the objection, and it was. not therefore urged. His Honor the Chief Justice having afterwards turned his attention to this point, satisfied himself that it was well taken; but the counsel of Strader desiring to be heard thereon, they were permitted to argue, and did argue this question at the last term of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Two questions are therefore now before us,</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">I. Upon whom rests the duty of attending to the repairs of that part of the bridge or way, off which the horse in question-fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">II. If that duty be on the Board of Chosen Freeholders, can they be held answerable for damages, ima civil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The.last point being decided in the negative, might supercede the necessity of a direct opinion upon the first. But the point being fairly before us, and understanding that cases of a like character, are awaiting our decision; it is thought right and proper that an opinion be expressed on both points involved in this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">I. The Board of Chosen Freeholders is a corporation created by statute, and made the agent of the county, for executing all the legal purposes, objects, business and affairs of said county. <em>Rev. L. </em>318. The repair of bridges (reparado pontiuna, anciently a part of the trinoda necessitas,) is one of the most important of those objects, not only at common law, but as recognized by our statutes. 1 <em>Black, C. </em>376; 2 <em>Wm. Black. </em>685; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>2 <em>East, </em>342, <em>356; 2 Maul. and S. </em>513; <em>Ryan. and M. </em>144; I <em>Barn. and A. </em>289; 13 <em>Rep. </em>33; <em>N.J.Rev.L. </em>285. It lias ever been held in England, that the statute of 22 <em>Henry 8th eh. 5, </em>which-places theburthenof repairing bridges, (except in special cases,) upon the county, was merely declaratory of the common law. 13 <em>Co. 37, sec. 7; 2 Inst. 701.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Theburthenof repairing that part of the-bridge, technically called the abutment, was unquestionably upon the board of freeholders who acted upon the part of the county, (if upon any body,) and not upon the overseers of the highways, who acted upon the part of the township. The abutment is as much-a part of the bridge, as the pier, the arch or- the timbers. It consists of that mass of stone or solid work at the end of the bridge, by whifch the extreme arches or timbers are sustained. But the word, \u201cabutment,\u201d is sometimes used to designate that which unites one-end of a thing to another, see <em>Webster's Diet, </em>and in that sense, it must have been used in the state of the case; fhr if was admitted upon the argument, that the horse fell from that part of the way which connects the abutment (proper) of the bridge, with the land; ordinarily called, <em>the filling up. </em>This, the freeholders contend, was no part of the bridge, but a part of the road or causeway, and as such, should have been repaired by the overseers of the highway: and it is further -certified that it has been customary in the county of Sussex, for the overseer of the highways, to fill in at the ends of bridges, the earth and stone which may be necessary to enable the traveller to reach, the bridge from the <em>common </em>highway. This custom does not /however appear to have been so general or long continued, as to be of much weight as an exposition of what the law is, and it is entitled to little consideration in any other respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The term* <em>a bridge, </em>conveys to my mind the idea of a passage way, by which travellers and others, are enabled to pags safely over streams or other obstructions. A structure <em>of </em>stone or -wood which spans the width of a stream, but is wholly inaccessible at either end, (whatever it may be in architecture,) does not meet my ideas of what is meant in law and common parlance, by a bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Sound policy, moreover, requires that we so consider the law, as to compel those persons who erect the structure itself, to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>it accessible at its ends. It is then, that an available passage way will be obtained for the public, when the body of the bridge itself, is completed. A division of the labor between the board of freeholders and the overseers of the highways, tends very much to delay that result. The two bodies act independent of each other, and as a consequence, the latter take their own time to finish what the former l/egan. It is for this reason that we too often see scattered throughout the country, these unfinished specimens of bridge building, standing for weeks and months, stretching their gaunt proportions from water\u2019s edge to water\u2019s edge, utterly inaccessible to the traveller, who is compelled to cross on some rickety, dilapidated thing, condemned as unsafe, when a substitute was ordered, to the imminent danger of life and limb. \u00cd repeat, that sound policy requires that this state of things should cease. The roads of our country have been in the mouths of foreigners, a subject of constant reproach, and perhaps the reproach has not been wholly unmerited; for where the action of the people (not the government) is so direct in its ap-plication to matters of this kind,' as with us, nothing marks more surely their gradations in civilization and improvement, than the character of their highways. If the' custom above alluded to,.of dividing the labor of bridge making, between distinct bodies who work in different ways and at different times, be general, it is a bad custom and ought to be abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">But independent of all arguments drawn from public policy, such a construction as will compel those who make the bridge itself, to fill it up at its ends so far as is necessary to make it a convenient and safe passage way for the public, will, in my opinion, best conform to the course of legislation in this state, as well as to ancient principles of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">There is nothing in our legislation from the earliest period to the present, which shows any design to alter or meddle with the principles of the common law. I have looked into the general course of legislation commencing under our colonial government, and coming down to the present. As early as <em>1683\u00a1Learning and S. 459, </em>provision is made for the appointment of overseers of the\" highways to amend all such roads as were laid out by <em>commissioners </em>&amp;c. and from that time forward, the books literally team with enactments about roads and bridges.- Those which apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to bridges, are many of a special character to meet the single-case. These sometimes, though not always, require that the bridge <em>and causeway </em>leading to the fast land, be made &amp;c. But more usually the language of the enactment is general, conforming much to those now in existence. The first genera! act which I find on the subject of bridges alone, was passed in in 8, and is to be found in 1 <em>Nevill, </em>84, <em>ch. </em>24. This act, moreover,, puts the general superintendence of bridges, upon chosen freeholders; and it speaks in general language,'of making and repairing bridges. Nothing in my judgment is any where to be found either extending or limiting the common law principle, whatever that principle may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">But again, the legislation of this state, affords many instances,, where companies and individuals are either bound or authorized to construct bridges, and in all such cases, the word, bridge, is used as tantamount to a complete passage way. It lias never been doubted, that when companies have been required to construct bridges over canals and rail roads, that they were bound to fill up-at the ends so as to make complete and safe passage ways for the public, or the owners of adjoining lands. So too, our statutes have authorized, owners of land, to construct bridges on private or bye roads, over drains and ditches, <em>Harr. C. </em>413, and under this phraseology, it has never been doubted that the owner is bound to fill up at the ends of these bridges, so far as to make them safe and convenient passage ways for such persons as may be entitled to the use of such private way. \"So too, where the legislature has authorized the construction of. toll bridges, <em>(.e. </em>g. the Trenton bridge or that, opposite Easton, over the Delaware,) and enacted penalties if the same be not kept in repair, the language used is merely \u201c a good and complete bridge,\u201d is to be erected; and yet it can never be doubted, and it never has been doubted, that they are bound not only, to build and keep in repair, the body of the bridge, but the filling up at the ends so as to make them accessible and , safe passage ways. In all such eases, where the word, bridge, has been used in our statutes, such has been its undoubted meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">But again, I have said that there-is nothing in the course of our legislation, which changes the common law principle. It is important therefore that we know what that principle is.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>In <em>Woolrych on Ways, </em>789, 4 <em>Law L. </em>61, 62, it is said that the statute 22 <em>Henry 8th, ch. 5, </em>(which declares that those, persons Who are bound to make or repair bridges &amp;c. shall make and repair the highways at the ends thereof, to the distance of three hundred feet) was merely declaratory of the common law7, for in an old case, it w7as said that the Abbot of Combe ought to repair the bridge <em>and </em>the highway applying to the. one end and to the other; although the Soil might be in anotheryin order that, the easement might be preserved for the people.\u201d And it was held by the King\u2019s Bench and subsequently by the House of Lords, in-Error, that the true common law principle, was as above stated; to wit: that the county or shi-re which is bound to build the bridge, is likewise bound to make it accessible'at its ends. And this held good even though the filling up of one of its ends, reached into another county. 3 <em>Harr. D. </em>2173, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Lord Ellenborough in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>West Riding of Yorkshire In</em>habitants, 7 <em>East, </em>596, says that the object of the statute of 22 <em>Henry </em>8, before referred to, w\u2019as intended merely <em>\u201c </em>to define the limit which was perhaps uncertain at common law,\u201d and therefore fixed upon three hundred feet as a proper extent of highway, to be repaired at the ends of bridges. 2 <em>Dow. </em>1 <em>S. C. in Error. </em>In 5 <em>Taunt. </em>299, Lord Eldon likewise considered this statute as merely defining the extent of the common law liability; and that a liability to repair at the ends of bridges, w7as independent of and prior to the statute in question. The statute of 22 <em>Henry </em>8, has never been- re-enacted in this state, and the common law principle remains therefore in full force. If any custom to the contrary have crept in, it must be of modern origin \u2014 is subversive-of. ancient principles, and contrary to-sound policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">II. But there is ano-ther-important point which remains to be considered. Can the Board of Chosen-Freeholders be held responsible in such a case, for damages, in a civil suit? I am satisfied that the view taken of this question by the Chief Justice, is correct: that no such action can be sustained. I have the more confidence in this conclusion, because I have reached it against my first impressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Although no such officer by name as a Chosen Freeholder, is know7n to the common law7, or to the English statutes, yet there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>have even existed persons charged with' the immediate duty of attending to highways and bridges. The English statutes like ours, have <em>surveyors </em>and <em>overseers </em>for mending the highways, 13 <em>Geo. </em>3, <em>ch. </em>73; and surveyors and <em>treasurers </em>&amp;c. whose duty it is specially to attend to the repairs of bridges, on behalf of the counties, 1 <em>Anne, </em>1, <em>ch. </em>18; and 13 <em>Geo. </em>3, <em>ch. </em>7, 8; and although these persons are natural persons, and capable of <em>suing and being sued, </em>yet not a single case can be found where either or any of them have been held liable, at common law, for damages in a civil suit by reason of a neglect of their public duties, The only remedy in such cases has been by indictment or presentment. And even this remedy', at common law, is not against the public officer, but against the parish or county which is bound for the repairs of the highway or bridge, 2 <em>Black. R. </em>685; <em>Cro. Car. </em>365; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Dixon et al. </em>12 <em>Mod. </em>198; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Great Broughton, 5 Burr. </em>2700; 1 <em>Lord Raymond, </em>715; 4 Burr 2510; 5 <em>Durnf. and E. </em>499. It should be remembered, that at common law, counties were not bound to make public bridges, but merely to <em>repair </em>them, <em>Roscoe\u2019s Ev. </em>246; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Devon, </em>14 <em>East, </em>477. The case of <em>Russel </em>v. <em>The men of Devon, </em>2 <em>D. and E, </em>667, is a leading case, and it was there decided that no ciyil suit could be sustained against the inhabitants of a county generally, for breach of a public duty. The court however, in the delivery of its opinion, and by way of argument, said that the county was not a corporation; nor was there any corporate fund out of which, the damages if recovered, could be made. In this, the counsel contended there is a difference between that case and the present. But it may properly bo answered in the first place, that it was no,t upon that ground only, that the court rested its opinion; it was rather matter thrown out, arguendo. And in the second place, lam not sure that there is any corporate fund, out of which, the board of freeholders could rightfully pay these damages, if any be recovered. The damages, it is alleged, have accrued by \"reason of their official misconduct, and that being the case, they must bo answerable personally, if at all. They cannot call upon the county to respond over to them, where they are bound by law to do a particular thing, and wrongfully neglect it. The county and the funds of the county stand between them and harm, where they do their duty as its public agents; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>but not in those cases where they neglect or refuse to do their duty; and damages are recovered against them by reason thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">But it was further contended, that our statute had changed the whole common law principle; that as it had erected a body of men into a corporation, to take the oversight of the business of the county, it had likewise given a special remedy in all cases against them. The board of chosen freeholders, is charged by statute, with the superintendence of county bridges \u2014 is <em>incorporated, </em>and made liable in express language, \u201c <em>to sue and be sued;\u201d </em>and this, it is contended, gives plenary powers. But it is clearly demonstrable, I think, that there is nothing in this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The words \u201cto sue and he sued,\u201d give to this artificial person, no greater powers, and subjects it to no greater responsibilities, than as if they were natural persons charged with the same duties. A corporate body is merely a legal or artificial person substituted for a natural person. <em>and dimes, os. </em>These words of the statute, are of no manner of importance; and although it is usual in the charters granted by this state, to corporations, to insert this clause; yet it might be rejected as surplus-age, without interfering in the slightest degree with their corporate powers. The simple act of incorporation, gave to the board of chosen freeholders, as a necessary incident, the right to sue and be sued. It is one of the essential and ordinary incidents to <em>every </em>corporation. 2 <em>Kent\u2019s C. 277, </em>278; 1 <em>Black. C. </em>475-6; <em>Kyd. on C. </em>69; <em>Ang. and Ames on C. </em>58. An undue importance therefore is attached to this power, as conferred by the statute. Though this corporation may like a natural person, sue and be sued, yet this suing and being sued, must always be in reference to matters and things within the legitimate scope and object of its creation, <em>Ang. and Ames, </em>207.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The better and the modern opinion is,that a corporation may be held liable even for its torts, in a special action upon case, for a neglect of duties, in particular cases, and even in trespass for the authorized torts committed by its agents, <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>The Bank of England, </em>16 <em>East, </em>6; <em>Chesnut Hill &amp;c. Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Rutter, </em>4 <em>Serg. and R. </em>16; <em>Grey </em>v. <em>The Portland Bank, </em>6 <em>Mass. </em>364; but all these powers and liabilities are attached to corporations, by the policy of the law, which seeks, as far as possible, to make them answerable to the same extent as individuals. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>cause the statute says, they may sue and be sued, it by no means' follows that they may be sued .for every thing, but it means that they, this artificial body, may be sued like an individual, for all those matters and tilings, for which they are civilly liable. We must look to general principles, for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of that civil and legal liability. If, for instance, the statute should give to a slave, the power to sue and be sued, surely that power must be exercised with reference to existing laws. He would be liable it is true, but to such an extent and in such a way only, as every other person in the community. There is nothing therefore, I repeat, in this power to sue and be sued, which will charge these defendants, as a corporation, with any civil liability which a natural person charged with like duties, would not have been equally subjected to. This principle being settled, we have abundant negative authority upon .the question now before us:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">From the earliest times both in England and in this country, the immediate duties of attending to the erection and repair of public bridges, have'been placed by law upon some public officer chosen for that purpose: and yet not a solitary case is on record, of such public officer having been held liable for damages to individuals by reason of a neglect of his public duties. As before said, the uniform remedy has been by indictment or presentment, and even that, not against the officer himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Nor have the counsel cited a single case in this country, which even bears upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">To make an overseer of the highways, indictable for neglect of his public duties, it was necessary that a special act of the legislature be passed, <em>Rev. L. </em>622, <em>sec. </em>18, and by the 27th sec. of the act concerning roads, he is subjected to a fine: there is no common law liability. In reference to the board of chosen freeholders, I am not aware that there is now, or ever has been a statute subjecting them to indictment, though they are by special enactment subjected to a penalty of fifteen dollars if they refuse to accept the office, and if after acceptance they refuse, after due notice, to perform certain duties required by the act concerning roads, <em>Rev. L. </em>570, they are liable to forfeit sixteen dollars for the use of the county. The liability under these statutes, is the only civil liability resting upon them, for neglect of their duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>to the public. If they be liable at common, law, to a civil suit for damages by reason of defective bridges, so must the overseers of the highway be equally liable for damages by reason of defective highways. The same principle must cover both. They are both capable of suing and being sued. But overseers of the highway;or officers charged with exactly the same duties, have existed from time immemorial, and yet they never have been held liable, except under special statutes. I desire to call attention to the case of <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Crosier, </em>15 <em>John\u2019s. R. </em>250, and to the same case in Error, 17 <em>John\u2019s R. </em>489; and more at large than I otherwise should, as no American case has at any time been cited, and it was thought there was none upon this point. It was an action on the case, and the declaration charged that the defendant below was an overseer of the highways, duly commissioned, sworn &amp;c. and that he had taken upon himself the execution of his office; but not regarding, and neglecting his duty, he negligently and wilfully suffered a certain bridge in his district, and on a public highway therein, to be and remain for the space of three months, broken, dangerous and unfit to be travel-led over &amp;c. That during the time the plaintiff was driving his mare over tiie bridge, and by the defendant\u2019s wilful neglect, she fell through and broke her ljg. These being the facts, it was contended for the overseer, that no civil action lies at common law for not repairing a bridge or road; but the Supreme Court of New York sustained the action, and Spencer, Ch. J. in delivering the opinion, said it was \u201c a general principle of law, that wherever an individual has sustained an injury by the mis-feasance or non-feasance of an officer, who acts or omits to act contrary to his duty, the law affords redress by an action on the case adapted to the injury;\u201d and he cited <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>The Susquehanna </em>Turn<em>pike Co. </em>6 J. <em>R. </em>90. The above principle is the same contended for in this case, and upon which, the plaintiff must recover, if at all. This case was carried into the court of Errors, and we have the opinion of Ch. J. Kent, concurred in by the whole court, reversing the judgment below, and denying the doctrine of the Supreme Court. The whole opinion has a strong bearing upon the case now before us, not upon the general question of liability at common law only, but as connected with the provisions in detail, of our statutes. He, among other things, remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that it could never have been the intention of the legislature to introduce a new rule, or they would have been explicit, and that to sustain an action at the present day, would be a surprise. He says further, that \u201cwhere the law renders a public officer liable to special damages for negleet of duty, the cases are those in which the services of the officer are not uncompensated or coerced, but voluntary and attended with compensation.\u201d These officers in New York, are it appears, like our freeholders, compelled to serve under pain of a forfeiture &amp;c. and perhaps get the same species of allowance, which is merely the per diem wages of a laborer, while they are actually employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">There is one other matter to which I desire to call attention. It is said that the liability of the board of freeholders, arises at least in some degree, from the statute; and yet it appears to me that it never could have been the intent of the statute to subject them to damages in such a case. There has been no charge so far as I am aware, of any wilful and fraudulent official neglect upon their part; and yet the statute does not make it an absolute duty, that the board repair <em>all </em>bridges, but leaves a discretion to the freeholders \u2014 they are <em>\u201c </em>to consider and decide upon the utility and necessity of erecting, rebuilding or repairing\u201d &amp;c. <em>Rev. L. 47, sec. </em>1. Non constat, but that they held it unnecessary in the present case, and if they err in judgment, however well meaning, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel be correct in their argument, they are exposed to all the responsibilities which may arise therefrom. This gross injustice arises from the counsel\u2019s substituting the responsibility of the freeholders, in place of the county, which latter is under all circumstances bound <em>prima fade </em>to keep the public bridges in good repair, and liable to indictment if it do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Other arguments might be drawn from the special provisions of the statute, but they are unnecessary. I am satisfied, no civil action lies in such a case; and the judgment of the Common Pleas must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b130-6\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAP\">concurred on the last point (that no action lies in such a case) but dissented on the first point.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">White, J, and Neyius, J. concurrred in all things with Justice Dayton.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Hornblower, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A83\">I fully and in all tilings concur in the \u2022opinion just delivered by my brother Dayton. If an individual may sue a county for not keeping a bridge in repair, he may sue a township for not keeping a road in repair. If he may maintain such action for an injury done to his horse or carriage, by reason of the road er bridge being out of repair, he may equally maintain an action for any other and for every degree of injury or incon venience, he may suffer, by reason of a road or bridge not being <em>in qidte as good </em>order as it ought to have been. If delayed on his journey, or unable to travel as expeditiously, or to carry as large burdens, as he might have done, had the road been in <em>sufficient </em>repair, he may have his action against the township,, for damages. This would open a new field for litigation and I think it would produce an abundant crop. It is true, \u25a0our counties and townships are municipal Corporations, and as such are suable at law: but the, mere fact of being suable does not make them liable to an <em>individual, </em>for neglecting to perform <em>a public duty. </em>In Bro. <em>Abr. Tit. on sur le case, pl. </em>93, (cited in <em>2 D. and E. </em>669,) it is said, <em>\u201c </em>if an highway be out of repair, by which my horse is mired, no action lies,\u201d and the reason given is, that the repair of the road, is a <em>public duty, </em>and the only-remedy is by presentment. The principle of law, I take to be this; that where a corporate body, whether of a municipal or of a private character, owes a specific duty to an individual, an action will lie for a breach or neglect of that duty, whenever such breach or neglect has occasioned an injury to that individual: but if such corporation, owe a duty to <em>the public, </em>and neglect to perform it, although every individual comprising that public, <em>is </em>thereby injured, some more, and some less, yet they can have no private remedy, at the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">It is the duty for instance, of the board of freeholders, to erect and keep in repair, court houses and jails: a neglect to do so, may occasion great inconvenience, perhaps positive loss and injury to some individual whose business or duty requires his attendance at court: the building by being old and out of repair may give \\vay, and break a man\u2019s limbs, or occasion him an injury in some other way: but no one will pretend that in such case an .action would lie by the person injured, against the county. So it is the duty of the freeholders, to build bridges where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the public safety and convenience requires it; but after all, they are, legislatively, to determine in what places, the public safety and convenience requires bridges to be built. If in their opinion, it is not necessary to erect a bridge over a certain stream, although a vast majority of the public think otherwise; a traveller finding the stream swollen by rains, is unable to pass and is delayed; or in attempting to ford the stream, injures his horse and carriage or his person; shall he have an action against the county for damages? If so, then the county is liable for the error in judgment of their board of freeholders. This surely cannot be. Again, if an individual puts an obstruction, or erects a nuisance in the highway, a person injured by it, cannot sue the overseer of the township. They may be indicted for suffering the obstruction or nuisance to remain; but <em>the </em>injured <em>party must </em>look to the person erecting the nuisance, for his private remedy. If it were otherwise, the overseer or township would be exposed to suits for damages, occasioned by the unlawful acts of other persons. The liability of toll bridge, rail road and turnpike companies, to respond in damages, to individuals who may be delayed or injured in their persons or property while travelling on suchroa'ds or bridges, rests upon different principles: though they are corporations of a public character, and their roads and bridges, are public highways, and though they owe certain duties to the public, for the neglect of which they may be indicted; yet, as between them and individuals who travel upon their roads and bridges, those corporations, are <em>quasi </em>common carriers: they receive a toll or compensation, and are therefore hound to furnish passengers with safe roads and bridges. In my opinion the Circuit Court ought to reverse the judgment of the Common Pleas, and affirm the judgment given before the Justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Circuit Court instructed to reverse the judgment of Common Pleas, and affirm that of the Court of Small Causes.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
