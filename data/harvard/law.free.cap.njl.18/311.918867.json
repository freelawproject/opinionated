For the act prohibiting the sale, see <em>Elm. Big. </em>249 <em>sec. 5, </em>and for the act authorising a general description of the liquor sold by the term <em>\u201cardent </em>spirits,\u201d see <em>Elm.'Big. </em>249, <em>sec. 6.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-13\">First, as to the construction of this latter section. \u201cIn <em>all </em>indictments hereafter found upon this act, or the act to which this is a Supplement, Or ar.y other act relative to Inns and Taverns, <em>it shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, as ardent spirits, </em>without specifying particularly the kind or description thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-14\">The word \u201cliquor\u201d in this section, refers to and includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201c <em>composition\u201d </em>mentioned in the previous section, and is the same as if the Legislature had said, \u201cit shall be sufficient to describe the \u201ccomposition\u201d sold, as <em>\u201cardent spirits \u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">To be satisfied that this is the proper construction of this section, we have only to inquire what was the difficulty, which this section was intended to obviate? When the prohibitory act stood alone, it was always necessary to describe the liquor sold, by its particular name, and if the State failed to prove a liquor sold as named in the indictment, the defendant escaped. This point was decided in 1st Harrison, 152, <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox et al. </em>Sometimes the liquor was mixed with others or with other ingredients, as water, lemon juice, &amp;c. and then sold, and it was rendered next to impossible to discover before the Grand Jury, exactly what was sold, although it might be known, that in some particular the statute had been violated. To avoid this difficulty, this section was enacted, so that under the general description of \u201c Ardent Spirits,\u201d the defendant might be charged, and if proved to have been guilty pf selling any of the prohibited articles, by less measure than a quart, without a license, he could be convicted and punished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">Such being the evident intention of the Legislature, it is a rule of construction, \u201c that such an one ought to be put upon a statute, as may best answer the intention Which the makers had in view: for <em>qui hserct in litera </em>\u2014 liter <em>et in cor tice\u201d Bac. Mr. Tit.

Mr. title Stat. page </em>648, \u201cis at sometimes to be collected from the cause or necessity of making a statute. At other times from other circumstances. Whenever this (intention) can be discovered, it ought to be followed with reason and discretion in the construction o\u00ed the statute, <em>although such construction seem contrary to the letter of the statute.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-8\">' Whenever any words of a statute are obscure or doubtfulj the intention of the legislators, is to be resorted to in order to find the meaning of the words.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-9\">\u201c A thing which is within the intention of the makers of a statute, is as much within the statute, as if it were v/ithin the letter.\u201d <em>Bac.

Certainly, for it is not for the sale of every composition, that a. man can be indicted: for the composition that is compounded and intended to be used as a medicin\u00e9is excepted, and a person may sell such; and unless it is averred, the said \u201c composition,\u201d (or as the act now permits the description,) that the said \u201cArdent Spirits\u201d was not or had not been compounded and intended to be used as a medicine, it is defective according to the irresistible current of authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">In <em>Palmer\u2019s </em>case, <em>Leach </em>120, it was not all milled money the putting off 'of which, was a felony by the statute of William III, hut only such as was unlawfully diminished and <em>not cut in pieces; </em>the indictment did not charge or aver, that it had not been cut in pieces, and it was holden bqd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">As tethe strictness required to be pursued in framing indictments upon statutes, see <em>Chitty Grim.

The language of the act is the .same, as if it read thus, \u201cIt shall not be lawful for any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>to sell \u201c Ardent Spirits\u201d <em>See. </em>excepting he havea license for that purpose, &amp;e. If such were the words, it would be necessary to aver, that the defendant had not a license &amp;c. 1 <em>Term. Rep. </em>144, (137 in some editions.) As was said by Lord Mansfield in the case of <em>Spiers </em>v. <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\">It is not always sufficient to allege even the exact words of a statute \u2014 as in the case of a declaration on the statute against robbing an orchard; although the .act contains'the words \u201c if any person rob an orchard, he shall &amp;c.\u201d yet it. must be further alleged of what, or how the orchard was robbed. 1 <em>East Rep. </em>647, in notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">In the present indictment, the words, \u201c Ardent Spirits,\u201d being in law a sufficient description of the composition, it may be presumed to be the composition; or in other words, it will not be presumed to be the simple liquor; and if the composition; or if not the simple, without a negative of the exception, it may be presumed to be the exception, for <em>\u201c omnia'prse$umuntur legitimi Jacta, donee probetur in contrarium. Injuria non preesumitur.\u201d </em>And upon this presumption, the case in 1 <em>Term. Rep. </em>137, (or 141 in some editions) <em>Spiers </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>is directly in point; where Lord Mansfield says, \u201cthis being after verdict, it is only necessary to prove at the trial, what is alleged in the declaration; and here it is only alleged, that these mariners had not deserted from the <em>Diamond; </em>therefore we cannot presume, that in this case, it was proved that these men had not deserted from <em>any </em>of His Majesty\u2019s Ships.\u201d So also the opinion of Buller, Justice \u201cas to its being intended'after verdict, nothing is to be presumed, but what is expressly stated in the declaration, or what is necessarily implied from those facts, wjiich are stated <em>Sec. </em>So also in 4 <em>Term. Rep. </em>472, <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Hayward. </em>Opinion of Justice Buller. So also 2 <em>Burrows, </em>681 and 682, opinion of Lord Mansfield, \u201cit may be his own pond or his own fish, for any thing that appears to the contrary.\u201d Opinion of Justice Denison, \u201cItddes not appear, that the fish he killed, were <em>not </em>his <em>own </em>or killed in his own ponds.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">Aud in this case it may with the same force be said, it does not appear, that the \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d or (as we may presume it was a composition,) that the composition was not compounded and intended to be used as medicine. Or in the language bf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Lord Mansfield, for aught that appears to the contrary in this indictment, it <em>maij </em>be a composition compounded and intended to be used as a medicine; and if so, the defendant is improperly convicted. And it would be a good reason in arrest of judgment; if so, the indictment, for the same reason may be quashed. 4 Halst. 296, <em>State </em>v. <em>Rickey. </em>Argument of Counsellor Halsted and opinion of Justice Drake. 1 <em>Harrison's Rep. </em>133, <em>Farwell et al. </em>v. <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">But it may be answered, that admitting the rules of pleading to have been so settled, yet this section of the law was intended to abrpgate it, and'make it a sufficient <em>description </em>of the offence, to describe the liquor sold as Ardent Spirits, without negativing the exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">But such is not the case. The statute only intended to help or aid the <em>description </em>of the <em>liquor </em>sold, and not of the <em>offence </em>created by the previous section of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">It does not say, that in all indictments hereafter found upon this act, it will be a sufficient <em>description </em>of the <em>offence, </em>to charge the party with having sold \u201cArdent Spirits\u201d contrary to the statute \u2014 but simply, that when you charge a party with an unlawful selling, it shall be a sufficient description of the <em>liquor </em>sold, to call it \u201cArdent Spirits.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">The Legislature never intended to alter, modify, or destroy, that well established and most reasonable rule of pleading, which in the like cases require the negativing of all exceptions in the-enacting clause creating the offence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">There was no reason for it, and if no reason, there could never have been intended such a law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-10\">It may be objected'to the above argument, that iuasmuch as hr an indictment for selliug a composition,, it is necessary not only to aver of what it is composed, (that the Court may take notice from the record or indictment whether it be a composition or not,) but also which particular liquor shall form the chief ingredient. The indictment will present the following or somewhat like ridiculous description of theoffence, viz: that A. B. on such a day, at &amp;c. without license &amp;c. unlawfully did seli or cause or knowingly permit to be sold, &amp;c. &amp;c. certain Ardent Spirits, then and there compounded of Ardent Spirits (and whatever else it may be) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>of which, Ardent Spirits did then and there form the chief ingredient. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-5\">But a simple reference to two particular words of the fourth section will dispel this apparent incongruity \u2014 the words, \u201ckind or description thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-6\">Before the sixth section wras passed, it was doubtless necessary to aver of what the composition was made, and also the particular liquor which formed tiie chief ingredient. So also, in the case of selling mixed liquors, I aprrehend it would have been necessary for the prosecution to specify the simples comprising the mixture, that the Court might take cognizance from the indictment itself, whether they were such liquors mixed, as the selling thereof constituted the offence. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-7\">But the language of the sixth section is so definite and expressive, that it is impossible to resist its force, \u201cit shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, (whether simple, compound, or mixed.) as \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d and not only so, but also without specifying particularly the kind, (referring to the simple,) or <em>description </em>thereof; (referring undoubtedly to the composition and mixed liquors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-8\">You need not specify the \u201cparticular kind\u201d of simple liquor, nor give a \u201cparticular description\u201d of the composition or mixed liquors, is in effect the language of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-9\">It shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, \u201cwhether simple, compound or mixed, as \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d without <em>specifying </em>particularly the \u201c kind\u201d of simple liquor and without giving a particular description of the composition or mixed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-10\">\u201cDescription\u201d cannot be predicated of a simple; but \u201c kind\u201d can. \u201cKind\u201d cannot be predicated of a compound or mixture, but description\u201d may.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-11\">On the second point, see <em>Chilly Crim.

It lias been frequently raised before the court of Oyer and Terminer, and the Quarter Sessions of the Peace of the several counties, and has received different, and sometimes contradictory answers: and I have lately perceived, that indictments have been drawn differently in different counties, according to the opinions, or the caution of the different prosecutors. I think the statute admits of a plain and'easy construction, and the question propounded, susceptible of a simpie and satisfactory answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">By analyzing the statute and considering its. different parts, we shall see its meaning and the intention of the legislature. To do that, I need not incumber this opinion with a copy of the act, but will proceed tastate the subsfance of its enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">1. In the first place it forbids the sale of wine, gin, rum, bran'dy, whiskey, cider spirits and all other kind of <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>by a less quantity than ope quart, without a license &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">2. It prohibits the sale by a less quantity than one quart, of any \u2018\u2018 <em>composition\u201d </em>of which wine, or any of the liquors above mentioned, shall form the chief ingredient, <em>except </em>such as shall be compounded and intended to be used as a medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">3. It prohibits the sale of any <em>\u201c mixed </em>liquors\u201d by a less quantity than five gallons.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Here there are three distinct offences created by $ie statute. An indictment for the first offence, (in the order above stated,) must charge, that the defendant, without license first had and obtained for that purpose, sold, by a less quantity than one quart, to wit: so'much wine, rum, gin, brandy, whiskey or cider spirits, naming the liquor according to the fact: or to avoid the danger of being defeated on the trial by failing to prove the kind of liquor named in the indictment, the prosecutor under the <em>remedial </em>provision of the sixth section' of the act, <em>Elm. Big. </em>2.49,. may charge the defendant with selling <em>u </em>Ardent Spirits\u201d by a less quantity &amp;c. and without license. To support such an indictment, the prosecutor must prove, that the defendant sold the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>cise kind of liquor named in the indictment: or if the indictment is for selling \u201c Ardent Spirits,\u201d lie must prove on the \u00bbial, that he sold one of the simples named in the statute, viz: Wine, rum, gin, brandy, whiskey or cider spirits.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In an indictment for the second offence, the,defendant must be charged with selling by a less quantity than one quart, \u201c a composition,\u201d not compounded and intended to be used as a medicine, of which wine, gin, rum, brandy, whiskey or cider spirits, formed the chief ingredient; specifying which of those simples prevailed in the composition, and such an indictment must be proved as laid, or the defendant cannot be convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The third offence consists in selling \u201c mixed liquors\u201d by a less measure than' <em>jive </em>gallons; and whatever may be meant by the term \u201cmixed liquors,\u201d the indictment must be for selling \u201cmixed liquors\u201d by the name, by which the. particular mixture is generally known. An indictment in the words of the statute, viz: for selling \u201cmixed liquor,\u201d would not in my opinion, be sufficient. \u201cLiquor,\u201d the dictionary informs us, means any thing liquid; but milk and water, or water and vinegar, or tea and coffee, are liquors, and may be mixed; and- when mixed, are mixed liquors. The legislature did not mean to prohibit the sale of such mixtures by a less quantity than five gallons; they no doubt intended to forbid the sale, by unlicensed persons of a-mixture of intoxicating drinks, in a less quantity than five gallons. In my opinion therefore, an indictment under this clause of the statute, must show what the mixture was composed of, and that it consisted of some one or more of the different kinds of Ardent Spirits or intoxicating liquor.s mentioned in the statute. And I am further of opinian,, that to support such an indictment, the prosecutor must prove the facts as laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In opposition to all this, it has been ingeniously and laboriously argued by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that by force of the sixth section of the statute, in <em>all </em>indictments found under it, \u201c it shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, as <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>without specifying particularly, the kind or description thereof:\u201d And hence he arg\u00fces, that in all indictments, the prosecutor should state, that the liquor or the ardent spirits sold, had not been compounded or intended to be used as a medicine. No doubt, if his main proposition is right, he is right also in his conclusion. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>if a man may be indicted for selling a <em>composition </em>by the name of <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>the indictment ought to aver, that, it had not been compounded and intended for a medicine; since the statute excepts from its prohibition, the sale of any composition, prepared and intended to be used as a medicine. It is a well settled .rule, and the cases cited by defendant\u2019s counsel fully establish it, that an exception, in the description of an offence, created by statute, is different from a proviso, which exempts from the penalty under certain circumstances. In the former case, the abscncb of that matter, or the non-existence of those facts, the absence or non-existence of which, is necessary by the statute, to constitute the offence, must be averred in the indictment; or rather, their existence must be negatived, Rut the latter, being mere matter of excuse or defence, need not be negatived in the indictment, but must.be proved by th\u20ac defendant if lie would have the benefit of it. It is upon this principle, that indictments under this statute have always, so far as I know, cont\u00e1ined the clause <em>\u201c </em>not having first obtained a license.\u201d If on the contrary, after prohibiting the sale of Ardent Spirits by the small measure, the statute had annexed a proviso, that a person having a license; or under the agd of twenty-one years, should not be liable to conviction and punishment, a license or minority, would be matter of defence to be shown by the defendant. The follow-,in^ among others are cases showing and illustrating this distinction, viz: <em>Spieres </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>1 T. R. 141; <em>Palmer\u2019s case, Leach C. C. </em>120; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Jukes et al. </em>8 T. <em>R. </em>542; 1 <em>Saund. </em>262 in note; <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Scrivens, 7 </em>T. <em>R. </em>27; 1 <em>Str. </em>66, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Sparling; Id. </em>497, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Ford; Id. 555, Rex </em>v. <em>Pratten; </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>559, <em>Rex v. James, </em>1 <em>Burr. R. 153; </em>1 T. <em>R. </em>145, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Stone; 1 East, </em>646 in note; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Brian, </em>2 <em>Str. </em>1101; 1 <em>Chitt. Crim. Law 283; 1 Burr. </em>153; 15 <em>East, </em>456; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>2 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>1415; <em>Id. </em>1386; 1 <em>T. R. </em>127; 4 <em>Id. </em>472; 2 <em>Burr. </em>681.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">% Rut it is a mistake to suppose, that <em>all </em>indictments under the statute, must, or may be, for selling Ardent Spirits. There is no rule of construction better settled, than that general words, may be restrained to meet the particular intent of the legislature. Nowr what was that intent? We all know the history of legislation upon this subject. Under the original statute, it was necessary to specify in the indictment, when a man was indicted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>selling wine, or any kind of ardent spirits, whether it was wine, rum, gin, brandy, whiskey or cider 'spirits. The consequence \u25a0 was, that prosecutions often failed, by reason of the bad memory or worse morals of the witnesses, who could not tell the difference between gin and brandy; or could not remember, which it was, they had bought and drank. And no doubt <em>too, </em>mistakes were often made in charging the liquor sold to be one kind, vyhen in fact it was another.'This difficulty never arose on indictments found for selling compositions or mixtures; but only on 'indictments for selling some of the specified liquors. It was then to remedy this difficulty upon indictments under the first clause of the statute, that the sixth section was introduced into the present act. We must then understand that section as meaning no more, than that, in <em>all </em>indictments, for selling wine or any of the simple liquors mentioned in the statute, it shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, as Ardent Spirits. But again, the application of this section to the second and third clauses of the statute, would lead to absurdity, and this is another reason for restraining the word \u201call\u201d in the manner suggested. Suppose, for instance, we substitute the word \u201c Ardent Spirits\u201d for the word \u201c Composition,\u201d in the second clause of the statute; how will the indictment read? For selling <em>Ardent Spirits </em>of which\u00bb rum, or gin, or brandy; or of which <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>was the' chief ingredient. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">But it is said, the indictment should be for selling <em>a composition, </em>of which \u201cArdent Spirits\u201d formed the chief ingredient. That however, would not be, a compliance with the statute. The statute authorises us to call <em>il </em>the liquor sold\u201d Ardent Spirits; .not the chief ingredient of the liquor sold. But the impropriety of extending the application of the sixth section to <em>ail </em>indictments under this statute, is more palpable, when considered\" in reference to the third offence created by the act: that prohibits the selling of mixed liquors, by a less quantity than five gallons, without a license. The indictment then, would charge 'the defendant with selling Ardent Spirits, by a less measure than five gallons. And yet we have no law forbidding the sale of Ardent Spirits hy the quart, the half gallon, the gallon or by any quantity, not less than a quart, The indictment then, would charge the defendant with no offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>In my opinion therefore, the word \u201call\u201d in the sixth section must be restricted to all indictments found under the act for selling any of the simple, unmixed liquors named in the act: that indictments upon the second clause of the act, must be for selling a composition, not compounded or intended to be used as a medicine, the chief ingredient of which, is Ardent Spirits, or one of the simple liquors mentioned in the act, naming it. And that indictments upon the third clause of the act must be for selling a mixed liquor, commonly called so, whatever its appropriate name may be. \u2022 . \u25a0 .</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">As to the conclusion of the indictment, against \u201c the statutes,\u201d I think there is nothing in the objection. In <em>Rex v. Johnson, </em>3 <em>M. </em>and <em>S. </em>553, cited in 10 <em>Petersd. Abr. </em>485, in margin, the court said, the conclusion'of an indictment forms so material a part of it, that for any defect in it, the indictment is ill. And yet in <em>Rex </em>v. Matthews, <em>5 T. R. </em>152; and in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Bathurst, Sayr. R. </em>225, it was held that if the indictment was good at the common law, the contra formam statuti, might be rejected. And see <em>The State </em>v. Berry, <em>4 Halst. R. 374. </em>So it has been held, that an indictment concluding against \u201cthe statute\u201d when in fact it was against two statutes, was good; and I do not see why a conclusion against the statutes, when there is only one statute, should not be equally good. And I understand it has been so decided by Mr. Justice Story, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert et al. 8 Sumn. Cir. C. R. </em>88; 2 <em>Peters\u2019 Dig. </em>447, <em>sec. </em>51.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Both objections must.be overruled, and judgment given for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\n<em>Motion to quash denied.
