Such an averment is <em>only </em>necessary, in an indictment on <em>the </em>second elanse of the fifth section of the statute of March 1, 1838, <em>Elm.

For the act prohibiting the sale, see <em>Elm. Dig. </em>249 <em>sec. </em>-5, and for the act authorising a general description of the liquor sold by the term \u201c <em>ardent spirits,\u201d </em>see <em>Elm. Dig. </em>249, <em>seo. </em>6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-16\">First, as to the construction of this latter section. \u201c In <em>all </em>indictments hereafter found upon this act, or the act to which this is a supplement, or any other act relative to Inns and Taverns, <em>it shall he sufficient to dpseribe the liquor sold, as ardent spirits, </em>without specifying particularly the kind or description thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-17\">The word \u201cliquor\u201d in this section, refers to and includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>\u201ccomposition \u201d </em>mentioned in the previous section, and is the same as if the Legislature had said, \u201c it shall be sufficient to describe the \u201c composition \u201d sold, as \u201c <em>ardent spirits.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\">To be satisfied that this is the proper construction of this section, we have only to inquire what was the difficult}, which this section was intended to obviate ? When the prohibitory act stood alone, it was always necessary to describe the liquor sold, by its particular name, and if the State failed to prove a liquor sold as named in the indictment, the defendant escaped. This point was decided in 1st <em>Harrison, </em>152, <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox et al. </em>Sometimes the liquor was mixed with others or with other ingredients, as water, lemon juice &amp;c. and then sold, and it was rendered next to impossible to discover before the Grand Jury, exactly what was sold, although it might be known, that in some particular the statute had been violated. To avoid this difficulty, this section was enacted, so that under the general description of \u201c Ardent Spirits \u201d the defendant might be charged, and if proved to have been guilty of selling any of the prohibited articles, by less measure than a quart, without a license, he could be convicted and punished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">Such being the evident intention of the Legislature, it is a rule of construction, \u201c that such an one ought to be put upon a statute, as may best answer the intention which the makers had in view : for <em>qui hosret in litera </em>\u2014 hceret <em>in eortiee.\u201d Bac. Abr. Tit. Stat. page </em>647.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">And if such a construction is to prevail, \u201c as may best answer the <em>intention </em>which the makers had in view,\u201d that \u201c <em>intention </em>\u201d by another rule, <em>Bac. Abr. title Stat. page </em>648, \u201c is at sometimes to be collected from the cause or necessity of making a statute. At other times from other circumstances. Whenever this (intention) can be discovered, it ought to be followed with reason and discretion in the construction of the statute, <em>although sueh construction seem contrary to the letter of the statute.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-8\">Whenever any words of a statute are obscure or doubtful, the intention of the legislators, is to be resorted to in order to find the meaning of the words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">\u201c A thing which is within the intention of the makers of a statute, is as much within the statute, as if it were within the letter.\u201d <em>Bac. Abr. title Stat. page </em>648.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>That the word \u201c liquor \u201d in the expression, \u201c it shall be sufficient to describe the <em>liquor </em>sold, as Ardent Spirits,\u201d includes the <em>compound </em>as well as the <em>simples, </em>is also ascertained by the language used in the section, viz : \u201c that in <em>all </em>indictments &amp;c. not,in <em>those indictments </em>which hereafter are found for selling the wine, the rum, the gin <em>&amp;c.\u201d </em>\u2014 ^numerating the simples.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-4\">Again, the words, \u201c in <em>all </em>indictments hereafter found upon this act,\u201d mean that can be found in virtue of this act, that is to say, that in every offence against this act, the offence of selling the \u201c composition \u201d as well as the several simple liquors enumerated, it shall be sufficient to describe them or either of them by the name of \u201c Ardent Spirits.\u201d Then for the purpose of the objection and argument, we have a.right to presume, that the \u201c Ardent Spirits \u201d spoken of in the indictment, means the \u201c composition mentioned in the act; and if the \u201c composition,\u201d should it not have been averred in the indictment, that it was not compounded and intended to be used as a medicine? Certainly, for it is not for the sale of every composition, that a man can be indicted: for the composition that is compounded and intended to be used as a medicine is excepted, and a person may sell such : and unless it is averred, the said \u201c composition \u201d (or as the act now permits the description,) that the said \u201cArdent Spirits\u201d was not or had not been compounded and intended to be used as a medicine, it is defective according to the irresistible current of authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">In <em>Palmer\u2019s </em>case, <em>Leach </em>120, it was not all milled money the putting off of which, was a felony by the statute of William III, but only such as was unlawfully diminished and <em>not cut in pieces; </em>the indictment did not charge or aver, that it had not been cut in pieces, and it was holden bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">As to the strictness required to be pursued in framing indictments upon statutes, see <em>Chitty Crim. Law, page </em>282, <em>et passim.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">As \u201c Ardent Spirits\u201d is description of a composition as well as a simple, for the purpose of argument, it may be presumed to be a \u201c composition \u201d which the defendant is charged with having sold, and, if so, it should be averred, that it was not or had not been compounded and intended to be used as medicine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">A conviction for any offence, enacted by statute must negative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>every </em>exception contained in the clause creating the offence. 8th <em>Term.

Law, </em>283; 1 <em>Burrows, </em>148; 2 <em>Burr. </em>1037; 1 <em>East, </em>646, in notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-11\">Where the excuse is given under a <em>proviso, </em>it is not necessary to negative it, but when it is in the <em>purview </em>or enacting clause, it must be negatived, 1 <em>Chitty Crim Law, </em>283; 1 <em>Levina R. </em>26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-12\">The words \u201cor any composition,\u201d excepting such \u201cas shall be compounded or intended to be used as medicine,\u201d are in the purview or enacting clause, and do not come in by way of <em>proviso ; </em>as is the case of the time when prosecution shall be commenced under this act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-13\">In a conviction on the game act in England, it must be particularly and <em>negatively </em>specified, that the defendant had not any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>of the qualifications, 1 <em>Burr. </em>148. Lord Mansfield. It is now settled by the uniform - course of authorities, that the qualifications must be negatively set out.

So the case in 2d <em>Lord Raymond, </em>1386.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">There is a great difference however, between the necessity of <em>alleging </em>the negative, and of <em>proving </em>it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\">The rule of pleading is more strict in <em>indictments </em>than in <em>civil actions. </em>Yet it is holden, that in a prosecution for a penalty on the 19th <em>George 2d chap. </em>30, for impressing a mariner in the West India Trade, the <em>declaration must aver </em>the negative, that he had <em>not </em>deserted from any of His Majesty\u2019s <em>Ships </em>of War.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-9\">Objection to a conviction for unlawfully taking and killing fish, in that it did not allege defendant had not the license or consent of the owner, and the conviction quashed on the objection. 2d <em>Burrows, </em>679, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Mallinson. \u201c </em>It may be his own fish or his own pond.\u201d Says Lord Mansfield in giving his opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-10\">For aught that appears upon this indictment, (and we have a right to presume it,) it may be the composition spoken of in the act; and if so, for aught that appears to the contrary, it may have been compounded and intended to be used as a medicine, and if so it ought to have been averred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-11\">It was even doubtful whether you must not negative by evidence also, the want of the qualifications to kill game. 1 <em>East R. </em>637 <em>The King </em>v. <em>Stone.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-12\"><em>Indictment </em>for not repairing a highway, charging the corporation of Liverpool with a prescriptive liability to repair all common highways within certain limits; <em>excepting </em>such as ought to-be-repaired according to the several statutes in such case made and provided, is bad for <em>not averring, </em>that the highway in question <em>was not </em>within any of the exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-13\">The prosecutor has acknowledged the rule by averring, that the defendant had no license &amp;c. The language of the act is the same, as if it read thus, <em>\u201c </em>It shall not be lawful for any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>to sell \u201cArdent spirits \u201d &amp;c. excepting he have a license for that purpose, <em>&amp;o. </em>If such were the words, it would be necessary to aver, that the defendant had not a license &amp;c. 1 <em>Term. Rep </em>144, (137 in some editions.) As was said by Lord Mansfield in the case of <em>Spiers </em>v. <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7E\">It is not always sufficient to allege even the exact words of a statute \u2014 as in the case of a declaration on the statute against robbing an orchard; although the act contains the words \u201c if any person rob an orchard, he shall &amp;e.\u201d yet it must be further alleged of what, or how the orchard was robbed. 1 <em>East. Rep. </em>647, in notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\">In the present indictment, the words, \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d being in law a sufficient description of the composition, it may be presumed to be the composition : or in other words, it will not be presumed to be the simple liquor; and if the composition, or if not the simple, without a negative of the exception, it may be presumed to be the exception, for \u201c <em>omnia proesumunter legitimi facta, donee probetur in contrarium. Injuria non preesumitur.\u201d </em>And upon this presumption, the case in 1 <em>Term. Rep. </em>137, (or 141 in some editions) <em>Spiers </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>is directly in point; where Lord Mansfield says, \u201c this being after verdict, it is only necessary to prove at the trial, what is alleged in the declaration; and here it is only alleged, that these mariners had not deserted from the <em>Diamond; </em>therefore we cannot presume, that in this case, it was proved that these men had not deserted from <em>any </em>of His Majesty\u2019s Ships.\u201d So also the opinion of Bailer, Justice \u201cas to its being intended after verdict, nothing is to be presumed, but what is expressly stated in the declaration, or what is necessarily implied from those facts, which are stated &amp;c. See also in 4 <em>Term. Rep. </em>472, <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Hayward. </em>Opinion of Justice Buller. See also 2 <em>Burrows, </em>681 and 682, opinion of Lord Mansfield, \u201c it may be his own pond or his own fish, for any thing that appears to the contrary.\u201d Opinion of Justice Denison, \u201cIt does not appear, that the fish he killed, were <em>not </em>his <em>own </em>or killed in his own ponds.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-8\">And in this ease it may with the same force'be said, it does not appear, that the \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d or (as we may presume it was a composition,) that the composition was not compounded and intended to be used as medicine. Or in the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Lord Mansfield, for aught that appears to the contrary in this indictment, it <em>may </em>be a composition compounded and intended to be used as a medicine; and if so, the defendant is improperly convicted. And it would be a good reason in arrest of judgment: if so, the indictment, for the same reason may be quashed. 4 <em>Halst. </em>296, <em>State </em>v. <em>Richey. </em>Argument of Counsellor Halsted and opinion of Justice Drake. 1 <em>Harrison\u2019s Rep. </em>133, <em>Farwell et al. </em>v. <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-5\">But it may be answered, that admitting the rules of pleading to have been so settled, yet this section of the law was intended to abrogate it, and make it a sufficient <em>description </em>of the offence, to describe the liquor sold as Ardent Spirits, without negativing the exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">But such is not the case. The statute only intended to help or aid the <em>description </em>of the <em>liquor </em>sold, and not of the <em>offence </em>created by the previous section of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\">It does not say, that in all indictments hereafter found upon this act, it will be a sufficient <em>description </em>of the <em>offence, </em>to charge the party with having sold \u201cArdent Spirits <em>\u201d </em>contrary to the statute \u2014 but simply, that when you charge a party with an unlawful selling, it shall be a sufficient description of the <em>liquor </em>sold, to call it \u201cArdent Spirits.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\">The Legislature never intended to alter, modify, or destroy, that well established and most reasonable rule of pleading, which in the like cases require the negativing of all exceptions in-the enacting clause creating the offence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-9\">There was no reason for it, and if no reason, there could never have been intended such a law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-10\">It may be objected to the above argument, that inasmuch as in an indictment for selling a composition, it is necessary not only to aver of what it is composed, (that the Court may take notice from the record or indictment whether it be a composition or not,) but also which particular liquor shall form the chief ingredient. The indictment will present the following or somewhat like ridiculous description of the offence, viz : that A. B. on such a day, at &amp;c. without license &amp;e. unlawfully did sell or cause or knowingly permit to be sold, &amp;c. &amp;c. certain Ardent Spirits, then and there compounded of Ardent Spirits (and whatever else it may be) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>of which, Ardent Spirits did then and there form the chief ingredient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-5\">But a simple reference to two particular words of the fourth section will dispel this apparent incongruity \u2014 the words, \u201c kind or description thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">Before the sixth section was passed, it was doubtless necessary to aver of what the composition was made, and also the particular liquor which formed the chief ingredient. So also, in the ease of selling mixed liquors, I apprehend it would have been necessary for the prosecution to specify the simples comprising the mixture, that the Court might take cognizance from the indictment itself, whether they were such liquors mixed, as the selling thereof constituted the offence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">But the language of the sixth section is so definite and expressive, that it is impossible to resist its force. \u201cIt shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, (whether simple, compound, or mixed,) as \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d and not only so, but also without specifying particularly the <em>hind, </em>(referring to the simple,) or <em>description </em>thereof; (referring undoubtedly to the composition and mixed liquors).</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-8\">You need not specify the \u201c particular kind \u201d of simple liquor, nor give a \u201cparticular description\u201d of the composition or mixed liquors, is in effect the language of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-9\">It shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, \u201c whether simple, compound or mixed,\u201d as \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d without <em>specifying </em>particularly the \u201c kind \u201d of simple liquor and without giving a particular description of the composition or mixed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-10\">\u201c Description \u201d cannot be predicated of a simple; but \u201c kind \u201d can. \u201c Kind \u201d cannot be predicated of a compound or mixture, but \u201c description \u201d may.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-11\">On the second point, see <em>Chitty Crim. Law. </em>289-292; <em>Yelv. </em>116; <em>Arch. Crim. Pl. </em>54, bottom.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\">The opinion of the Court, delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b333-13\">Hoksblower, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFO\">This is an indictment for selling <em>\u201cArdent Spirits, </em>by less measure than one quart, without license &amp;.e\u201d and it concludes, <em>\u201c </em>against the form of the statutes,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">Two exceptions are taken to this indictment: First, that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>does not aver, that the Ardent Spirits sold, had not been compounded and intended to be used as a medicine: and Secondly, that it concludes, against the <em>statutes: </em>when in fact there is now, but one statute on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">It is time the principal question in this case should receive a quieting answer from this court. \u25a0 It has been frequently raised before the court of Oyer and Terminer, and the Quarter Sessions of the Peace of the several counties, and has received differen-t, and sometimes contradictory answers: and I'have lately perceived, that indictments have been drawn differently in different counties, according to the opinions, or the caution of the different prosecutors. I think the statute admits of a plain and easy construction, and the question propounded, susceptible of a simple and satisfactory answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">By analyzing the statute and considering its different parts, we shall see its meaning and the intention of the legislature. To do that, I need not incumber this opinion with a copy of the act, but will proceed to state the substance of its enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">1. In the first place it forbids the sale of wine, gin, rum, brandy, whiskey, cider spirits and all other kind of <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>by a less quantity than one quart, without a license &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">2. It prohibits the sale by a less quantity than one quart, of any \u201c <em>composition \u201d </em>of which wine, or any of the liquors above mentioned, shall form the chief ingredient, <em>except </em>such as shall be compounded and intended to be used as a medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">3. It prohibits the sale of any \u201c <em>mixed liquors \u201d </em>by a less quantity than five gallons.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao7\">Here there are three distinct offences- created by the statute. An indictment for the first offence, (in the order above stated,) must charge, that the defendant, without license first had and obtained for that purpose, sold, by a less quantity than one quart, to wit: so much wine, rum, gin, brandy, whiskey or cider spirits, naming the liquor according to the fact: or to avoid the danger of being defeated on the trial by failing to prove the kind of liquor named in the indictment, the prosecutor under the <em>remedial </em>provision of the sixth section of the act, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>249, may charge the defendant with selling \u201cArdent Spirits \u201d by a less quantity &amp;c. and without license. To support such an indictment, the prosecutor must prove, that the defendant sold the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>cise kind of liquor named in the indictment; or if the indictment is for selling \u201cArdent Spirits,\u201d he must prove on the trial, fhat he sold one of the simples named in the statute, viz: Wine, rum, gin, brandy, whiskey or eider spirits.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In an indictment for the second offence, the defendant must be charged with selling by a less quantity than one quart, \u201ca composition,\u201d not compounded and intended to be used as a medicine, of which wine, gin, rum, brandy, whiskey or cider spirits, formed the chief ingredient; specifying which of those simples prevailed in the composition, and such an indictment must be proved as laid, or the defendant cannot be convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The third offence consists in selling \u201c mixed liquors \u201d by a less measure than <em>Jive </em>gallons; and whatever may be meant by the term \u201c mixed liquors,\u201d the indictment must be for selling \u201cmixed liquors\u201d by the name, by which the particular mixture is generally known. An indictment in the words of the statute,, viz: for selling \u201c mixed liquor,\u201d would not in my opinion, be sufficient. <em>\u201c </em>Liquor,\u201d the dictionary informs us, means any thing liquid; but milk and water, or water and vinegar, or tea and coffee, are liquors, and may be <em>mixed; </em>and when mixed, are mixed liquors. The legislature did not mean to prohibit the sale of such mixtures by a less quantity than five gallons; they no doubt intended to forbid the sale, by unlicensed persons of a mixture of intoxicating drinks, in a less quantity than five gallons. In my opinion therefore, an indictment under this clause of the statute, must show what the mixture was composed of, and that it consisted of some one or more of the different kinds of Ardent Spirits or intoxicating liquors mentioned in the statute. And I am further of opinion that to support such an indictment, the prosecutor must prove the facts as laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In opposition to all this, it has been ingeniously and laboriously argued by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that by force of the sixth section of the statute, in <em>all </em>indictments found under it, \u201c it shall be sufficient to describe the liquor sold, as <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>without specifying particularly, the kind or description thereofAnd hence he argues, that in all indictments, the prosecutor should state, that the liquor or the ardent spirits sold, had not been compounded or intended to be used as a medicine. No doubt, if his main proposition is right, he is right also in his conclusion. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>if a man may be indicted for selling a <em>composition </em>by the name of <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>the indictment ought to aver, that it had not been compounded and intended for a medicine; since the statute excepts from its prohibition, the sale of any composition, prepared and intended to be used as a medicine. It is a well settled rule, and the cases cited by defendant\u2019s counsel fully establish it, that an exception, in the description of an offence, created by statute, is different from a proviso, which exempts from the penalty under certain circumstances. In the former ease, the absence of that matter, or the non-existence of those facts, the absence or non-existence of which, is necessary by the statute, to constitute the offence, must be averred in the indictment; or rather, their existence must be negatived. But the latter being mere matter of excuse or defence, need not be negatived in the indictment, but must be proved by the defendant if he would nave the benefit of it. It is upon this principle, that indictments under this statute have always, so far as I know, contained the clause \u201c not having first obtained a license.\u201d ' If on the contrary, after prohibiting the sale of Ardent Spirits by the small measure, the statute had annexed a proviso, that a person having a license; or under the age of twenty-one years, should not be liable to conviction and punishment, a license or minority, would be matter of defence to be shown by the defendant. The following among others are cases showing and illustrating this distinction, viz: <em>Spieres </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>141; <em>Palmer\u2019s case, Leach C. C. </em>120; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Jukes et al. </em>8 <em>T. R. </em>542; 1 <em>Saund. </em>262 in note; <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Scrivens, </em>7 <em>T. R. </em>27; 1 <em>Str. </em>66, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Sparling; Id. </em>497, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Ford; Id. </em>555, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Pratten; </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>559, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>James, </em>1 <em>Burr. R. </em>153; 1 <em>T. R. </em>145, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Stone; </em>1 <em>Fast, </em>646 in note; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Brian, </em>2 <em>Str. </em>1101; 1 <em>Chitt. Crim. Law </em>283; 1 <em>Burr. </em>153; 15 <em>East, </em>456; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hill, 2 Ld. Raym. </em>1415; <em>Id. </em>1386; 1 <em>T. R. </em>127; 4 <em>Id. </em>472; 2 <em>Burr. </em>681.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">But it is a mistake to suppose, that <em>all </em>indictments under the statute, must, or may be, for selling Ardent Spirits. There is no rule of construction better settled, than that general words, may be restrained to meet the particular intent of the legislature. Now what was that intent? We all know the history of legislation upon this subject. Under the original statute, it was necessary to specify in the indictment, when a man was indicted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>selling wine, or any kind of ardent spirits, whether it was wine, rum, gin, brandy, whiskey or ciders pirits. The consequence was, that prosecution often failed, by reason of the bad memory or worse morals of the witnesses, who could not tell the difference between gin and brandy; or could not remember, which it was, they had bought and drank. And no doubt too, mistakes were often made in charging the liquor sold to be one kind, when in fact it was another. This difficulty never arose on indictments found for selling compositions or mixtures ; but only on indictments for selling some of the specified liquors. It was then to remedy this difficulty upon indictments under the first clause of the statute, that the sixth section was introduced into the present act. We must then understand that section as meaning no more than that, in <em>all </em>indictments, for selling wine or any of the simple liquors mentioned in the statute, it shall he sufficient to describe the liquor sold, as Ardent Spirits. But again, the application of this section to the second and third clauses of the statute, would lead to absurdity, and this is another reason for restraining the word \u201call\u201d in the manner suggested. Suppose, for instance, we substitute the word \u201cArdent Spirits\u201d for the word \u201c Composition,\u201d in the second clause of the statute; how will the indictment read? For selling <em>Ardent Spirits </em>of which rum, or gin, or brandy <em>\u2022 or </em>of which <em>Ardent Spirits, </em>was the chief ingredient.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">But it is said, the indictment should be for selling <em>a composition, </em>of which \u201cArdent Spirits\u201d formed the chief ingredient. That however, would not be a compliance with the statute. The statute authorizes us to call \u201cthe liquor sold\u201d Ardent Spirits; not the chief ingredient of the liquor sold. But the impropriety of extending the application of the sixth section to <em>all </em>indictments under this statute, is more palpable, when considered in reference to the third offence created hv the act; that prohibits the selling of mixed liquors, by a less quantity than five gallons, without a license. The indictment then, would charge the defendant with selling Ardent Spirits, by a less measure than five gallons. And yet we have no law forbidding the sale of Ardent Spirits by the quart, the half gallon, the gallon or by any quantity, not less than a quart. The indictment then, would charge the defendant with no offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>In my opinion therefore, the word \u201call\u201d in the sixth section must be restricted to all indictments found under the act for selling any of the simple, unmixed liquors named in the act: that indictments upon the second clause of the act, must be for selling a composition, not compounded or intended to be used as a medicine, the chief ingredient of which, is Ardent Spirits, or one of the simple liquors mentioned in the act naming it. And that indictments upon the third clause of the act must be for selling a mixed liquor, commonly called so, whatever its appropriate name may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">As to the conclusion of the indictment, against \u201c the statutes,\u201d I think there is nothing in the objection. In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 <em>M. </em>and <em>S. 553, </em>cited in 10 <em>Petersd. Abr. </em>485, in margin, the. court said, the conclusion of an indictment forms so material a part of it, that for any defect in it, the indictment is ill. And yet in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Matthews, 5 T. R. </em>152; and in <em>Rex v. Bathurst, Sayr. R. </em>225, it was held that if the indictment was good at the common law, the contra formam statuti, might be rejected. And see <em>The State v. Berry, </em>4 <em>Halst. R. </em>374. So it has been held, that an indictment concluding against \u201c the statute \u201d when in fact it was against two statutes, was good; and I do not see why a conclusion against the statutes, when there is only one statute, should not be equally good. And I understand it has been so decided by Mr. Justice Story, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert et al. </em>3 <em>Sumn. Cir. C. R. </em>88; 2 <em>Peters\u2019 Dig. </em>447, <em>sec. </em>51.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Both objections must be overruled, and judgment given for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>Motion to quash denied. Judgment for the State,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Cited <em>in State </em>v. <em>Dayton, </em>3 <em>Zab. </em>61.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
