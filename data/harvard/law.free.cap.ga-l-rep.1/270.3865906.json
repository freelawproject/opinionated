It differs from that in 70 Ga., 825, where the facts were doubtful, and the accused might have suffered injury from the failure of the court to charge the law as to reasonable doubts. In a case like the present, if the defendant desires a charge on that subject, he should request it.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
