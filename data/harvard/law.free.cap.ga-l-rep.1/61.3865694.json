Section 3583, of the Code, which provides that, \u201cwhere a money judgment shall hereafter be rendered against any defendant who, at the time suit is begun, does not reside in the county where it is instituted, the property of such' non resident defendant which is situated at the time of the judgment without such county shall, so far as affects <em>bona fide </em>purchasers for value without actual notice of the judgment, not be bound by such judgment, unless the owner of said judgment shall, within three months of the final rendition of the judgment, have his <em>fieri faoias </em>entered upon the execution docket in the office of the Superior Court of the county where such defendant resided at the date of the judgment,\u201d has reference to general judgments against the defendant and all his property, and not to a judgment <em>inrem, </em>enforcing against certain land a charge created thereon by the will of the former owner.
