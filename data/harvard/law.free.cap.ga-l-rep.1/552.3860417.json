The indictment contained three counts, and in each of them a conviction of a' former offense of like character was set out in order to make the offense by it charged a second offense, and to be punished accordingly. After the testimony was closed, and the case had been argued and submitted to the jury, before retiring for consultation, the jury asked the court whether they could find a verdict for a first offense. In reply, the court instructed the jury \u201cthat under the indictment, they could only find a verdict of guilty of a second offense.\u201d To this instruction of the court exception was taken, which presents the sole question for consideration. The record shows that the jury found a verdict \u201cof guilty of second offense.\u201d In numerous cases this court has decided that under the act of 1872, c. 316, bills of exception are allowable \u201cin criminal cases\u201d in the like manner and to the same extent as they are allowed in civil cases. Rhinehart cases, 45 Md., 455; Archer\u2019s case, Id. 460; McGrath\u2019s case, 46 Md., 632<em>; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Kearney\u2019s case, Id. 423 , and in' numerous cases in this court, since the act of 1872, c. 316, and since the <em>obiter </em>construction of it in Broil\u2019s case, 45 Md., 356, the court has entertained and passed upon the rulings of the lower court, during the trial, other than upon questions of evidence. Waters vs. State, 51 Md., 435 ; Turpin vs. State, 55 Md., 462; Zimmerman vs. State, 56 Md., 536; Bell\u2019s case, 57 Md., 108. It has uniformly \u2022been held that the jury, under the State Constitution, are judges of both law and fact, and that they are not bound by any instruction the court might choose to give, such instructions being only \u201cadvisory.\u201d Wheeler\u2019s case, 42 Md, 569; For wood\u2019s case, 49. Md., 537; Bloomer\u2019s case, 48 Md., 539. It has never been decided, however, that if the court should, in the exercise of its discretion, instruct the jury, and should instruct them erroneously, and the jury should follow the instructions to the plain injury of the accused, in such case no just ground of reversal would exist upon exception taken to such ruling. In Forwood\u2019s case, 49 Md., 537, the point was made that such ruling was not reviewable ; but the court declined to pass on the question because it was unnecessary, as in their judgment the instruction was proper and the prisoner suffered no injury. Although this court has said that, the jury being judges of both law and fact, the court is not bound to instruct, if asked, and that refusal to instruct is no ground of appeal, yet we are clearly of the opinion that if the court does instruct the jury, and does so <em>erroneously. </em>and exception is taken, and the jury have manifestly followed that instruction to the plain injury of the prisoner, he is entitled to have the injury remedied on appeal. In this case, however, we find no ground for reversal. The mistake of the court was clearly in the prisoner\u2019s interest, when the court told the jury that \u201cunder the indictment they could oaly find a verdict for a second offense,\u201d it was equivalent to saying: \u201cIf you cannot, on the proof, find the party guilty of a second offense, you should find him not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Under Maguire\u2019s case, 47 Md., 498, he was in error, for they could have found a general verdict of guilty, which would have subjected him to punishment for a first offense. If, therefore, the evidence had not warranted the jury in finding the \u201chistorical fact\u201d of former conviction, they would have found a <em>verdict </em>of not guilty. The court only stated what, in its opinion, was justified by the indictment,.and made acquittal possible, if the jury followed the instruction, notwitanding the jury might believe from the evidence the prisoner guilty, except as to the former conviction. He has clearly suffered no injury, and we shall accordingly affirm. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Ruling affirmed, and case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Note. \u2014 Provisions similar to the Maryland constitutional provision are incorporated in many of the State constitutions and laws. In Indiana the Constitution makes the jury the exclusive judges of the law and evidence in criminal cases; but a statute declares that the court shall charge the jury and state \u201call matters of law necessary-for their information in, giving their verdict.\u201d In one casein that State.the trial court charged the jury as follows : \u201cYou are the exclusive judges of the evidence, and may determine the law. It is as much your duty to believe the law as charged to you by the court as it is your sworn duty to determine the evidence.\u201d This was\u2019 held erroneous, the court saying: \u201cEvidently it was not, in the sense of the instruction, their duty to believe the law as charged by the court \u2014 otherwise they could have had no right to determine it themseves. The instruction cannot be sustained. But we have a statute which requires the court in its charge-to the jury in criminal 'cases, to state \u2018all matters of law necessary for their information in giving their verdict.\u2019 It is insisted that this enactment conflicts with the constitution ; but we are not of that opinion\u00bb It simply confers upon the court an advisory power \u2014 directs the judge to inform the jury as to the law of the case ; and though it may be their duty to respect and give due consideration to the opinion of the court on questions of law applicable to the facts proved, still the statute does not, either in terms or by implication, deprive the jury of their right, under the constitution, to determine the law.\u201d Williams vs. State, 10 Ind., 503 ; Daily <em>vs. </em>State, 10 Ind., 536, (overruling <em>dictum </em>in Driskill <em>vs. </em>State, 7 Ind., 339; Carter <em>vs. </em>State, 2 Ind., 617, and Townsend <em>vs. </em>State, 2 Blackf. (Ind.) 151; Warren <em>vs. </em>State, 4 Blackf. (Ind.) 150. (Under the decision quoted from, Rice <em>vs </em>State and Stocking <em>vs. </em>State, 7 Ind., 326, 332, are qualified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">So, where the court said to the jury that \u201cthe jurors are not authorized to make a law for each case, but must decide it according to the law as it is. If the court instruct the jury fully and truly as to the law, the jurors must be governed by the instructions. If the court does not do this, the jury may disregard the instructions,\u201d it was held error and sufficient to reverse the c\u00e1se. McDonald <em>vs. </em>State, 63 Ind., 544; see Nuzum vs. State, 88 Ind., 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">A refusal to instruct the jury that they are the exclusive judges of the law and the facts is held erroneous in that State. McCarthy <em>vs. </em>State, 56 Ind., 203; McCullough <em>vs. </em>State, 10 Ind , 276; Powers vs. State, 87 Ind., 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">And if the court misdirect the jury in a matter of law the charge of the court is presumed to control their minds to some extent in deciding the case and arriving at a verdict \u2014 so much so is this presumed that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>if the court\u2019s instructions relate to a material matter of law the misdirection is good ground for reversal. Glem <em>vs. </em>State, 42 Ind., 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">In Indiana the jury is not even bound by the decisions of the supreme court as to what the law is. Keiser <em>vs. </em>State, 83 Ind., 234. And an instruction that they are bound by those decisions until overruled is erroneous. Fowler <em>vs. </em>State, 85 Ind., 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">So, in Indiana, an instruction to the jury as follows: \u201cYou have-no right to determine the question whether the facts stated in the indictment constitute a'public offense, or to determine the sufficiency of the indictment. If the'facts stated in the indictment are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, you must convict,\u201d was held erroneous. Hudelson <em>vs. </em>State, 94 Ind., 426; S. C., 5 Crim. L. Mag , 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In Pennsylvania the court was divided upon the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury that they \u201care the judges of the law and the fact,\u201d Kane <em>vs. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Crim. L. Mag., 47; S. C., 89 Pa. St., 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In Illinois a charge that the jury must accept it as the law, unless they can say on their oaths that they are better judges of the law than the court, was held proper. Mullinex <em>vs. </em>People, 76 Ill., 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">And in Louisiana the jury may be told while they have the power they have no moral right to reject the opinion of the court. State <em>vs. </em>Tally, 23 La. Ann., 677; and the same rule is followed in Georgia. M\u2019Math <em>vs. </em>State, 55 Ga., 303 ; Blaisdell\u2019s trial, Id., 54; Robinson <em>vs. </em>State, 66 Ga., 517; People <em>vs. </em>Mortimer, 48 Mich., 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">So it is held that the court has the power to prevent counsel arguing that the law is not such as the court declares it is. Bell <em>vs. </em>State, 45 Md., 356; S. C., 2 Crim. L. Mag., 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">See, generally, State <em>vs. </em>Kirkwood, 19 N. W. Rep., 660; Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Moore, 2 Chest.
