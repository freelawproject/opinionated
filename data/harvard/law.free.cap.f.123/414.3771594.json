Three alleged acts of bankruptcy are set forth in the petition. As to two of them the facts averred are not made out by the proofs. The third charge is that, while insolvent, and within the statutory four months, an action was instituted by one partner against the other, in which, upon the application of the one and the consent of the other, a receiver was appointed, all \u201cwith intent to hinder, delay, and defraud their creditors.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>F.

S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3422] relied upon reads: \u201cActs of bankruptcy by a person shall consist of his having (1) conveyed, transferred, concealed, or removed, or permitted to be concealed or removed, any part of his property with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, or any of them.\u201d The section also contained a clause enumerating, as an act of bankruptcy, the making of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors. It did not provide for receiverships. Since then the act has been amended by the act of 1903, and the specific case provided for in these words: \u201cOr, being insolvent, applied for a receiver or trustee for his property or because of insolvency a receiver or trustee has been put in charge of his property under the laws of a state, of a territory, or of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Inasmuch as the disposition of future cases involving the question raised here has been thus settled by Congress, it seems unnecessary to set forth at length the reasons which have induced us to concur with the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The decree is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
