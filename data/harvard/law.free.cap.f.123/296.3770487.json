S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1630]. The relevant paragraph is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">\u201c(57) Zinc, oxide of, and white paint or pigment containing zinc and not containing lead, dry, one cent per pound; ground in oil, one and three-fourth cents per pound; sulfid of zinc white, or white sulphide of zinc, one and one-fourth cents per pound; chloride of zinc and sulphate of zinc, one cent per pound.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">The specific name of the merchandise is \u201clithofone.\u201d It is, when dry, a white pigment, and, when ground in oil, a white paint, \u201ccontaining zinc and not containing lead,\u201d and its sole use is as a paint or pigment. It is composed of about 70 per cent, of sulphate of barytes and 30 per cent, of sulphide of zinc. The latter, therefore, cannot be considered as the main ingredient, nor as the component of chief value. It was contended, however, and such contention was found persuasive by the board of general appraisers and by the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>cuit court, that the phrase \u201csulphide of zinc white,\u201d as known in trade and commerce, included this and similar compounds, whose more specific designations are \u201cBeckton white,\u201d \u201cOrris white,\u201d \u201cCharlton white,\u201d etc. A careful examination of the record leads us-to the conclusion that the testimony as to commercial designation is not only conflicting, but also so closely balanced as to make it difficult to say on which side lies the weight of evidence. Under these circumstances, the finding of the board of appraisers, which had-.very many of the witnesses before it, will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">It is contended'by the importers that, in view of the fact that pure sulphide of zinc is never used as a paint or pigment, while the merchandise imported is only so used, should control the classification of .the latter. There is some force to the argument adduced from the other sections of the same schedule, that Congress, whenever it refers to paints or pigments, recognized a distinction between the dry pigment and the same ground in oil, and thus made into a paint. Blues, such as Prussian, etc., boneblack, ivory black, chrome yellow, chrome green, ocher, sienna, vermilion, red, and other colors in this-schedule, are referred to as \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cground in oil or water,\u201d and in some instances are subject to a higher rate of duty in the latter condition. See paragraphs 45, 47, 48, 49, 54, 55, 56, 58, Act July 24, 1897, c. 11, 30 Stat. 153, 154 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, pp. 1629, 1630].</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The evidence shows that lithofone is lithofone whether dry or giound in oil, and if, by commercial designation, it comes within tht clause \u201csulphide of zinc white,\u201d it will pay the same duty, in whichever condition it may come, whereas if it were classified as \u201ca white paint or pigment containing zinc, but not containing lead,\u201d it would-pay a higher rate when ground in oil. \u2019 But the argument is inconclusive, since there are some paints\u2014white lead, for instance (paragraph. 55)\u2014upon which Congress has imposed the same rate for both conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The decision of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
