The testimony as to the accord and satisfaction, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-11\">Deposition of James Davis, that after the note was given, Bradshaw agreed to take cotton at five dollars per hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>pounds, to be delivered at Mr. Hale\u2019s gin, near Douglass, in Nacogdoches county ; did not know when the agreement was made ; his father sent him to tell Bradshaw that the cotton was ready at Mr. Hale\u2019s gin; Bradshaw remarked that would do very well, it was close to where he lived and would answer him as well as the money, turned to some gentlemen and asked if that was not very cheap, and remarked that he had good luck in Texas, that he had got the cotton near where he owed a debt, and that it would answer him as well as money, and that he thought he was doing well to get it; this conversation occurred in Nacogdoches, about Christmas, 1843 ; there was no time when the cotton was to be delivered; it was to be picked cotton, at five dollars per hundred weight; did not know when it was to be delivered ; the cotton was first rate; he hauled it to the gin ; it remained at the gin for Mr. Bradshaw twelve months or more; were nine or ten bales or eleven; part of the cotton at the gin at present; does not know that any person received any of the cotton for Mr. Bradshaw; deposition taken 30th December, 1844.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">Deposition of R. G. Hale, that John Davis offered James Bradshaw nine bales of cotton already baled and two more to be baled as part payment of a note that James Bradshaw held against the defendants; it was at my gin house in May, 1844; the cotton was of fine quality; the cotton was delivered at my gin for James Bradshaw and would have been ready according to Bradshaw\u2019s expectation if my gin had not got broken ; the cotton was not accepted by Bradshaw; he said it had not been delivered according to contract, and the price of cotton had fallen, he did not consider himself bound to take it, that he would rather have a negro in its place; the defendants left the cotton at witness\u2019s house, in his possession, and told him to let Bradshaw have it at five cents per pound and have their note credited with the amount; he offered it to Bradshaw, who replied he was too smart to take it, for he intended to have a negro for the debt; Bradshaw told him that he had sold the cotton he was to get from Da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>vis, at three cents per pound before he bought it, that he had filled the place otherwise, and now he was determined to have one of their negroes for the debt; the cotton offered by John T.

Because the defendants did not use sufficient diligence in defending themselves at law, their only apology for their extraordinary laches is their attorney\u2019s ignorance of law, and his absence when the case was called. Had he chanced to know the law, or happened to have been present when judgment was rendered, even this flimsy excuse could not have been set up. (Floyd v. Jane, 6 Johns. Ch. R. 479; 1 Id. 465.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-10\">3rd. Defendants do not disclose in their injunction bill, a valid legal defence to the action at law, for the doctrine is well settled by the cases ancient and modern, English and American, that an executory accord is no defence. In Paytois case, 9 Coke, 79, it was held that where part of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>cord had been executed, tender of the residue, would not be sufficient to make it a bar to the action, but there must be an acceptance in satisfaction. Cited and approved, 2 H. Bla. 817. In accordance herewith, it was decided by the Supreme Court, North Carolina, (1 Dev. and Batt. 565, 1 U. S. Dig. 43,) \u201c That the plea must state what was given in satisfaction, al- \u201c lege delivery, and expressly aver an acceptance in satisfac- \u201c tion and discharge.\u201d By the Supreme Court of Indiana it was held that, \u201c An accord cannot in any case be pleaded in bar, unless it be executed.\u201d (7 Blackf. 582; 7 U. S. Dig. 12.) So in Kentucky it was held \u201c That the plea of accord, &amp;c., must show that the plaintiff received something valuable.\u201d (3 J. J. Marsh. 497; 1 U. S. Dig. 43.) In New York it was decided that to an action of debt on a bond for the payment of money, a plea averring an agreement by the obligee to accept a surrender of land, mortgaged as collateral security, and a tender of performance by defendant, is not a good bar. (6 Wend. R. 390; 1 U. S. Dig. 43.) They say, \u201cAn accord must be executed.\u201d In 5 N. Hamp. 136, (1 U. S. Dig. 42,) the Court reiterating the language of Faytois case, say \u201c an \u201c accord and satisfaction to constitute a legal bar to the action, \u201c must be full, perfect and complete.\u201d These epithets refer to the satisfaction. It is needless to add that these authorities, utterly demolish defendants3 special answer in the nature of a plea of accord and satisfaction, and leave them without a defence at law, or ground for invoking the aid of a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-5\">4th. The mere plea of tender is not a ground upon which the aid of a Court of Equity can be invoked. Even at law, such pleas are considered <em>strioti </em>juris, and nothing will be presumed in their favor. (3 U. S. Dig. 514.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-6\">The Court erred in setting aside the judgment and granting a new trial. It is well settled that a Court at law has no control over its own judgments after the Term at which they are rendered. It is equally clear that a Court of Equity cannot set aside a judgment or grant a new trial in a case at law. (6 Johns. Ch. R. 479.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The Court erred in overruling the motion of plaintiff in error for a new trial. The evidence did not show a tender of enough cotton picked and baled to pay the debt and the interest that had accrued. It is said to be a well known rule, that the defendant must take care at his peril to tender enough. (Boyden v. Moore, 5 Mass. E. 365; 3 U. S. Dig. 514.) This role applies with greater force to tenders of property than to those of money, for the reason that they are held to extinguish the demand.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-4\"><em>W.

Defendants having a meritorious defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-10\">Our own statute makes any act of plaintiff which amounts to a fraud an exception to the general rule. The circumstances under which plaintiff took his judgment argues anything but fairness upon his part, finding defendants absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>under a misconception of their rights, their counsel absent, takes a judgment by default over a plea showing substantial merits, which upon the trial was fully sustained by the depositions of witnesses then on file.

In support of the ruling of the Court in this particular refer to Smith v. Sherwood, 2nd vol. of Texas Rep. p. 460. An offer to deliver and a refusal to receive are a sufficient compliance-with a promise to deliver specific articles. In further support of this principle, as ruled in the American Courts, refer to 3rd vol. of Johns. Cases, p. 243, Coit and Woolsey v. Houston, opinion delivered by Thompson, Livingston and Kent.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> So written, in the transcript of the record.

That the defendants\u2019 petition for a new trial did not disclose sufficient legal grounds to entitle them to the relief sought. 2nd. That the Court erred in overruling the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the defendants\u2019 plea of accord and satisfaction; and in refusing his application for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In answer to the first of these grounds, it is to be observed, that the sufficiency of the petition was not brought in question in the Court below. \u2022 The exceptions were confined to the supposed insufficiency of the bond, in the several respects indicated ; but the legal sufficiency of the petition does not appear to have been questioned. Had there been exceptions to the petition for the causes now urged; that is, that it did not show, such diligence as the law requires in defending the suit, or in instituting proceedings to obtain a new trial; or that by its averments it appeared that the defendant had his remedy to avoid the judgment by a writ of error, a very different case would have been presented. Or, if there had been a general demurrer to the petition overruled, it would have become necessary to revise the petition on the merits, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>inquire whether it sufficiently appeared by its averments, that the defendant had a good defence to the action. But the defendant, by his silence, having acquiesced in the sufficiency of the petition, and the original cause having been re-tried upon its merits, it is now too late to question the legal sufficiency of the petition, or application on which the new trial was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It is in general true, that where a petition does not show good cause to entitle the party to relief, on the merits of his case, the objection may be taken by motion in arrest of judgment, or on error. But where the petition, as in this case, was in the nature of an application for a new trial, which was granted, without a question having been made as to the sufficiency of the petition, or the propriety of awarding the new trial, the case must stand on appeal from the judgment upon the second trial, as an ordinary case of the grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The judgment of the Court overruling the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the defendants\u2019 plea of accord and satisfaction, presents a.graver'question and one not free from difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u201c It is laid down as a general principle, that accord without \u201c satisfaction is no bar to an action for, or any extinguishment 66 of a debt; that is, that the accord or promise to confer sat- \u201c isfaction must be fully and actually executed and accepted, \u201c in order to afford a defence to such action. But this pro- \u201c position requires much explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u201c Where the accord is to do a thing in satisfaction at a 66 future day, and the act is accordingly done and accepted at \u201c that time, and is in law a sufficient satisfaction, no doubt 66 the original demand will not furnish a right to sue thereon ic after the day on which the satisfaction was rendered, al- \u201c though at the time of the accord, the satisfaction was ex- \u201c ecutory. In this instance there is accord with satisfaction, \u201c and the claim is satisfied and extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">\u201c If the accord, or agreement that satisfaction should be \u201c rendered by the defendant, or a third person, at a future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201c day, be not founded on a new consideration, and be not so \u201c far binding on the debtor as to afford a fresh right of action \u201c to the creditor for its non-performance, an action lies on the cl original demand, even before the time prescribed for ren- \u201c dering satisfaction. Many of the old cases upon the subject \u201c of accord without satisfaction were expressly decided on this \u201cground.\u201d (Chit, on Con. 760 to 762,7th Am. from 3d London Edit.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In the earliest cases on this subject it was held that \u201c Ac- \u201c ceptance of the thing agreed on in these accords is the only \u201c material thing to make them binding.\u201d (Hob. 178; 5 Mod. 86.) Yet in the time of Lord Raymond, it was said, \u201cOf late \u201c it hath been held, that upon mutual promises an action lies, \u201c and consequently, there being equal remedy on both sides, \u201c an accord may be pleaded without execution, as well as an \u201carbitrament.\u201d (Raym. 450; 2 Jones, 158; Tom. L. D. \u201c Acoord.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The general principle, however, undoubtedly is, as stated by Mr. Chitty, that an accord not executed is no bar to a preexisting demand. (3 Johns. Cas. 246, 256; 5 Johns. R. 386; 16 Id. 86 ; 6 Wend. R. 390.) \u201c It is well settled (says Green-leaf,) \u201c that an accord, alone, not executed, is no bar to an \u201c action for a pre-existing demand. And the rule is equally \u201c clear, that the person who is to be discharged is bound to do \u201c the act which is to discharge him; and not the other party.\u201d (2 Greenl. Ev. Sec. 30.) The same learned jurist adds: \u201c Whether an accord, with a tender of satisfaction, is suffi- \u201c dent, without acceptance, is a point upon which the author- \u201c ities are not agreed. It is, however, perfectly clear, that a \u201c mere agreement to accept a less sum in composition of a \u201c debt, is not binding, and cannot be set up in bar of an \u201caction upon the original contract.\u201d \u201c But whether, where \u201c the agreement is for the performance of some collateral act, \u201c and is upon sufficient consideration, a tender of performance \u201c is equivalent to a satisfaction, seems still to be an opSn \u201c question ; though the weight of authority is in the affirm- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201c ative. In one case, which was very folly considered, it was \u201c laid down as a rule, warranted by the authorities, that a \u201c contract or agreement, which will afford a complete recompense to a party for an original demand, ought to be re-u ceived, as a substitute and satisfaction for such demand, and \u201c is sufficient evidence to support a plea of accord and satis- \u201c faction. (Coit v. Houston, 3 Johns. Cas. 249.) Therefore, \u201c where the holder of a promissory note, agreed in writing \u201c with the indorser, to receive' payment in coals at a stipu- \u201c lated price, and they were tendered accordingly, but refused, \u201c the agreement and tender were held to be a sufficient accord \u201c and satisfaction to bar an action on the the note, (same case.) \u201c So, where a man\u2019s creditors agreed to take a composition \u201c on their respective debts, to be secured partly by accept- \u201c anees of a third person, and partly by his own notes, and to u execute a composition deed, containing a clause of release ; \u201c it was held by Lord Ellenborough, that an action for the original debt could not be maintained by a creditor, who had \u201cpromised to come in under the agreement, to whom the ac- \u201c ceptances and notes were regularly tendered, and who re- \u201c fused to execute the composition deed, after it had been ex- \u201c ecuted by all the other creditors ; the learned Judge remark- \u201c ing, that a party should not be permitted to say there is no \u201csatisfaction, to whom satisfaction has been tendered, ae- \u201c cording to the terms of the accord. (Bradley v. Gregory, 2 \u201c Campb. 383.) But it has since been held, in this country, \u201c that a readiness to perform a collateral agreement is not to \u201c be taken for a performance, or as the satisfaction required \u201cbylaw. Russell v. Lytle, 6 Wend. 390.\u201d (2 Greenl. Ev. See. 31.) Of this last case, Russell v. Lytle, it is added, in the note, \u201c But in this case, the decision of the same Court in \u201c Goit v. Houston, many years before, was not cited or ad- \u201c verted to, and the question was decided upon the earliest \u201c authorities. Yet in several of these, the reason why an ac- \u201c cord without satisfaction is not binding, is stated to be, that \u201c the plaintiff has no remedy upon the accord; thus tacitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201c seeming to admit that, where there is such a remedy, the \u201c accord with a tender of satisfaction is sufficient. 1 Roll, \u201c Ab. Tit. Accord, pl. 11, 12, 13 ; Allen v. Harris, 1 Ld. \u201c Raym. 122; Brooke, Ab. Tit. Accord, &amp;c., pl. 6; 16 Ed. 4, \u201c 8, pl. 6. So in Lyman v. Bruce, 2 H. Bl. 317. See, how- \u201c ever, Hawley v. Foote, 19 Wend. 516, where an agreement \u201c to accept a collateral thing in satisfaction, with a tender and \u201c refusal, was held not a good bar.\u201d (Ib. n. 4, 2nd Edit.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In Story on Contracts, (Sec. 982 b. 3d Edit.) it is said, \u201c Whether an accord, with an unaccepted tender of satisfac- \u201c tion, be a sufficient defence, does not seem to be settled. If \u201c the accord be to accept a lesser sum than a debt, in satis- \u201c faction of it, there must be an actual acceptance in order to \u201c constitute a defence to the debt, and a mere tender is insuf- \u201c ficient. Thus, an agreement by creditors to accept fiveshil- \u201c lings six pence in the pound, in full satisfaction of their \u201c claims, was held to create no bar to an action for the full \u201cdebt, there being no consideration to support the agreement. \u201c But where there is a sufficient consideration to support the \u201c agreement, it seems that a tender, though unaccepted, would \u201c be a bar to an action. So, also, where a different mode of \u201c payment from that received by the original claim is substi- \u201c tuted for it by agreement, a tender according to such agree- \u201c ment will be sufficient, if it appear to have been a complete \u201csatisfaction.\u201d And Goit v. Houston, and other cases which will not be found so fully to support the text as does that case, are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The law upon this subject, is thus left by the authorities, in an unsettled and perplexing state of uncertainty and embarrassment. On principle, however, it seems to us, that the reason and equity of the case support the doctrine stated in the extract taken from the text of Story, and in favor of which Greenleaf thinks there is the weight of authority. If the accord is by a valid agreement which will afford a remedy to compel its execution, it is difficult to perceive why a tender of performance should not have the same effect to discharge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>contract in that case as in any other. Yet the case of Coit v. Houston, relied on by counsel for the appellee in this case, appears to be the leading and principal case referred to in the authorities to which we have access, which fully supports that doctrine. That case was decided by a very learned Court, and, as remarked by Professor Greenleaf, was very fully considered, the four Judges who participated in the decision each giving his reasons at length. And though Eadcliff, J. dissented from the judgment, he fully agreed with his brethren that the accord was a valid and binding agreement, and that, for the purpose of effectuating it, \u201c a tender and refusal would \u201c be equivalent to an actual perform an v-, and entitle the ven- \u201c dor to the price, and the vendee to possession of the property \u201c which was the subject of the contract; that an omission or \u201c neglect to accept the article when tendered, is also equiva- \u201c lent to a refusal, and will subject the party in default to the \u201c like consequences.\u201d These (he said) appeared to him to be <em>\u201c </em>plain principles founded in equity, and supported both by \u201c the civil law and the authorities in our own law.\u201d And he rested his dissent on the ground of the want of legal tender; but more especially on the ground that the debtor, by after-wards selling the coal, the subject of the tender, had waived his right to demand the full price for it, and of consequence to have it adjudged a full satisfaction for the debt. On this point, the learned Judge used the following language, which I quote, as pertinent to the case we are considering and as expressive of what seems to me the true view of this branch of the subject. He said : \u201c I consider it as equally clear, that \u201c by force of the contract alone, which was merely executory, \u201c the property was not changed ; but on making the tender, \u201c if it was competent (that is, a legal tender,) the defendant \u201c had an election to consider it changed, and to become the \u201c bailee for the plaintiffs, or to affirm the property to continue \u201c in himself, and demand the difference between its actual \u201c value and the price agreed on. If he elected to consider \u201c the property changed, it would remrmi in his possession at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201c the charge and risk of the plaintiffs, and subject to their di- \u201c rection. He could not, in the character of bailee, dispose of \u201c it for his own benefit. The moment he did so, he treated it \u201c as his own, and affirmed the property to continue in him- \u201c self; and could only demand the difference between the value \u201c and the price which was stipulated.\u201d He proceeds to show that this is in accordance with the rule of the civil law ; and concludes that, \u201c the defendant by the sale and disposition of \u201c the coal subsequent to the tender, determined his election to \u201c consider the property as his own, and cannot afterwards de- \u201c mand the full price for which it was sold to the plaintiff. \u201c He cannot retain the whole property, and at the same time \u201c demand the whole price. He is entitled to recover, in \u201c damages, a sum equal to the difference in value only.\u201d (3 Johns. Cas. 255-6.) The Court do not appear to have disagreed as to the legal principles involved in the discussion; but only as to their application to the facts of the caes then before them. The majority were of opinion that there was evidence of a tender, or what was equivalent to a tender; which amounted to a performance of the accord, or new agreement on the part of the defendant, and was a bar to plaintiff\u2019s right of action on the original contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Mr. Justice Thompson, after reviewing the authorities cm the subject of this defence, concluded by presenting a clear exposition of the law on the subject of the suflieiency and effect of the tender under the new agreement. \u201c Although I do \u201c not think it necessary, (he said,) for the purpose of deter- \u201c mining the present question, to say that, in all cases, a ten- \u201c der and refusal shall be equivalent to actual acceptance; yet \u201c I think it a rule founded in good sense, and one that is not \u201c contradicted by the general tenor of the authorities. Whe- \u201c ther in this case there was a tender and refusal, were ques- \u201c tions for the determination of the jury. And even admit- \u201c ting there was no actual tender, it would not, in my judg- \u201c ment, alter the result. The party to whom it is to be made, \u201chas, undoubtedly, a right to waive that ceremony, and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201c think the circumstances here are fully sufficient to warrant \u201c such an inference. When it is said that a tender and refusal \u201c are equivalent to an actual performance, it is not to be understood that it amounts to an absolute discharge of the \u201cparty from liability on the contract. In the case of a ten- \u201c der of money, it only discharges the subsequent interest and \u201c costs. And in the case of goods, like the present, it only \u201c exonerates the party from responsibility for their safe keep- \u201c ing. But as long as he continues in the possession of the \u201c goods, he will be bound to deliver them on demand. And \u201c if he should dispose of them, he would answer for the avails. \u201c On the whole, I think it a rule fully warranted by the authorities, that a contract or agreement, which will afford a \u201c complete recompense to a party for an original demand, \u201c ought to be received, as a substitute and satisfaction for such \u201c demand, and is sufficient to support a plea of accord and \u201c satisfaction. This appears to me to be a rule founded on \u201c sound principles, and one calculated for the furtherance of \u201cjustice. In the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy must be \u201c upon the agreement for the sale of the coal, in which case \u201c complete justice can be dispensed, according to the true in- \u201c tent and meaning of the parties.\u201d (Id. 248, 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Mr. Justice Livingston rested his opinion on substantially the same ground, that the acts of the parties were equivalent to a tender, and that that amounted to a performance of the new agreement on the part of the defendant. And he supported his opinion by reasons and principles drawn from both the Civil and Common Law authorities.</p>\n<author id=\"b359-6\">Kent, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARS\">was of opinion that, as the coal was ready to be delivered to the plaintiffs, in pursuance of the agreement which they had accepted; as the defendant had repeatedly offered the coal to the plaintiffs, who at one time said they would call the next morning and look at the coal, and at another that they would call and bring it away and send a person to examine it; \u201c from these facts, the jury might infer that the de- \u201c fendant had performed the agreement upon his part, by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201c acceptance on the part of the plaintiffs, and it may be held \u201c that the plaintiffs were properly concluded or estopped \u201c by their own declarations made at the time of the offer, and \u201c their act in pursuance thereof, from denying an acceptance \u201c of the coal.\u201d In the view he took of the case, the defendant became trustee to the plaintiffs; and the acts of the parties were sufficient to give the defendant a right to the note sued on, for the discharge of which the accord was made, and consequently to bar any action the plaintiffs.might bring on the note. (Id. 257, 258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">I have drawn thus largely from the opinions of the eminent Judges who decided the case of Coit v. Houston, because of the conflict of authorities on the question, and its importance as affecting business transactions of common occurrence; and because, they appear to me to contain a clear elucidation of the true principles on which the law, on this perplexed question, should be settled by this Court, as well as the best commentary I can give upon the law as directly applicable to the facts of this case. The only material difference between the facts in this case and in the case of Coit v. Houston, as respects the legal principles determined by the Court in that case, is, that it does not appear what disposition was Anally made of the cotton, the subject matter of the tender. It does appear that two of the defendants, Wiley and William Davis, had cotton baled at the gin where this cotton was delivered, and about the same time, which they removed from the gin; but the cotton tendered to Bradshaw was by the other defendant, John Davis, and it is in evidence that some of it remained at the gin for a year or more; so that it could not have been the cotton which was ginned for and removed by the other defendants. It does not. appear that the cotton delivered for Bradshaw was used or disposed of by the defendants ; or that by any act of theirs, they became responsible to the plaintiff\" for its value. And this disembarrasses the present case of the question on which the Court were divided in the case of Coit v. Houston. For, supposing the tender to have been admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ted, the difference of opinion there was as to what should be the effect of the subsequent sale of the coal by the defendant. On that question, in our practice, there could be, it would seem, no difference of opinion. If it liad appeared that the defendants after having made the tender, had appropriated the cotton to their own use, and thereby elected to affirm the property to remain in themselves, as in the case of the coal, that, on equitable grounds, must have been held an answer to the plea of accord and satisfaction. Clearly, they could, in equity and justice, have claimed no more than an abatement of the debt due upon the original contract, in a sum equal to its reduced value below the price at which the plaintiff had contracted to receive it; or the actual damage they had sustained by reason of his refusal to receive. For it would be plainly inequitable and unjust to permit the defendant to retain the whole property, and at the same time demand the whole price. On the other hand, if the property had depreciated in value and tlfe defendant had sustained injury and loss by reason of the refusal of the plaintiff to receive it, when tendered in accordance with his agreement, it would be equally inequitable and unjust to throw such loss upon the defendant, who had performed the agreement in good faith on his part. And in our practice, there could be no technical or legal difficulty in the way of adjusting and settling the respective rights of the parties growing out of the contract, so as to dispense complete justice in one action.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">But in the present case it does not appear that the defendants elected to consider the property as remaining in themselves. They did not retain the possession of the property, but left it, as appears by the evidence, at the gin, where by the agreement it was to be delivered, and where it remained in the care of a third person, who became bailee for the plaintiff and held the property subject to his risk. The defendants therefore appear to have made their election, as it was undoubtedly their right, to consider the property in the cotton as vested, by the delivery and tender, in the plaintiff; and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>do not appear afterwards to have done any act inconsistent with his right of property. Having rightfully parted with the title and possession of the property, for the benefit of the plaintiff and by his appointment, they cannot be responsible to him for its value. And it is the obvious dictate of reason and justice that they should be held discharged of all liability upon the contract. They must be so held in equity, if not in strictness of law; for if not a legal, there can be no question that these facts showed an equitable satisfaction and discharge of the debt. (Dewees v. Lockhart, 1 Tex. R. 535.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We cannot doubt, that upon the facts, the defendants would have been entitled to relief in equity; and the facts which would afford a ground of equitable relief, must constitute a good defence in bar of the action. This, it is conceived, cannot admit of controversy, whatever opinion may be entertained of the sufficiency of the plea as a plea of accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">It was insisted in argument, that the verdict was not warranted by the evidence; in that the evidence did not show enough cotton tendered to satisfy the debt. There certainly was more than enough cotton delivered at the gin. The weight of the cotton baled was not stated by the witnesses; but we think the jury were warranted by the evidence in finding that the quantity contracted for was delivered according to the contract. The plaintiff did not put his refusal to accept on the ground that there was not enough in quantity of the cotton. Had he done so, greater strictness of proof on that point might have been required.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The new agreement in this case was not the less valid and binding, as between the parties, because not in writing. It was to be performed within less than one year; and it is not pretended that it was within the operation of the statute of frauds. It was made subsequently to the written contract, and was a new, substituted agreement, for the discharge 'Of the written contract; which it was competent to prove by parol testimony. (Chit, on Con. 107-111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In the case of Coit v. Houston it was, in effect, pleaded, that the defendant had tendered the coal and the plaintiffs refused to accept it; and further that he delivered, and the plaintiffs accepted the coal in full satisfaction of the note. Here the plea was simply, that the defendant delivered the cotton in pursuance of the agreement, and demanded the note; and that the plaintiff refused to receive the cotton or deliver up the note. In strictness, the plea, we think, should have shown, what the evidence does show, that the defendants elected to treat the cotton as the property of the plaintiff; that they left it in possession of the proper person as his bailee, and did not retain or resume the possession. These facts show them clearly entitled to demand the delivery up, or cancellation of the note; and consequently, not liable to the plaintiff in an action upon it; and the answer setting out these facts would have shown a good defence in bar of the action. But the defendant was not apprised, by special exceptions to the plea, of the ground of insufficiency relied on, or he might by amendment have obviated the objection. On the authority of Coit v. Houston, we might, perhaps, be warranted in holding the plea legally sufficient. But if the Court erred in holding the plea, on general demurrer, sufficient, it was probably by reason of the fault of the plaintiff in not pointing out wherein it was insufficient, and thus directing the attention of the Court to that point. The plaintiff cannot have been injured by the ruling, as he examined witness touching the disposition of the cotton, and had the full benefit of contesting the validity of the defence in evidence on the trial. And the ruling upon the sufficiency of the plea cannot now be material to the just disposition of the case on the merits; and, consequently cannot afford a ground for reversing the judgment. (McClenny v. Floyd, 10 Tex. R. 519.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The justice of the case is clearly with the defendants. And we may conclude with the observations of Kent, J., in the case of Coit v. Houston, that, \u201c The evidence tended to \u201c the conclusion drawn by the jury ; and as the Court of K. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>B. (2 Term. R. 5) observed, on a like motion for a new trial, \u201c that, as it did not require much penetration to see where \u25a0\u201cjustice lay, they would not exercise their discretion in send- \u201c ing down the cause to be re-tried on a technical objection in \u201cpoint of law.\u201d (3 Johns. Cas. 258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">We may suppose the Court below very properly to have acted upon that view in refusing a new trial; and such an exercise of discretion would not afford a ground of reversal. And on the whole, we are of opinion that there is no error in the judgment and that it be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
