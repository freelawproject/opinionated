Nelson.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b378-8\">Where property is loaned for a definite period, or for a day or two, or a week or two, if it be not returned at the end of the longer period, the lender can sustain an action for the recovery of the property, or, if that cannot be obtained, its value, without a previous demand.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-9\">Appeal from Houston. The plaintiff in the Court below instituted this suit on the 30th August, 1851, to recover of <em>the </em>defendant a wagon and two mules, which property he states he owned and possessed on the 20th day of the same month, \u201c Which said wagon and mules he loaned for a day \u201c or two to the defendant Nelson, who, although the time for \u201c which petitioner loaned him said property has expired, still <em>\u201c </em>withholds said wagon and mules from petitioner; and al- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u201c though he well knows said wagon and mules to be the pro- \u201c perty of petitioner, he has hitherto failed and refused and still \u201c fails and refuses to deliver or return said wagon and mules to \u201c petitioner,\u201d to petitioner\u2019s damage, $900. He prays citation and judgment for the property, or if that cannot be had, its value. To the petition the defendant demurred generally, and set forth as a special cause of demurrer, that \u201c there is no \u201c allegation in said petition, that plaintiff\u2019s intestate ever de- \u201c manded of defendant the property therein demanded and \u201c sued for.\u201d The Court sustained the demurrer, and this action of the Court is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-5\">G. <em>F. </em>Moore, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aml\">The case here is in no respect similar to that of a suit against an agent or factor, where, from the character of the business, there is an implied contract that the defendant is not liable until an account is rendered or a demand made, which seem to be the only cases where a previous demand is necessary to sustain the suit. (Clark v. Moody, 17 Mass. 145, quoted in Mitchell v. McLemore, 9 Tex. R. 153.) And this suit being for the recovery of the specific property and not for its conversion, the principle upon which the actions of trover are grounded are still more clearly inapplicable ; but for the rules to govern us in this case we should rather look to the decisions in actions of detinue, where most clearly a demand would not be necessary to sustain the suit. (2 Str. Ev. 387-8.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">These principles are believed to have been fully and expressly sustained by this Court, in the case of Dunn v. Choate, 4 Tex. 19, which is a case precisely similar in principle to this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">Under the contract of gratuitous loan it is the duty of the borrower to return to the lender, the property loaned, at the end of the time for which it was loaned.

Pl. 594.) In the case of Mortimer v. Brumfield, 3 Mumf. 122, found in 11 U. S. Digest, p. 65, Sec. 11, it was decided that \u201cin detinue, \u201c a general charge that the defendant, though often requested, \u201c&amp;c., is sufficient, without stating a special demand and re- \u201c fusal.\u201d But even this general charge nowhere appears in the petition under examination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">\u201c A mere naked bailee of goods is not liable to an action \u201c for them, at the bailor\u2019s suit, until after a demand and re- \u201c fusal of them.\u201d (Brown v. Cook, 9 Johns. R. 361, cited in 1 U. S. Digest, p. 368, Sec. 5.) \u201cIf the depositor be dead, \u201c the usual notice given by the administrator of his appoint- \u201c ment, calling on all persons indebted to make payment, &amp;c., \u201cis not sufficient demand.\u201d (1 U. S. Dig. p. 368, Sec. 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-8\">In the case at bar the defendant did not come in possession of the goods tortiously, but with the consent of the plaintiff. Erom the petition, it is uncertain when defendant got that possession, and also how long he was to retain the possession. I conclude then, that this is one of the cases where, from the nature of the contract, it is implied that a request must precede the delivery, and consequently that a demand or request to terminate the loan and return the property, was a necessary prerequisite to the commencement of the suit, and therefore the Court did not err in sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-9\">Hemphill, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ablu\">This is an action for the recovery of specific chattels which the plaintiff alleged he had loaned for a day or two to the defendant, and which the said defendant, although the time for the loan had expired, had failed and refused to deliver or return to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The defendant demurred, on the ground that there was no allegation in the petition, that demand had been made of the property sued for. The demurrer was sustained and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">We are of opinion that the judgment, sustaining the demurrer, was erroneous. The plaintiff\u2019s allegations about the loan or the time for which it was made, are not very definite and precise, but they are sufficiently definite to authorize proof of the facts. He alleges property in himself about ten days before the commencement of suit, and that he had made a loan for a day or two, the term for which had expired. The phrase, a day or two, is rather indefinite; but I presume a jury, with the facts before them, would have but little difficulty in determining whether the property had been detained longer than a day or two or not. Whether a demand should be made, in cases of bailment, previous to suit, depends upon the stipulations as to time for the return of the property. The return must be made at the time contemplated in the contract. If the property be detained beyond that period, no demand would be necessary in order to sustain an action for its recovery. It is not one of the obligations of the lender, that he shall at the expiration of the loan go after and bring back his property, but it is the duty of the borrower to restore it according to his stipulations. If no time is fixed for the return, then a demand might be necessary as a prerequisite to the action. In this case it is averred that the time for the loan had expired. If such were the fact, and the demurrer admits its truth, it was the duty of the defendant to have restored the property, and he cannot justify its detention on the ground that no demand was made for its restoration.
