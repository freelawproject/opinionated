(In this case there were other issues.)</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-6\">The note sued on was executed as a forfeit in the event of a failure to run a horse race. Several defences were pleaded, and on trial verdict was for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-7\">The Court charged the jury that \u201c should the jury believe \u201c from the evidence, that the note sued on, was executed for \u201c the purpose of, and put up as, a forfeiture, to accrue in the \u201cevent of not running a contemplated horse race, and they \u201c should believe from the testimony, that such racing is or was \u201can inducement to immorality, breaches of the peace, or \u201c against public policy and the good order of society, then in \u201c such case the note is invalid, and you should find for the de- \u201c fendant.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-8\"><em>Henderson </em>&amp; Jones, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVe\">A statement of facts is not necessary to show the relevancy and materiality of this charge, to the issue, since these appear from the pleadings, and therefore do not come within the rule of Holman v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">As no statement of facts has been sent up with the record, the judgment must be presumed to be correct, and must be sustained. Some of the charges of the Court,1 it is true, are utterly erroneous and subversive of the law of' the land, as repeatedly declared by this Court, but there were substantial grounds of defence, as pleaded, and if these or any of them were supported by evidence, the jury were authorized to find their verdict. Without a statement of facts we have-no evidence that the note sued upon was adduced in evidence, or that there was any proof which would have entitled the plaintiff to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
