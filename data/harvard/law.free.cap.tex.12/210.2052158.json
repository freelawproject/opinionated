How comes the defendant by his attorney and moves the Court to quash the indictment in this cause for the following reasons, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-15\">1st. Because there does not appear to have been any <em>venire facias </em>issued in due form of law as required by the statute regulating jurors. 2d. Because the <em>venire </em>does not require the Sheriff or other officer to summon the persons named in said <em>venire </em>to serve as jurors. 3d. Because the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>who found the bill was not sworn as the statute prescribes, as the records plainly show. 4th. Because there was no District Attorney during the Term of the Court at which said bill was found, legally or constitutionally authorized to hold and exercise said office. 5th. Because there is no venue laid in the first count of the indictment. 6th. Because the return of the Sheriff does not show how it was executed. Motion overruled, defendant excepted. The record stated\u2019that R. B. Hudnall was ordered to act as foreman of the grand jury for the present Term of this Court, \u201c who being called, comes and is sworn \u201c according to the statute to discharge the duties as foreman \u201c of the grand jury, and now come the other members of the \u201c grand jury, who take a like oath.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">'One witness testified that he had seen the defendant play at a game of cards; that he supposed there was money bet upon the game ; that coffee grains were used by the parties playing, to keep the game; that the playing was in the bed-room of defendant, in Smith county, within twelve months of the time of the Court at which the indictment was found ; that the bedroom was separated from the grocery by one room; that he had seen the defendant play two or three games in said bedroom, at which coffee grains, grains of corn, or'nails were used for the purpose of keeping the game. Another witness testified to the same effect, \u201c that it was his understanding that there was money bet on the game;\u201d that the playing was in a room occupied by defendant as a bed-room, all under.one roof, and part of the same establishment, though put up after the other part of the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">The Court charged the jury, that if they found that the defendant played at a game of cards, upon which money was bet, in the grocery, &amp;c., they would find him guilty; they must believe money was bet; that money may be bet without being on the table or in sight,1 as a house-or town lot may be bet on cards, without being on the table or in view ; that the law makes it unlawful to play cards in a grocery, and in any part or room, whether front room or back room, in bar-room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>or bed-room, separated by never so many partitions, it is unlawful to play there. If they found the defendant guilty, they might consider, in assessing the amount of the fine, the testimony as to defendant\u2019s character and occupation as owner of the grocery. The most innocent violator of the statute is fined $10, the most habitual cannot be fined more than $25. Jurors should apportion the fine according to circumstances. To which charge the defendant excepted. The defendant made a motion for a new trial based upon the ruling of the Court on this motion to quash the indictment and the charges of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">The errors assigned were as follows : 1st. The Court erred in overruling the motion to quash the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">2d. The Court erred in charging the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">3d. The Court erred in refusing to grant a new trial as asked for by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-9\">4th. The Court erred in refusing to act upon the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-10\">The indictment was signed by B. T. Selman, District Attorney <em>pro tem.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-11\"><em>S. Reaves, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8-\">I. The motion to quash the indictment ought to have been sustained by the Court.below,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASPW\">1st. Because the paper purporting to be a <em>venire </em>facias, is not such a <em>venire </em>as contemplated by the statute. That law requires that the <em>venire facias </em>shall be in due form, directed to the Sheriff or other <em>\u201c </em>officer, containing the names of the \u201c persons who have been drawn to serve as jurors, and com- \u201c manding him to summon them to appear and serve as jurors \u201cat the next succeeding Term of the District Court,\u201d &amp;c. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1647.) The <em>venire </em>does not require the Sheriff as the law requires it should do ; and consequently is no <em>venire. </em>And if the grand jury were impanneled without a venire, it is not in accordance with law, and therefore their acts as such are voidable at least.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>II. In order that an indictment found by a grand jury should be good, they must be sworn, otherwise a bill found by them would be voidable, if not void of itself. So if they take any other oath than the one prescribed by law. (Arthur v. The State, 3 Tex. R. 403.) When the Legislature undertakes to prescribe the oath which shall be taken, it must be observed. (Ib.) In this case the record shows conclusively that the grand jury that formed the indictment, were not sworn as the law required they should be, but that they were sworn entirely different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-5\">The records of the Term of the Court at which the indictment was found, show the following order and action of the Court, to wit: \u201c Ordered by the Court that R. B. Hudnall act \u201c as foreman of the grand jury for the present Term, who \u201c being called, comes and is sworn according to the statute to \u201c discharge the duties of foreman of the grand jury; and now \u201ccome the other members of the grand jury and take a like \u201c oath.\u201d This is not the oath that the statute requires that the grand jurors shall take. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1653.) If the records showed that the grand jury had been duly or legally sworn, the presumption would have been in favor of the correctness of the oath they had taken; but the record shows that it was disregarded in that respect. (Arthur v. The State, 3 Tex. R. 403.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATX\">III. The District Attorney is an officer of the Court, and in order to make his acts valid and binding, he must be eligible to hold an office under the Constitution and laws of this State. B. T. Selman who was acting as District Attorney, and whose name appears on the indictment as such, was not eligible to hold any office under the Constitution and laws of this State, he not having been a citizen of the State twelve months prior to the time of his qualification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-8\">IV. The indictment is bad for the reason that there is no venue laid in it. It does not charge the offence to have been committed in the county. (Searcy v. The State, 4 Tex. R. 450; 1 Chitt. Cr. Law, 177.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>, V. A new trial should have been granted for various reasons. 1st. Because there is, no venue laid in the first count in the indictment. 2nd. There was no testimony to support the second count. 3rd. There was not sufficient testimony to support either of the counts, there being no witness who testified that there was money bet on the game, but that the witness supposed there was money bet, &amp;c., which is not sufficient evidence to authorize the jury to find a verdict of guilty. (Tuberville v. The State, 4 Tex. R. 128.) The mere supposition of a witness is not sufficient to authorize a conviction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-5\"><em>Attorney General, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmT\">I. Articles 1647, 8, 9 of the Digest, relied on by appellant as sustaining his objections to the <em>venire facias </em>and its execution and return, are clearly only directory to the Clerk and Sheriff, and their deficiencies could at most have been objected to successfully by the persons summoned as jurors, in their exculpation for not attending in obedience to the writ. As between the appellant and the State, they fully accomplished the object of the law, in procuring the attendance of those of whom he was entitled, <em>to </em>form the grand jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">Objections to the regularity of this writ have probably been sustained upon nice grounds, when they furnish the Sheriff authority to select jurors. While, under our law, being only intended to command the Sheriff to summon persons already selected, the same character of objections ought not to be entertained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">II. The 3rd ground of the motion to quash is even more clearly not maintainable. The record shows that the foreman was sworn according to law, and that the rest of the grand jurors \u201ctook a like oath.\u201d Row a \u201c like oath\u201d is not the same, and this exception would not be considered well taken, even in a school house, unless \u201c the school-master was abroad.\u201d The record does not undertake to recite the oath of the foreman, but only states that he was sworn according to the statute; and in saying that the other members of the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201c took a like oath,\u201d it only says that they too took the oatku prescribed for them by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">III. The 4th exception, \u201c that the indictment was signed by \u201c the District Attorney <em>fro </em>tem, has repeatedly been answered; \u201cby this Court, in cases similar to this.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-8\">IY. That there is no venue laid in the first count of the indictment, might well be questioned in point of fact. After-mentioning the county of Smith, as the territory for which \"the grand jury were to inquire of offences, and stating the day on which the playing took place, it says the defendant \u201c did then and there play at a game,\u201d &amp;c. Then and where ? In the county of Smith, which is the only place or venue that had been mentioned. But waiving this answer to this exception, the District Court did not err in not quashing the indictment-on account of it, as there was another count which was good and which was sufficient to save the indictment. (King v. The State, 10 Tex. R. 281.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-9\">V. The 6th objection has been considered under the first-ground of exception to the indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-10\">VI. The 2nd error assigned is \u201c that the Court erred in its-charge to the jury.\u201d This exception merits but little attention. The particular of the charge objected to is that part of it in which the Judge says, \u201c the jury may consider, in assessing \u201c the amount of the fine, the character and occupation of the \u201c defendant as owner of the grocery,\u201d &amp;c. The Judge clearly means that the jury might, in determining the amount of the fine, take into consideration of the fact that the defendant furnished the means and place of playing, that being a place where such playing was illegal, and liquor (the pabulum of\" gaming) was sold. After all, this charge could have had but little influence, as defendant was fined but a small amount over the minimum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-12\">VII. The fourth error assigned, \u201c that the Court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial,\u201d and the 5th, \u201c that the Court erred in refusing to act upon the motion for a new trial,\u201d are not sustained by the record, as it contains no. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>action of the Court in reference to this motion, either in overruling or refusing to consider it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-5\">VIII. Row, admitting that the first count of the indictment is defective, there being no motion for a new trial overruled, we are bound to sustain the verdict and judgment, there being-one good count upon which they can rest. (King v. The State, before cited.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-6\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8B\">Various objections have been taken to the judgment, which would have seemed scarcely deserving of notice, but for the importance which appears to have been attached to them by counsel in argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">It is objected to the <em>venire facias </em>that it is not in due form and does not contain the proper direction to the officer. We are not informed by the argument, and it is not perceived, what words are omitted, or in what the supposed misdirection or informality consists. The writ appears to conform substantially to the statute. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1647.) But if it be defective in form, that manifestly was no ground for quashing the indictment. The only purpose of the writ was to notify' the persons liable to serve as jurors to attend at the time and place appointed for the performance of that service.' When the writ had been executed and returned, it was <em>functus officio. </em>It had performed its office; and if so defective as not to have answered the purpose designed, of giving the persons intended to be summoned, the requisite legal notice, that might be a good excuse for their failure to attend. But there is no pretence that the writ did not fully answer the purpose for which it was intended. A jury was in attendance in obedience to the summons ; no question was made by them as to its legality or sufficiency; and they were the only persons who had the right to object that the notice, which it was the sole purpose of the writ to afford them, was insufficient. If the Sheriff had failed to obey the mandate, and his omission of' duty was in question, he might have objected to its legal sufficiency ; or, if the jurors had been punished for a contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>in failing to obey the summons,, they doubtless might question the legal sufficiency of the service; no one else can.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The objection that the jurors were not duly sworn, is not \u2022supported by the record. The entry does not profess to give \u2022the form of the oath administered, nor was that necessary. It \u2018recites that they were sworn \u201c according to the statute,\u201d &amp;c., which admits no other reasonable inference than that the \u25a0oath prescribed was administered. (Russell v. The State, 10 Tex. R. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">. The objection to the want of signing by a legally qualified District Attorney is disposed of by our opinion in Epps v. The State. (10 Tex. R. 474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The objection that there is no venue laid to the offence charged in the indictment is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">We have inspected the record and see no ground for reversing the judgment. Ro objection was made to the manner in \u25a0which the witnesses testified. The evidence- was sufficient to warrant the finding of the jury. There is no error in the charge of the Court. The conviction was in all respects legal -and correct; and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
