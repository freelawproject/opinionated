However, there are certain requirements which must be met as a prerequisite to granting such leave. Among these requirements are a plaintiffs affidavit of merits containing, <em>inter alia, </em>the reasons for the delay and the facts which warrant the increase <em>(Koi v P. S. &amp; M. Catering Corp., </em>15 AD2d 775) and a physician\u2019s affidavit demonstrating the nature of the injuries and resulting disabilities and the causal relationship between these disabilities and the original injury <em>(Germinario v Seatrain Lines, </em>81 AD2d 540).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Since plaintiff submitted neither an affidavit of merits nor an affidavit of a physician in support of her motion, containing \"sufficient factual and medical support * * * to afford the court an opportunity to render an informed determination that the original amount demanded is now insufficient and that a re-evaluation is necessary\u201d <em>(Brennan v City of New York, </em>99 AD2d 445, 446), the Supreme Court erred in granting her motion to amend the complaint.
