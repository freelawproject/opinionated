Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol., 1988 Cum.Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 539(a). Under \u00a7 543(d) of the Insurance Code, however, the PIP benefits are to be reduced by the amount of benefits the recipient \u201chas recovered ... under workmen\u2019s compensation laws.\u201d The question before this Court is whether a provision in a motor vehicle insurance policy providing for a reduction in PIP benefits by the amount the insured may be entitled to recover in the future under \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation law\u201d is valid in light of the above statutory provisions. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">The facts are not in dispute. On September 6, 1985, Tina Harness Gable, while in the course of her employment, was injured in an automobile accident. Ms. Gable filed a claim with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission in September 1985. She did not pursue her claim, however, and has never received any benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Ms. Gable then filed a claim for PIP benefits with her automobile insurer, Colonial Insurance Company of California. Colonial refused to pay because of a policy exclusion for injuries \u201coccurring during the course of employment if benefits are payable or must be provided under a workers\u2019 compensation law or similar law.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Ms. Gable brought this action in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore County, to recover $978.55 in PIP benefits. After judgment was entered in favor of Colonial because of the policy exclusion, Ms. Gable appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. In the de novo appeal, the circuit court granted Colonial\u2019s motion for summary judgment, relying on the policy exclusion. Thereafter, this Court granted Ms. Gable\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari which challenged the validity of the policy provision as applied under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">As previously noted, <em>supra </em>n. 1, both parties agree that the language of the Colonial insurance policy bars recovery of PIP benefits in the instant case. Nevertheless, if the policy provision, as applied to the facts of this case, is contrary to the Insurance Code, the provision is unenforceable. <em>See, e.g., Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 528 A.2d 912 (1987); <em>Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass'n, </em>309 Md. 167, 171-172, 174-179, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987); <em>State Farm Mut. v. Nationwide Mut., </em>307 Md. 631, 636, 516 A.2d 586 (1986); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>305 Md. 614, 620, 505 A.2d 1338 (1986); <em>Jennings v. Government Employees Ins., </em>302 Md. 352, 356-357, 488 A.2d 166 (1985); <em>Guardian Life Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>293 Md. 629, 643, 446 A.2d 1140 (1982); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 436 A.2d 465 (1981); <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 156, 416 A.2d 734 (1980). In our view the provision, as applied to PIP benefits and work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>men\u2019s compensation benefits not yet recovered, is inconsistent with public policy as embodied in the Maryland Insurance Code. The statutory language allows a deduction from PIP benefits only for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits actually received.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Section 539(a) of the Insurance Code requires every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued in Maryland to afford a minimum of $2,500 medical, hospital, and disability benefits. Section 543(d), however, specifies: \u201cBenefits payable under the coverages required in [\u00a7 539] ... shall be reduced to the extent that the recipient <em>has recovered </em>benefits under workmen\u2019s compensation laws of any state or the federal government.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The language of \u00a7 543(d) shows a legislative intent to provide offsets only for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits actually received and not for future benefits. The subsection provides for a deduction only for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits that the claimant \u201chas recovered.\u201d The General Assembly drew a sharp distinction between workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which have been received and those benefits which have not. To allow a deduction for unrecovered benefits would insert an additional exception to the provision mandating PIP coverage. As a matter of statutory construction, where the Legislature has required specified coverages in a particular category of insurance, and has provided for certain exceptions or exclusions to the required coverages, additional exclusions are generally not permitted. <em>Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. at 239, 528 A.2d at 915; <em>State Farm Mut. v. Nationwide Mut., supra, </em>307 Md. at 638, 516 A.2d at 589; <em>Jennings v. Government Employees Ins., supra, </em>302 Md. at 358-359, 488 A.2d at 169-170; <em>DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 725, 475 A.2d 454 (1984); <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, supra, </em>288 Md. at 156,. 416 A.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Colonial chiefly relies upon <em>State Farm Mut. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>283 Md. 663, 392 A.2d 1114 (1978), asserting that <em>\u201cState Farm </em>is directly on point.\u201d (Brief, p. 8). Nevertheless, it is the difference between recovered and unrecovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which makes the case at bar distinguishable from the <em>State Farm </em>case. In <em>State Farm, </em>the insured had received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits but later had reimbursed the workmen\u2019s compensation carrier when he received a settlement for his tort claim against a negligent third party. When the insured\u2019s own automobile insurance company reduced his PIP benefits by the amount he had received from, but later repaid to, the workmen\u2019s compensation carrier, he brought suit. This Court held that the automobile insurance carrier could offset the PIP benefits by the amount of the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits because the insured \u201chad recovered\u201d those workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. In reaching that conclusion, we stated (283 Md. at 671-672, 392 A.2d at 1118):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201cThe critical words in the statute are \u2018has recovered.\u2019 The general meaning in law of the verb \u2018to recover\u2019 is \u2018to get,\u2019 \u2018to obtain,\u2019 \u2018to come into possession of,\u2019 \u2018to receive.\u2019 <em>Garza v. Chicago Health Clubs, Inc., </em>347 F.Supp. 955, 962 (N.D.Ill.1972); <em>Covert v. Randles, </em>53 Ariz. 225, 231, 87 P.2d 488, 490 (1939); <em>Swader v. Flour Mills Co., </em>103 Kan. 703, 704, 176 P. 143, 144-145 (1918); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>p. 1440 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, </em>p. 2081 (2d ed. unabridged, 1961). In a narrower sense, \u2018to recover\u2019 means \u2018to succeed in a [legal] proceeding,\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, supra, </em>or \u2018to obtain in any legal manner in contrast to voluntary payment,\u2019 <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra. See also Union Petroleum S.S. Co. v. United States, </em>18 F.2d 752, 753 (2d Cir.1927), <em>cert. denied, </em>274 U.S. 760, 47 S.Ct. 770, 71 L.Ed. 1338 (1927); <em>Garza v. Chicago Health Clubs, Inc., supra, </em>347 F.Supp. at 962; <em>Covert v. Randles, supra, </em>53 Ariz. at 231.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Under either definition of \u201chas recovered\u201d the insured in the present case, unlike the insured in <em>State Farm, </em>has not recovered any workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>See also Hines v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>305 Md. 369, 376-377, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>504 A.2d 632 (1986); <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 444 A.2d 1024 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The contrast between the language of the Maryland statute and that of similar statutes in other states is further indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent to allow offsets only for those workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which have been actually received. New York\u2019s no-fault statute, for example, states that benefits shall be reduced by \u201camounts recovered or <em>recoverable </em>on account of such injury under state or federal laws providing social security disability benefits, or workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d N.Y.Ins.Law \u00a7 5102(b)(2) (Consol.1985) (emphasis added). <em>Accord </em>Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \u00a7 38-333, subd. [c] (1987) (\u201cany amount paid or payable by virtue of any workers\u2019 compensation law shall be deducted\u201d); Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 500.3109 (1983) (\u201cBenefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government shall be subtracted ...\u201d); Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 65B.61, subd. 2 (1986) (\u201cIf benefits are paid or payable under a workers\u2019 compensation law ... no disability income loss benefits are payable ... \u201d); Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 31A-22-309 (1986) (benefits \u201care reduced by ... any benefits which that person receives or is entitled to receive ... under any workers\u2019 compensation ... plan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">A New York court pointed to the legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u2018recoverable\u2019 in holding that in New York an insurer may deduct the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits upon a mere showing of their availability. <em>Carlo Service Corp. v. Rachmani, </em>64 A.D.2d 579, 407 N.Y.S.2d 700, 701 (1978). Conversely, the absence of the word \u2018recoverable\u2019 in the Maryland statute indicates that in Maryland the insurer\u2019s right to offset workmen\u2019s compensation benefits is contingent upon their receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Colonial Insurance Company also relies upon \u00a7 540(a) of the Maryland Insurance Code. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 540 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Fault; collateral sources; coordination; subro</em>gation.\u2014The benefits required under \u00a7 539 of this subtitle shall be payable without regard to the fault or non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>fault of the named insured or the recipient in causing or contributing to the accident, and without regard to any collateral source of medical, hospital, or wage continuation benefits. Where the insured has coverage for both the benefits required under \u00a7 539 and the collateral benefits, the insurer or insurers may coordinate the policies to provide for nonduplication of such benefits; subject, however, to appropriate reductions in premiums for one or both of said coverages approved by the Insurance Commissioner, and the named insured shall have the right to elect or reject the coordination of policies and nonduplication of benefits. If the insured elects to coordinate, he shall indicate in writing which policy is to become primary. An insurer paying benefits under \u00a7 539 of this article shall have no right of subrogation and no claim against any other person or insurer to recover any such benefits by reason of the alleged fault of such other person in causing or contributing to the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The first sentence of \u00a7 540(a), instead of supporting Colonial\u2019s position, confirms the legislative intent that generally there are to be no offsets against the PIP benefits required under \u00a7 539. The second sentence of \u00a7 540(a), which Colonial specifically invokes, has no application to this case. As the language of the second and third sentences demonstrates, the statutory provision contemplates a situation where the insured has taken out two overlapping insurance policies, where the insurer or insurers under both policies have decided to coordinate them, where there has been a reduction in premiums because of the coordination, where the Insurance Commissioner has approved the reduction, where the insured has been given the opportunity to reject the coordination but has, instead, elected to coordinate, and where the insured has in writing designated which policy is to be primary. As far as the record in this case shows, none of these circumstances is present here. Moreover, it would not seem that coordination of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits (which are the responsibility of the employer who sometimes is self-insured) with an employee\u2019s PIP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>benefits under his automobile insurance policy, could ever come within \u00a7 540(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Furthermore, there is another reason for \u00a7 540(a)\u2019s inapplicability to the instant case. Section 543(d) is the section specifically dealing with the coordination of PIP and workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. Under the rule that specific terms of a statute prevail over general language, \u00a7 543(d) would govern this case rather than the more general language in \u00a7 540(a). <em>See DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Insurance Co., supra, </em>299 Md. at 718, 475 A.2d at 459, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Not only is a deduction for unrecovered workers\u2019 compensation benefits prohibited by the language of the Insurance Code, but it would be contrary to the policies underlying the provision for mandatory PIP benefits. The primary purpose of the statutory provisions is to promote certain and prompt recovery. As Chief Judge Murphy recently pointed out for the Court in <em>Insurance Commissioner v. Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association, </em>313 Md. 518, 532, 546 A.2d 458 (1988), \u201cone of [the Insurance Code\u2019s] fundamental aims is the speedy provision of PIP benefits without the lengthy delays entailed by ... litigation. Such prompt payment is a basic purpose of no-fault insurance generally____\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, this purpose may be gleaned from various provisions in the Insurance Code. Section 544, for example, requires that all PIP claims must be paid within 30 days of satisfactory proof. Additionally, \u00a7 540(a) provides that benefits \u201cshall be payable without regard to the fault or nonfault of the named insured or the recipient in causing or contributing to the accident.\u201d Thus, the provisions for PIP benefits contemplate that the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>would avoid the delay, uncertainty, and expense of litigation. Allowing an insurer to offset unrecovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits would undermine these policies. Inevitably, disputes would arise between the PIP carrier and the insured as to whether workmen\u2019s compensation would cover the claim. These problems, however, do not arise where the insured has already been paid by the workmen\u2019s compensation carrier. There the goals of certain and prompt payment are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Similar considerations led a New Jersey court to hold that an automobile insurer may not set-off unrecovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits against no fault benefits, <em>Solimano v. Consolidated Mutual Ins. Co., </em>146 N.J.Super. 393, 369 A.2d 1003 (1977). The court in <em>Solimano </em>reached this conclusion even though the New Jersey statute provided that \u201cbenefits <em>collectible </em>under workmen\u2019s compensation insurance ... shall be deducted____\u201d N.J.S.A. 39:6A-6 (1973) (emphasis added). The court reasoned (146 N.J.Super. at 397, 369 A.2d at 1005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">\u201cIn interpreting that section this court has stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\u2018It is apparent that the purpose of the act is to provide for prompt payment of medical bills, lost wages and property damage without having to await the outcome of protracted litigation. <em>[Harris v. Osorio, </em>125 N.J.Super. 468, 469, 311 A.2d 748, 749 (Law Div.1973)].\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5u\">\u201cTo the above quotation from our opinion in <em>Harris </em>we now add the words \u2018or an involved claim in workmen\u2019s compensation.\u2019 Simply stated, the No Fault Act was designed to get the bills paid and keep the injured insured, and those who must rely upon him or her for support, off the public assistance rolls. [A reading that the PIP claimant must dispose of his workers\u2019 compensation claim first] would require a judicial mandate to the least capable party <em>(i.e., </em>the injured, oftentimes debilitated, insured) to exhaust all possibilities for recovery before turning to his primary source of reimbursement\u2014the PIP carrier. This position is contrary to the letter and spirit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>of the No Fault Act and the recent decisions of our courts interpreting it. We therefore reject it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We hold, therefore, that an automobile insurer may only deduct from PIP benefits the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits actually received. To the extent that the insurance policy exclusion in the case at bar is inconsistent with this holding, it is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. RESPONDENT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\">. Part III of the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201cWe will pay for reasonable expenses actually incurred within one year from the date of accident for necessary medical and funeral services because of bodily injury suffered by an insured person.\u201d ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">\"This coverage will also not apply for bodily injury to any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcB\">\"(9) Occurring during the course of employment if benefits are payable or must be provided under a workers\u2019 compensation law or similar law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">It is unclear whether this section was intended to apply to PIP benefits under \u00a7 539. Nevertheless, because both parties and the courts below have proceeded as if the policy provision were intended to be applicable, we shall, for purposes of this case only, proceed upon the same assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">. <em>See also, e.g., Solimano v.
