Pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9(b), we referred the matter to Judge J. James McKenna of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The facts, as disclosed by the record and the circuit judge\u2019s findings, are as follows. The respondent, a member of the Bar of this Court since 1964, frequently represented First Maryland Savings and Loan Association in real estate settlement matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In transactions in which the respondent represented First Maryland, the savings and loan had agreed that, before the date of a closing, it would directly deposit the requisite funds into the respondent\u2019s client escrow account at Maryland National Bank. During 1983, however, the respondent learned that on several occasions First Maryland had failed to make the deposits in a timely fashion. In order to ensure that future closings would be funded on time, the respondent directed one of his employees to make more satisfactory arrangements with First Maryland. The employee, Ms. McNeill, was not an attorney; nor, apparently, did she receive any specific instructions from the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">At First Maryland\u2019s suggestion, Ms. McNeill agreed to a system under which the savings and loan would deposit a check for the requisite amount into the respondent\u2019s personal, interest-bearing checking account at First Maryland. Immediately thereafter, Ms. McNeill would write a check, on the respondent\u2019s personal account, payable to the client escrow account at Maryland National Bank. Later in 1983, Ms. McNeill established a separate, interest-bearing office account at First Maryland in the name of Dacy &amp; Associ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ates, the respondent\u2019s firm. Subsequently, monies destined from First Maryland to the Maryland National escrow account would pass through this Dacy &amp; Associates account.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The respondent\u2019s uncontradicted testimony indicates that it was not until some point after Ms. McNeill had established the Dacy &amp; Associates account that he inquired about or learned of the particular solution which she had devised.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The record also establishes that in August 1983 the respondent attended a meeting at which First Maryland, as the lender, and several other parties agreed to close a real estate transaction. The borrowers, who had accounts at First Maryland, wanted the loan proceeds to be credited immediately to their accounts. Consequently, the parties considered it impractical first to deposit the amount of the loan into the respondent\u2019s escrow account at Maryland National Bank and then to authorize a disbursement out of the escrow account. Instead, First Maryland\u2019s president proposed that the money be deposited in the respondent\u2019s personal account and that the respondent then disburse the amount of the loan from that account to the borrowers. The respondent agreed to do so. According to his testimony before Judge McKenna, he believed that, because he had the consent of all parties involved, his conduct would not violate any statute or disciplinary rule. In response to a question by Bar Counsel, the respondent admitted that, on this occasion, he knowingly had clients\u2019 money placed in his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">It is undisputed that none of the respondent\u2019s clients suffered any losses as a result of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Based on the foregoing evidence, the circuit court found that the respondent had commingled client funds with his personal funds. In addition, however, the court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>such commingling was inadvertent, although, the court added, it was \u201cinadvertence of a rather extraordinary nature.\u201d Finally, the circuit court concluded that, because of his conduct, the respondent had violated Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 10, \u00a7 44(a)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> DR 9-102(A),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and DR 1-102(A)(1) and (6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Bar Counsel has excepted to the circuit court\u2019s finding that the respondent\u2019s conduct was inadvertent. According to Bar Counsel, \u201c[t]he clear and convincing evidence shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that the Respondent did have scienter.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8\">As to Ms. McNeill\u2019s purported solution to the difficulties with First National, there is abundant evidence that the respondent acted negligently. Indeed, he concedes as much. Had the respondent given Ms. McNeill reasonably specific instructions, it is clear that the problems with First Maryland might have been solved by creating an escrow account at that savings and loan. Moreover, had the respondent exercised a reasonable degree of supervision over Ms. McNeill, he might have detected her error before any ethical proscriptions had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Nonetheless, the respondent\u2019s uncontradicted testimony indicates that, in this regard, he did not intend to violate any ethical principle and that his conduct was the product of negligence. The circuit judge expressly found the respondent to be a credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">By the respondent\u2019s own admission, however, he acted knowingly and not inadvertently when, at the August 1983 closing, he temporarily deposited client funds in his personal account. Thus, as to the commingling that occurred as a result of that decision, we hold that the circuit court\u2019s finding of inadvertence was clearly erroneous, and we sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">By way of a sanction, the respondent suggests that a reprimand would be appropriate. On the other hand, Bar Counsel recommends a three-month suspension. Bar Counsel argues, however, that our decision in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Goldberg, </em>292 Md. 650, 441 A.2d 338 (1982), is similar to the instant case. In <em>Goldberg, supra, </em>the attorney did not adequately supervise his office manager, who negligently performed her duties. As a result, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>attorney\u2019s escrow account became overdrawn. Also, in <em>Goldberg, </em>important pleadings were never filed. On the basis of these facts, we concluded that the proper sanction was a 30-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">As in <em>Goldberg, </em>the prior record of the respondent in the case at bar is unblemished. Moreover, as in <em>Goldberg, </em>the respondent changed his office procedures when the problems came to his attention. In addition, none of the respondent\u2019s clients were injured as a result of any of his actions. Consequently, we conclude that the appropriate sanction in this case is a 30-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV 15 c, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST EDWARD ANTHONY DACY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">. The respondent was also a shareholder and director of First Maryland and a member of its Loan Committee. First Maryland was placed in receivership in November 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">. The respondent testified that he could not \u201crecollect ... with specificity\u201d the exact date on which Ms. McNeill provided him with this information. In addition, the record does not clearly indicate whether Ms. McNeill volunteered this information or whether the respondent actually inquired about it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-5\">. Art. 10, \u00a7 44, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>\u201cDuty of Attorney.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">(\u0430) (1) If any attorney is entrusted with, or receives and accepts, or otherwise holds, deposit moneys or other trust moneys, of whatever kind or nature, such moneys, in the absence of court order to the contrary shall be expeditiously deposited in an account or accounts maintained as a separate account or accounts for funds belonging to others. In no event shall the attorney commingle any such funds with such attorney\u2019s funds or use any such funds for any purpose other than the purpose for which they were entrusted to the attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\">.

Initially, Bar Counsel had also charged respondent with a failure to maintain adequate records concerning interest earned on client funds that were deposited in his personal and business accounts. The trial court concluded that this charge had been proved, but found respondent's actions to have been inadvertent. Bar Counsel does not press this charge and now characterizes this proceeding as a \"pure commingling case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
