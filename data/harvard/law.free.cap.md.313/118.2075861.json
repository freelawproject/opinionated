NCR contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">1. It should have been allowed to deduct gross-up from its federal taxable income for 1976;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">2. it should have been allowed to deduct domestic placement interest income from its federal taxable income; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">3. the Comptroller incorrectly applied the Maryland apportionment formula to NCR\u2019s foreign-source income when he excluded from the denominators the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales that generated the income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">We reject NCR\u2019s first two arguments and remand for further fact-finding as to the third. We thus affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Comptroller v. NCR Corp., </em>71 Md.App. 116, 524 A.2d 93 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">This case made its way from the Tax Court to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to the Court of Special Appeals. To the extent that particular happenings at any of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>levels are important to our decision, we shall discuss them in that portion of this opinion dealing with the particular issue involved. We preface our discussion by noting that during the tax years in question, NCR engaged in the manufacture of business equipment and machinery. It sold its products and related supplies and services at wholesale and retail levels throughout the world.. Its corporate headquarters and principal place of business were in Ohio, but it had several sales and service offices and a marketing administrative office in Maryland. The Tax Court determined that NCR\u2019s worldwide operations constituted a unitary business for apportionment purposes. NCR does not contest that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I. NCR\u2019s 1976 Gross-Up Income</p>\n<p id=\"AnW\">Federal tax law permits (or at times relevant to this case permitted) a United States corporation owning at least a 10 percent interest in the voting stock of a foreign subsidiary to elect to claim credit for certain foreign taxes paid by that subsidiary. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901(a), 901(b)(1) and 902(a). For the purposes of these provisions, the credit is allowed for that portion of the foreign taxes which the domestic corporation is deemed to have paid. NCR is such a corporation with respect to ten foreign subsidiaries and it elected to take a \u201cdeemed paid\u201d foreign tax credit for the tax year 1976. By virtue of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 78, NCR was required to treat those \u201cdeemed paid\u201d credits as \u201cgrossed-up\u201d dividend income for federal tax purposes (hence the term \u201cgross-up\u201d). It then claimed a credit against its federal income tax pursuant to \u00a7 902(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On its Maryland return, however, NCR deducted the gross-up from its federal taxable income. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The Comptroller disallowed the deduction, on the ground that under Md.Code (1975 Repl.Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 280A(a), the net taxable income of a corporation, for Maryland tax purposes, is \u201cthe taxable income of such taxpayer as defined in the laws of the United States____\u201d Thus, the gross-up was returned to NCR\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The Tax Court agreed that \u00a7 280A(a) required this treatment. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City did not; it held that taxation of \u201cfictitious\u201d gross-up income was not mandated by \u00a7 280A(a) and was unconstitutional by virtue of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court of Special Appeals held the Tax Court to be correct. It reversed the circuit court, but did not pass on the constitutional issue. NCR insists that a proper interpretation of Maryland law results in the exclusion of gross-up in 1976, and that if we read Maryland law otherwise, it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">A. <em>Gross-up and Article 81, \u00a7 280A(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As we have seen, \u00a7 280A(a) instructs, as it did in 1976, that \u201c[t]he net income of a corporation shall be the taxable income of such taxpayer as defined in the laws of the United States ... for the corresponding taxable period____\u201d The purpose of that provision is \u201cto bring the State taxation system in conformity with the federal scheme.\u201d <em>Comptroller v. American Satellite Corp., </em>312 Md. 537, 545, 540 A.2d 1146, 1150 (1988). Since NCR\u2019s 1976 federal taxable income included the gross-up, and since the Maryland statutes applicable to 1976 contained no authority to adjust or deduct that figure, it should, one would think, be included in Maryland taxable income. <em>See Comptroller v. American Satellite Corp., supra. </em>But NCR, pointing to somewhat unusual legislative history, reaches a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">NCR explains that when \u00a7 280A was enacted in 1967, subsection (c) provided that \u201c[tjhere shall be subtracted from taxable income of ... [the] taxpayer: ... (4) dividend income to the extent included in taxable income____\u201d Thus, all dividend income was effectively excluded from taxation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>by Maryland. That changed in 1976. By Ch. 904 of the Acts of that year, subsection (c) was amended to repeal the dividend exclusion. The amended version applied \u201cto all taxable years of corporate taxpayers beginning after December 31, 1975.\u201d Ch. 904, Acts of 1976, \u00a7 5. This, of course, required inclusion, for Maryland tax purposes, of dividend income included in federal taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In 1977 the General Assembly revisited \u00a7 280A (c) by adding (via Ch. 812 of the Acts of that year) language calling for the subtraction from federal taxable income, to the extent included therein, \u201c(4) any amounts included therein by operation of the provisions of \u00a7 78 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954....\u201d Section 78 is, of course, the gross-up provision, and the 1977 amendment effectively produced the result (at least from its effective date of 1 July 1977) for which NCR now contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">As NCR reads this history, the 1976 amendment was not directed to gross-up income; it was simply intended to make actual dividend income taxable in Maryland. In 1977 the legislature realized it had made a terrible mistake in the prior year and promptly addressed the gross-up problem by allowing subtraction for Maryland purposes of amounts included in federal income by virtue of \u00a7 78. The legislative intent, under this theory, was never to tax gross-up income. Under somewhat similar circumstances, the Supreme Court of Vermont used a subsequent statutory amendment to decipher prior legislative intent in the manner for which NCR now contends. <em>In re Knosher, </em>139 Vt. 285, 287-288, 428 A.2d 1104, 1105 (1981). <em>See also Winterset, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r of Taxes, </em>144 Vt. 230, 232-234, 475 A.2d 231, 232-233 (1984). But we do not see the Maryland legislative history that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">When we construe a statute, we seek to ascertain and effectuate the legislative goal or object, and our first recourse in doing so is to the words of the statute, giving them their ordinary and natural import. <em>Comptroller v. American Satellite Corp., </em>312 Md. at 544, 540 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>1150. The plain words before us now in no way support NCR\u2019s conclusion; to the contrary, they bolster the Comptroller\u2019s position. Nevertheless, a statute must be construed in context, and the plainest language may be governed by the context in which it appears. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-516, 525 A.2d 628, 632-633 (1987). Legislative reports and other pertinent legislative history may help to provide the appropriate context. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Chapter 812, Acts of 1977, contains only the usual effective date provision\u20141 July 1977. Unlike the 1976 act, it contains no language carefully spelling out the tax year to which the amendment applies. Statutes are normally prospective in operation absent clear intent to the contrary. <em>See Mason v. State, </em>309 Md. 215, 219-220 &amp; n. 1, 522 A.2d 1344, 1346 &amp; n. 1 (1987); <em>WSSC v. Riverdale Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 560-561, 520 A.2d 1319, 1321-1322 (1987). The lack of retrospective wording gives NCR\u2019s \u201cunintended consequence\u201d argument a somewhat hollow ring. Surely had the General Assembly meant to correct an inadvertent error made in 1976, the 1977 law expressly would have applied to the 1976 tax year. That the legislature knew how to write this sort of language appears from the 1976 act itself. And given a filing date of 15 April 1977, for 1976 tax returns <em>[see </em>Md.Code (1975 Repl.Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 305], it seems particularly clear that a tax statute taking effect on 1 July 1977 was not designed to apply to the 1976 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Finally, it appears that when the 1976 bill was under consideration in the House Ways and Means Committee, an amendment to allow deduction of gross-up was rejected. <em>See </em>Letter of 5 November 1976 from William S. Ratchford, II, to Senator Roy N. Staten. While a committee\u2019s rejection of an amendment is clearly not an infallible indication of legislative intent, it may help our understanding of overall legislative history. <em>See Bd. of Examiners in Optometry v. Spitz, </em>300 Md. 466, 479-480, 479 A.2d 363, 369-370 (1984); <em>Demory Brothers v. Bd. of Pub. Works, </em>273 Md. 320, 325-326, 329 A.2d 674, 677 (1974); <em>Bosely v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Dorsey, </em>191 Md. 229, 240, 60 A.2d 691, 696 (1948); <em>Cohen v. Goldstein, </em>58 Md.App. 699, 717, 474 A.2d 229, 237-238, <em>cert. denied, </em>301 Md. 41, 481 A.2d 801 (1984), espousing the proposition that legislative intent cannot be inferred solely from failure of a bill, but failure may be taken into account. <em>But cf. Automobile Trade Ass\u2019n v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>292 Md. 15, 24, 437 A.2d 199, 203 (1981). The \u201cGeneral Assembly is presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute____\u201d <em>Board of Educ., Garrett Co. v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1982). With that in mind, and with all available legislative history before us, we conclude that \u00a7 280A, as applied in 1976, required the inclusion of gross-up in NCR\u2019s taxable Maryland income for that year. The next question is whether the statute, so construed, is constitutional. It is to that topic that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">B. <em>Gross-up and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Though conceding that the income derived from foreign subsidiaries is part of its unitary business, NCR argues that taxation of its gross-up income contravenes the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is so, NCR contends, because whether or not it was taxed on gross-up depended solely upon its treatment of foreign taxes <em>paid\u2014i.e., </em>as a credit or deduction on its federal return. Hence, NCR asserts that the \u201cgross-up amount created by its ... foreign tax credit election bears no \u2018rational relationship\u2019 to its \u2018interstate values\u2019 in Maryland.\u201d Brief at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u201cUnder both the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution, a State may not, when imposing an income-based tax, \u2018tax value earned outside its borders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159, 164, 103 S.Ct. 2933, 2939, 77 L.Ed.2d 545, 552, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>U.S. 909, 104 S.Ct. 265, 78 L.Ed.2d 248 (1983) (quoting <em>ASARCO, Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>458 U.S. 307, 315, 102 S.Ct. 3103, 3108, 73 L.Ed.2d 787, 794 (1982)). Nonetheless, \u201c[i]t has long been established that the income of a business operating in interstate commerce is not immune from fairly apportioned state taxation.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Comm\u2019r of Taxes, </em>445 U.S. 425, 436, 100 S.Ct. 1223, 1231, 63 L.Ed.2d 510, 520 (1980); <em>also see Random House v. Comptroller, </em>310 Md. 696, 707, 531 A.2d 683, 688 (1987); <em>Xerox Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>290 Md. 126, 128, 428 A.2d 1208, 1210 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In order to challenge successfully State apportionment of corporate income, \u201cthe taxpayer [must] ... prove \u2018by clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that the income attributed to the State is in fact \u2018out of all appropriate proportions to the business transacted ... in that State, ... or has led to a grossly distorted result____\u2019\u201d <em>Container Corp., supra, </em>463 U.S. at 170, 103 S.Ct. at 2942, 77 L.Ed.2d at 556 (quoting <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, </em>437 U.S. 267, 274, 98 S.Ct. 2340, 2345, 57 L.Ed.2d 197, 205, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>439 U.S. 885, 99 S.Ct. 233, 58 L.Ed.2d 201 (1978)). NCR\u2019s argument that its gross-up meets this test relies principally on language extracted from <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept., </em>458 U.S. 354, 372-373, 102 S.Ct. 3128, 3139, 73 L.Ed.2d 819, 833, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>459 U.S. 961, 103 S.Ct. 274, 74 L.Ed.2d 213 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">We need not be detained by New Mexico\u2019s reaching out to tax \u201cgross-up\u201d amounts that even the Supreme Court of New Mexico recognized as \u201cfictitious.\u201d ... The gross-up computation is a figure that the Federal Government \u201cdeems\u201d Woolworth to have received for purposes of part of Woolworth\u2019s federal foreign tax credit calculation____ In this case the foreign tax credit arose from the taxation by foreign nations of Woolworth foreign subsidiaries that had no unitary business relationship with New Mexico. New Mexico\u2019s effort to tax this income \u201cdeemed received\u201d\u2014with respect to which New Mexico contributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>nothing\u2014also must be held to contravene the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><em>Id. </em>[citations omitted].</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">But the reason the Supreme Court of the United States did not need to be detained by New Mexico\u2019s efforts to tax Woolworth\u2019s gross-up was not because, in that Court\u2019s view, State taxation of gross-up was unconstitutional per se. It was because a state can\u00f1ot tax gross-up dividends, any more than it can tax actual dividends, when the foreign subsidiaries have no unitary business relationship with the state. Since the principle undergirding the holding in <em>Woolworth </em>was the absence of a unitary business relationship, the Court was not required to address the due process argument Woolworth directed at New Mexico\u2019s inclusion of gross-up. <em>Woolworth </em>is of no comfort to NCR; the unitary nature of NCR\u2019s business is conceded here.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">There are, of course, gross-up cases (or cases involving analogous principles) in which state courts have reached results favorable to the taxpayer by excluding gross-up (or other \u201cincome\u201d includible in federal taxable income) from income subject to state taxation. <em>See Dow Chemical Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 254, 391 N.E.2d 253 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Emhart Corp., </em>443 Pa. 397, 278 A.2d 916, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>404 U.S. 981, 92 S.Ct. 451, 30 L.Ed.2d 364 (1971); <em>In re Knosher, supra. </em>There are also similar cases that hold in favor of the taxing authorities. <em>See Ex parte Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>503 So.2d 304 (Ala.1987); <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Lenckos, </em>84 Ill.2d 102, 49 Ill.Dec. 329, 417 N.E.2d 1343 (1981), <em>appeal dismissed sub nom. Chicago, Bridge &amp; Iron Co. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>463 U.S. 1220, 103 S.Ct. 3562, 77 L.Ed.2d 1402 (1983); <em>Albany Int'l Corp. v. Halperin, </em>388 A.2d 902 (Me.1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Westinghouse, </em>478 Pa. 164, 386 A.2d 491, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>439 U.S. 805, 99 S.Ct. 61, 58 L.Ed.2d 97 (1978). But the outcome in each of these cases turns bn the specific provisions of a state statute, or on a reading of legislative intent in light of a particular legislative history or a given state\u2019s general approach to statutory interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tion. None addresses the fourteenth amendment issue that is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">One decision that does touch on that issue is <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Dept. v. F.W. Woolworth, </em>95 N.M. 519, 624 P.2d 28 (1981), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>458 U.S. 854, 102 S.Ct. 3128, 73 L.Ed.2d 819, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>459 U.S. 961, 103 S.Ct. 274, 74 L.Ed.2d 218 (1982). As is obvious from the citation (and as NCR points out), this decision was reversed by the United States Supreme Court. But as we have just observed, that reversal had nothing to do with any conclusion that a state would violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment if it taxed gross-up. The Supreme Court did not deal with that issue. The Supreme Court of New Mexico did at least touch on it, and seemed to find no constitutional impediment because Woolworth had received measurable economic benefit from its election to use the federal tax credit as opposed to a federal deduction for foreign taxes paid. <em>Id. </em>at 522-523, 624 P.2d at 31-32. And the Supreme Court of North Dakota has very recently reached the same conclusion. <em>International Minerals &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Heitkamp, </em>417 N.W.2d 791 (N.D.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In <em>Heitkamp, </em>International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp. (IMC), a unitary business operating both within and without North Dakota and which owned a number of foreign subsidiaries, took the federal \u201cdeemed paid\u201d credit. As in Maryland federal taxable income served as a tax base for state taxable income, but IMC tried to exclude the gross-up amount from its taxable North Dakota income. It made essentially the same constitutional argument that NCR submits to us. Observing, as we have, that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Woolworth </em>did not address the issue, the North Dakota court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">A domestic corporation required to compute \u201cgross-up\u201d income under [26 U.S.C.] \u00a7 78 has received economic benefit from its election to take the \u00a7 902 foreign tax credit. By making this voluntary election, IMC has reduced its federal income tax liability____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In this case, it is conceded that IMC\u2019s foreign subsidiaries had a unitary business relationship with IMC and North Dakota. Therefore, the due process clause does not preclude North Dakota from taxing actual dividends IMC received from its foreign subsidiaries____ Having elected the benefit of the \u00a7 902 \u201cdeemed paid\u201d foreign tax credit, IMC in effect chose not to deduct the foreign taxes paid by its foreign subsidiaries but to instead treat them as \u201cdividends\u201d and therefore \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] We do not believe due process requires that IMC be freed from this choice for state tax purposes____ Because North Dakota does not statutorily recognize a deduction for \u00a7 78 \u201cgross-up\u201d income, IMC may not exclude the \u201cgross-up\u201d from the amount of federal taxable income reported on its state income tax return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 796 [citations omitted].</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\"><em>Heitkamp </em>is on all fours with the case before us. We agree with the Supreme Court of North Dakota\u2019s reasoning, and for the same reasons, hold that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment does not preclude Maryland from taxing NCR\u2019s \u201cgross-up\u201d income for tax year 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">II. NCR\u2019s Domestic Placement Income</p>\n<p id=\"Azr\">During the years 1976 and 1977, NCR received income generated from various short-term investments totalling $17,856,121 and $22,138,461, respectively. Of that income, NCR concedes, amounts of $6,440,986 in 1976 and $4,044,-691 in 1977 were from unitary business sources such as finance charges and loans and advances to subsidiaries and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>agents, and thus were properly subject to Maryland\u2019s apportionment tax. But the remainder of that interest income\u2014 $11,415,135 in 1976 and $18,093,770 in 1977\u2014was derived from other sources. NCR refers to this other-source income as \u201cdomestic placement income\u201d (DPI). The sources of the DPI, it asserts, were nonunitary.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">If NCR is correct in this assertion, the DPI was not subject to apportionment in Maryland. The \u201c \u2018linchpin of apportionability\u2019 for state income taxation of an interstate enterprise is the unitary business principle.\u201d <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept., </em>458 U.S. at 362, 102 S.Ct. at 3134, 73 L.Ed.2d at 826 (quoting <em>ASARCO, Inc. v.

It rejects geographical or transactional accounting, and instead calculates the local tax base by first defining the scope of the \u201cunitary business\u201d of which the taxed enterprise\u2019s activities in the taxing jurisdiction form one part, and then apportioning the total income of that \u201cunitary business\u201d between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of the world on the basis of a formula taking into account objective measures of the corporation\u2019s activities within and without the jurisdiction. This Court long ago upheld the constitutionality of the unitary business/formula apportionment method, although subject to certain constraints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>Container Corp., </em>463 U.S. at 165, 103 S.Ct. at 2940, 77 L.Ed.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Apportionment under the unitary business formula, however, is not without its restrictions. The due process and commerce clauses do not allow states to tax a corporation\u2019s interstate activities unless there exists a \u201c \u2018minimal connection\u2019 or \u2018nexus\u2019 between the interstate activities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the taxing State, and \u2018a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, </em>447 U.S. 207, 219-220, 100 S.Ct. 2109, 2118, 65 L.Ed.2d 66, 79 (1980) (quoting <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v.

Comptroller, supra, </em>Chief Judge Murphy discussed for the Court the two parts of the due process test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">The first of the two parts of the due process test\u2014the existence of a \u201cminimal connection\u201d or \u201cnexus\u201d\u2014concerns a State\u2019s jurisdiction to tax a business\u2019s income. The second part of the test\u2014whether there is a rational relationship between the taxing State and the intrastate values of the taxpayer\u2019s enterprise\u2014deals with constitutional limits on the application of a particular apportionment formula.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Xerox, </em>290 Md. at 145, 428 A.2d at 1218-1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Prong one of the test is satisfied by demonstrating the existence of unitary business, part of which is carried on in the taxing state. Hellerstein, \u201cState Income Taxation of Multijurisdictional Corporations, Part II: Reflections on <em>ASARCO </em>and Woolworth,\u201d 81 Mich.L.Rev. 157, 168 (1982) (hereinafter \u201cState Income Taxation\u201d). Once the requisite nexus has been shown, the taxpayer then bears the burden of demonstrating that the income it seeks to exclude from taxation was derived from unrelated business activity that constituted a discreet business enterprise. <em>See Container Corp., supra, </em>463 U.S. at 164, 103 S.Ct. at 2939-2940, 77 L.Ed.2d at 552; <em>Exxon Corp, supra, </em>447 U.S. at 223-224, 100 S.Ct. at 2120, 65 L.Ed.2d at 81; <em>Mobil Oil, supra, </em>445 U.S. at 442, 100 S.Ct. at 1234, 63 L.Ed.2d at 524. NCR does not dispute the fact that it maintained several offices in this State. The nexus between it and Maryland was sufficient for imposition of the State income tax. Rather, NCR\u2019s contention is that its DPI was derived from sources that were not part of its unitary business and thus the DPI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>should not have been apportioned to Maryland. To test this contention, we turn initially to what the Tax Court had to say about the DPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The Tax Court observed that NCR \u201creceives ... [DPI] from short term interest bearing instruments, primarily certificates of deposit, backers of acceptances, commercial paper, government notes and municipal bonds.\u201d The agency accepted NCR\u2019s claim that \u201cthe banks, government agencies, and other organizations which issue these short term interest bearing instruments are not part of the unitary business of NCR.\u201d It then concluded that since \u201cNCR has shown that the short term investments involved were not part of its unitary operations, i.e., the production and sale of business machines ... apportionment of this interest income ... would violate the due process clause because this income does not represent profits derived from the functionally integrated unitary business of NCR operating in Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The circuit court agreed with this analysis, but the Court of Special Appeals rejected it, holding that the Tax Court (and the circuit court) had applied an incorrect legal standard. <em>Comptroller v. NCR Corp., </em>71 Md.App. at 133, 524 A.2d at 101. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">NCR assails the Court of Special Appeals for what the taxpayer perceives as that court\u2019s failure to give proper deference to the Tax Court\u2019s findings, as required by the emphatic teaching of <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985). The Court of Special Appeals understood and accepted that teaching. Judge Bishop, writing for the intermediate appellate court, pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">As we explained in section II [of the opinion], a tax court receives considerable deference regarding its factual and law to fact determinations. A reviewing court may not disturb findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Ramsay, Scarlett, </em>302 Md. at 834, 490 A.2d 1296____ Similarly, determinations involving mixed questions of fact and law must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>affirmed if, after deferring to the Tax Court\u2019s expertise and to the presumption that the decision is correct, <em>\u201ca </em>reasoning mind could have reached the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion.\u201d ... <em>[A]ccord Ramsay, Scarlett, </em>302 Md. at 838, 490 A.2d 1296.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>Comptroller v. NCR, </em>71 Md.App. at 133, 524 A.2d at 101 [other citation omitted]. But as the Court of Special Appeals also recognized, if the Tax Court\u2019s legal conclusions are wrong, a reviewing court may \u201csubstitute the correct legal principles. <em>Ramsay, Scarlett, </em>302 Md. at 834, 490 A.2d 1296____\u201d <em>Id. See also Washington Nat\u2019l Arena v. Comptroller, </em>308 Md. 370, 378-380, 519 A.2d 1277, 1281-1282 (1987). We now explain why the Tax Court (and the circuit court) erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Factually, the Tax Court was unassailably correct in finding that \u201cthe banks, government agencies, and other organizations\u201d that produced the DPI \u201care not part of the unitary business of NCR.\u201d But legally, the Tax Court was wrong in concluding that the interest payers had to be a part of NCR\u2019s business for apportionment to apply. If that legal standard is correct, then Maryland could not apportion the income derived by NCR from the sale of a cash register to any out-of-state supermarket unaffiliated with NCR, for the supermarket also would not be part of NCR\u2019s unitary business. In other words, the focus of the inquiry is on the relationship of the activity in question with the unitary business, not on the identity of the business payer. <em>Xerox, </em>290 Md. at 144, 428 A.2d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The Tax Court derived its legal standard from dicta in <em>Mobil, supra. </em>In that case the Supreme Court affirmed the apportionability by Vermont of dividend income from Mobil\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The Court cautioned, however, that not all dividend income of an interstate unitary business is necessarily taxable. \u201cWhere the business activities of the dividend payor have nothing to do with the activities of the recipient in the taxing State, due process considerations might well preclude apportionability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>because there would be no underlying unitary business.\u201d 445 U.S. at 442, 100 S.Ct. at 1234, 63 L.Ed.2d at 523-524.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">This view was applied in <em>ASARCO, supra. </em>ASARCO\u2019s general unitary business was the mining, smelting, and refining of nonferrous metals in various states. Its specific activities in Idaho (the taxing state) had to do with silver mining. The income Idaho sought to apportion consisted chiefly of dividends and interest from certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries. The Supreme Court accepted Idaho\u2019s own fact-finding which showed that the degree of control ASARCO exercised over the subsidiaries was insufficient to bring them within ASARCO\u2019s unitary business. Under these circumstances, the Court rejected Idaho\u2019s argument that \u201ccorporate <em>purpose </em>should define unitary business ... [and that] intangible income should be considered a part of a unitary business if the intangible property ... is \u2018acquired, managed or disposed of for purposes relating or contributing to the taxpayer\u2019s business.\u2019 \u201d 458 U.S. at 326, 102 S.Ct. at 3114, 73 L.Ed.2d at 801 (quoting from Idaho\u2019s brief) [emphasis in original].</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In so doing the Court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anx\">[Idaho\u2019s] definition of unitary business would destroy the concept. The business of a corporation requires that it earn money to continue operations and to provide a return on its invested capital. Consequently <em>all </em>of its operations, including any investment made, in some sense can be said to be \u201cfor purposes related to or contributing to the [corporation\u2019s] business.\u201d When pressed to its logical limit, this conception of the \u201cunitary business\u201d limitation becomes no limitation at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting from Idaho\u2019s brief) [emphasis in original].</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">What is important about <em>ASARCO </em>is its factual foundation. The subsidiaries in question there were discrete business enterprises, that is, they had no connection whatsoever with ASARCO\u2019s Idaho activities. The interest payers here involved were also not part of NCR\u2019s business machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>enterprise, nor were they controlled by NCR. But to paraphrase <em>Mobil, </em>only if \u201cthe income was earned in the course of activities unrelated to [NCR\u2019s unitary activities in Maryland]\u201d would Maryland be prevented from taxing it. <em>Mobil, </em>445 U.S. at 439, 100 S.Ct. at 1232, 63 L.Ed.2d at 522, quoted in <em>ASARCO, </em>458 U.S. at 317, 102 S.Ct. at 3109, 73 L.Ed.2d at 795. Several cases illustrate approaches other states have taken to the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In <em>Champion Int\u2019l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, </em>88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300 (App.1975), Champion International challenged tax assessments by New Mexico\u2019s Commissioner of Revenue on \u201cshort-term investments and highly liquid assets from which interest income was derived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 540 P.2d at 1303. This income was used when \u201cneeded for future business activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The court found that \u201ca normal and customary practice by Champion was to invest excess capital, not needed for business purposes, in short-term securities [and that] ... this was a specific function done in the regular course of Champion\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 540 P.2d at 1303. Consequently, it concluded that the interest income was \u201cbusiness income\u201d within the meaning of N.M.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 72-15A-17(A) (Repl.Vol. 10, pt. 2, 1973 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">As to Champion\u2019s constitutional claims, the court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">The Commissioner\u2019s decision does not tax out-of-state activity. Neither does the tax statute. The taxation is not beyond the state\u2019s taxing authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Champion\u2019s claim of unconstitutionality based on taxation of out-of-state activity, and its claim that the imposition of the tax is beyond the taxing authority of New Mexico, are both groundless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">88 N.M. at 417, 540 P.2d at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Of like tenor is <em>Atlantic Ritchfield Co. v. State, </em>198 Colo. 413, 601 P.2d 628 (1979). <em>Atlantic Ritchfield </em>concerned Colorado\u2019s authority to tax interest income and capital gains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>derived from the sale of certain of Atlantic Ritchfield\u2019s corporate assets, located outside of Colorado. The Court engaged in a lengthy discussion of whether the interest and capital gains were \u201cbusiness income\u201d within the context of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 24-60-1301, Art. IV(l)(a) (1973). Noting that \u201c[historically, Ritchfield, as part of its business operations, has regularly engaged in major acquisitions and dispositions of the same type involved here, [and that] ... [s]uch acquisitions and dispositions of assets constitute a systematic and recurrent business practice,\u201d the court concluded the capital gains and interest constituted \u201cbusiness income.\u201d 198 Colo, at 418, 601 P.2d at 632. The court summarily dismissed Atlantic Ritchfield\u2019s due process claim concluding that \u201cthe apportionment formula is reasonably related to Ritchfield\u2019s business activities in Colorado and, therefore, is constitutional.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">In <em>Qualls v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., </em>266 Ark. 207, 585 S.W.2d 18 (1979), the Supreme Court of Arkansas upheld state taxation of Montgomery Ward\u2019s interest income derived from loans and advances to out-of-state corporate relatives which were not part of its unitary business. In addressing Montgomery Ward\u2019s due process challenge, the court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Income earned in Arkansas went into Ward\u2019s working capital. In the regular course of Ward\u2019s business, loans and advances to related corporations earned interest which also went into working capital, a part of which was used to carry on operations in Arkansas. The interest goes into a fund that will be used, in part, in Arkansas, and the supplies and services received from the borrowers contribute to the conduct of Ward\u2019s business in Arkansas. These facts provide the necessary nexus, not to justify taxation of the total amount of this interest income, but to justify taxing that portion attributable to Arkansas under the three-factor apportionment formula.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 230, 585 S.W.2d at 30.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">These cases, of course, all were decided before <em>Mobil, Exxon, </em>and <em>ASARCO. </em>But similar results were reached in two <em>Tpost-ASARCO </em>cases involving facts like the ones before us. In <em>Lone Star Steel Co. v. Dolan, </em>668 P.2d 916 (Colo.1983), the Supreme Court of Colorado upheld a state tax on Lone Star\u2019s interest income derived from short-term loans made to its out-of-state parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Lone Star had argued that \u201cunder <em>ASARCO </em>the interest paid by [its parent was] ... not apportionable because [the parent was] ... not engaged in a unitary business with [it]____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 924. The court, citing Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissent in <em>ASARCO </em>(458 U.S. at 337, 102 S.Ct. at 3120, 73 L.Ed.2d at 808) and the majority\u2019s response in note 21 of that case <em>(id. </em>at 324 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. at 3113 n. 21, 73 L.Ed.2d at 800 n. 21), concluded that <em>ASARCO </em>was not controlling. 668 P.2d at 925. The Colorado court distinguished <em>ASARCO </em>thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\"><em>ASARCO </em>could legitimately be viewed as engaging in two businesses: nonferrous metal mining and \u201cdiscrete business enterprises.\u201d Because the Court concluded that these two functions were not the same unitary business, it held the dividends and interest to be nontaxable in Idaho. It cannot reasonably be said, however, that Lone Star is engaged in two separate businesses\u2014the integrated steel business and the short-term lending business. Instead, it is engaged in only one business\u2014the integrated steel business\u2014and <em>it lends money to its parent in furtherance of the goals, and to aid the operations, of its unitary business.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">* * # * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Consequently, we hold that the interest from Lone Star\u2019s short-term loans to Northwest results from Lone Star\u2019s unitary steel business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 925 [emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>Silent Hoist &amp; Crane v. Taxation Div. Director, </em>100 N.J. 1, 494 A.2d 775, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 995, 106 S.Ct. 409, 88 L.Ed.2d 359 (1985), involved a similar situation. There Silent Hoist contested New Jersey\u2019s apportionment of income generated from the purchase of real property in New York and from investment of corporate funds in securities. The court found the income to be properly apportionable to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Although, it recognized \u201cthat a corporation will not be deemed a unitary corporation merely because the income from a subsidiary or a division adds to the richness of the corporation, [the court found that] ... the evidence [did] ... not establish that any of the alleged operations were conducted as a discrete business enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21, 494 A.2d at 785. Among the factors considered critical to the court\u2019s determination were that (1) a single employee exercised control over all of Silent Hoist\u2019s business operations; (2) the corporation utilized but a single bank account, in which all receipts were deposited and out of which nearly all expenses were paid; (3) and the real property in question was purchased and maintained with corporate funds. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21, 494 A.2d at 784-785. Consideration of \u201cthe combination of [all] these factors [led the court] ... indisputably to the conclusion that Silent Hoist [was] a unitary corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 494 A.2d at 785-786.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">In short, the Tax Court was legally wrong when it concluded that it had to exclude the DPI from apportionment merely because the interest payers were independent of NCR. In its most recent discussion of the \u201cunitary\u201d issue, the Supreme Court said that unitariness is demonstrated by \u201csome sharing or exchange of value not capable of precise identification or measurement\u2014beyond the mere flow of funds arising out of a passive investment or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>distinct business operation____\u201d <em>Container Corp., </em>463 U.S. at 166, 103 S.Ct. at 2940, 77 L.Ed.2d at 554. The evidence before the Tax Court did not show that the investments which produced the DPI were passive. They were actively monitored and carefully timed so as to meet NCR\u2019s operating needs. And they did not arise- out of a distinct business operation \u2014that is, a money-lending operation, as opposed to the business machine business. As NCR\u2019s Mr. Jones testified before the Tax Court: \u2018.\u2018The funds are turned over and are available for whatever business reason may be necessary at that time, such as debt retirement, [or] acquisition.\u201d Record Extract at 47. Mr. Jones also explained that the DPI money was mingled in a general fund, along with income from the sales of equipment. Money from that fund (including DPI) would even be used to fund daily operations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9G\">[w]here we have a negative cash position. If the day\u2019s receipts do not equal the day\u2019s disbursements, then we would be in a negative position and that negative position would have to be funded. And those funds would come from the general funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Record Extract at 103-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">This uncontradicted testimony strongly suggests, as did the evidence in <em>Lone Star, </em>that the interest income was received and used in furtherance of NCR\u2019s unitary business. Nor is there anything in the record to suggest that none of the DPI was available for support of NCR\u2019s activities in Maryland. We may contrast this record with that in <em>AS ARCO, </em>where \u201c[t]he trial court ... found [that ASARCO had] ... \u2018sufficient cash flow from mining to provide operating capital for all mining operations without reliance upon cash flow from ... income from intangibles.\u2019 \u201d 458 U.S. at 324 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. at 3113 n. 21, 73 L.Ed.2d at 800 n. 21 (quoting from the trial record).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We shall not, of course, indulge in the Tax Court\u2019s fact-finding function. It was NCR that had the burden of proving that its DPI should be excluded from Maryland apportionment. <em>Container Corp., </em>463 U.S. at 164, 103 S.Ct. at 2939-2940, 77 L.Ed.2d at 552, <em>Xerox, </em>290 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>138-139, 428 A.2d at 1215. As was the case in <em>Mobil, </em>NCR has failed to sustain that burden. <em>Mobil, </em>445 U.S. at 442, 100 S.Ct. at 1234, 63 L.Ed.2d at 523-524. Given that failure, and the Tax Court\u2019s use of an incorrect legal standard, we hold that the DPI is subject to apportionment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">III. Adjustment of the Apportionment Formula</p>\n<p id=\"Azv\">Included in NCR\u2019s federal taxable income for 1976 and 1977 were both dividends for the tax years 1976 and 1977 and royalty income for the tax years 1972 through 1977. The royalties were paid to NCR by some ten foreign subsidiaries, one 70 percent owned by NCR, the others wholly owned. The royalty payments were made under licensing agreements whereby the subsidiaries compensated NCR for the right to use certain trademarks, patentable and nonpatentable \u201cknow-how\u201d and trade secrets. The dividends and royalties formed part of NCR\u2019s business income for purposes of Md. Code (1980 Repl. Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 316 (c), a proposition NCR does not now challenge. Under \u00a7 316 (c) the \u201cportion of the business income\u201d of a unitary business \u201callowable to this State\u201d\u2014that is, the taxpayer\u2019s Maryland tax liability\u2014is determined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">by using a three-factor (sales, property and payroll) apportionment formula, each \u201cfactor\u201d being a fraction. The numerator of the sales factor, for example, is the amount of a corporation\u2019s in-state sales; the denominator of the sales factor is the total amount of a corporation\u2019s in-state and out-of-state sales. The property and payroll factors are computed in the same manner. The three factors are averaged and the resulting fraction, expressed as a percentage, is multiplied by the corporation\u2019s business income. The resulting dollar amount constitutes the business income apportioned to this State. The applicable tax rate is then applied to the corporation\u2019s apportioned income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"><em>Xerox, </em>290 Md. at 130, 428 A.2d at 1211. In other words, the Maryland share of the apportionable income is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>1 .Md. tangible property Md. payroll Md. sales, 3 'All tangible property + All payroll + All sales</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Random House v. Comptroller, </em>310 Md. at 701, 531 A.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Although the Comptroller included the dividend and royalty income in NCR\u2019s apportionable income, he did not reflect, in the denominators of the formula, the property, payroll, and sales values of the subsidiaries that generated the dividend and royalty income. NCR insists that the formula should have been adjusted to include these values. It argues that to include the income paid to NCR by the subsidiaries, but to exclude the subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales figures, impermissibly skews the formula by apportioning to Maryland an unduly large share of NCR\u2019s business income. The adjustments NCR seeks, it says, are required by the foreign commerce and due process clauses of the United States Constitution, as well as by the correct reading of \u00a7 316.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>We can dispose of the foreign commerce argument in short order. The issue was not raised in the Tax Court, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, or the Court of Special Appeals. NCR\u2019s petition for certiorari is silent on that subject. The question is not before us. <em>See </em>former Md. Rules 885 and 813 a and present Rules 8-131 (a) and 8-131 (b)(1). The other two contentions require more extensive consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">A. <em>Interpretation of Article 81, \u00a7316 (c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">If, as NCR asserts, \u00a7 316 (c) mandates the formula adjustments it seeks, we need proceed no further. We turn to that problem first.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Section 316 (c) is not too explicit as to what the apportionment formula must contain. The statute speaks only of \u201ca three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, in which each factor shall be given equal weight and in which the property factor shall include rented as well as owned property and tangible personal property having a permanent situs within this State and used in the trade or business shall be included as well as real property.\u201d The Comptroller\u2019s regulations in effect for tax years 1976 and 1977 added some flesh to the statutory bones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzvR\">b. [Tjhere shall be allocated to this State such percentage [of business income] ... as the average value of the property ... and business within this State and payroll within this State bears to the average value of the <em>total </em>property ... and <em>total </em>business and <em>total </em>payroll____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">f. The business within this State shall be measured by the ratio of the gross sales [within Maryland, as defined] ... to the gross sales made <em>everywhere </em>during the taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Comptroller\u2019s Regulation 4A (5), revised 1 January 1968 [emphasis supplied]. The current regulations are very sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ilar. <em>See </em>Md. Regs. Code tit. 3, \u00a7 03.04.01.03.0(2), (3), (5), and (6) (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Pointing to this language, NCR avers that both \u201ctotal\u201d and \u201ceverywhere\u201d mean what they say; the words are all inclusive and require the Comptroller to include worldwide values in the denominators of the formula. It finds support for its position in <em>Kellogg Co. v. Herrington, </em>216 Neb. 138, 343 N.W.2d 326 (1984). NCR\u2019s reading of <em>Kellogg </em>is accurate, but that will avail it naught. The case\u2019s reasoning is wholly inconsistent with the Maryland approach to statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Nebraska plan for taxing unitary businesses, as revealed in <em>Kellogg, </em>is much like ours. Nebraska, like Maryland, starts with federal taxable income. In the case of a unitary business operating partly within and partly without Nebraska, the federal taxable income (after certain state adjustments are made) is, as in Maryland, apportioned by use of a three-factor formula. The denominators consist of \u201call\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s real and tangible property, \u201call\u201d of its sales, and payroll \u201ceverywhere.\u201d Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 77-2744, 77-2747, and 77-2749 (Reissue 1981). The similarity to the language of the Maryland regulations is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Kellogg was a multijurisdictional corporation engaged in the unitary business of manufacturing and selling food products. It had 17 foreign subsidiaries from which it received dividends and \u201cknow how\u201d fees (like royalties). The Nebraska tax authorities declined to exclude the dividends and fees from federal taxable income. They also refused to include the subsidiaries\u2019 property, sales, and payroll values in the denominators of the formula. The trial court, to the contrary, concluded that worldwide income and worldwide property, sales, and payroll figures should be used. The Supreme Court of Nebraska took a slightly different approach, reaching a result virtually identical to the one NCR seeks here.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The <em>Kellogg </em>court first pointed out that Nebraska\u2019s federal taxable income beginning point precluded inclusion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>unitary business\u2019s worldwide income in the apportionable income figure. The income of the foreign subsidiaries simply was not part of federal taxable income. That portion of the analysis seems unexceptionable. Next, however, the court invoked various canons of statutory construction, particularly the \u201cplain language\u201d rule. Applying them with remorseless rigidity, it read \u201call\u201d and \u201ceverywhere\u201d as statutorily mandating inclusion of the worldwide property values of both Kellogg and its subsidiaries in the formula denominators. 216 Neb. at 145-149, 343 N.W.2d at 331-333.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">This exercise in statutory construction produced the lowest possible tax for Kellogg under the formula and, according to one commentator \u201cthrust the revenue position of Nebraska into confusion____\u201d Comment, \u201cUnitary Taxation: An Analysis of State Taxation of Multijurisdictional Corporations in Nebraska,\u201d 64 Neb.L.Rev. 135, 136 (1985). We decline to follow <em>Kellogg, </em>not because to do so would reduce Maryland revenues, but because to do so would repudiate settled Maryland law dealing with statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Supreme Court of Nebraska, as we have noted, mechanically applied canons of statutory construction. It was heedless of legislative intent and legislative history. Indeed, the result it reached, it confessed, \u201cprobably ... does not provide the State with the result it had hoped to obtain by adopting the ... Act.\u201d 216 Neb. at 149, 343 N.W.2d at 332. And it admitted that under its interpretation the \u201cState realizes the smallest tax possible\u201d\u2014an outcome that was \u201cnot what the legislature intended____\u201d 216 Neb. at 148-149, 343 N.W.2d at 332-333.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But in Maryland we do not engage in mindless application of canons of statutory construction. We look at statutory language in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>context; we consider legislative history when it is available. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. at 514-516, 525 A.2d at 632-633. Our endeavor always is to construe a statute so as to implement the legislative goal, not to frustrate it. <em>Neal v. Fisher, </em>312 Md. 685, 692, 541 A.2d 1314, 1318 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We have already held that the goal of \u00a7 316 (c) is \u201ctaxation of so much of a corporation\u2019s net income as is constitutionally permissible.\u201d <em>Xerox, </em>290 Md. at 142, 428 A.2d at 1217. <em>See also Random House, </em>310 Md. at 700, 531 A.2d at 684-685. It is also reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended to draft a law that was internally consistent. <em>See </em>Comment, 64 Neb.L.Rev. at 179. Article 81, \u00a7 280A (a) establishes a corporate taxpayer\u2019s federal taxable income as the beginning point for apportionment. We read \u00a7 316 (a) and its implementing regulations as applying to that same corporate taxpayer. That is, it is the taxpayer\u2019s property, sales, and payroll values, in Maryland and in total or everywhere, that enter the formula. \u201cThe taxpayer\u201d does not, of course, include the taxpayer\u2019s subsidiaries or their property, sales, and payroll values, just as the subsidiaries\u2019 income is not included in the taxpayer\u2019s federal taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">This construction of the statute will effectuate apparent legislative goals and is fully consistent with the language of the statute and the regulations. Accordingly, we reject NCR\u2019s proposed construction of \u00a7 316 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">B. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">NCR strenuously contends that our construction of \u00a7\u00a7 280A and 316 (c), as applied to its circumstances, deprives it of due process of law. It insists that when royalty income and foreign subsidiary dividend income are included in the apportionable income, but the subsidiaries\u2019 property, sales, and payroll values used in producing that income are excluded from the formula denominators, then the result is unconstitutionally skewed in favor of the Comptroller. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>remedy, it asserts, is to require the Comptroller to modify the formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">There is no doubt that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">an apportionment formula must, under both the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, be fair____ The first, and again obvious, component of fairness in an apportionment formula is what might be called internal consistency \u2014that is, the formula must be such that, if applied by every jurisdiction, it would result in no more than all of the unitary business income being taxed. The second and more difficult requirement is what might be called external consistency\u2014the factor or factors used in the apportionment formula must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated.

Co. v. Bair, </em>437 U.S. at 272, 98 S.Ct. at 2344, 57 L.Ed.2d at 204) [citations omitted; emphasis in original]. Nor do we doubt that if a tax as applied is unfair in the constitutional sense <em>{i.e., </em>unconstitutional), the Comptroller may be required to modify the \u00a7 316 (c) formula to produce a constitutional result. Ordinarily, formula modification is within the Comptroller\u2019s discretion. <em>See Random House v. Comptroller, </em>310 Md. at 705, 531 A.2d at 687; <em>Chesapeake Industries v. Comptroller, </em>59 Md.App. 370, 382, 475 A.2d 1224, 1230 (1984). Section 316 (c) grants him \u201cthe right\u201d to do so \u201cin those cases where circumstances warrant____\u201d When application of the formula yields an unconstitutional outcome, the right becomes a duty. The question is whether NCR has demonstrated that in this case there is such an outcome. We address that question while remaining mindful that NCR does not question that all the activities and income involved here are part of a unitary business. The issue that was before the Supreme Court in <em>ASARCO, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>supra, </em>(whether certain income payers were part of a unitary business) is not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Comm\u2019r of Taxes, supra, </em>the Vermont Department of Taxes included Mobil Oil\u2019s foreign subsidiary dividend income in that state\u2019s apportionable income. But in its three-factor formula application, the department failed to include the property, payroll and sales factors responsible for producing the foreign subsidiary dividend income. For reasons that are not important here, the majority declined to decide \u201cwhether application of Vermont\u2019s formula produced a fair attribution of [Mobil Oil\u2019s] ... dividend income to that State.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil, </em>445 U.S. at 434, 100 S.Ct. at 1230, 63 L.Ed.2d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Justice Stevens, however, did reach the issue. In a strongly worded dissent he remarked that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">But of greatest importance, the record contains no information about the payrolls, sales or property values of any of those corporations, and Vermont has made no attempt to incorporate them into the apportionment formula computations. Unless the sales, payroll, and property values connected with the production of income by the payor corporations are added to the denominator of the apportionment formula, the inclusion of earnings attributable to those corporations in the apportionable tax base will inevitably cause Mobil\u2019s Vermont income to be overstated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 460-461, 100 S.Ct. at 1243, 63 L.Ed.2d at 535 (Stevens, J., dissenting) [footnote omitted].</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Justice Stevens thus concluded that \u201cVermont\u2019s apportionment formula [had] ... been applied in an arbitrary and unconstitutional way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 100 S.Ct. at 1238, 63 L.Ed.2d at 530. Vermont had in his opinion \u201cindefensibly used its apportionment methodology artificially to multiply its share of Mobil\u2019s 1970 taxable income perhaps as much as tenfold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 100 S.Ct. at 1243, 63 L.Ed.2d at 535. <em>Also see Random House, </em>310 Md. at 708, 531 A.2d at 689 (quoting Justice Steven\u2019s dissent). This prompted him to propose what he viewed as a permissible application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>three-factor formula-\u2014one which \u201cfairly summarizes consolidated earnings, and takes the payroll, sales and property of the payor corporations into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 100 S.Ct. at 1244, 63 L.Ed.2d at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">It is NCR\u2019s notion that the Supreme Court has now adopted Justice Stevens\u2019s lone dissent. It claims that this metamorphosis was achieved via footnote 5 in <em>Container Corp., supra. </em>NCR is indulging in wishful thinking. In the course of rejecting Container Corporation\u2019s claim of unconstitutional application of an apportionment formula, the Court did refer to Justice Stevens\u2019s <em>Mobil </em>dissent. But to say that the Court adopted that dissent is wrong.

In point of fact, the <em>Container Corp. </em>Court, instead of adopting the sort of per se rule advocated by Justice Stevens, said that a court \u201cwill [only] strike down the application of an apportionment formula if the taxpayer can prove \u2018by clear and cogent evidence that the income attributed to the state is in fact out of all proportion to the business transacted ... in that State or has led to a grossly distorted result\u2019____\u201d <em>Container Corp., </em>463 U.S. at 170, 103 S.Ct. at 2942, 77 L.Ed. at 556 (quoting <em>Moorman Mfg.

Even a recent state appellate decision on the subject has not gone as far as the Stevens/NCR position.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\"><em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, </em>143 Wis.2d. 533, 422 N.W.2d 629 (1988), was a case in which the taxing authority included in A.T. &amp; T.\u2019s apportionable income dividends and interest paid to it by its subsidiaries. The authority did not include anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>relative to the subsidiaries in the denominators of the apportionment factor. This, according to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, was unconstitutional because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az1\">the apportionment formula used by the department does not bear a reasonable relation to the corporate activities of the Bell System in Wisconsin; it apportions to Wisconsin far too much income of the Bell System in relation to its property located here, its sales or its payroll____ [T]he taxes which Wisconsin exacts from A.T. &amp; T. are grossly disproportionate to the benefits conferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 549, 422 N.W.2d at 636. <em>But see NCR Corp. v. Comm</em>'r <em>of Revenue, </em>No. 4224 Minn. Tax Court, filed 8 March 1988 [available on WESTLAW, 1988 WL 31675], <em>cert. granted, </em>(Minn. No. \u2014, 11 April 1988) (rejecting claims of NCR similar to those asserted here, and by A.T. &amp; T. in Wisconsin).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">NCR advances the concept that fairness is the test of due process constitutionality in the context of unitary business income taxation. We agree. <em>Random House, </em>310 Md. at 707, 531 A.2d at 688. But as we said also there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4X\">Random House seems to treat the principle of fairness as if it existed independently of the absence of gross disproportionality. In theory, there is only one principle\u2014fairness. But to demonstrate in practice that the principle has been violated in a particular case the taxpayer must prove disproportionality to a constitutionally significant degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\"><em>Id. </em>That, of course, is what A.T. &amp; T. apparently was able to prove in its case in Wisconsin. The intermediate appellate court found gross disproportionality, although the published opinion does not reveal the facts and figures on which that conclusion was based, nor are we made privy to just how \u201cgross\u201d the \u201cdisproportion\u201d was. That is what Mobil failed to prove in its case in Vermont, and later in the Supreme Court. In the Supreme Court, Mobil based its case on a different strategy, and simply did not address the extent of the alleged disproportionality. <em>Mobil Oil, </em>445 U.S. at 434-435, 100 S.Ct. at 1230, 63 L.Ed.2d at 519. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>in our Court, Xerox was unable to convince us that use of the apportionment formula led to a \u201c \u2018grossly distorted result\u2019 \u201d or that the \u201cassessments were \u2018... out of [all] appropriate proportion\u2019 to the business ... transacted in this State.\u201d <em>Xerox, </em>290 Md. at 147, 428 A.2d at 1220 (quoting <em>Moorman Mfg.

The question becomes whether NCR has demonstrated that the existing distortion is so grossly disproportionate that it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">By various exercises in mathematics, NCR purports to show that the formula as applied by the Comptroller has an aggregate denominator 75 percent less than would be the case were the values attributable to its foreign subsidiaries included. The Comptroller responds with a mathematical exercise which purports to show that the difference is in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>neighborhood of 11 percent. In order to determine whether the distortion in taxable income apportionable to Maryland is within the range we found constitutional in <em>Random House, </em>310 Md. at 706-707, 531 A.2d at 688 (10 percent), and the Supreme Court found constitutionally acceptable in <em>Container Corp., </em>463 U.S. at 184, 103 S.Ct. at 2950, 77 L.Ed.2d at 565 (14 percent) but constitutionally unacceptable in <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons Inc. v. North Carolina ex rel. Maxwell, </em>283 U.S. 123, 135, 51 S.Ct. 385, 389, 74 L.Ed. 879, 908 (1931) (250 percent), we must examine the computations of each party.</p>\n<p id=\"ASH\">The proper focus of the inquiry for the purposes of determining apportionment distortion is on \u201cthe percentage increase in taxable income apportioned to [the taxing state]____\u201d <em>Random House, </em>310 Md. at 706, 531 A.2d at 688. <em>Also see Container Corp., </em>463 U.S. at 184, 103 S.Ct. at 2950, 77 L.Ed.2d at 565. Of course taxpayers can, as NCR does here, and as Random House did in that case, present proposals as to how they think the apportionment formula should be structured in a given case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">NCR wants its subsidiaries\u2019 property, sales, and payroll factors included in the formula denominators because dividends and royalties received from the foreign subsidiaries are included in its apportionable income. There is at least one difficulty with this. The royalties do not require the special treatment that NCR requests. If NCR licensed a nonsubsidiary corporation to use certain of its business machinery, patents, and trademarks, the income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>received in exchange would be unitary business income, but surely there would be no requirement to include the licensee\u2019s property, sales, and payroll values in the denominators of the formula. We are dealing here with the sale of a right to use a patent or trademark, which is similar to the sale of a business machine. The fact that in this case licenses were granted to NCR\u2019s subsidiaries does not change the nature of the underlying transaction, just as a sale of a business machine to a subsidiary would be treated like the sale of the same machine to a nonaffiliated customer. Thus, the foreign subsidiary property, payroll, and sales factors which generated NCR\u2019s royalty income should not have been included in the denominators of the apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Nonetheless, it may not be unreasonable to suggest that inclusion of subsidiaries\u2019 dividends in the apportionable income should be balanced by some changes in the formula denominator. But the balancing should not be done by including the total property, sales, and payroll values of the subsidiaries in the formula denominators. Instead, the denominators should be modified by including only those percentages of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales that generated the foreign subsidiary dividend income taxed by Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">As we have seen, certain modifications of the apportionment formula ordered by the Tax Court remain unchallenged and await implementation. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra. </em>Because these modifications and those which might be required due to our holdings in Parts I and II of this opinion have not yet been entered into the apportionment formula calculus, we are unable to determine, in any meaningful way, the extent to which a reasonably structured formula (as we have described it) might differ in its results from a formula which excludes that portion of the foreign subsidiary property, payroll, and sales which generated the dividend income. As a further consequence, we cannot tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>whether disproportionality of constitutional proportions is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We cannot agree with the Court of Special Appeals that NCR has failed to meet its burden of proof on this issue. NCR presented its case to the Tax Court in considerable detail. The presentation included exhibits demonstrating various outcomes based on various adjustments of the formula. Since that time, however, the case has proceeded through numerous stages in the review process. This complex litigation has been further complicated by the several orders for modification of the Comptroller\u2019s taxing scheme and by concessions on the part of both sides. As a matter of fairness, NCR should now have an opportunity to develop facts as to the extent of any disproportionality, in light of the principles now established in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Consequently, we shall direct a remand to the Tax Court. On remand the agency should first implement the uncontested segment of its own order <em>[see </em>note 5, <em>supra] </em>and make any other adjustments to the apportionment formula that are necessitated by our holding in Parts I and II of this opinion. It should then calculate the amount of distortion that occurs when the formula excludes the portions of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 property, payroll, and sales that generated the foreign subsidiary dividend income. After calculating the distortion, the agency should determine whether that distortion is of constitutional dimensions. If so, the formula must be modified to reflect the foreign subsidiary factors. If not, modification is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

NCR offers this example of how gross-up operates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">[I]f a foreign subsidiary of a United States parent earns $100, pays foreign tax of $40, and pays a dividend of $30 out of its after-tax profits of $60, the deemed paid foreign tax credit of the parent under Section 902 (a) is 30/60 x $40, or $20. The parent includes $50 in dividend income <em>(i.e., </em>the actual dividend of $30 plus $20 of \u201cgross-up\") and claims a foreign tax credit of $20 against the [f]ederal income tax on this income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Brief at 4 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. Section 1 of that provision in pertinent part provides that \"[n]o State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law____\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">. Generally speaking \u201ca credit is ... more valuable than a deduction because it reduces tax dollar for dollar____[However,] [b]ecause of the complexity of the separate limitation computations and their effect of reducing prior benefits and because of the reduction in United States tax rates, in some cases taxpayers may wish to deduct their foreign income taxes.\u201d 11 J. Mertens, <em>Law of Federal Income Taxation, </em>\u00a7 45-4.04 (M. Weinstein rev. ed. 1987 &amp; 1988 Cum. Supp.). We presume that NCR acted in its own best interests and that it received financial benefit as a result of its election of the federal tax credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\"><em>.

The Tax Court directed the Comptroller to modify the formula in a number of respects. So far as is pertinent to the present posture of this case, the Comptroller was required to include the royalty, interest, and miscellaneous receipts income (generated by NCR's unitary business) in the denominator of the sales factor; the net book value of the copyrights and patents in the denominator of the property factor; and the expenses for foreign employees in research and development in the denominator of the payroll factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The Comptroller abandoned his claim of error with respect to the Tax Court order to include the research and development, payroll, and miscellaneous receipts in the denominators of the apportionment factor and did not raise these claims in the Court of Special Appeals nor present them to us in a cross-petition for certiorari. Thus, neither our opinion nor that of the Court of Special Appeals affects the validity of these portions of the Tax Court order. <em>See </em>former Md. Rules 813 a, 885, and 1085 and present Rules 8-131 (b)(1) and 8-131 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The remaining portions of the Tax Court order cited above were affirmed by the circuit court. The Comptroller, however, did not raise claims of error as to these directives in the Court of Special Appeals nor did he do so in a cross-petition for certiorari before this Court. Thus, we do not reach these issues and the uncontested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>segment of the Tax Court order remains in effect. <em>See </em>former Md. Rules 813 a and 885 and present Rules 8-131 (b)(1) and 8-131 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. That the legislature did not intend this outcome is suggested by the fact that promptly after <em>Kellogg, </em>it enacted legislation to override the decision. <em>See </em>1984 Neb.

There are many ways to approach the taxation of a multistate business\u2014consolidated returns, combined reports, use of worldwide income and worldwide property, sales and payroll values, without regard to corporate entities.
