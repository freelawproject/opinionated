Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the transitional rules apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and we therefore have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), <em>as amended by </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c), <em>Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1195 n. 4 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in failing to address Tabino\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because Tabino failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). <em>Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1125 (9th Cir.2000). Tabino did not file an affidavit detailing the agreement between himself and former counsel, nor did he inform former counsel of the allegations leveled against him, or explain to the BIA why he never lodged a formal complaint against former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary committee. The record does not show a \u201cclear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d that would excuse <em>Lozada </em>compliance. <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir.2000). Furthermore, even if Tabino had complied with <em>Lozada, </em>the record does not show that Tabino suffered any actual prejudice due to ineffective representation. <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Mohsseni v. INS, </em>796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. The BIA pointed to contradictions in Tabino\u2019s testimony, to suspect documentary evidence, and to the implausibility of Tabino\u2019s story in making its finding. Absent credible evidence, Tabino\u2019s asylum application must fail. <em>Berroteran-Melendez v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>INS, </em>955 F.2d 1251, 1256-58 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b786-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
