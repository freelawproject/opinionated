Beckwith, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In 1999, a federal jury convicted Blanca Vega of several drug-related charges. She was allowed to remain free on bond, but failed to appear at her sentencing hearing. Vega subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to appear at this hearing, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1). On December 8, 2000, she was sentenced to twelve months of imprisonment on this charge, which was made consecutive to a sentence of seventy-eight months on her drug-related convictions. The district court also imposed a concurrent term of three years of supervised release. Vega now appeals her conviction and the sentence that she received for failing to appear. Upon examination, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The attorney who represented Vega on her failure-to-appear charge has filed a motion to withdraw, with a brief indicating that there are no colorable issues to appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Vega has not filed a timely response to this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The rearraignment transcript indicates that Vega\u2019s guilty plea was valid and that the district court substantially complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">11. The court determined that Vega was competent and that she understood her rights, the nature of the charges and the consequences of her plea. Vega acknowledged a factual basis for her plea and clearly indicated that the decision to plead guilty was voluntary. She was represented by counsel and has not made any attempt to withdraw her plea. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the current record does not reveal any viable claim regarding Vega\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">The presentence report indicated that the offense level for Vega\u2019s failure to appear was 15 and that her total offense level was 28, when this offense was grouped with her drug-related convictions. This yielded a sentencing guideline range of 78-97 months. Vega filed only one objection to the presentence report regarding her current conviction, arguing that she was entitled to a reduction in her offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. However, counsel subsequently withdrew this objection, and Vega did not raise any legal arguments at sentencing regarding her conviction for failing to appear. Thus, she has forfeited any sentencing claims that she might have in the absence of plain error that affects her substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Barajas-Nunez, </em>91 F.3d 826, 830 (6th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">No sentencing error is apparent from the present record. A reduction for acceptance of responsibility does not apply when multiple counts are combined unless responsibility is accepted for all of the counts. <em>See United States v. Chambers, </em>195 F.3d 274, 278-79 (6th Cir.1999). Thus, the district court did not err by declining to reduce Vega\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 3E1.1, as her testimony at trial was not consistent with an acceptance of responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>bility regarding her drug-related charges. The twelve month sentence that Vega received for failing to appear was authorized by statute, and her total sentence fell near the middle of the applicable guideline range. Hence, it appears that any direct challenge to Vega\u2019s sentence would be unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We note that Vega\u2019s drug-related sentences are the subject of a separate appeal, and our opinion here is not intended as a ruling on any of the arguments that may be raised therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
