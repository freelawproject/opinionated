The district court sentenced Watie to 84 months imprisonment and three years supervised release. Counsel has moved to withdraw on appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief raising the issue whether the district court should have departed downward based on Watie\u2019s substantial assistance. Watie has filed a pro se supplemental brief, essentially challenging various base-offense-level enhancements, complaining that his counsel should have consulted with him before filing the <em>Anders </em>brief, and arguing that the district court did not thoroughly examine the plea agreement before sentencing. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">We first reject the <em>Anders </em>brief argument. The plea agreement was silent as to the possible provision of substantial assistance, the government did not move for a departure at sentencing, and the district court could not grant a departure absent such a motion. <em>See United States v. Wilkerson, </em>179 F.3d 1083, 1085 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">We also reject Watie\u2019s pro se arguments. First, Watie cannot challenge the base-offense-level enhancements because he stipulated to them in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (\u201cdefendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to a specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal\u201d). Second, Watie is not entitled to reversal on the basis that counsel failed to consult with him before filing the <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>Cf. United States ex rel. Russo v. Attorney Gen., </em>780 F.2d 712, 715 (7th Cir.) (per curiam) (agreeing with Fourth Circuit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>actual consultation with defendant prior to filing of <em>Anders </em>brief is not constitutionally required), <em>cert, denied, </em>476 U.S. 1185, 106 S.Ct. 2922, 91 L.Ed.2d 550 (1986). Third, the district court complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. ll(e)\u2019s requirements regarding the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">After review of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, along with our independent review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
