We have carefully reviewed Mr. Mandel\u2019s arguments and the materials provided. However, we discern no basis for overturning the finding that Mr. Mandel\u2019s failure to report his employment with both the Nassau County Department of Corrections and Westchester County Department of Safety, on several employment forms and during his personal interview, was grounds for dismissal. Similarly, the Board\u2019s finding that Mr. Mandel engaged in negligent conduct during prior employment is supported by substantial evidence. The Board\u2019s decision must be <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-32\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
