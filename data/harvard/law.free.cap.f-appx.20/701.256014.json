Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 945.3. This section prevents defendants in criminal actions from filing civil suits against \u201cpeace officers\u201d while the criminal case is still pending in a \u201cjustice, municipal, or superior court\u201d and tolls the statute of limitations on the civil action until the criminal charges are resolved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The criminal case against Yurgil was not pending in a \u201cjustice, municipal or superior court,\u201d but rather in a military court under the authority of the California National Guard, so the tolling provision does not apply. His claim against the federal officer, like his claims against the other defendants, is barred by the one year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-24\">.
