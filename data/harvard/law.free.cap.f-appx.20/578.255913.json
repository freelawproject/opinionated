Larry G. Massanari has been appointed to serve as Acting Commissioner of Social Security, and is substituted as appellee pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b609-11\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">Helen Marie Lee appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits. Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Hunt v. Massanari, </em>250 F.3d 622, 623-24 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">In her January 1995 application, Lee claimed disability since August 1994 from back problems. After a March 1998 hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) found Lee not disabled, because-although she could not perform her past relevant work-she could perform jobs identified by a vocational expert to whom a hypothetical had been posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">Contrary to Lee\u2019s assertions on appeal, we conclude the ALJ (1) developed the record fully and fairly, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1517 (2001); (2) made residual-functional-capacity and credibility findings which are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, <em>see Ply v. Massanari, </em>251 F.3d 777, 779 (8th Cir. 2001) (per curiam); <em>Dunahoo v. Apfel, </em>241 F.3d 1033, 1038 (8th Cir.2001); (3) considered Lee\u2019s impairments in combination, <em>see Hajek v. Shalala, </em>30 F.3d 89, 92 (8th Cir. 1994); (4) properly found Lee\u2019s lumbar disc disease was not of listing-level severity, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 1.05(C) (2001); and (5) met his burden at step five of the sequential evaluation process, <em>see Hunt, </em>250 F.3d at 625. We decline to consider Lee\u2019s remaining arguments. <em>See Planet Prods., Inc. v. Shank, </em>119 F.3d 729, 732 (8th Cir.1997); <em>Misner v. Chater, </em>79 F.3d 745, 746 (8th Cir.1996); <em>Primary Care Investors, Seven, Inc. v. PHP Healthcare Corp., </em>986 F.2d 1208, 1212 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-14\">.
