Barrios contends that the district court erred in considering in the same proceeding both Barrios\u2019 motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255 and the Government\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence under Fed. R.Crim.P. 35. Barrios asserts that he would have ended up with a lower sentence if the district court had first considered his \u00a7 2255 claims that he was entitled to relief under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and then reduced his sentence in a separate proceeding under Rule 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-20\">We have recently held that the <em>Appren-di </em>ruling is not applicable retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir. 2001). Therefore, Barrios is entitled to no relief under <em>Apprendi. </em>In addition, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to depart downward to the extent it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">Barrios has filed a pro se, supplemental brief. Our review of these claims convinces us that the issues raised therein entitle him to no relief. We affirm the decision of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
