In 1998, Calixce was convicted following a jury trial of possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. The indictment referenced 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), but not \u00a7 841(b), and did not refer to any specific drug quantity. At sentencing, the court adopted the probation department\u2019s finding regarding drug quantity, and the applicable guideline sentencing range based on that quantity. On direct appeal, Calixce did not challenge his indictment or sentence, but argued only that the district court had erred in denying his pre-trial suppression motion. This court affirmed Calixce\u2019s conviction in an unpublished opinion dated April 2, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">Almost two years later, Calixce filed two motions in district court. The first one was a motion to amend his prison sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The second one was a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and for review of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. The district court denied both motions. We agree with the district court that Calixce has failed to show that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>entitled to the relief that he sought in these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">I. <em>Appeal No. 01-1321: Appeal from Motion to Amend Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d In this case, Calixce claims that Amendment 591 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, effective November 1, 2000, lowered the sentencing range on which his sentence was based. Specifically, he refers to the amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Calixce seems to argue that, Amendment 591 altered the sentencing guidelines by requiring that a sentence may only be based on factors that are specified in the indictment. A review of the sentencing guidelines before and after Amendment 591 took effect belies Calixce\u2019s interpretation. Both the pre- and post-amendment guidelines refer to the \u201coffense conduct charged in the count of indictment\u201d as the basis for determining the appropriate \u201coffense guideline section.\u201d And both the pre- and post-amendment guidelines provide that the applicable \u201coffense guideline range\u201d should be determined \u201cin accordance with \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) .\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(b). The background notes to \u00a7 1B1.3 (both pre- and post-amendment) specifically provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">[e]onduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (backg\u2019d.)(Nov.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The amendment on which Calixce relies did not lower the sentencing range on which his sentence was based. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying him relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). The denial of that motion is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">II. <em>Appeal No. 01-1573: Motion to Dismiss for Want of Jurisdiction and for Review of Sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371*2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">In this motion, Calixce argued that his indictment, conviction and sentence are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He contended that because the indictment failed to specify a drug quantity (as required by Apprendi), it was a nullity and the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case. In the alternative, Calixce argued in his motion, as he does in his brief on appeal, that he is entitled to be resentenced based upon the lowest possible quantity of cocaine under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">The time for Calixce to appeal his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3742 has long since expired. <em>See </em>Fed.RApp.P. 4(b). Moreover, Calixce filed a timely appeal from his sentence in which he did not include the present challenge to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. This court has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">an objection that an indictment fails to state an essential element of an offense \u201cshall be noticed by the court at any time <em>during the pendency of the proceedings.\u201d </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2). This means that the defendant may raise the objection for the first time on appeal or that this court may raise the issue sua sponte.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-13\"><em>United States v. Mojica-Baez, </em>229 F.3d 292, 309 (1st Cir.2000)(emphasis added), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 2215, 150 L.Ed.2d 209 (2001). Because the pen-dency of the proceedings in Calixce\u2019s case had already passed when he filed this mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tion, however, he is not entitled to relief pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2). Instead, the appropriate form in which to raise the <em>Apprendi </em>issue would be a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This court has not yet decided the question whether <em>Apprendi </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review, an issue on which courts are divided. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>260 F.3d 382 (5th Cir.2001) (Circuit Judge Parker, dissenting). We need not reach that question, however, because Calixee\u2019s only reference to \u00a7 2255 in his filings in the district court or this court was in an objection to the government\u2019s suggestion that of one of his motions might be construed as pursuant to \u00a7 2255. In any event, this court has recognized the right of a petitioner to \u201chave his motion decided as he had framed it.\u201d <em>See Raineri v. United States, </em>233 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Calixce is not entitled to the relief he sought pursuant to Rule 12(b) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of that motion is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Calixee\u2019s motion in opposition to consolidation of these appeals is <em>denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
