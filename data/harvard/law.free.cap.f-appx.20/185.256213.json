Wall pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West 2000). Wall argues a 1974 conviction for burglary of a house trailer was improperly used as a sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000). Because he did not raise this nonconstitutional issue in his direct appeal, it is deemed waived in his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 477 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976); <em>United States v. Emanuel, </em>869 F.2d 795, 796 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In his notice of appeal, Wall challenged the district court\u2019s ruling on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim; however, because he did not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his brief, the issue is deemed waived. <em>See Canady v. Crestar Mortgage Corp., </em>109 F.3d 969, 973-74 (4th Cir.1997); 4th Cir. R. 34(b). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of ap-pealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
