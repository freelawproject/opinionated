The district court record reflects Garrett lost his prison job in May 2000 and had no income deposited into his inmate trust account after July 11, 2000. Because the district court did not find that Garrett did in fact have income deposited into his inmate account and did not find that Garrett\u2019s allegation of poverty was untrue, we find the dismissal constituted an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Garrett\u2019s action and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
