Yuriditsky seeks review of a final decision from the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (\u201cOPM\u201d) decision that found Yuriditsky ineligible to receive a discontinued service annuity because his removal was for \u201cmisconduct\u201d as well as lack of a security clearance. <em>Yuriditsky v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DC-0831-01-0063-1-1 (Feb. 23, 2001). Because substantial evidence ultimately supports this decision and because we reject the argument that the Board committed an error of law in reaching its conclusion, we <em>affirm,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Yuriditsky served at the Defense Intelligence Agency (\u201cDIA\u201d), most recently in the position of \u201cSupervisory Intelligence Officer (Military Capabilities).\u201d Although this appeal only concerns Yuriditsky\u2019s eligibility for a discontinued service annuity, the DIA, the Office of Personnel Management and later the Board itself found him ineligible because of removal for \u201cmisconduct,\u201d one of the grounds that renders an employee statutorily ineligible to receive the benefit at issue. Consequently, we must explore the reasons underlying Yuri-ditsky\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">In January 1999, the DIA notified Yuri-ditsky about its intent to revoke his security clearance. As a condition of their employment, all DIA employees must have a security clearance. In a \u201cstatement of reasons\u201d for this intended action, DIA identified the following as information that put Yuriditsky\u2019s security clearance at issue: a 1998 \u00bfrrest for malicious wounding and subsequent conviction and prison sentence for assault and battery; a May 1995 charge and sentence for solicitation, which were eventually dismissed after Yuriditsky had performed 100 hours of community service; an October 1991 charge for \u201ccurse and abuse,\u201d which was later nolle pressed; an October 1996 \u201cverbal altercation\u201d in which Yuriditsky had allegedly threatened \u201cviolence\u201d against another DIA employee and had thereby caused \u201cthat employee to fear for her safety\u201d; and a Fall 1998 incident in which Yuriditsky \u201canonymously transmitted pornographic material to a subordinate co-worker on at least one occasion via the Internet to her personal electronic mail account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">In June 1999, Yuriditsky appeared before DIA officials to address the proposed grounds for revoking his clearance and, in August 1999, a DIA official notified him that DIA was indeed revoking it. In its decision, DIA indicated that Yuriditsky\u2019s actions evidenced an absence of the \u201cjudgment, trustworthiness and personal conduct\u201d needed to function in the workplace and to hold a position \u201cresponsible for protecting National security.\u201d Specifically, the DIA notice stated that Yuriditsky\u2019s \u201crepeated involvement in incidents ... reveal [sic] a pattern of aggressive actions which collectively causes [sic] continual questions about your reliability and stability. You have revealed yourself to be combative, argumentative, and have repeatedly exhibited an explosive temper followed by scurrilous behavior.\u201d After reconsidering its decision (at Yuriditsky\u2019s request), the DIA thereafter notified him that because he no longer held the requisite security clearance, it also intended to remove him from his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>DIA representatives met with Yuridit-sky again to address the intended action and, in February 2000, DIA decided to remove him from his position. At the time of this action, Yuriditsky had worked at the DIA for more than 28 years and had reached the age of 50. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336(d)(1) (West 2001), employees who lose their job or involuntarily \u201cseparate\u201d from government service \u201cafter becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service\u201d may receive a discontinued service annuity unless their separation resulted from \u201cremoval for cause on charges of misconduct.\u201d In a letter dated March 27, 2000, DIA\u2019s personnel office notified OPM that it had removed Yuriditsky \u201cdue to failure to meet a condition of employment (security clearance).\u201d The letter adds that absent the \u201closs of security clearance, there would be no basis (performance or conduct) to remove Mr. Yuriditsky from employment at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Yuriditsky thereafter applied for the discontinued service annuity mentioned above but the OPM denied his application, finding that the documents in Yuriditsky\u2019s file showed that DIA had removed him not only because of the revocation of his security clearance, but also \u201cbecause of criminal and personal misconduct, which led to the revocation.\u201d Following a hearing, the Board affirmed. In so doing, the Board noted that while Yuriditsky had described some of the allegations contained in these documents as either \u201cinaccurate or exaggerated,\u201d he had also admitted to the 1998 conviction and \u201cbrief jail sentence\u201d for assault. In addition, the Board considered Yuriditsky\u2019s assertion that he had pled guilty to this charge only because counsel and the DIA had advised him to do so. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d the Board stated, the evidence still showed that Yuriditsky\u2019s removal rested, \u201cin part, on misconduct to which he had pled guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Here, Yuriditsky first argues that DIA actually removed him because of \u201cwhistle blowing actions\u201d relating to the alleged \u201ccover up of the possible causes of Gulf War Syndrome.\u201d Neither OPM nor the Board considered this \u201ctrue reason\u201d for Yuriditsky\u2019s removal, he argues. At the same time, the record shows that Yuridit-sky never presented this whistle-blowing allegation to the Office of Special Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Yuriditsky also contends that the OPM and the Board \u201cover ruled\u201d our decision in <em>Litzenberger v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>231 F.3d 1333 (Fed.Cir.2000) because, as we understand his argument, OPM had failed to provide him with the criteria it uses to determine \u201cwhat conduct disqualifies an employee from receiving\u201d a discontinued service annuity. Last, Yuri-ditsky argues that the Board erroneously \u201callowed OPM to pursue hearsay and speculative lines of questioning at [his] hearing\u201d and that \u201cDIA\u2019s General Counsel and [his] immediate supervisor advised [him] to accept a plea bargain rather than go to trial.\u201d In a similar vein, he claims that the Board also denied him the opportunity to call an \u201cOPM Benefits Specialist\u201d as a witness who \u201ccould have testified that he was going to approve [Yuriditsky\u2019s application for a discontinued service annuity] until a DIA representative cautioned him against doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">We play only a limited role in reviewing Board decisions. <em>See, e.g., Deweese v. Tennessee Valley Auth., </em>35 F.3d 538, 541 (Fed.Cir.1994). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c), we may reverse the Board only if its decision was: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without the procedures required by law; or (3) not supported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>\u00a7 7703(c). None of these limited grounds was shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">First, Yuriditsky has given us no reason to believe that the Board here had failed to consider his argument that his \u201cwhistle blowing\u201d activities actually led to his dismissal. Indeed, \u201cabsent specific evidence indicating otherwise,\u201d we presume that a fact finder (like the Board) reviewed all the evidence contained in the record, regardless of whether or not it expressly discussed that evidence. <em>See, e.g., Gonzales v. West, </em>218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir.2000). And we agree with the government that this presumption seems particularly appropriate in this case, given that the Board would not have had jurisdiction to consider a whistleblower\u2019s action even if Yuriditsky had separately filed one. <em>See Ward v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed.Cir.1992) (Board has jurisdiction over whistleblower\u2019s action only if petitioner first specified the exact grounds of wrongdoing to the Office of Special Counsel). In the end, it seems just as likely that the Board considered this argument but thought it unnecessary to address in a written opinion. In either event, we discern no error with that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Second, neither the Board nor the OPM \u201cover ruled\u201d or misinterpreted our decision in <em>Litzenberger v. Office of Personnel Management. </em>There, we held that OPM and the Board erred when neither had verified in the first place or reviewed in the second whether the record actually showed the \u201cmisconduct\u201d that could serve as the basis for denying a discontinued service annuity. 231 F.3d at 1336-37 (\u201cOPM could not decide that the removal was for misconduct, a ground not mentioned by the [employing agency], without confronting the issue of privileged testimony. OPM did not do so; and the Board erred in not reviewing this issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Here, on the other hand, OPM and the Board both satisfied their respective roles. As shown by its decision denying the discontinued service annuity, OPM evaluated the record and verified that Yuriditsky\u2019s criminal and personal conduct did indeed lead to the revocation of his security clearance, which in turn led to his automatic dismissal. For its part, the Board did consider the grounds for revocation and finding of \u201cmisconduct,\u201d and it determined that notwithstanding Yuriditsky\u2019s other allegations, Yuriditsky did admit to the conviction that justified the revocation of his clearance and concomitant removal. We believe the Board\u2019s decision, though surely not a paradigm of thoroughness, nevertheless indicated that it had sufficiently reviewed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">We note, too, that neither <em>Litzenberger </em>nor any other authority cited to us required the DIA or OPM to present in advance the written \u201ccriteria\u201d for delineating the specific \u201cmisconduct\u201d that could render an employee ineligible for a discontinued service annuity. To the contrary, <em>Litzenberger </em>merely instructs that OPM and the Board must simply verify and review the grounds cited for the underlying \u201cmisconduct.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that DIA had ultimately removed Yuriditsky for misconduct. As noted, the record contains evidence showing that Yuriditsky had committed several acts \u2014 both criminal and otherwise \u2014 that called into question his character and suitability for both the workplace and for a position involving \u201cNational security.\u201d Stated differently, the record contains sufficient evidence showing that Yuriditsky had committed the \u201cmisconduct\u201d that could have rendered him ineligible to receive an annuity. And while he challenged some of these grounds for misconduct as either false or \u201cexaggerated,\u201d he did admit to the 1998 conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>that formed at least part of the underlying basis for revoking his clearance and for finding \u201cmisconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">That some evidence in the record, including the March 27, 2000, letter from DIA\u2019s personnel office to the OPM, implies that DIA may not have removed Yuridit-sky solely for misconduct cannot change our conclusion. \u201cSubstantial evidence,\u201d the standard of review that we must use here, means evidence sufficient to support a conclusion, even if other evidence in the record could detract from that conclusion. <em>See In re Gartside, </em>203 F.3d 1305, 1312 (Fed.Cir.2000). Again, that evidence (including Yuriditsky\u2019s own testimony) supports the conclusion drawn by the Board here, even if a letter could suggest otherwise. In that situation, we must also leave it to the Board to weigh the conflicting evidence and make the final evidentiary determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Finally, we simply cannot identify, from either the record or the arguments presented, any relevant \u201chearsay and speculative lines of questioning\u201d to which Yuri-ditsky objects. Regardless, the evidence cited in the record, including Yuriditsky\u2019s own testimony, does pass \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d muster. In our view, the Board did not have to believe every ground cited by OPM or DIA in order to uphold the \u201cmisconduct\u201d finding. o And nor did it have to accept Yuriditsky\u2019s argument about pleading guilty to the 1998 assault only because the DIA and counsel had urged him to do so. Yuriditsky pled guilty to the offense, which by itself could have ended the Board\u2019s inquiry about whether he had committed \u201cmisconduct\u201d and had thereby become ineligible to receive the annuity at issue. The Board simply had no obligation to ferret out, much less discuss, <em>every </em>theory of whether a criminal act or \u201cmisconduct\u201d did or did not occur here. Under <em>Litzenberger, </em>it merely had to determine whether DIA had removed Yuriditsky for misconduct and assess whether OPM had so verified. It did.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Similarly, nothing before us explains or shows the circumstances in which the Board allegedly denied Yuriditsky the opportunity to call an \u201cOPM Benefits Specialist\u201d as a witness. But this bald allegation alone cannot warrant reversal either, for even if this witness did testify, we do not understand how that would have undermined the Board\u2019s conclusion. After all, nothing in Yuriditsky\u2019s description of the proposed testimony shows that this witness knew anything more about the facts than any other reviewing tribunal or office. In other words, the \u201copinion\u201d this witness would have purportedly offered appeared to rely on nothing more than speculation or hearsay. Again, this assertion does not disturb either the Board\u2019s finding or our conclusion that substantial evidence supports its ultimate finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
