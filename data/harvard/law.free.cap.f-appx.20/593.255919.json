Burnett challenges the sentence imposed by the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>he pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Mr. Burnett\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in assessing criminal history points for two 1972 crime-of-violence convictions, which (when combined with a prior state conviction for a crime of violence) qualified Mr. Burnett as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Mr. Burnett has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">It is undisputed that in 1989 Mr. Burnett began serving additional time in prison on the 1972 federal offenses after he was released from custody on an intervening state assault conviction. We thus conclude that the district court properly determined Mr. Burnett\u2019s career-offender status, as his return to federal custody occurred within fifteen years of commencing the instant drug offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.2(e) (counting any prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding 13 months, whenever imposed, that resulted in defendant being incarcerated during any part of 15-year period prior to commencement of instant offense), 4B1.2, comment, (n.4) (provisions of \u00a7 4A1.2 apply to counting of convictions under \u00a7 4B1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
