Following the posting of information on the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM\u2019s) web site concerning the awarding of veterans\u2019 hiring preferences under the Veterans Opportunity Act (VEOA) of 1998, Hunt filed a complaint with the Department of Labor on June 24, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 2. In his complaint, Hunt challenged the legitimacy of OPM\u2019s explanation that the veterans\u2019 preferences defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(f) are to be applied to non-status applicants only. <em>Id. </em>OPM\u2019s guidance directed hiring agencies not to credit a preference eligible veteran with a veterans\u2019 preference when that veteran applies for a promotion open only to status applicants, defined as current or certain former federal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">After receiving no response from Labor, Hunt appealed to the Board on August 25, 2000, <em>id. </em>at 2, adding an additional complaint that the OPM guidance would deny the veterans\u2019 preference rights provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3313 for internal candidates passing an examination required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3361 for promotion in the competitive services. The Board then ordered Hunt to prove that the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Acknowledgment Order, No. CH-3443-00-0859-I-1 (MSPB Sept. 26, 2000). Hunt responded that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a(d) grants the Board jurisdiction whenever Labor is unable to resolve a complaint, submitted pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a(a), within sixty days. Brief in Support for Jurisdiction, <em>Hunt </em>(No. CH-3443-00-0859-I-1). Hunt\u2019s brief added an additional complaint that the OPM guidance would deny veterans\u2019 preference rights under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3317-18.-<em>Id. </em>at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">The Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) concluded that Hunt failed to meet his burden of establishing Board jurisdiction because he did \u201cnot allege ... that OPM directly interfered with his candidacy for any specific selection action by his employing agency.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>No. CH-3443-00-0859-I-1, slip op. at 3. The AJ went on to state that Hunt may request, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(f) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1203.11, Board review of the OPM guidance, <em>id. </em>at 3, and that in such a case Hunt\u2019s appeal would fail on the merits because 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(f) does not grant veterans\u2019 preference, and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3313 and 3361 \u201crelate to applicants\u2019 initial entrance into the ' competitive service,\u201d whereas OPM\u2019s guidance addresses only \u201cmerit promotion actions of veterans already employed in the competitive service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The AJ also concluded that Hunt had not alleged that the OPM guidance would violate 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3317-18 and 3361 \u201cas they relate to the appellant\u2019s candidacy for any specified position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Because Hunt did not petition for review by the full Board, the AJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Board. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Hunt timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">The scope of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction is a question of law that we review without deference. <em>Kelley v. MSPB, </em>241 F.3d 1368, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2001). Otherwise, the scope of our review of a decision of the Board is limited. We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision on the merits unless it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Jennings v. MSPB, </em>59 F.3d 159, 160 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">On appeal, Hunt first challenges the Board\u2019s denial of jurisdiction. More specifically, Hunt argues that compliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a(d) provides the Board with jurisdiction as a matter of right and that the Board erred in requiring that he show denial of a specific position. Certain of Hunt\u2019s other arguments are directed at the substance of his claim, <em>ie., </em>that the OPM guidance is inconsistent with the statutory provisions for granting veterans\u2019 preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The government argues that the language of \u00a7 3330a(a)(l) requires Hunt to \u201callege[ ] that an agency has violated [his] rights ... to veterans\u2019 preference\u201d and that Hunt failed to make such an allegation in connection with a specific employment opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We first consider the question of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. In relevant part, VEOA provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-6\">(a)(1) A preference eligible who alleges that an agency has violated such individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans\u2019 preference may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-7\">(d)(1) If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint under subsection (a) within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Merits Systems Protection Board</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-8\"><em>5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a (2000). That statute thus grants the Board jurisdiction to hear and decide cases in which a preference eligible veteran has complained to Labor of a violation and not received satisfactory resolution of his complaint within sixty days. That is the statutory provision that Hunt cited as the basis for his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The AJ concluded that Hunt did not fulfill the requirement of the statute by \u201callegfing] that an agency has violated [his] rights ... to veterans\u2019 preference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board held that it therefore lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. We agree that Hunt\u2019s complaint based on \u00a7 3330a fails, but not for lack of Board jurisdiction. Jurisdiction relates to the power of a tribunal to hear and decide a case. That was not lacking here. Hunt is a preference eligible veteran who alleged that an agency violated his rights under a statute relating to veterans\u2019 preference, and he did file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor that was not resolved with sixty days. Thus, there was Board jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">However, while the Board erred in dismissing Hunt\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction, the error was merely linguistic. The Board should have characterized its ruling against Hunt as being on the merits for failure to prove a violation. Hunt has not shown that he was denied any preference to which he was entitled for any employment vacancy. In fact, he has not shown that he has applied for any vacancy at all. As the AJ stated, he did \u201cnot allege ... that OPM directly interfered with his candidacy for any specific selection action by his employing agency.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>No. CH-3443-00-0859-I-1, slip op. at 3. To put it differently, Hunt\u2019s generalized grievance is not grounded in a \u201cviolation,\u201d as the statute requires. Because Hunt has failed to show a violation, the disposition of this case should be failure on the merits rather than dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Spruill v. MSPB, </em>978 F.2d 679, 686 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">If and when Hunt connects the OPM guidance with a concrete violation of his rights in connection with a specific employment opportunity, only then he will have made a sufficient allegation to state a claim under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">Hunt argues that OPM\u2019s guidance is inconsistent with statutory provisions. Jurisdiction for such a claim is provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(f)(1). That statute pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>vides that the Board shall review an OPM rule or regulation \u201c(A) on its own motion; (B) on the granting by the Board ... of any petition ...; or (C) on the filing of a written complaint by requesting such a review.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(f)(1) (2000). <em>See also 5 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1203.11 (2001). However, Hunt did not plead that provision as a basis for jurisdiction. Nor did the AJ exercise jurisdiction under that provision to review OPM\u2019s guidance. The AJ\u2019s comments on the substantive issues were, thus, dicta. Because those issues were not decided by the Board, they are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">We have considered Hunt\u2019s other arguments and find them unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We therefore conclude that the Board erred in dismissing Hunt\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction, but we affirm the Board\u2019s decision on the merits for the reasons set forth above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
