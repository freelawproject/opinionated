Bennett also claimed entitlement to credit at sentencing for time served during pretrial custody. In his informal brief, the sole issue Bennett raises is the propriety of the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Because Bennett failed to raise this claim in the district court, we decline to consider it for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, we deny a certif\u00edcate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
