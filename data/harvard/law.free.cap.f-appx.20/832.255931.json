Julie McKENNA, Assistant District Attorney, Salina, KS; (FNU) Jerkovich, Psychiatrist, Salina, KS; William Hermesmeyer, Public Defender; Mark Dinkle, Head Public Defender; R E Schulman, Clinical and Forensic Psychology; Douglas D.

R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">When Plaintiff filed the original complaint in this case, he designated it as pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In a well-stated order, the district court correctly dismissed Plaintiffs complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) and (b). The district court then granted Plaintiff leave to appeal <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">On appeal, Plaintiff appears to argue that he is also entitled to habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. He relies on the same facts that he alleged in the trial court plus some additional facts. While the district court never addressed this ease as one for habeas corpus, after review of the pleadings and briefs, we conclude that Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead a plausible action for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">However characterized, we conclude that this action fails. Therefore, the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action is affirmed. The motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Appellant is reminded that he is still obligated to finish payment of the filing fee ordered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
