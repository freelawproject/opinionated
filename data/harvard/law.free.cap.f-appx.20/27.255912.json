Ser-pico was sentenced to a term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ment of 24 months, which he is now serving, 3 years of supervised release, $329,898.05 in restitution, a $5,000 f\u00edne, and a $50 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">On appeal, Serpico contends that the district court erred by (1) refusing to grant a downward departure on the basis of extraordinary family circumstances and (2) imposing restitution based on summary consideration, rather than detailed factual findings concerning Serpico\u2019s ability to pay restitution and the other factors mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Since we find that Serpico waived his right to appeal the length of his sentence in his plea agreement, we do not reach the merits of Serpico\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in declining to grant him a downward departure. \u201cIn general, a defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal a sentence within an agreed guideline range is enforceable.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Rosa, 123 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir.1997) (collecting cases). Here, Serpico knowingly and voluntarily signed a plea agreement providing that he \u201cwill not file an appeal or otherwise challenge the conviction or sentence in the event that the Court imposes a sentence within or below the range of imprisonment set forth in paragraph 2 [setting forth an estimated range of 27 to 33 months].\u201d At his plea allocution, Serpico responded affirmatively to the district court\u2019s question whether he understood that, pursuant to his plea agreement, he would \u201cgiv[e] up [his] right to appeal to the Court of Appeals from any sentence [imposed by the district court], provided the jail term portion of that sentence is 33 months or less.\u201d After an unrelated downward adjustment, Serpico was sentenced to a 24 month term of imprisonment that was well below the agreed guideline range. The waiver in Serpico\u2019s plea agreement is thus enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Reviewing Serpico\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s restitution order for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Kinlock, </em>174 F.3d 297, 299 (2d Cir.1999), we find his claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">In imposing a sentence of restitution, a court must consider the following factors: \u201c(1) the amount of loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense; (2) the financial resources of the defendant; (3) the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and his dependents; and (4) any other factors which the court wishes to address.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Contrary to Serpieo\u2019s assertions, a district court is not required to make detailed factual findings concerning these factors. Rather, it is necessary only that the record contain \u201can affirmative act or statement allowing an inference that the district court in fact considered the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300 (quoting <em>United States v. Mortimer, </em>52 F.3d 429, 436 (2d Cir.1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">Such an inference is warranted in the instant case. The district court was presented with ample information concerning Serpico and his family\u2019s financial condition in the letter submitted by Serpico\u2019s counsel in support of the grant of a downward departure, the Presentence Investigation Report, and Serpico\u2019s own statement at the presentencing hearing in response to the district court\u2019s proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>restitution order. Though the presence of this information, without more, would be insufficient to support an inference of consideration, <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>113 F.3d 13, 15-16 (2d Cir.1997), the district court demonstrated its consideration of this information by referring to Serpi-co\u2019s \u201cfinancial wherewithal\u201d in connection with its decision to impose the minimum fine and subordinate payment of the fine to payment of restitution. <em>See Mortimer, </em>52 F.3d at 436. Moreover, the district court ordered payment of only $50 a month during the term of Serpico\u2019s supervised release, a clear indication that the court had taken his financial situation into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Similarly, the district court\u2019s consideration and adoption of the loss figures in the Addendum to the Presentence Report also satisfied its obligation to consider the amount of loss sustained by each victim and to protect against double compensation to the victims. In fact, the amount of restitution awarded was confined to the losses of three victims and did not represent the total losses to all victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We have considered Serpico\u2019s other objections and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">. Though the parties disagree over whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)\u00a9 or its predecessor 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(a) is applicable, we need not decide the issue because the factors prescribed by both statutes are substantially the same. <em>See Kinlock, </em>174 F.3d at 299 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
