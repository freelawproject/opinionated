On appeal, counsel moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief arguing that Duran-Vare-la should have received a downward departure because his previous aggravated felony conviction for aggravated battery was not serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">The district court\u2019s decision was clearly an exercise of discretion not to depart under the circumstances in this case. The court\u2019s decision is therefore unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Rodriguez, </em>220 F.3d 940, 942 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">Moreover, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-13\">. The HONORABLE RICHARD G.
