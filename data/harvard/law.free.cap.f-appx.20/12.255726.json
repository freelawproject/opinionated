Snaggs first claims that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of Detective Nonis; second, Snaggs claims that the District Court improperly instructed the jury on Snaggs\u2019s alibi charge; third, Snaggs argues that he was improperly sentenced by the use of uncharged conduct as a separate unit under the multiple count grouping rules. Alexander claims first that the evidence of the effect of a robbery on interstate commerce was insufficient; second, that the District Court erred in sentencing him as a career offender; and third, he claims that the District Court erred in imposing enhancements for uncharged robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Snaggs\u2019s first claim is that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding, under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the testimony of Detective Basil Nonis. We agree that the sought testimony had little relevance and had potential to confuse the jury. Accordingly, we find that the District Court acted well within its discretion in denying admission of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Snaggs also argues that the District Court erred when it included uncharged conduct related to a robbery committed during the conspiracy as a separate unit under the multiple count grouping rules during sentencing. We find that the District Court\u2019s analysis is consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rug-giero, </em>100 F.3d 284, 292 (2d Cir.1996), which allowed relevant conduct offenses to be separately grouped when appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">We have considered the rest of Snaggs\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Alexander\u2019s first claim is that the evidence of effect on interstate commerce of the November 1998 robbery was insufficient to meet the jurisdictional requirement of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). This claim is without merit. It is well established that the burden of proving the interstate commerce nexus is <em>de minimis. United States v. Arena, </em>180 F.3d 380, 389 (2d Cir.1999) <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 811, 121 S.Ct. 33, 148 L.Ed.2d 13 (2000). Furthermore, in a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, the question is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). A reviewing court must \u201ccredit every inference that could have been drawn in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Masotto, </em>73 F.3d 1233, 1241 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotations omitted). The District Court did not err in finding that the jurisdictional requirement was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">We have considered the rest of Alexander\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
