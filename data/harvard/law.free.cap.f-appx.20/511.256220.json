NORRIS, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-26\">Defendant Michael Monus appeals from a district court order denying his motion for a reduction of sentence \u201cas if\u2019 under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). Because defendant failed to make the requisite showing that an unconstitutional motive influenced the government\u2019s decision not to move for a downward departure based upon Rule 35(b), we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The facts giving rise to the underlying prosecution have already been recited at some length by this court, <em>see United States v. Monus, </em>128 F.3d 376, 381 (6th Cir.1997), and we will not repeat them here. The only issue before us at this juncture is whether defendant made the showing of improper motive required to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing and, potentially, to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">By its express terms, only the government can bring a Rule 35(b) motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXz\">If the <em>Government </em>so moves within one year after the sentence is imposed, the court may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant\u2019s subsequent substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person, in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994. The court may consider a <em>government motion </em>to reduce a sentence made one year or more after the sentence is imposed if the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance involves information or evidence not known by the defendant until one year or more after sentence is imposed. In evaluating whether substantial assistance has been rendered, the court may consider the defendant\u2019s pre-sentence assistance. In applying this subdivision, the court may reduce the sentence to a level below that established by statute as a minimum sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Fed. R.Crim. P. 35(b) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>3 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 585.1 (2d ed. Supp.2001) (\u201cUnder amended Rule 35(b), the court may still lower a sentence, but only on a motion by the government.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140 (5th Cir.1994)). Hence, \u201cthe government has discretion in deciding whether to file a substantial assistance motion. That decision will not be questioned unless the defendant can make a \u2018substantial threshold showing of an unconstitutional motive.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>213 F.3d 302, 314 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Bagnoli, </em>7 F.3d 90, 92 (6th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The rule that a government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion cannot be challenged unless it is based on an unconstitutional motive stems from <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). In <em>Wade, </em>the defendant asserted at his sentencing hearing that he had provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to law-enforcement officials after his arrest and was therefore entitled to a sentence reduction. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 183, 112 S.Ct. 1840. The district court held that it had no authority to grant a reduction since the government had not filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court agreed with the district court that \u201cin both \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 5K1.1 the condition limiting the court\u2019s authority gives the Government a power, <em>not a duty, </em>to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840 (emphasis added). However, the Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">[A] prosecutor\u2019s discretion when exercising that power is subject to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce. Because we see no reason why courts should treat a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion differently from a prosecutor\u2019s other decisions, we hold that the federal district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">It follows that a claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would generalized allegations of improper motive. Indeed, Wade concedes, that a defendant has no right to discovery or an evidentiary hearing unless he makes a \u201csubstantial threshold showing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Although defendant alleges that he provided substantial assistance to the government, his motion to the district court falls far short of meeting the \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d required to trigger an evidentiary hearing. While it contains the kind of \u201cgeneralized allegations\u201d discounted by the Court in <em>Wade, </em>there are no affidavits attached. Moreover, the motion focuses more on whether defendant provided substantial assistance rather than upon the more important issue: whether the government\u2019s decision was based upon an improper motive. As the district court aptly put it, \u201cThe Defendant has not produced any evidence which demonstrates that the Government possesses an unconstitutional motive in not moving for a reduction in the Defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d Memorandum Opinion and Order, March 30, 2000, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">. A motion under \u00a7 3553(e) is the pre-sen-tence equivalent of a Rule 35(b) motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (\"Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
