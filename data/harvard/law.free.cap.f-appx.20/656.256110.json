R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">California state prisoner Jack Keesling appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as barred by the statute of limitations. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Keesling contends that the district court erred by dismissing his petition as untimely, because the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations does not apply to his conviction. He is mistaken. <em>See Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243,1245 (9th Cir.2001) Keesling further contends that even if the statute of limitations does apply, it was tolled, and that his \u00a7 2254 petition was timely. This contention also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations was not tolled during the 55 day period between enactment of the statute and the filing of Keesling\u2019s Superior court petition. <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999). Nor was it tolled during the seven months between the California Supreme Court\u2019s final decision on Keesling\u2019s initial habeas petition, and his filing of a subsequent petition in the Los Angeles Superior Court. <em>See id. </em>(stating that there is no tolling when no petition is \u201cpending\u201d except when a prisoner is properly using state court procedures to exhaust state court remedies on a particular post-conviction application). Accordingly, even assuming that Keesling\u2019s petition for certiorari tolled the statute of limitations, the last day on which Keesling could have properly filed his petition was February 1, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">Because the AEDPA\u2019s one year statute of limitation is applicable to Keesling\u2019s ha-beas petition, and because the petition was not filed until June 9, 1999, the petition is barred by the statute of limitations and was properly dismissed by the district court. 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2244(d); <em>see Nino, </em>183 F.3d at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
