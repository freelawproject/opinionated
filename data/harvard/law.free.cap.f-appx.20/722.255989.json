The Board had jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(b) and we have jurisdiction over the timely filed petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We grant the petition and remand to the Board for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-25\">Whether we review the opinion of the Board or that of the immigration judge depends on the type of review the Board conducted. If it simply adopts the immigration judge\u2019s opinion, then we review the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir.1996). Otherwise, we review only the Board\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>sion. <em>Id. </em>Reading the decision of the Board in context, it is clear that the Board conducted a de novo review of the immigration judge\u2019s decision. Thus, we review the decision of the Board, rather than that of the immigration judge. <em>Perez v. INS, </em>96 F.3d 390, 392 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">It is not clear to us that Vizcardo-Lla-mas has adequately raised the issue of past persecution in his notice of appeal or briefs before the Board. Fortunately, we need not decide this, as this petition can be disposed of by addressing his claim that he fears future persecution if he returns to Peru. The Board seems to have taken a similar position, based on its observation that respondent \u201cfailed to establish that a reasonable person in his position would [ ] fear persecution on account of\u2019 any enumerated factors upon his return to Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The Board\u2019s decision relies primarily upon the lack of corroborative evidence. The Board followed its own precedent in holding that \u201cthe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony on key points relating to an alleged fear of persecution, the greater the need for corroborative evidence of one kind or another, if such evidence is available.\u201d The principal case relied upon by the Board was <em>Matter of M-D-, </em>Interim Decision 3339 (BIA 1998). However, subsequent to the Board\u2019s decision, we decided <em>Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 901 (9th Cir.2000), specifically rejecting <em>Matter of M-D-. Ladha </em>held that an alien\u2019s unrefuted, credible, direct, and specific testimony sufficiently \u201cestablish[es] the facts testified without need for any corroboration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Thus, while <em>Matter ofM-D- </em>can be read as a permissible analytical framework to apply in determining whether a petitioner has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate entitlement to his claim, and while <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999) has cautioned us to provide deference to the Board in a similar situation, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ladha </em>forecloses any such arguments in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The petition for review is granted and the matter is remanded to the Board for further consideration in light of <em>Ladha v. INS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">PETITION GRANTED AND CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
