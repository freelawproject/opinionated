We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Myers claims that his trial attorney did not perform a sufficient investigation and thereby deprived him of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The state courts found to the contrary, but Myers contends that we should still grant relief because they applied the law improperly. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 401-09, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1518-21, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Nguyen v. Lindsey, </em>232 F.3d 1236, 1239-40 (9th Cir.2000). We have reviewed the record and we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">As the state courts and the district court decided, counsel certainly did quite enough under the circumstances to bring his actions within the broad range of conduct that we consider reasonable professional assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Myers\u2019 suggestion that counsel could have done more does not change that; a claim of that kind can almost always be made. <em>See Babbitt v. Calderon, </em>151 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (9th Cir. 1998). What Myers\u2019 attack amounts to is a request that we use the distorting hindsight that the Supreme Court has warned us against. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065; <em>Smith v. Stewart, </em>140 F.3d 1263, 1268 (9th Cir.1998); Siri-<em>pongs v. Calderon, </em>35 F.3d 1308, 1323 (9th Cir.1994) (Fernandez, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b712-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">.
