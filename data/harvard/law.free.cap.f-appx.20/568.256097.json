We conclude that the filing of an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) detainer with federal prison officials, merely notifying them that the INS will in the future make a decision regarding Mr. Perez-Ramirez\u2019s deportation, does not create custody supporting habeas corpus jurisdiction; and, without deciding whether the INS detainer adversely affected Mr. Perez-Ramirez\u2019s custody and security classifications, we note that prison officials may consider an INS detainer in assessing such classifications. <em>See Mohammed v. Sullivan, </em>866 F.2d 258, 260 (8th Cir.1989) (filing INS detainer with prison officials does not constitute technical custody for purpose of habeas jurisdiction; prison officials may consider INS detainer in assessing prisoner\u2019s classifications); <em>Campillo v. Sullivan, </em>853 F.2d 593, 595 (8th Cir.1988) (prisoner may not challenge detainer via habeas corpus until he is placed in INS custody, which will not occur until prisoner is released from present term of confinement), <em>cert, denied, </em>490 U.S. 1082, 109 S.Ct. 2105, 104 L.Ed.2d 666 (1989); <em>see also Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>236 (1976) (Congress has given federal prison officials full discretion to control prison classification and qualification for institutional programs). Mr. Perez-Ramirez has alluded to additional arguments; they lack merit, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-15\">. The Honorable David S.
