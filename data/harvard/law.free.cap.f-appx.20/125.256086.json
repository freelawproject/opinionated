Atkinson, appeals an order by the district court dismissing as untimely Appellant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Appellant, Richard H. Atkinson, was convicted on October 2, 1996 for six counts of malicious wounding and malicious bodily injury in the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond, Virginia. The Virginia Supreme Court denied his direct appeal on October 28, 1997. The ninety-day period in which to appeal the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s denial to the United States Supreme Court expired on January 26, 1998. On October 22,1998, Appellant filed a state petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Virginia Supreme Court. On March 19, 1999, the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed the state petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">More than five months later, on September 7, 1999, Appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria Division). After tolling the limitation period from October 22, 1998 to March 19, 1999 which included the period from the filing of the state petition for habeas corpus through its denial by the Virginia Supreme Court, the district court concluded that the petition was filed over thirteen months since expiration of Appellant\u2019s opportunity to appeal his conviction to the United States Supreme Court, or January 26,1998. Accordingly, the district court dismissed Appellant\u2019s petition as untimely in accordance with the one year period of limitations prescribed by the An-titerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the one year AEDPA time limitation is tolled by the ninety-day certiorari period following the state court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s state petition for a writ of habeas corpus, when Appellant did not petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Resolution of this issue entails the construction of a statute, hence it is a question of law which we review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">The relevant provisions of the AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-17\">(d)(1) A-l year period of limitations shall apply to an application for writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">(2) the time during which a properly filed application for <em>State post-conviction or other collateral review </em>with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) (1994) (emphasis added). Thus, the AEDPA, as set forth under its provisions, limits requests for federal collateral review <em>of </em>state convictions to one year. The limitation period begins to run upon the later of (1) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or (2) the expiration of time available to seek direct review of the judgment. However, the statute provides that the statute of limitations is tolled during the pendency of a properly filed application for \u201cState post-conviction or other collateral review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). It is upon this phrase in \u00a7 2244(d)(2) where the dispute centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Appellant, Atkinson, argues that \u201cState post-conviction\u201d refers only to state post-conviction review while \u201cother collateral review\u201d includes the prisoner\u2019s right to seek United States Supreme Court review after the state\u2019s highest supreme court had denied him relief. Appellee counters that the word \u201cState\u201d modifies both phrases, meaning that \u201cother collateral review\u201d encompasses all forms of state review only. The parties do not dispute that if Appellant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) is adopted, his habeas corpus petition to federal district court would have been timely because the limitation period would have been tolled an additional ninety (90) days from the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal on March 19, 1999 during which time he could have sought certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. On the other hand, if the tolling allowance of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) is construed to apply only to state proceedings, Appellant\u2019s federal petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Although this Circuit had not addressed the precise issue in this case at the time of argument, Appellant, nevertheless, was confronted with almost insuperable odds. Every Circuit which has considered the issue of whether the one-year limitation period under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) included the time in which a defendant could have sought certiorari to the United States Supreme Court answered it in the negative. <em>See Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>241 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Snow v. Ault, </em>238 F.3d 1033 (8th Cir .2001); <em>I sham v. Randle, </em>226 F.3d 691, 695 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Coates v. Byrd, </em>211 F.3d 1225, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Jones v. Morton, </em>195 F.3d 153,158 (3rd Cir.1999); <em>Ott v. Johnson, </em>192 F.3d 510, 512-13 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Rhine v. Boone, </em>182 F.3d 1153, 1155-56 (10th Cir. 1999). The only Circuit which had reached a contrary decision was the Second circuit which held that a federal habeas petition, properly filed under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) and pending in the district court tolled the limitation period. <em>See Walker v. Artuz, </em>208 F.3d 357 (2nd Cir.2000), <em>rev\u2019d, Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Walker has now been reversed by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Duncan, </em>the Supreme Court adopted the interpretation now posited by the Appellee and held that the phrase \u201cother collateral review\u201d does not include federal relief. 533 U.S. 167, 121 S.Ct. at 2126-27. On the contrary, the Court opined that the wording of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) \u201cState\u201d modifies both the phrase \u201cpost-conviction review\u201d as well as the phrase \u201cother collateral review.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Id., </em>533 U.S. 167, 121 S.Ct. at 2126-27. Meanwhile, in <em>Crawley v. Cato, </em>257 F.3d 395, 399-400 (4th Cir.2001), this Circuit recently addressed the issue and has determined that the one-year limitation period under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) is only tolled during the pendency of state proceedings and does not include the time in which a defendant could have sought certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Accordingly, the limitation period under the statute was not tolled in this case during the period that Appellant could have filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">TV</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">A review of the record indicates that Appellant had one year, or until January 26, 1999, to file his federal habeas corpus petition plus any tolling period during the pendency of a properly filed application for state post-conviction or other collateral review. On October 22, 1998, some eight (8) months and twenty-six (26) days after the one year period commenced, Appellant properly filed for post-conviction relief, thereby tolling the period. The request for post-conviction relief was denied on March 19,1999 and the one-year limitation period (of which nearly nine (9) months had already elapsed) resumed running. After excluding the tolling period, Appellant had approximately an additional ninety (90) days, or until on or about June 17, 1999, to file his \u00a7 2254 petition in federal court. The petition for federal habeas corpus relief was not filed until September 7, 1999 which was beyond the one (1) year limitation period under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Because Appellant did not file his petition under \u00a7 2254 within one year (excluding the tolling period for his properly filed application for post-conviction relief) his petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing the petition for habeas corpus as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
