Reece appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his action alleging that the United States inducted him into the Army because he was mentally retarded, denied him adequate medical care while he was enlisted, and subjected him to non-consensual experimentation before and during his military service. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo whether a claim is barred by <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950). <em>Gregory v. Widnall, </em>153 F.3d 1071, 1074 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam). We also review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). <em>Marlys Bear Med. v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>States, </em>241 F.3d 1208, 1213 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Reece\u2019s claims related to his military service were properly dismissed under <em>Feres, </em>which bars all suits alleging \u201cinjuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153; <em>see Gerardi v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 492 (9th Cir.1969) (per curiam) (wrongful induction); <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>110 F.3d 1484, 1489 (9th Cir.1997) (inadequate medical care); <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>483 U.S. 669, 671-72, 683-84, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987) (non-consensual experimentation during military service).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Reece\u2019s constitutional claim against the United States premised on experimental radiation injections prior to military service is barred by sovereign immunity. <em>See Arnsberg v. United States, </em>757 F.2d 971, 980 (9th Cir.1985). Any FTCA claim premised upon this experimentation is barred by the FTCA statute of limitations, 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2401(b). <em>Augustine v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Because all of Reece\u2019s claims are precluded as a matter of law, the district court properly denied leave to amend as futile. <em>See Kennedy v. United States Postal Serv., </em>145 F.3d 1077, 1078 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Reece\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
