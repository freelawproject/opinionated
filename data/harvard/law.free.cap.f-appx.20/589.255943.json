A jury convicted MeClean of two of the counts and the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced MeClean to serve concurrent twenty-seven month sentences, to make restitution, and to pay a special assessment. On appeal, MeClean raises issues regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, the determination of loss, and his sentence. Having reviewed the record and the arguments of both parties, we reject McClean\u2019s arguments and affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">MeClean argues that the government did not introduce sufficient evidence of his intent to commit wire fraud. When addressing a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and reverse only if no reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Rounsavall, </em>115 F.3d 561, 565 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>522 U.S. 903, 118 S.Ct. 256, 139 L.Ed.2d 183 (1997). The government\u2019s evidence showed that MeClean admitted that he deceived interested business associates with false statements made by telephone and facsimile and that MeClean knew that he put these associates at financial risk. Although MeClean stated that he intended to repay the parties in his business transactions who suffered losses and that he intended no harm, the jury was free to disbelieve him. <em>See United States v. Ervasti </em>201 F.3d 1029, 1037 (8th Cir.2000). We hold the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">With regard to his sentence, MeClean argues that the District Court erred in determining the amount of the monetary loss he caused. We review the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and the District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Oligmueller, </em>198 F.3d 669, 671 (8th Cir.1999). The District Court calculated the loss caused by MeClean by examining the losses incurred by two victims of his fraud \u2014 a building supply company (Wick Building Systems) and a bank (Green Tree Financial Corporation). These losses included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>unpaid loan guaranties and unpaid reimbursement for home sales. Sentencing McClean in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, the District Court found \u2014 relying on the presentence investigation report and evidence at the sentencing hearing\u2014 that the amount of loss was in the range of $500,000 to $800,000. The District Court\u2019s finding is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, McClean argues that his twenty-seven month sentence violates the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We note that <em>Apprendi </em>dealt with a non-jury factual determination that was used as a basis for a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 491-95, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Because McClean\u2019s sentence was less than the statutory maximum for wire fraud (five years), <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>See United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 933-34 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AKmN\">.
