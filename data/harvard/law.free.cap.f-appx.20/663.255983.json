He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the petition, and Mr. Metcalf now appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Metcalfs habeas petition. <em>See Lockhart v. Terhune, </em>250 F.3d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir.2001). Because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) governs Mr. Metcalfs case, we may grant habeas relief only if the state court\u2019s decision (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-17\">Mr. Metcalf argues first that comments made by the trial judge violated his Fifth Amendment right not to testify at his trial. Both Mr. Metcalf and the government agree that the trial judge\u2019s comments constituted error under <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). However, <em>Griffin </em>errors are trial errors, not structural errors, and are subject to harmless error review. <em>See Rice v. Wood, </em>77 F.3d 1138, 1143 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-18\">The California appellate court concluded that the <em>Griffin </em>error in Mr. Metcalfs case was harmless. In light of the evidence presented in this case, we find that it was not clear error for the California appellate court to conclude that the <em>Griffin </em>error was harmless. <em>See Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143,1152 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-19\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-20\">Mr. Metcalf argues next that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because defense counsel was not present at the post-indictment live lineup, even though a defense investigator was. In support of his argument, Mr. Metcalf relies primarily on <em>United States v. Wade, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>388 U.S. 218, 237, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We need not decide whether Mr. Met-calfs Sixth Amendment right to counsel was in fact violated under the circumstances. Assuming that there was a violation, there was still clear and convincing evidence that the eyewitnesses\u2019 in-court identifications of Mr. Metcalf were based upon observations of him other than at the live lineup. <em>See id. </em>at 241, 87 S.Ct. 1926 (adopting the test established in <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Finally, Mr. Metcalf contends that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the admission of the lineup evidence. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (discussing standard for ineffective assistance of counsel). We conclude that, even if trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the lineup evidence, Mr. Metcalf suffered no prejudice as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-21\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b695-9\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQg0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">I would find that the <em>Griffin </em>error in this case had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict because the evidence in this case was far from overwhelming. I would also find that the state court\u2019s decision that the <em>Griffin </em>error was harmless amounts to an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court. I would therefore reverse the district court and grant the habeas petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
