The notices of appeal were filed by Pritchard as president of Tamojira, Inc., the debtor in the underlying bankruptcy. Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654 (1994) permits parties to conduct their own litigation, it is well set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tied that a corporation must be represented by an attorney in federal court. <em>National Indep. Theatre Exhibitors v. Buena Vista Distrib., </em>748 F.2d 602, 609 (11th Cir.1984) (corporate officer could not bring pro se action on behalf of corporation); <em>Jones v. Niagara Frontier Transp. Auth., </em>722 F.2d 20, 22 (2d Cir .1983). Accordingly, because Tamojira, Inc., is not represented by licensed counsel, we grant the Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We deny as moot Pritchard\u2019s motion for reconsideration of this court\u2019s May 30, 2001, order because his response was filed and has been fully considered. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
