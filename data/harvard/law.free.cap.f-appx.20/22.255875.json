On appeal, Drukman argues that the district court erroneously entered his plea of guilty in the absence of sufficient evidence of his intent to defraud, an element of the offense of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">On December 15, 1997, United States Secret Service agents executed an arrest warrant for codefendant Joseph Tzerno-chov at a Brooklyn, New York residence. Tzernochov was suspected of being involved in the manufacture of counterfeit United States currency. When the Secret Service agents entered the Brooklyn residence, they saw Drukman sitting at a table with sheets of uncut counterfeit currency in front of him, cutting them. The agents also found on this table a razor, scrap paper and bundles of counterfeit currency. The agents observed two copying machines that, at the time, were making additional counterfeit currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">On March 11, 1998, Drukman pled guilty to knowingly, and with intent to defraud, manufacturing counterfeit currency, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 471. During the hearing in which Drukman pled guilty, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">THE COURT: I want you to take a moment then and in your own words tell me what you did to commit this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">DEFENDANT: I knew it was counterfeit money and I cut the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">THE COURT: I understand that this money was being copied in some way at the location where you were arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">Is that what was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">THE COURT: And you helped by cutting it into individual bills, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-15\">THE COURT: You knew the money was not lawful money, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-16\">DEFENDANT: Yes, I knew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-17\">THE COURT: Did you also recognize that this money was going to be given to people, so that they could use it as real money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-18\">DEFENDANT: I did not understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-19\">THE COURT: I just want to make certain you didn\u2019t think the money was being made just to play games with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-20\">Did you understand that somehow people intended to use this as real money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-21\">DEFENDANT: Yes, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-22\">THE COURT: And is that what your intent was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-23\">DEFENDANT: I knew it was counterfeit money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-24\">THE COURT: Did you know that the purpose of your making it was so that someday, somebody could use it as if it were real money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-25\">DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-26\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that the record furnishes a factual basis sufficient to support the plea for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>160 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir.1998). Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f) requires that the district court judge \u201cdetermine \u2018that the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>duet which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged in the indictment or information or an offense included therein to which the defendant has pleaded guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Livorsi, </em>180 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The offense to which Drukman pled guilty, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 471, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">Whoever, with intent to defraud, falsely makes, forges, counterfeits, or alters any obligation or other security of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Drukman argues that at his plea allocution he never acknowledged that he had a specific intent to defraud. This argument must fail because the crime to which Druk-man pled guilty requires that he possess only a \u201cgeneral intent that some innocent third party in the chain of distribution be defrauded.\u201d <em>United States v. Mucciante, </em>21 F.3d 1228, 1235 (2d Cir.1994) (construing \u201cintent to defraud\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 479) (quotation omitted). Because we find that the district court amply established a factual basis to support Drukman\u2019s plea, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
