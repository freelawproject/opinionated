He argues the district court committed error by applying an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, denying an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and refusing to depart downward for substantial assistance to authorities, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">We reject these arguments seriatim. First, Parmeley was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender Guideline; thus, his obstruction argument is moot. <em>See United States v. Unthank, </em>109 F.3d 1205,1212 (7th Cir.1997) (\u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement ultimately had no effect on sentence as defendant was assigned higher offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1); <em>cf. United States v. McNeil, </em>90 F.3d 298, 300 (8th Cir.) (because district court correctly determined defendant to be career offender, his objection to court\u2019s role-in-offense determination was moot), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 U.S. 1034, 117 S.Ct. 596, 136 L.Ed.2d 524 (1996). Second, the district court did not commit clear error in denying the section 3E1.1 reduction, as Parmeley failed to prove entitlement to it. <em>See United States v. Ervasti, </em>201 F.3d 1029, 1043 (8th Cir. 2000) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Honken, </em>184 F.3d 961, 967-69 (8th Cir.) (commission of obstructive conduct ordinarily indicates defendant has not accepted responsibility; burden is on defendant to establish entitlement to \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1056, 120 S.Ct. 602, 145 L.Ed.2d 500 (1999). Finally, as Parmeley does not claim the district court was unaware of its authority to depart or refused to depart on account of an unconstitutional motive, the court\u2019s discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>decision is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Causor-Serraio, </em>234 F.3d 384, 390 (8th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2229, 150 L.Ed.2d 220 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
