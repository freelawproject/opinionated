Sprecher (\u201cSprecher\u201d) appeals from a December 15, 2000 order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, Judge) denying his petition for a writ of error coram nobis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651. In January 1992, after a bench trial, Sprecher was convicted of numerous offenses related to tax and securities fraud. In his current petition for a writ of error coram nobis, Sprecher claims that the admission at trial of his statements to Thomas Doonan, an investigator for the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, was unconstitutional under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In order to obtain coram nobis relief, a petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate that T) there are circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice, 2) sound reasons exist for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief, and 3) the petitioner continues to suffer legal consequences from his conviction that may be remedied by granting of the writ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fleming v. United States, </em>146 F.3d 88, 90 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Foont v. United States, </em>93 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1996)). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the issue of whether the district court applied the proper legal standard, but we review the district court\u2019s ultimate decision to deny the writ for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Fleming, </em>146 F.3d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Without speaking to whether Sprecher has satisfied requirements (1) and (3) above, we hold that the District Court did not exceed its allowable discretion in ruling that Sprecher did not set forth sound reasons for his failure to raise the <em>Miranda </em>issue earlier. <em>See Foont, </em>93 F.3d at 80. <em>Miranda </em>was applicable at the time of Sprecher\u2019s conviction, and the recent ruling in <em>Dickerson </em>merely reaffirmed the ongoing applicability of <em>Miranda </em>in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501. <em>See Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 443-44, 120 S.Ct. 2326. Thus, regardless whether it is retroactive or not, <em>Dickerson </em>does not justify Sprecher\u2019s failure to present his current <em>Miranda </em>claim earlier. As in <em>Foont, </em>Sprecher \u201cknew or should have known since the time of his conviction in [1992] of the facts underlying his current claim\u201d that the admission of Doonan\u2019s testimony constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 93 F.3d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">We have considered Sprecher\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">. We express no opinion as to whether Sprecher's statements were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
