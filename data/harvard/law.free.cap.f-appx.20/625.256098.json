We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">The Olsens contend that the County and Planning Department did not meet their burden as the moving parties on summary judgment. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Weiner v. San Diego County, </em>210 F.3d 1025,1028 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">The County of Sacramento and the Planning Department met the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issues of material fact existed and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Because the Olsens failed to produce evidence that there is a genuine issue for trial, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper. <em>See Schneider v. TRW, </em>938 F.2d 986, 991 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-22\">We have considered the Olsens\u2019 remaining contentions and deny them for lack of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
