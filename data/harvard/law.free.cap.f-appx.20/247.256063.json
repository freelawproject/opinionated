Oliver alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that in retaliation for filing lawsuits against them, prison officials have barred his access to the grievance process. Even if Defendants refused to file the grievances in retaliation, Oliver has no cognizable injury on the face of the present record. <em>Adams v. Rice, </em>40 F.3d 72, 75 (4th Cir. 1994); <em>ACLU v. Wicomico County, </em>999 F.2d 780, 785 (4th Cir.1993). To the extent that he alleges claims against a state magistrate, such claims are meritless. <em>Pressly v. Gregory, </em>831 F.2d 514, 517 (4th Cir.1987) (holding that magistrates enjoy absolute immunity for acts performed in judicial capacity). We therefore affirm the denial of relief under \u00a7 1915A. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
