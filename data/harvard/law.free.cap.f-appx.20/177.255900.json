Sensabaugh argues that the district court\u2019s supplemental instruction to the jury was both confusing and an incorrect statement of the law. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the supplemental joint appendix and find no error in the court\u2019s supplemental instruction to the jury in response to its second question. <em>Taylor v. Virginia Union Univ., </em>193 F.3d 219, 240 (4th Cir.1999) (reviewing district court\u2019s response to jury question involves \u201c \u2018ask[ing] whether the court\u2019s answer was reasonably responsive to the jury\u2019s question and whether the original and supplemental instructions as a whole allowed the jury to understand the issue presented to it\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>38 F.3d 167, 170 (5th Cir.1994)), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1189, 120 S.Ct. 1243, 146 L.Ed.2d 101 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Sensabaugh v. Joy Mining Machinery, </em>No. CA-97-112 B (W.D.Va. Nov. 14, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
