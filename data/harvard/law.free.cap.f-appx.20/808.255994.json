ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Defendant James Meyer entered a conditional plea of guilty to possession with intent to distribute approximately 293 pounds of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, reserving for appeal the issue of whether the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Meyer was sentenced to sixty months imprisonment and assessed $100 in costs. We affirm the denial of this motion to suppress and affirm Meyer\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">On March 20, 2000, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Kansas Highway Patrol Troopers John Rule and Rich Jimerson observed a vehicle with Colorado license plates driven by Meyer traveling eastbound on Interstate 70. The troopers noted that the vehicle\u2019s rear was sagging, as if heavily loaded, which caused them to follow the vehicle. While following Meyer\u2019s car, the troopers observed the ear travel twice slightly past the lane marker on the shoulder of the road, and then drift toward the center line of the road. Trooper Rule turned on his emergency lights and stopped Meyer\u2019s vehicle for failing to drive his vehicle within a single lane, in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8-1522. The emergency lights activated the patrol car video camera and recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">When Trooper Rule approached the car, he observed Meyer was driving the vehicle and Michael Hayes was in the passenger seat. Trooper Rule testified at the suppression hearing that, when he first began questioning Meyer, he detected a very strong odor of air freshener coming from the car. The trooper described it as the strongest odor he had ever smelled coming from a vehicle. Trooper Rule also testified that, during his entire interchange with Meyer, Meyer appeared very nervous, with visibly shaking hands, more than the trooper saw in most traffic stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">As the district court noted, most of the conversation between Trooper Rule and Meyer is audible on the tape which recorded the stop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Trooper Rule asked to see Meyer\u2019s driver\u2019s license and explained that he had stopped the car because it had been drifting, and he asked if Meyer was sleepy. Meyer stated that he was not too tired, but that he had lenses (presumably contacts) which were \u201cfuzzy\u201d or \u201cfunky\u201d and he was not used to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">After noticing that both Meyer and Hayes were wearing ties, and because there were blueprints in the back window of the car, a business card visible near the front windshield, and a briefcase visible in the back seat, Trooper Rule asked Meyer and Hayes if they were working. Meyer responded that they were on their way to the Hilton in Kansas City. When asked where they were coming from, Meyer said they were traveling from Colorado Springs to attend a software conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Trooper Rule returned to his patrol car and checked Meyer\u2019s license, which was valid. The trooper then walked back to Meyer\u2019s side of the car and asked whether another car, a Volvo also with Colorado plates, was traveling with them. Meyer responded in the negative. Trooper Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>then returned Meyer\u2019s license to him and handed him a warning citation. Meyer asked whether he had really been drifting, and the trooper assured him that he had. Trooper Rule told Meyer and Hayes to have a good trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The trooper then asked if they would mind if he asked them a few more questions. Meyer responded, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Trooper Rule again asked if they would mind if he asked them a few more questions. The trooper testified that \u201c[h]e agreed, nodded his head, yes, I believe.\u201d Tr. of Suppression Mot. Proceedings at 15, Appellant\u2019s App. at G-77. The district court described in detail the following conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\">Rule asked something to the effect of \u201cComing from Colorado Springs, you guys didn\u2019t bring anything illegal, did you, no guns, drugs, large amounts of money, anything like that?\u201d Meyer said, \u201cNo, No, sir.\u201d Rule said, \u201cCould I take a look in your trunk, would that be okay?\u201d Meyer said, \u201cIn my trunk?\u201d Rule said, \u201cyeah.\u201d Meyer then paused and asked, \u201cWell what for?\u201d Rule said, \u201cOkay. You\u2019re not carrying anything illegal with you.\u201d Meyer responded, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Rule continued, \u201cOkay. We get a lot of illegal stuff coming out of the Colorado Springs area.\u201d Meyer interjected, \u201cI understand that, sir, I\u2014 absolutely not, I\u2019m not carrying anything illegal.\u201d Rule said, \u201cOkay. So can I take a look in your trunk?\u201d Meyer may have said \u2018Well\u201d and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why though.\u201d Rule said, \u201cOkay. So you don\u2019t want me to?\u201d Meyer responded that, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to\u201d and then said that his father was an officer and that he understood his rights. Rule said that he was not asking to violate Meyer\u2019s rights, that he was just asking if he could take a look in the trunk. Meyer then recounted a rather lengthy story about how he had been through this before a long time ago in New Mexico, when he had been with his mother, and some officers had searched through their belongings and some of their clothes were scattered around and destroyed. Rule said that he wasn\u2019t going to go through their clothes, he just wanted to look in the trunk. Meyer said, Well, officer,\u201d Rule said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to, is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d Meyer said, Well, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">Rule said, Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m seeing right now. Okay? There\u2019s a very strong odor of air freshener coming from your vehicle right now. Okay? That smells to me like it possibly could be a masking agent for some kind of drug.\u201d He further indicated he thought the fact that they were supposedly going to a conference and were wearing ties for 700 miles on the highway was very unusual. Meyer or Hayes said that he always wears a tie. Rule said, \u201cOkay. Do you not want me to look in the trunk?\u201d Meyer said, \u201cI \u2014 I just know my rights\u201d and added, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I respectfully decline.\u201d Rule said, \u201cAll right. Is it okay with you then if I just walk my dog around your car?\u201d Meyer immediately responded, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Rule then said to the defendants, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys step out here for me, okay?\u201d as he opened up the driver\u2019s door and motioned Meyer toward the side of the road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Mem. and Order at 4-6, Appellant\u2019s App. at B-14-B-16 (footnotes omitted). At Trooper Rule\u2019s request, Meyer and Hayes got out of the car. Our review of the videotape confirms that the district court\u2019s factual findings relating to the stop were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Trooper Rule then got his drug-sniffing dog, Kilo, out of his patrol car and walked him counter-clockwise around Meyer\u2019s car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court found that \u201cfrom the testimony at the hearing and from the videotape ... the dog appeared to show some interest (characterized by Rule as a \u2018behavior change\u2019) in the driver\u2019s side rear wheel or fender area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at B 17. Kilo repeated this behavior twice more. Then Trooper Rule got down on his hands and knees and pointed under the car, and Kilo sniffed under the car. Trooper Rule testified at the suppression hearing that Kilo indicated by scratching the underside of the car. The trooper then told Meyer to give him his car keys because the dog had alerted on the car. When he opened the trunk, Trooper Rule saw the marijuana in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The district court denied Meyer\u2019s motion to suppress. Meyer conditionally pleaded guilty and now appeals that denial. He argues: (1) the district court erred in holding that the initial stop of Meyer\u2019s car was valid; (2) the district court erred in holding that, once the initial purpose of the stop was accomplished, the continued detention was justified by Trooper Rule\u2019s reasonable and articulable suspicion that Meyer was involved in criminal activity; and (3) because Meyer was being illegally detained at the time he consented to the walk-around by Kilo, the evidence seized as a result of the walk-around must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">When we review an order denying a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Caro, </em>248 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir.2001). Moreover, credibility determinations, \u201c \u2018and the weight given to the evidence, as well as the inferences and conclusions drawn therefrom, are matters for the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>18 F.3d 874, 876 (10th Cir.1994)). However, we review de novo the ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">\u201c \u2018A traffic stop is a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\u2019 \u201c <em>United States v. Holt, </em>264 F.3d 1215, 2001 WL 1013251 at *3 (10th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Hunnieutt, </em>135 F.3d 1345, 1348 (10th Cir. 1998) (further quotation omitted)). We apply the principles of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) to such traffic stops. Thus, the reasonableness of a stop depends on \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">I. Validity of Initial Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">Turning to the first inquiry, the validity of the initial stop, our cases \u201cestablish that a traffic stop is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment at its inception if the officer has either (1) probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred ... or (2) a reasonable articulable suspicion that \u2018this particular motorist violated any one of the multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations of the jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ozbirn, </em>189 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>1194, 1197 (quoting <em>United States v. Bote-ro Ospina, </em>71 F.3d 783, 787 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc) (further quotations and citations omitted)). <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (holding that detention of a motorist supported by probable cause to believe the motorist committed a traffic violation is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment). The officer\u2019s subjective intentions and motivations are irrelevant. Id. at 813,116 S.Ct. 1769.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Meyer argues the initial stop of his vehicle was not justified because (1) even if he momentarily drifted onto the shoulder of the road, \u201ca traffic stop based upon a momentary drift is not justified under clearly established case law, and (2) there is no evidence the movement was unsafe and endangered defendant, defendant\u2019s vehicle or any other person or object, which element (unsafe movement) is required under K.S.A. 8-1522.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14-15. Meyer relies upon <em>United States v. Gregory, </em>79 F.3d 973, 978 (10th Cir .1996) and <em>United States v. Ochoa, </em>4 F.Supp.2d 1007,1011 (D.Kan.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The district court found the troopers\u2019 testimony that Meyer\u2019s car twice crossed over the lane marker was credible and concluded that the officers had probable cause to believe that Meyer had violated \u00a7 8-1522. Although Meyer testified at the suppression hearing that he did not pass over the lane marker, we do not review the credibility determinations of the district court. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the troopers observed Meyer\u2019s car twice drift out of its lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Meyer next argues that, even if he drifted over the lane briefly, that is insufficient to establish a violation of \u00a7 8-1522 and, therefore, insufficient to justify the traffic stop based upon an observed violation of a traffic law. Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8-1522 provides that \u201cfwjhenever any roadway has been divided into two (2) or more clearly marked lanes for traffic ... [a] vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane.\u201d Meyer relies primarily on <em>Gregory </em>and <em>Ochoa </em>for this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">In <em>Gregory, </em>we held that \u201can isolated incident of a vehicle crossing into the emergency lane of a roadway\u201d was not a violation of applicable state law justifying a stop. <em>Gregory, </em>79 F.3d at 978. <em>Ochoa </em>relied upon <em>Gregory </em>to similarly hold that a single instance of drifting into the emergency lane did not provide probable cause to stop a vehicle. 4 F.Supp.2d at 1011-12. We have since recognized that <em>Gregory </em>does not announce any bright-line rule applicable to all traffic stops: \u201cdecisions like <em>Gregory </em>do not establish an absolute standard or bright-line rule regarding what conduct constitutes a violation of statutes like Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8-1522, but instead highlight the need to analyze objectively all the surrounding facts and circumstances to determine whether the officer had the probable cause necessary to justify the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Ozbirn, </em>189 F.3d 1194,1198 (10th Cir.1999). Considering all the facts and circumstances in this case, including that: (1) unlike in <em>Gregory, </em>the road and weather conditions were optimal; (2) Meyer drifted across the lane twice, not just once; and (3) unlike the factual situation in <em>Ochoa, </em>where the court found a single crossing onto the shoulder did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 8-1522, there is no suggestion here that the officers contributed to Meyer\u2019s drifting onto the shoulder, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the troopers had probable cause to stop Meyer\u2019s vehicle for an observed traffic violation. <em>See Ozbirn, </em>189 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>F.3d at 1198-99.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the troopers\u2019 initial stop of Meyer\u2019s vehicle was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">II. Validity of Detention</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Having determined that the initial stop was valid, we now consider whether the entire stop was reasonable \u2014 \u201cwhether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>264 F.3d 1215, 1220 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868). As indicated above, and as the district court correctly found, Trooper Rule returned Meyer\u2019s driver\u2019s license after issuing him a warning, and wished Meyer and Hayes a good trip. However, he immediately asked Meyer if he could ask him a few questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\u2018When a driver has produced a valid license and proof of entitlement to operate the vehicle, an officer may issue a citation, but then usually must allow the driver to proceed without further delay or questioning.\u201d <em>United States v. Patten, </em>183 F.3d 1190, 1193 (10th Cir.1999). Two established exceptions to this general rule permit further questioning if \u201c(1) the officer has an objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that the driver is engaged in illegal activity, or (2) the driver voluntarily consents to further questioning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The district court first held that Meyer voluntarily consented to the questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-10\">after Trooper Rule returned Meyer\u2019s license and gave him a warning citation, Meyer initially voluntarily consented to further questioning by the officer. The totality of the circumstances leads the court to conclude that Meyer\u2019s consent was voluntary. Regardless of the fact that Meyer undoubtedly did not want to stay and talk, the fact is that he chose to do so, and there is no evidence that Rule employed official coercion or intimidation to overcome Meyer\u2019s ability to make a free and deliberate choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Mem. and Order at 10, Appellant\u2019s App. at B-20. Meyer argues that the district court overlooked two circumstances which undermine the conclusion that he consented to the further questioning: (1) during the interchange between Meyer and Trooper Rule, Meyer specifically declined permission to search the trunk of his ear several times; and (2) for part of the interchange, the trooper had his hand on Meyer\u2019s windshield and, at one point, leaned his head almost into the window, thereby, according to Meyer, \u201csubtlely, but effectively, conveying to defendant he could not leave because the officer had not released him.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">\u201cIn determining whether a driver and police officer are engaged in a consensual encounter in the context of a traffic stop, there are few, if any bright-line rules.\u201d <em>United States v. Elliott, </em>107 F.3d 810, 813 (10th Cir.1997). Rather, we must consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814 (citing <em>Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>117 S.Ct. 417, 136 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996)). While the return of documents, such as a driver\u2019s license or other personal papers, is a prerequisite to an encounter becoming consensual, we have acknowledged it \u201cis not always sufficient to demonstrate that an encounter becomes consensual.\u201d <em>Elliott, </em>107 F.3d at 814; see <em>also Gregory, </em>79 F.3d at 979. Accordingly, even after the officer returns a driver\u2019s papers, the encounter may not be consensual where \u201cthere was evidence of a \u2018coercive show of authority, such as the presence of more than one officer, the display of a weapon, physical touching by the officer, or his use of a commanding tone of voice indicating that compliance might be compelled.\u2019 \u201c <em>Elliott, </em>107 F.3d at 814 (quoting <em>United States v. Turner, </em>928 F.2d 956, 959 (10th Cir.1991)). We have also observed, in dicta, that an officer leaning on a car may support a finding of a coercive show of authority. <em>See Elliott, </em>107 F.3d at 814. However, the ultimate test is whether \u201ca reasonable person under the circumstances would believe he was free to leave or disregard the officer\u2019s request for information.\u201d <em>United States v. McKneely, </em>6 F.3d 1447, 1451 (10th Cir.1993). Given the totality of the circumstances in this case (no display of a weapon, non-threatening tone of voice, no physical touching of Meyer) we conclude that Trooper Rule\u2019s placement of his hand and/or forearm briefly on Meyer\u2019s windshield did not render the encounter non-consensual. <em>Cf. United States v. West, </em>219 F.3d 1171, 1177 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that there was no unlawful detention even though officer stood \u201cextremely close to [defendant\u2019s] car and lean[ed] forward so that the car door could not open without hitting [the officer]\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The district court also held that \u201cat the time Rule began to question the defendants about whether they were carrying anything illegal, the facts known to the trooper supported a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity that justified a brief investigative detention.\u201d Mem. and Order at 10-11, Appellant\u2019s App. at B-20-B-21. The court based this conclusion on Trooper Rule\u2019s testimony, which the court specifically found credible, that he smelled a strong odor of air freshener in Meyer\u2019s car, along with both troopers\u2019 observation that the trunk of the car sagged down as if heavily loaded, and Trooper Rule\u2019s observation that Meyer appeared unusually nervous during their encounter. <em>Id. </em>at B-21B-22. Trooper Rule was aware of these circumstances from the beginning of his encounter with Meyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the combination of those factors supported a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. \u201cThe Tenth Circuit has consistently held that the scent of air freshener is properly considered as a factor in the probable cause analysis.\u201d <em>West, </em>219 F.3d at 1179 (citations omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[although normal nervousness exhibited by those stopped for a traffic citation is usually entitled to limited significance in the probable cause analysis, ... extreme and continued nervousness\u201d is entitled to more weight. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the fact that the car appeared to be heavily loaded can contribute to a reasonable suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>supporting a stop and brief investigation. <em>See United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 683 n. 3, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (noting that one of the facts giving rise to reasonable suspicion to stop a truck was that it \u201cappeared to be heavily loaded\u201d). Viewed collectively, those factors would give an experienced officer reasonable articulable suspicion that Meyer was engaged in criminal activity and justify the brief continued detention. Thus, even were we to conclude that the encounter was non-consensual, or became non-consensual, we would find that Trooper Rule\u2019s brief detention of Meyer, including his seizure of him when he ordered him out of his car, was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">III. Validity of Consent to Dog Sniff</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Meyer\u2019s final argument appears to be that his consent to having Kilo walk around his car was rendered involuntary by the fact that he was being unlawfully detained at the time he gave that consent. He further appears to concede that the resolution of this issue is controlled by our resolution of the first two issues. Since we have affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the stop and detention were valid, Meyer\u2019s third argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the denial of Meyer\u2019s motion to suppress and AFFIRM his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-15\">. We have also reviewed the video tape, and conclude that the district court's factual findings are amply supported by the tape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. Kilo is Trooper Rule's drug detection dog, who usually accompanies the trooper on patrol. Trooper Rule is a trained and certified K-9 handler. Both he and Kilo are re-certified annually.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. Meyer also refers us to <em>United States v. Freeman, </em>209 F.3d 464, 468 (6th Cir.2000), in which, citing <em>Gregory, </em>the court held that a single instance of a large motor home briefly drifting into the emergency lane did not justify a traffic stop. That case is factually distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">With respect to Meyer's argument that there is an \"unsafe movement\u201d element in \u00a7 8-1522, he provides no support for that argument. Further, our decisions in <em>Ozbim </em>and <em>Gregory </em>state that the statutory phrase \"as nearly as practicable\u201d precludes \"absolute standards,\" but rather requires the kind of \u201cfact-specific inquiry\u201d we have conducted in this case. <em>Ozbirn, </em>189 F.3d at 1198.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b845-5\">. The district court also found that, immediately after Meyer consented to the dog sniff, Trooper Rule opened the car door and effectively \"ordered\" Meyer and Hayes out of the car. Mem. and Order at 12-13, Appellant's App. at B-22-B-23.
