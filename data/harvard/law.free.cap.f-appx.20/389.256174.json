FREELAND MANUFACTURING COMPANY, Respondent.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b419-12\">No. 01-1991.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b419-13\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b419-15\">Sept. 24, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b419-23\">Before RYAN, BATCHELDER, and COLE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b419-24\">JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b419-25\">The National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) applies for summary enforcement of its March 30, 2001, decision and order in Case No. 7-CA-43192 in which it found the respondent violated federal labor law and directed the respondent to take certain remedial steps stated therein. Although the respondent filed an answer to the charges against it, it later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>withdrew its answer on the grounds it had ceased operations, had laid off all employees, and that a creditor had a secured interest in all of its assets. In the absence of an answer, the Board entered default judgment against the respondent. The respondent has made no appearance before this court and does not contest the Board\u2019s application. Under these circumstances, we conclude the Board is entitled to summary enorcement. <em>See NLRB v. TriState Warehouse &amp; Distributing, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 31 (6th Cir.1982) (order) (in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a Board decision and order is entitled to summary enforcement if no objections are filed with the Board); <em>NLRB v. Innkeepers of Ohio, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 177 (6th Cir. 1979) (order). The fact the respondent may have ceased business operations and may no longer be able to comply with the Board\u2019s decision and order is not a bar to enforcement by this court. <em>NLRB v. Electric Steam Radiator Corp., </em>321 F.2d 733, 738 (6th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">It therefore is ORDERED that the Board\u2019s decision and order in Case No. 7-CA-43192 is hereby enforced. The respondent, Freeland Manufacturing Company, Detroit, Michigan, its officers, agents, successors and assigns, shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">1. Cease and desist from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">(a) Suspending employees for assisting the union or engaging in activities on behalf of the union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">(b) Terminating or otherwise discriminating against employees for assisting the union, or for making references to filing charges with the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">(c) In any like or related manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed them by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">2.
