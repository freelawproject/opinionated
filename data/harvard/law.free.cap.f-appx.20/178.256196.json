We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s decision and conclude that Smith is ineligible for that relief because she failed to accrue seven years of continuous physical presence prior to the initiation of deportation proceedings against her. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 518 (9th Cir.2001); <em>McBride v. INS, </em>238 F.3d 371, 375-77 (5th Cir. 2001); <em>Afolayan v. INS, </em>219 F.3d 784, 788-89 (8th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
