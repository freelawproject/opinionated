The government contends that the appeal should be dismissed because Gomez was resentenced pursuant to an agreement in which he expressly waived his right to appeal and because he does not meet the criteria set forth in USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 and thus does not qualify for a reduction in his sentence pursuant to the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Quintero-Gomez was re-sentenced to 168 months imprisonment after entering into a plea agreement with the government. As part of his plea agreement, Quintero-Gomez \u201cfreely, voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waive[ed] any right to further appeal any matter in connection with this prosecution and sentence ... \u201cBecause Quintero-Gomez does not challenge the validity of the waiver of the right to appeal, and there is no evidence that the waiver was not knowing or not voluntary, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v.
