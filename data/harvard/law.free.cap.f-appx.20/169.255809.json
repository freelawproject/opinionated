We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Craig, </em>985 F.2d 175, 178 (4th Cir.1993). For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">Johnson bore the burden of demonstrating a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e). We have articulated six factors for determining whether a defendant has met his burden: (1) whether the defendant has laid out credible evidence that his plea was not knowing and voluntary, (2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his innocence, (3) whether there has been a delay between the entering of the plea and the filing of the motion, (4) whether the defendant has had close assistance of competent counsel, (5) whether withdrawal will prejudice the government, and (6) whether a withdrawal will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">Johnson only contests the district court\u2019s decision on the basis of the fourth factor. He asserts he lacked close assistance of competent counsel, and the district court failed to make an adequate determination as to the validity of his contentions. In his oral motion to withdraw his plea, Johnson alleged his attorney operated under conflicting interests, and rendered erroneous advice regarding Johnson\u2019s pending sentence. Making an \u201cinescapably impressionistic judgment,\u201d the district court concluded that Johnson lacked a fair and just reason for withdrawal, <em>United States v. Sparks, </em>67 F.3d 1145, 1154 (4th Cir.1995). Nonetheless, despite finding no conflict of interest, the court permitted Johnson to substitute new counsel. Significantly, after retention of new counsel and after learning of the precise sentencing range he faced, Johnson ultimately abandoned his request to withdraw his guilty plea. Consequently, Johnson cannot credibly claim that he would have proceeded to trial but for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>allegedly ineffective assistance of his original counsel. <em>See United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir. 1992) (discussing dependance of success of fourth <em>Moore </em>factor on establishment that but for counsel\u2019s errors, defendant would have proceeded to trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Moreover, we have specifically held that an allegation that counsel\u2019s predictions caused a defendant to believe he would receive a shorter sentence than that imposed is not a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawing the plea when the court corrects or clarifies at the Rule 11 hearing the range of punishment to which the defendant is subject. <em>See id. </em>at 1395. In <em>Lam-bey, </em>the defendant received a sentence three times greater than that estimated by counsel, a quantitative error similar to that alleged in this case. Yet as in <em>Lambey, </em>the district court informed Johnson that he could receive a sentence up to life imprisonment, and Johnson indicated that he understood that possibility. Thus, Johnson was fully aware of the \u201cpotential vagaries of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
