Lavonne Moton-Teague (collectively \u201cH.O.M.E.\u201d), appeal from a district court judgment dismissing their complaint, which sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(p). The plaintiffs incurred those legal fees during the course of an administrative proceeding before the New York State Division of Human Rights in which they successfully challenged the discriminatory rental policy of the defendant landlords. The District Court (William M. Skretny, <em>Judge) </em>dismissed the complaint, holding that H.O.M.E. failed to state a valid claim for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(p). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">Prior to filing the complaint in this federal action, H.O.M.E. had already litigated their claim for attorney\u2019s fees in the state court system, and that claim had been denied. They originally brought their claims \u2014 both the substantive discrimination claim and the attorney\u2019s fees claim\u2014 before the New York State Division of Human Rights (\u201cNYDHR\u201d), where they were successful on the merits of their charge of discrimination but were denied their request for attorney\u2019s fees. The state agency denied the attorney\u2019s fees claim on the grounds that it had no power, that is jurisdiction, to grant attorney\u2019s fees. The Appellate Division Fourth Department affirmed the NYDHR decision insofar as it denied attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">H.O.M.E. arguably had a valid federal claim to attorney\u2019s fees, but now realizes that its decision to pursue its claim via New York State administrative proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>ings has denied it an opportunity to litigate that claim. Accordingly, it urges us to recognize an independent federal cause of action for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We decline to accept H.O.M.E.\u2019s invitation. Section 3612(p) of the Fair Housing Act does not provide for a separate cause of action under federal law, but instead provides that attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded \u201c[i]n any administrative proceeding brought under this section, or any court proceeding arising therefrom, or any civil action under this section____\u201d As a result, federal courts have awarded attorney\u2019s fees when plaintiffs have asserted a discrimination claim pursuant to the Fair Housing Act. <em>See, e.g., Cabrera v. Jakabovitz, </em>24 F.3d 372, 391 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>513 U.S. 876, 115 S.Ct. 205, 130 L.Ed.2d 135 (1994). As the District Court held, a free standing action for attorney\u2019s fee fits none of these three categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Nor are we persuaded that <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980), requires us to recognize such an action. <em>New York Gaslight </em>bears some similarities to this case: the plaintiff prevailed on the merits of its Title VII claim in a state administrative proceeding, and raised a claim for attorney\u2019s fees in a separate action before a federal district court. <em>See id. </em>at 58-59, 100 S.Ct. 2024. But the relevant similarities end there. The federal action in <em>New York Gaslight </em>involved other federal causes of action, beyond a claim for attorney\u2019s fees, so that the question of whether a separate action for attorney\u2019s fees is provided for \u201cis not only doubtful but is a question that is plainly not presented by this record.\u201d <em>See id </em>at 71, 100 S.Ct. 2024 (Stevens, J. concurring). Even more important, the statutory scheme both provided for attorney\u2019s fees <em>and </em>required that the plaintiff proceed via an administrative mechanism that could not award such fees. Thus, permitting the plaintiff to assert their fees claim in a separate action was the essential to realize Congress\u2019s twin objectives. <em>See </em>447 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2024. We are faced with no such dilemma here: H.O.M.E. could have prosecuted its discrimination claim via federal court at the outset, an avenue which would have preserved its fees claim. 42 U.S ,C. \u00a7 3612(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">We have considered all of the claims raised by H.O.M.E., and we find them to be without merit. For the reasons set forth, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-13\">. New York State amended its legislation in <em>1999 </em>to authorize NYDHR to grant attorney's fees in housing discrimination cases. <em>See </em>N.Y.
