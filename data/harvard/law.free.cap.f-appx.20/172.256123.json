He appeals the sentence of twenty-four months imprisonment imposed by the district court, contending that the district court clearly erred in refusing to award him a two-level adjustment for having a minor role in the offense. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2(b) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Steven Wells and Justin Stukey, friends of Jenkins, suggested burglarizing Parks Hardware in Parkersburg, West Virginia, the day before they broke into the store. Jenkins reportedly discouraged the idea. In the early hours of October 10, 2000, Jenkins drove Wells, Stukey, and another friend, Gilbert Carpenter, to a location near the store, where Stukey and Wells got out. According to Jenkins, they were all using methamphetamine and he believed Stukey and Wells were going to obtain more of the drug. When they returned, they told Jenkins they had broken into the hardware store and asked Jenkins to drive to the store so they could complete the theft. He complied. Wells and Stukey then removed approximately twenty-one firearms from the store and put them in Jenkins\u2019s car. Jenkins drove to his sister\u2019s house, where the weapons were divided. According to Wells, he and Stukey each took ten firearms, while Jenkins and Carpenter each received one firearm. At Jenkins\u2019 sentencing, the district court rejected his claim that he had a minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">A \u201cminor participant\u201d under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 is one who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants,\u201d but who has enough knowledge about the offense that he is not a \u201cminimal participant.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. nn. 1, 3. A defendant seeking a minor role adjustment has the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to it. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1177, 120 S.Ct. 1209, 145 L.Ed.2d 1111 (2000). The district court\u2019s factual determination that a defendant had a minor role is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1130, 120 S.Ct. 968, 145 L.Ed.2d 839 (2000). The appeals court should consider \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct relative to the other defendants ... [and] to the elements of conviction ... [and ask] whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d at 202 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">As evidence of his minor role, Jenkins points out that he did not help plan the theft, that it could have been committed without the aid of a getaway driver, and that he received only one of the stolen fire-arms. We cannot say, however, that the district court clearly erred in finding that Jenkins had more than a minor role. He willingly helped the thieves by allowing them to load the stolen firearms into his car. He thus assisted the theft with full knowledge of what the others were doing, and provided material, if not essential, assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
