We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Ursu entered the United States on October 2, 1990, with a six-month visitor visa. Ursu maintains that he filed an application for political asylum on October 19, 1990. The application does not appear in the record. No action was ever taken on the purported application. Ursu remained in the United States illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">On December 11, 1997, Ursu was convicted of DUI/Manslaughter, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.193(3), a second degree felony under Florida law, and sentenced to eighteen months of imprisonment. Ursu had driven while intoxicated and had struck and killed another driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">After Ursu\u2019s release from prison, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) sought to deport him on the bases that he had remained in the United States illegally, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) (1998),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1998). After a hearing, the IJ ordered Ursu\u2019s removal. The BIA affirmed, holding that Ursu was de-portable because he had committed an aggravated felony, <em>id, </em>and that he was ineligible for withholding of removal because, \u201chaving been convicted ... of a particular-</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">District of California, sitting by designation. ly serious crime,\u201d he was a danger to the community, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii) (1998). The BIA further held that the INS was not estopped from deporting him based on its alleged failure to act on his petition for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">We review the issue of our jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Sareang Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir.2000). We also review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s determination that Ursu is ineligible for withholding of removal; however, we accord considerable deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statute. <em>See Ramirez-Ramos v. INS, </em>814 F.2d 1394,1396 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">The BIA determined that Ursu had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was therefore deportable. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order of removal only if Ursu was <em>not </em>convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>See Sareang Ye, </em>214 F.3d at 1131; <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (1998). Because of our holding in <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir.2001), the INS now concedes that Ursu was not convicted of an aggravated felony. We agree and hold that we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">The BIA held that Ursu had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (1998), which defines an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d Such a conviction would make him ineligible for asylum, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(B)\u00ae (1998), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>would preclude our review, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (1998). The court in <em>Trinidadr-Aquino </em>held that the California crime of driving under the influence with injury to another, Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 23153, was not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (1998), <em>i.e., </em>that it was not a crime of violence, because it could be committed with a <em>mens rea </em>of negligence. <em>Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d at 1145. As with the California statute at issue in <em>Trinidad-Aquino, </em>a person can violate section 316.193(3) under Florida law by acting with a <em>mens rea </em>of negligence. <em>See generally State v. Van Hubbard, </em>751 So.2d 552 (Fla.1999). We conclude that DUI/Manslaughter under Florida law is not an aggravated felony within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (1998), and that therefore 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (1998) does not preclude our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">We turn to the question of whether DUI/Manslaughter is a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d If it is, then Ursu is ineligible for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) (1998), and ineligible for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii) (1998) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We grant the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the term deference because it is the agency charged with enforcing the statute. <em>See Ramirez-Ramos, </em>814 F.2d at 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The determination of whether a crime qualifies as particularly serious requires an examination of \u201cthe nature of the conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and the circumstances and facts underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>Mahini v. INS, </em>779 F.2d 1419, 1421 (9th Cir.1986). Here, the BIA determined that the crime was particularly serious in light of the facts that Ursu had caused the death of another human being and that he was so intoxicated that he failed to realize that he had injured someone and continued to drive until his car became disabled. The BIA emphasized that the seriousness of the crime of driving under the influence and the substantial risk of harm from that behavior have been -widely recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The BIA\u2019s holding in the case before us is thus consistent with its prior decisions, and is entitled to our deference, provided that it reflects a reasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>See, e.g., Wilshire Westwood Assocs. v. Atl. Richfield Corp., </em>881 F.2d 801, 809 (9th Cir.1989). Given that Ursu caused the death of another human being and that he was so impaired that he continued to operate his vehicle without realizing what he had done, we agree with the reasonableness of the BIA\u2019s decision that his crime was particularly serious. We affirm the BIA\u2019s holding that Ursu is not entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Finally, we turn to Ursu\u2019s argument that INS should be estopped from deporting him. Even leaving aside the formidable barriers to bringing an estoppel claim against a United States government agency, <em>see, e.g., Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 </em>F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir.2000), we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>evaluate Ursu\u2019s estoppel claim because his asylum application is not in the record. The immigration laws explicitly provide that \u201cthe court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (1998). <em>See also Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 963 (9th Cir. 1996) (en banc). Because no evidence of Ursu\u2019s 1990 asylum application is before us, even if we assume Ursu did file such an application, we cannot properly on this record determine the merits of his estop-pel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-16\">. We cite the 1998 version of the United States Code throughout because that version was in effect when the INS initiated removal proceedings against Ursu in February 1998, and the relevant statutes have been frequently amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) (1998) provides that the Attorney General does not have the power to grant asylum if the \"alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii) (1998) provides that withholding of removal is not available when \"the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime is a danger to the community of the United States.\u201d The BIA has consistently viewed the commission of a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d itself as signifying that petitioner constitutes a danger to the community. <em>See, e.g., In re SS-, </em>1999 BIA LEXIS 1, at *23-24, Interim Decision 3374 (1999); <em>see also Ahmetovic v.
