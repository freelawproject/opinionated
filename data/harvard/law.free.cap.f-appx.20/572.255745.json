After determining his offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Guidelines, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Estrada-Vega to 41 months in prison and two years supervised release. He appeals that sentence. Appellate counsel moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief arguing that Estrada-Vega was entitled to a downward departure because, as an illegal alien, he would receive disparate treatment from the Bureau of Prisons; because his prior aggravated felony was not serious; and because he is culturally assimilated in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-20\">As the district court assumed that it had authority to depart on the requested grounds as a matter of law, but found no factual basis to depart, the court\u2019s discretionary decision is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Rodriguez, </em>220 F.3d 940, 942 (8th Cir.2000). In addition, we note \u201cthat a defendant\u2019s alien status, without more, cannot take his case outside the heartland of cases under section 2L1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Cardosa-Rodri-guez, </em>241 F.3d 613 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-21\">Our independent review of the record has revealed no other nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-17\">.
