Inversiones Shemtov appeals the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U .S.C. \u00a7 2412. We review the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys fees for an abuse of discretion and its factual determinations for clear error, <em>see United, States v. One 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser, </em>248 F.3d 899, 903 (9th Cir.2001), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the government was substantially justified in its forfeiture claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 981 and 984. The government had probable cause to believe that $100,000 in laundered funds or replacement funds was in the Bank Leumi account because it was transferred there on the instructions of its agent. Given that the government could seek either the specific funds or replacement funds, it did not need to trace first in order for its position to be substantially justified. As the district court also found, the government dropped its \u00a7 981 theory once it learned that the account had been \u201czeroed out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Further, as the district court explained with respect to \u00a7 984, there was no authority putting a clear outer limit on when a seizure must occur to be \u201cforthwith\u201d for purposes of complying with Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, Rules C(2) and E(4)(a). The district court was in the best position to know all of the elements that bear upon whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified in this particular case, <em>see Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 560, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988), including the existence of a comprehensive criminal investigation that did not close until immediately before the seizure was effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Corporaci\u00f3n E. Inversiones Shemtov contends that regardless of whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified, the court should not have denied attorneys fees under \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(D). However, subsection (d)(1)(D) only applies where the United States has obtained a judgment and the non-prevailing party shows that the government\u2019s demand was nevertheless unreasonable. <em>See One 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser, </em>248 F.3d at 904. Here, judgment was not obtained by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
