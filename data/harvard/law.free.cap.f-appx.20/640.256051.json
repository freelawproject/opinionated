Lay, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">We find insufficient evidence in the record to support the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u2019s\u201d) decision denying Mei Zi Xea\u2019s application for asylum and therefore reverse. As the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">1. Where the BIA conducts an independent review of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cLFs\u201d) findings and determines that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum, this Court reviews under the substantial evidence standard the BIA\u2019s decision and not the decision of the IJ. <em>Sidlm v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Riverar-Moreno v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 481, 485 (9th Cir.2000). Here, the BIA relied on different reasons for its credibility determination than those pointed to by the IJ, so it is the BIA\u2019s decision that we are reviewing. If the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record considered as a whole, it must be upheld. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">2. Substantial evidence in the record supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Ms. Xea did not prove that she \u2014 as opposed to her spouse \u2014 was subjected to coercive family planning policies. Government officials never detained her, nor did they force her to have an abortion. Although Ms. Xea contends that she was assessed a series of fines to register her children, the fines do not rise to the level of persecution for which asylum may be granted. <em>See, e.g., Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">3. The BIA has determined that an applicant establishes eligibility for asylum if she can demonstrate her spouse was forcibly sterilized. <em>Matter of C-Y-Z, 21 I &amp; </em>N Dec. 915 (BIA 1997). Ms. Xea made this allegation at her asylum hearing, supported by her testimony and documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\">The BIA, however, rejected Ms. Xea\u2019s claim because, first, it doubted whether her husband was <em>forcibly </em>sterilized, suggesting that he may have voluntarily undergone the procedure. The BIA noted cultural preferences for male offspring in China and Ms. Xea\u2019s own expression of pride at having a son. It then reasoned that, having finally achieved a male heir after three daughters, Ms. Xea\u2019s husband might have submitted voluntarily to a sterilization procedure in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>satisfy Chinese family planning officials. This reasoning, however, is fundamentally flawed. Ms. Xea alleged, and the documentary evidence would support, that her husband was sterilized four months <em>before </em>her son\u2019s birth. There is no evidence suggesting he had knowledge of the child\u2019s sex at the time of the procedure, and Ms. Xea testified that she did not know the child\u2019s sex before his birth. We therefore reject this reason as a basis for doubting Ms. Xea\u2019s claim that her husband was forcibly sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">4. The BIA further questioned in passing whether Ms. Xea\u2019s husband was sterilized at all. It doubted the validity of the \u201csterilization certificate,\u201d noting that the State Department Report on current conditions in China discredited \u201cabortion certificates\u201d as evidence of forcible, as opposed to voluntary, abortion and contained no indication that similar certificates of sterilization existed. The absence of a reference in the State Department Report is hardly sufficient evidence to indicate the document is fabricated. Furthermore, the Certificate of Marriage, Birth and Family Planning Ms. Xea offered at her hearing is not similar to the questionable \u201cabortion certificates\u201d impugned by the State Department Report. We therefore find the BIA\u2019s basis for discrediting the document unjustified and thus not a sufficient basis for doubting Ms. Xea\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">5. For the foregoing reasons, we find that the BIA\u2019s reasoning for denying Ms. Xea eligibility for asylum patently inadequate. Consequently, we REVERSE its decision and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b671-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
