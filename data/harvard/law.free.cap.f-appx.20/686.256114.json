He appeals the denial of his motion to suppress evidence recovered during a search of his residence, and also appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-22\">A. <em>The Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-23\">According to Defendant, the supporting affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause for issuance of the warrant. We need not decide that question because, even if the warrant was not supported by probable cause, the evidence obtained in the search was admissible under the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <em>United States v. Clark, </em>31 F.3d 831, 835 (9th Cir.1994). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>determining whether the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception applies, \u201cthe inquiry is one of objective reasonableness; we must decide whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that this particular search was illegal despite the magistrate judge\u2019s authorization.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Defendant\u2019s main argument is that the supporting affidavit was \u201cso lacking in reliable information\u201d that no reasonable officer would have relied on the resulting search warrant. We disagree. Although the informant who provided the details in the supporting affidavit was far from a model citizen, his statements were against penal interest and the investigating officers confirmed details of his story before they sought the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The issue for purposes of the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception is not whether the magistrate judge was right to issue the warrant; rather, it is whether he was so obviously wrong that a police officer looking at the affidavit could not have had an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause. The affidavit was not so clearly inadequate, if it was inadequate at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">B. <em>The Enhancement Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) provides for an enhancement in cases in which a defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d Defendant concededly possessed firearms but argues that there was insufficient evidence of the other felony offense (manufacture of methamphetamine) and, in the alternative, that there was no evidence that he possessed the firearms \u201cin connection with\u201d that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The government presented sufficient evidence to establish the underlying felony. Evidence of the presence in Defendant\u2019s shed of laboratory-quality glassware covered with methamphetamine residue, cookware and a spatula with methamphetamine residue, and precursors like muriatic acid, iodine crystals, freon, and lye is sufficient to satisfy the government\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">The government also proved that Defendant possessed the weapons to embolden or protect his drug-manufacturing activity. This is a recognized connection for purposes of this enhancement. <em>United States v. Polanco, </em>93 F.3d 555, 567 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">Defendant\u2019s guns were hidden in the shed in which he was manufacturing methamphetamine. As in <em>Polanco, </em>it is reasonable to infer that the presence of the firearms had some emboldening effect on Defendant, because the guns gave him a ready means to defend the drugs that he was manufacturing in an otherwise less-than-secure location.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
