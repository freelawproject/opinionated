The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b35-21\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment entered May 22, 2000, dismissing the complaint with prejudice, and the district court\u2019s order entered July 7, 2000, denying reconsideration, be affirmed substantially for the reasons stated by the district court. Even under the \u201cless stringent standards\u201d accorded pro se litigants, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam), the district court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The sua sponte dismissal without leave to amend was appropriate because it is clear \u201cthe claimant cannot possibly win relief.\u201d <em>Raz-zoli v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>230 F.3d 371, 377 (D.C.Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Davis v. District of Columbia, </em>158 F.3d 1342, 1349 (D.C.Cir.1998) (internal quotation and citation omitted)). Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, </em>841 F.2d 1133, 1138 (D.C.Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
