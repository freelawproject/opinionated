We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Johnson contends at the time of his offense, USSG \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(4)(B) did not provide a sentence enhancement for fraud during bankruptcy proceedings. He argues the application of amendment 597 to the Sentencing Guidelines violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. We review ex post facto challenges to sentencing decisions de novo, <em>see United States v. Ortland, </em>109 F.3d 539, 543 (9th Cir.1997), and conclude Johnson\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">We have previously held section 2Fl.l(b)(4)(B) applies to bankruptcy fraud. <em>See United States v. Welch, </em>103 F.3d 906, 908 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (holding then-section 2Fl.l(b)(3)(B) applies to bankruptcy proceedings). Even without amendment 597, Johnson would have received the two point adjustment. <em>See id. </em>Because Johnson was not disadvantaged by the amendment, there was no ex post facto violation. <em>See United States v. Chea, </em>231 F.3d 531, 539 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
