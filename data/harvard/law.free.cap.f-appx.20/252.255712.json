Yow applied for Social Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-24\">We must uphold the decision to deny disability insurance benefits if the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>is supported by substantial evidence and the correct law was applied. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g) (West Supp.2001); <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 589 (4th Cir.1996). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court and the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
