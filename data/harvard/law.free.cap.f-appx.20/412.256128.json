Additionally, for the first time on appeal, Smith has contended that the district judge neglected to state adequate reasons for sentencing him at the high end of the applicable guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">During June 1998, Smith commenced regular correspondence, via instrumentalities of interstate communications including computerized electronic mail (\u201ce-mail\u201d) and the telephone, with an adolescent girl identified in the trial court record as \u201cK.H.. \u201d At that time, K.H., a Maryland citizen, was 16 years of age, whereas Smith, then an Alabama resident, was 42 years old and the father of a teen-aged daughter. Initially, their long-distance relationship consisted of sexually charged conversations and exchanges of explicit nude photographs. However, in early December 1998, the two \u201cfriends\u201d agreed to meet at a Holiday Inn motel near the girl\u2019s residence. On Sunday, December 8, 1998, Smith and K.H., who by this date was 17 years old, engaged in sexual activity, including cunnilingus and genital intercourse, inside a room at that motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Subsequently, Smith, in late December 1998, after relocating his domicile from Albertville, Alabama to Dyersburg, Tennessee, and without the girl\u2019s knowledge, traveled to a Days Inn motor lodge in Maryland with an intent to rendezvous with K.H.. However, on this occasion, K.H. resisted Smith\u2019s overtures. On December 27,1998, Smith, after locating K.H. at a shopping mall, pressured her into meeting with him at the motel. During that liaison, Smith presented K.H. with a necklace, a bracelet, and two tee-shirts. Nonetheless, despite' Smith\u2019s bids to purchase her continuing cooperation, the schoolgirl attempted to permanently terminate her relationship with the middle-aged Smith, which precipitated a violent argument. During that fracas, Smith verbally abused the juvenile, spat at her, physically restrained her to prevent her departure, and slammed her automobile\u2019s door on her leg as she entered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In early January 1999, notwithstanding Smith\u2019s demonstrated character and menacing behavior, K.H. naively resumed her long-distance correspondence with her exploiter. Smith told K.H. that he had purchased an engagement ring for her, and that he would finance her college education so that she could leave her parents. In mid-January 1999, Smith again traveled to Maryland to physically violate K.H.. During Smith\u2019s stay at the local Days Inn, K.H. performed fellatio upon him, twice engaged in coitus with him, and tolerated his digital penetration of her vagina. However, irrespective of their erstwhile intimacy, Smith physically and verbally assaulted K.H. when she attempted to depart the motel room. Among other things, he obstructed her exit, violently shoved her into a door, and dragged her to the bed whereupon he restrained her mobility by sitting on her, which caused her to \u201ccry hysterically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>In February 1999, Smith returned to the Days Inn hostelry. On February 13, 1999, K.H. orally stimulated Smith\u2019s genitals, and copulated with him, at that situs. Although Smith became enraged when the girl resisted his painful efforts to immerse his entire hand inside her vagina, to sodomize her anus, and to ejaculate inside her mouth, K.H. nonetheless assented to his marriage proposal after Smith , gifted her with a gold and diamond engagement ring. However, approximately one week following that encounter, the repentant female informed Smith once again, via telephone, that their intimate relationship was ended. On that occasion, K.H. evidenced a firm resolve to permanently disassociate herself from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">During the ensuing weeks, the frustrated Smith launched a \u201ccarrot-and-stick\u201d campaign to win his target\u2019s renewed acquiescence. His efforts included the delivery of several floral arrangements to K.H., coupled with death threats and declarations of intent to publish naked photographs of the schoolgirl on the world wide web unless she resumed gratifying his demands. Nonetheless, K.H. steadfastly refused to relent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In a quest to further pressure the girl, or alternatively to attain revenge against her, Smith, while deceptively posing as K.H., offered, via e-mail, to supply sexually explicit photographs of K.H. to several of her friends. Unbeknownst to Smith, a youthful recipient of his fraudulent and malevolent electronic messages alerted K.H. to his actions. The victim then contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The Maryland State Police Department assigned Trooper Brian Moser (\u201cMoser\u201d) of its Computer Crimes Unit to conduct an undercover investigation of Smith\u2019s activities. Moser established electronic contact with Smith using an alias, \u201cDavid Wiggins,\u201d a fictional sixteen-year-old classmate of K.H.\u2019s at Brunswick High School. Posing as the nonexistent \u2018Wiggins,\u201d the investigator expressed to Smith a desire to \u201cruin [KH.\u2019s] life.\u201d Convinced that \u2018Wiggins\u201d was a youth possessed of a kindred malicious spirit, Smith transmitted four smutty photographs of K.H. to his fictitious compatriot\u2019s e-mail account, accompanied by instructions to distribute them throughout the school building together with the rumor that K.H. had carnal relations with adult men whom she had met on the Internet, and to deliver prints of the vulgar pictures to K.H .\u2019s parents and her employment location.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In the meanwhile, Smith, acting in the guise of K.H., fabricated a web page on which the secondary student purportedly solicited sex from both male and female visitors. One mendacious posting on that Internet site advertised for a girl to participate in a three-way orgy with K.H. and an unnamed \u201cgreat older guy\u201d from Tennessee. Trooper Moser, now posing as \u201cStephadeus,\u201d a fictitious fifteen-year-old female, responded positively to that proposal. Smith, while pretending to be K.H., replied to that cyber-message by inviting, \u201cStephadeus\u201d to contact Smith for \u201cphone sex\u201d or to arrange a physical union. Smith reinforced his proposition by transmitting lewd images of K.H. and himself to the e-mail account which Moser had opened for his \u201cStephadeus\u201d alter ego. Concurrently, the defendant sent a digital-ized image of himself, along with his telephone number, to a \u201cbait\u201d web address which Moser had constructed using KH.\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">On May 27, 1999, at 8:00 a.m., two FBI agents and four local police officers, supported by a computer technician, executed a warrant search of Smith\u2019s residence in Dyersburg, Tennessee. Those investigators discovered Smith in the company of an adult male (Barry Pope) and an adoles<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>cent female (identified in the trial court record as \u201cV.N.\u201d). An exploration of Smith\u2019s computer hard drive and data storage disks disclosed that he had downloaded numerous pornographic depictions of under-aged females, including some who appeared pre-pubescent, performing various lascivious acts. Interviews of the house\u2019s occupants revealed that Smith had enticed V.N. to travel from Cleveland, Ohio; that Smith knew her tender age (seventeen); and that he had fornicated with her. Although the defendant initially asserted that V.N. had traveled to Tennessee by interstate bus, subsequent investigation proved that he had transported her from Cleveland to Dyersburg in his personal vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">On September 2, 1999, a federal grand jury charged Smith with seven felony offenses, to wit: (1) persuading, inducing, enticing, and coercing V.N., during the period April 1999 to May 27, 1999, to travel interstate for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse illegalized by Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-506 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(a)); (2) using interstate Internet and telephonic communication instrumen-talities, during the interval beginning in April 1999 and ending on May 27, 1999, to persuade, induce, entice, and coerce V.N. to engage in unlawful sexual intercourse (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b)); (3) transporting V.N. over state boundaries, between April 1999 and May 27, 1999, with the intent of committing illegal sexual acts with her (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a)); (4) using interstate Internet and telephonic means to persuade, induce, entice, and coerce K.H. to perform fellatio upon him in violation of Md.Code Ann. Art. 27, \u00a7 554 (18 U .S.C. \u00a7 2422(b)); (5) using a computer on approximately May 20, 1999 to electronically transmit, in interstate commerce, a visual image of K.H. engaging in sexually explicit conduct (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1)); (6) knowingly receiving, during the period June 1998 to May 27,1999, a visual depiction, which had been shipped in interstate commerce, of K.H. engaging in sexually explicit conduct (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2)); and (7) knowingly possessing, during the period December 1998 to May 27, 1999, seven computer disks plus a hard drive which retained visual depictions, which had been transmitted in interstate commerce, of minors performing sexually explicit acts (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B)). In addition, the indictment\u2019s ultimate count (no. 8) claimed criminal forfeiture of Smith\u2019s personal property connected to the crimes alleged above, including his personal computer and associated equipment, and his 1993 four-door Mercury Grand Marquis automobile (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">On February 25, 2000, the defendant executed a written plea agreement pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, whereby he pleaded guilty to each felony charge asserted in the indictment, and agreed to forfeit the personalty targeted in count 8, in exchange for the government\u2019s pledge to forbear any request for an upwards sentencing departure. On April 6, 1999, the probation office completed its presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) for the defendant, which disclosed, among other things, that Smith had incurred at least three prior sex-related convictions in Alabama, namely (1) attempted sexual misconduct and (2) first degree attempted sodomy, resulting from Smith\u2019s January 23, 1990 violent rape of a twenty-five-year-old woman, during which assault he inflicted several knife wounds upon his victim, for which he was sentenced on October 29, 1990 to serve ten years of imprisonment (initially suspended);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) an additional charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>of second degree rape committed on May 25, 1992 upon a fourteen-year-old girl, which earned the defendant, on June 11, 1995, a term of fifteen years in the state reformatory, which was modified on June 21, 1995 to three years in penal custody with twelve years suspended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On May 12, 2000, the presiding judge conducted a sentencing hearing, which encompassed sworn testimony from the victim detailing Smith\u2019s sundry acts of violence against her, including physically restraining her, shaking her, grabbing her arm, throwing her on the motel bed, slamming her automobile\u2019s door on her leg, and transmitting genital warts to her. Overruling Smith\u2019s objection, the sentencing jurist concluded that Smith qualified as a career offender, thus triggering the highest possible criminal history category (VI). Furthermore, rejecting Smith\u2019s opposition, the trial judge imposed a five-point enhancement to Smith\u2019s offense level for distributing pornographic material, plus an additional five-point enhancement for engaging in a pattern of abuse or exploitation of a minor, which, when cumu-lated with the defendant\u2019s uncontested offense level points, and after deduction of three points for acceptance of responsibility, produced a total offense level of 26. Smith\u2019s criminal history category of VI, matched with his offense level of 26, yielded a guidelines sentencing range of 120 to 150 months in the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A (Sentencing Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On May 18, 2000, the district court jour-nalized its judgment of conviction and sentence against Smith, which, among other things, condemned Smith to serve 150 months of rehabilitative detention in federal prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release. On that same day, Smith noticed a timely appeal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">A sentencing court\u2019s factual findings, made upon a preponderance of the evidence, are reviewed for clear error, which exists when \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Saucedo, </em>226 F.3d 782, 787 n. 10 (6th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1102, 121 S.Ct. 838, 148 L.Ed.2d 718 (2001). By contrast, the initial forum\u2019s legal conclusions are examined <em>de novo, </em>although its construction of the sentencing guidelines is entitled to \u201cdue deference.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Dunlap, </em>209 F.3d 472, 476-77 n. 8 (6th Cir.2000). Generally, the Official Commentary to the guidelines should be accorded the same authority as the guidelines themselves. <em>Dunlap, </em>209 F.3d at 477 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The sentencing guidelines\u2019 definition of a \u201ccareer offender\u201d comprises three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. That section further posits that \u201c[a] career offender\u2019s criminal history category in every case shall be Category VI.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">No dispute exists that Smith was over age 18 when he committed the subject offense conduct. Thus, Smith fulfilled the first requisite of \u201ccareer offender\u201d status.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Regarding the second requirement, the trial court found that <em>two </em>of Smith\u2019s counts of conviction were felonious crimes of violence:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (1) count one, use of a computer to entice a minor (V .N.) to travel interstate to engage in unlawful sex, which carried a potential penalty of ten years in prison (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(a)); and (2) count three, interstate transportation of a minor (V.N.) to commit illegal sex acts, which was maximally punishable by fifteen years in federal custody (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a)). The Sixth Circuit has instructed that any felony involving the sexual exploitation of a juvenile inherently poses a serious potential risk of physical injury to the victim and hence constitutes a categorical \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>256 F.3d 381, 395-97 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Champion, </em>248 F.3d 502, 505-06 (6th Cir.2001). Therefore, the district judge\u2019s ruling that Smith had committed at least one subject felonious violent crime of conviction was not contaminated by any error of law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Addressing the final branch of the three-pronged \u201ccareer offender\u201d query, the trial court resolved that at least two of Smith\u2019s three prior Alabama convictions, evolved above, were anchored in violent felony offenses. The conduct averred in the April 1990 Alabama indictment against Smith included \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse with [an adult victim], a female, by forcible compulsion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in violation of \u00a7 13A-6-63 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as last amended,\u201d and further charged forcible anal and oral penetration of the same victim in affront to the same Alabama statute. The Alabama jury convicted Smith of attempted sexual misconduct and first degree attempted sodomy. Alabama\u2019s sodomy statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>(a) A person commits the crime of sodomy in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">(1) He engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person by forcible compulsion!)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">(b) Sodomy in the first degree is a Class A felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Accordingly, at minimum, Smith\u2019s January 23, 1990 Alabama conviction for attempted sodomy in the first degree constituted a felonious crime of violence, because it included, as an essential element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violence; and, alternatively, because the subject indictment had alleged conduct which posed a serious risk of physical injury to the victim. <em>See </em>note 4 above; <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>58 F.3d 1117, 1124 (6th Cir.1995). Smith\u2019s June 1995 Alabama conviction for the second degree rape of a fourteen-year-old girl supplied the second requisite prior violent felony conviction<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because, as illustrated above, any felony conviction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor victim categorically constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See Campbell, </em>256 F.3d at 395-97; <em>Champion, </em>248 F.3d at 505-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Thus, because the three required elements of \u00a7 4B1.1 had been proved, the district court correctly applied the \u201ccareer offender\u201d guideline to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The defendant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s five-point augmentation of his offense level for distributing materials involving the sexual exploitation of a minor was likewise misconceived. At the time of</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Smith\u2019s May 2000 sentencing, the guidelines directed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-16\">If the offense [related to materials involving the sexual exploitation of a minor] involved distribution, increase [the offense level] by the number of levels from the table in \u00a7 2F1.1 corresponding to the retail value of the material, <em>but in no event by less than 5 levels.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) (Nov. 1, 1998) (italics added; boldface in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">Contrary to Smith\u2019s argument, the absence of a monetary incentive motivating his electronic distribution of obscene photographs of K.H. did not insulate him from the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Hibbler, </em>159 F.3d 233, 237-38 (6th Cir.1998) <em>(citing United States v. Canada, </em>110 F.3d 260, 263 (5th Cir. 1997)), <em>cert, denied, </em>526 U.S. 1030, 119 S.Ct. 1278, 143 L.Ed.2d 372 (1999). Smith\u2019s alternate contention, that enhancing his offense level for \u201cdistributing\u201d salacious images of a juvenile via the Internet constituted impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d because he had been separately punished for \u201ctransporting or shipping\u201d sexually explicit images of the same girl in interstate commerce under count five of the indictment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was also ill-formulated. \u201cDistribution\u201d of pornographic images of a minor is an activity materially distinct from the use of a computer to \u201ctransport or ship\u201d sordid visual depictions of a minor \u2014 whereas \u00a7 2252(a)(1) punishes <em>the abuse of avenues of interstate commerce </em>by transmitting prurient and offensive sexual images of children thereby, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) penalizes <em>the publication or broadcast to others </em>of such degenerate and exploitative likenesses. <em>See United States v. Muhammad, </em>948 F.2d 1449, 1458 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">At any rate, the \u201cdouble counting\u201d prohibition does <em>not </em>preclude the imposition of a guidelines enhancement for the same or similar conduct independently punished by statute, \u201cwhere it appears that Congress or the Sentencing Commission intended to attach multiple penalties to the same conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Farrow, </em>198 F.3d 179, 194 (6th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). The Sentencing Commission, in Appendix A to the guidelines, specified that the enhancements dictated by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 would apply to persons, like Smith, convicted of impinging 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument was inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Next, the defendant has assailed the trial court\u2019s assessment of five offense levels for engaging \u201cin a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). The Official Commentary instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">For purposes of this guideline -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cPattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor\u201d means any combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant, whether or not the abuse or exploitation (A) occurred during the course of the offense; (B) involved the same or different victims; or (C) resulted in a conviction for such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201cSexual abuse or exploitation\u201d means conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, abusive sexual contact of a minor, any similar offense under state law, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the above offenses. \u201cSexual abuse or exploitation\u201d does not include trafficking in material relating to the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">Prior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(4) are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-13\"><em>Id. </em>(n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Smith\u2019s sex crimes, developed above, against K.H., V.N., and a hapless fourteen-year-old child in Alabama, when aggregated, constituted \u201ctwo or more instances of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation\u201d of minors by the defendant. Smith\u2019s erroneous contention, supported solely by nonbinding, unpersuasive, and off-point out-of-circuit precedents, that only transgressions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241-45, which illegalize various forms of sexual abuse committed within the federal special maritime or territorial jurisdiction, or \u00a7 2251, which outlaws certain acts related to the sexual exploitation of children,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> should exclusively be recognized under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), contradicted the broad inclusive language of that guideline\u2019s above-quoted Application Note 1, and thus is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">Finally, the defendant has postulated that the sentencing judge prejudicially erred by allegedly neglecting to articulate, on the record, her reasons for sentencing him at the highest extreme, rather than at a lesser point, on the applicable 120-to-150-month guidelines range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>181 F.3d 740, 744 (6th Cir.1999). However, because Smith failed to object to the trial court\u2019s averred default of that statutory obligation, he has forfeited that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>challenge; it is therefore non-cognizable on review, unless the lower court\u2019s charged omission constituted prejudicial \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770,123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Kingsley, </em>241 F.3d 828, 835-36 (6th Cir.2001), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>No. 00-10459 (June 5, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the sentencing bench did not commit the charged error. The sentencing transcript reflected multiple rationales for the district judge\u2019s election to impose the maximum custodial term allowed under the guidelines, including Smith\u2019s efforts to traumatize his youthful victim by distributing private intimate photographs of her, and embarrassing personal information and false rumors about her, in a vengeful bid to tarnish her reputation among her classmates and relatives, as well as by stalking and harassing her; his repeated abusive sexual exploits with, and victimization of, at least three juvenile females, including the violent ravishment of a fourteen-year-old student; his age (early 40s) at the time of his crimes of conviction; the defendant\u2019s long-standing pattern and practice of unconscionable manipulation of naive adolescents by means including threatened injuries and actual physical and emotional assaults; and the social interest in quarantining immoral predatory pedophiles like Smith from vulnerable and gullible children for the maximum duration authorized by the law. Any arguable inadequacy in the district court\u2019s articulation of its reasons for imposing the highest possible guidelines sentence would be, at worst, harmless error, given that \u201cthe supporting reasons are evident on the overall record[.]\u201d <em>Kingsley, </em>241 F.3d at 836 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">This reviewing court has carefully considered all arguments mounted by the appellant, and concludes that each was misconceived.

On June 19, 1992, following a judicial hearing, the suspension of Smith's ten-year prison term for his above-referenced January 23, 1990 violent sexual attack was revoked, whereupon he was remanded to state custody. Ultimately, the Alabama trial court directed that Smith's October 29, 1990 and June 21, 1995 penalties would run concurrently. Although the PSR did not reflect the date of Smith's release on probation from the Alabama correctional system, it disclosed that Smith \"was conditionally released from supervised probation on December 9, 1997, after having completed over half of his probation\" but that his \"probation officially expires June 17, 2000.\u201d Accordingly, Smith was on probation for the commission of sex-related felonies, including the victimization of a secondary school pupil, when he committed the instant offenses against K.H. and V.N..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">.
