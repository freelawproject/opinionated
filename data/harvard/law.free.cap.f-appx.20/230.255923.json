To the extent the district court found that Mrs. Chasse failed to establish proximate cause, our review of the materials before us discloses no reversible error, and we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Chasse v. United States, </em>No. CA-97-3511-8 (D.S.C. May 15, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>In No. 00-2105, Mrs. Chasse appeals the award of costs to the United States pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Chasse v. United States, </em>No. CA-97-3511-7 (D.S.C. July 6, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
