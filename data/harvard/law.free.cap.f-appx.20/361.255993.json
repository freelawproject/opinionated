The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In 1997, Todd was convicted of conspiring to manufacture marijuana, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. He was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment and sixty months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Todd alleged that he should be eligible for a reduced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), if he successfully completed a drug-treatment program. The district court noted a prison regulation that made Todd ineligible for this sentence reduction, as he had possessed a firearm during his offense. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(vi)(B). Nevertheless, the court issued a writ of habeas corpus on July 30, 1999, citing language in \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) that made the reduction available to any prisoner who had not been convicted of a violent crime. The government\u2019s motion for reconsideration was subsequently denied, and it now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Unfortunately, the district court did not have the benefit of a recent Supreme Court decision, which held that the Bureau of Prisons may categorically exclude prisoners from a \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) sentence reduction based on their preconviction conduct. <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 244, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001). In so ruling, the Court also found that it was reasonable to conclude that \u201can inmate\u2019s prior involvement with firearms, in connection with the commission of a felony, suggests his readiness to resort to life-endangering violence and therefore appropriately determines the early release decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of this decision, Todd now concedes that the issue has been resolved in favor of the Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
