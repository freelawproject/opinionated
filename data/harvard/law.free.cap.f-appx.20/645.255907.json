We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition on statute of limitations grounds and its decision not to equitably toll the limitations period. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir. 1999). We agree with the district court that Ledezma\u2019s petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Ledezma\u2019s petition challenges his 1994 conviction for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The one-year limitations period under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 began to run on May 18, 1998. <em>See </em>28 U .S.C. \u00a7 2255(3); <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>195 F.3d 544, 548 (9th Cir.1999). Ledezma therefore had until May 18,1999, to file his habeas petition. Ledezma did not file his petition, however, until October 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We reject Ledezma\u2019s argument that the limitations period should be extended because of his deportation from the United States. Under the circumstances here, we cannot conclude that Ledezma\u2019s deportation was an \u201cimpediment\u201d to filing his habeas petition that was \u201ccreated by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(2). We also reject Ledezma\u2019s equitable-tolling argument, because he has shown no \u201cextraordinary circumstances beyond [his] control,\u201d following his deportation, that made it \u201cimpossible to file a petition on time.\u201d <em>Green v. White, </em>223 F.3d 1001,1003 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
