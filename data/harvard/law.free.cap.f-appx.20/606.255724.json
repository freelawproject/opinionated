Gomez-Trapala contends that in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court erred in imposing a sentence in excess of the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) based upon a prior felony to which he did not admit, and which was not submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He also contends that <em>Apprendi </em>renders inapplicable <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor and not a separate offense), because he did not admit to an aggravated felony at his plea hearing. His arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir.2000), <em>amended by </em>2000 WL 33156290 (9th Cir. Feb.8, 2001) (order). <em>United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1020,1025 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The sentence is AFFIRMED. This matter is REMANDED to the district court with directions to correct the judgment of conviction to exclude the reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), consistent with <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir.2000). <em>United States v. Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">.
