The complaint is anything but a \u201cshort and plain\u201d statement of the claims for relief, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), but we are able to discern a recurring theme\u2014 Omegbu and Chesser seek to challenge a Wisconsin law that permits the City of Milwaukee to create charter schools. After sifting through Omegbu and Chesser\u2019s complaint, the district court ultimately concluded that it failed to state a federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-22\">On appeal Omegbu and Chesser have filed separate briefs but neither offers a discernable basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s judgment. Their briefs, to say the least, are no more understandable than their complaint, with one exception. Om-egbu argues that the defendants have violated a litany of constitutional and statutory provisions by refusing to pay him for masonry work his corporation performed at a local school in retaliation for filing this suit. We believe, however, that Omegbu has done nothing more than recast a routine contract dispute as a violation of federal law, which it is not. Omegbu and Chesser do not otherwise direct our attention to any error in the district court\u2019s judgment, and after reviewing the record and the briefs, we are of the opinion that the district court correctly dismissed their complaint. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
