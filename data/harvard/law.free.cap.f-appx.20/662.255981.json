Alexander argued before the district court that the statute of limitations found in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), was tolled because his prison law library did not contain a copy of AEDPA until well after the limitations period would have expired in his case. The district court, relying on the panel opinion in <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>204 F.3d 907, 909 (9th Cir.2000), held that inadequacies of the prison law library could not give rise to tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-26\">Equitable tolling is available \u201cif extraordinary circumstances beyond a pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>oner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted). <em>See also Allen v. Lewis, 255 </em>F.3d 798, 800 (9th Cir.2001). Statutory tolling is available until an \u201cimpediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such state action.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). After the district court\u2019s decision was rendered, we withdrew the <em>Whalem/Hunt </em>panel\u2019s decision and rendered an en banc opinion emphasizing that \u201cdeterminations of whether there was an \u2018impediment\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) and whether there are grounds for equitable tolling are highly fact-dependent.\u201d <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146, 1148 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In support of his declaration to the district court that he had \u201cabsolutely no knowledge whatsoever\u201d that his habeas petition was subject to a one-year limitations period, Alexander submitted several declarations from inmates and prisoner law-library clerks regarding the timing of the library\u2019s acquisition of updated AEDPA materials and the lack of legal training for inmate clerks. The State does not appear to have been asked to respond to Alexander\u2019s declaration, and the district court held no evidentiary hearing and made no factual findings relevant to Alexander\u2019s various claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">It cannot be said that there are \u201cno circumstances consistent with petitioner\u2019s petition and declaration under which he would be entitled to a finding of an \u2018impediment\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) or to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Whalem/Hunt, </em>233 F.3d at 1148. Because \u201cthe district court is in a better position to develop the facts and assess their legal significance in the first instance,\u201d <em>id., </em>we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court for appropriate development of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b692-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
