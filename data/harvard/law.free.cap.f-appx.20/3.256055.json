The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b33-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment filed June 30, 2000 be affirmed. The district court did not abuse its discretion or misapply the law in its denial of appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. <em>See United States v. Rouse, </em>168 F.3d 1371, 1375 (D.C.Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s determination that the testimony of Michael Blake would not probably lead to an acquittal was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Woolfolk, </em>197 F.3d 900, 905 &amp; n. 1 (7th Cir.1999) (district court\u2019s denial of new trial based upon witness\u2019 lack of credibility not abuse of discretion); <em>Rouse, </em>168 F.3d at 1376 (same). The district court\u2019s conclusion that the testimony of appellant\u2019s proposed expert would have been discovered prior to trial with due diligence was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>103 F.3d 606, 609-10 (7th Cir.1997) (new trial not warranted where expert testimony could have been produced prior to trial; defendant had not used due diligence); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>79 F.3d 105, 108 (8th Cir.1996) (same), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>520 U.S. 1226,117 S.Ct. 1816,137 L.Ed.2d 1025 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-21\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
