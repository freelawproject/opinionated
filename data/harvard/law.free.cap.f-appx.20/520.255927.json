Mr. Jones argues that the district court misapplied the one-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 2255 116 by miscalculating the beginning date of the limitations period. Because we conclude that the present record lacks an adequate foundation for finding Mr. Jones\u2019s motion untimely, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Mr. Jones pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962, and on October 24, 1997, received a 168-month prison sentence. He did not file a direct appeal. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, postmarked July 1, 1999, and file-stamped by the district court on July 7, Mr. Jones presses several theories of ineffective assistance of counsel and disputes the computation of his sentence. Specifically, Mr. Jones challenges his attorney\u2019s preparedness, his failure to object to matters at sentencing, and his failure to file a direct appeal upon request. Additionally, Mr. Jones asserts that the district court miscalculated his base offense level when computing his guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In the district court Mr. Jones maintained that his \u00a7 2255 motion was timely under \u00a7 2255 H 6(4), which starts the statute of limitations on \u201cthe date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d Mr. Jones alleged that his trial attorney failed to file a direct appeal despite a request at an unspecified time to do so, and he added that he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cforthwith\u201d upon discovering this fact. He did not discuss the timeliness of his other claims or offer further information to excuse his delay in presenting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The district court sua sponte concluded that the motion was facially untimely, having been filed almost two years after the date Mr. Jones was sentenced. Focusing on former counsel\u2019s failure to file a direct appeal, however, the court anticipated that Mr. Jones might be able to \u201csuccessfully bring himself within the statutory alternative\u201d of \u00a7 2255 116(4). Accordingly, the court ordered both Mr. Jones and the lawyer, Nathan Diamond-Falk, to file affidavits detailing the dates and nature of any communications between them concerning Mr. Jones\u2019s purported desire to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Attorney Diamond-Falk never responded, but Mr. Jones filed a supplemental affidavit and attached a letter from his wife addressed \u201cTo Whom It May Concern.\u201d In this follow-up affidavit, Mr. Jones describes his post-sentencing conversations with Diamond-Falk about the possibility of filing an appeal, although it is unclear from the affidavit when-if at all-Mr. Jones specifically instructed counsel to file a notice of appeal. According to Mr. Jones, immediately following sentencing he asked the attorney what could be done about his case and then asked, \u201cCan we appeal this?\u201d Diamond-Falk reportedly replied that he did not know but that Mr. Jones should call him later. Mr. Jones says he telephoned the following day and asked \u201cif we could appeal the decision.\u201d Diamond-Falk suggested that Mr. Jones make an appointment to discuss the matter. Mr. Jones did so, but he later called to reschedule the appointment and, according to his supplemental affidavit, \u201cagain asked Mr. Diamond-Falk to file an appeal.\u201d Diamond-Falk replied, \u201cJust enjoy your holiday. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">At this point in his supplemental affidavit, Mr. Jones \u201cincorporates\u201d the letter from his wife, who details her own conversations with attorney Diamond-Falk after Mr. Jones began serving his prison sentence. Stephanie Jones relates having telephoned Diamond-Falk in mid-February 1998 to inquire about appealing and being told by him on February 19 or 20 that there was \u201cnothing he could do\u201d because the case was \u201cclosed\u201d and he already had \u201cdone everything he could.\u201d Ms. Jones notes also in her letter that in September 1998 she raised the subject of an appeal with attorney Mark Kusolzky, who tried several times to contact Diamond-Falk about Mr. Jones\u2019s case. Finally in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>December 1998 Kusolzky verified through court records that Diamond-Falk had not filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Mr. Jones then concludes his supplemental affidavit by noting that, after he and his wife learned from Kusolzky that an appeal had never been filed, they began arranging to obtain copies of the relevant court documents. For financial reasons, Mr. Jones maintains, they were unable to secure the needed copies until June 28, 1999. As noted earlier, Mr. Jones filed his \u00a7 2255 motion shortly thereafter in early July 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Armed with this information from Mr. Jones, the district court concluded that \u201cnot later than February 20, 1998 [Mr. Jones\u2019s] wife was aware on his behalf that Diamond-Falk had not taken any action toward an appeal.\u201d The court thus reasoned that the one-year limitations period had long expired before Mr. Jones filed his \u00a7 2255 motion in July 1999, and accordingly dismissed the motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Mr. Jones timely moved for reconsideration, requesting that the district court construe his \u00a7 2255 motion as seeking coram nobis relief and thus not subject to the one-year statute of limitations. When the district court declined, Mr. Jones filed a \u201cMotion for Relief from Judgment\u201d disputing the district court\u2019s statute-of-limitations analysis. In an attached affidavit, Mr. Jones for the first time avers specifically that on the day of sentencing he explicitly instructed attorney Diamond-Falk to file an appeal. He also asserts that he was not aware that Diamond-Falk was not going to file an appeal until Ku-solzky investigated the situation in late 1998. The district court denied this motion \u201cfor failure to advance any reasons justifying relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Mr. Jones filed a notice of appeal that brings before us the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion and the denial of his motion to reconsider. We issued a certificate of appealability allowing him to challenge the timeliness issue and the underlying ineffective-assistance claim. Mr. Jones later filed another notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his Motion for Relief from Judgment, but he abandoned that appeal and so that motion is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">We begin by noting that our analysis of whether Mr. Jones timely filed his \u00a7 2255 motion applies only to his theory that attorney Diamond-Falk was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal. For all other arguments-challenges to the calculation of Mr. Jones\u2019s sentence and additional theories of ineffective assistance based on his attorney\u2019s preparation and performance at sentencing-the underlying facts necessary to seek post-conviction relief were known at the time of sentencing. Thus, the statute of limitations with respect to Mr. Jones\u2019s other contentions began running when his conviction became final, and he offers no rationale that the limitations period was tolled for those arguments. In- \u25a0 deed, in his brief and at oral argument, counsel encouraged us to construe Mr. Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as presenting only a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file a direct appeal. We accept that invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">As to the timeliness of Mr. Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the one-year limitations period began to run from the latest of four dates, only one of which is relevant here: \u201cthe date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 116(4). Inquiry into due diligence focuses on when the factual predicate of a particular claim <em>could have been </em>discover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ed; recognition of the legal significance of the facts is irrelevant, as is the time that the underlying facts were actually discovered. <em>Owens v. Boyd, </em>235 F.3d 356, 359 (7th Cir.2000). Still, courts evaluating the timeliness of a \u00a7 2255 motion must consider \u201cindividual circumstances,\u201d which for imprisoned individuals include the conditions of confinement and the practical realities of the prison system. <em>Montenegro v. United States, </em>248 F.3d 585, 592 (7th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The district court concluded that Mr. Jones had not been diligent in presenting his \u00a7 2255 motion in view of the information included in his supplemental affidavit and the attached letter from his wife. Mr. Jones was sentenced in October 1997; according to his affidavit he tried for several months to contact attorney Diamond-Falk about an appeal. The district court also relied on the letter from Ms. Jones describing the February 1998 conversation in which Diamond-Falk told her that there was \u201cnothing he could do\u201d and that the case was \u201cclosed.\u201d Because Mr. Jones filed his \u00a7 2255 motion in July 1999, the district court found that he had exceeded the one-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Mr. Jones contends that the district court erred by imputing to him the information his wife learned during her February 1998 conversation with Diamond-Falk, and by concluding that \u201chis wife was aware on his behalf\u2019 that no appeal had been filed. We agree that this decision was precipitous. The district court did not cite, and the government has not offered, any legal authority to support imputing knowledge between spouses in situations like this. We have been unable to find any cases instructing that the district court could-or should as a matter of policy-treat spouses as one unit for purposes of ascertaining due diligence. Moreover, there is an insufficient factual basis in this particular case from which to conclude that Mr. Jones was aware of attorney Diamond-Falk\u2019s representations in February 1998. Given the truncated proceedings in the district court, the record concerning Mr. Jones\u2019s knowledge of his attorney\u2019s intentions has not been developed enough to support the district court\u2019s factual findings and its ultimate holding of untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The government suggests that it was perfectly appropriate for the district court to impute to Mr. Jones the information in his wife\u2019s letter because of the manner in which he presented the letter to the district court. The government points out that Mr. Jones attached his wife\u2019s letter to his affidavit, filed in direct response to a question from the district court concerning the timing and substance of his communications with attorney Diamond-Falk. Further, Mr. Jones\u2019s affidavit explicitly states that he wishes to \u201cincorporate[ ]\u201d the attached document. Thus, the government maintains, Mr. Jones represented to the district court that he was aware of the conversations his wife had with Diamond-Falk and with the later attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">At first blush this seems to be a reasonable inference; the government\u2019s argument possesses a certain amount of logic. We too are tempted to ascribe great significance to Mr. Jones\u2019s incorporation of his wife\u2019s letter. But after careful consideration, we are not prepared to assume that Mr. Jones knew from his wife about attorney Diamond-Falk\u2019s February 1998 statements that the criminal case was over. Though we agree that Mr. Jones\u2019s presentation gives rise to some inference of knowledge, that inference is not conclusive and we are unwilling to fill the gap with speculation. And we cannot avoid observing that, although the document is not squarely before us, Mr. Jones filed a later affidavit accompanying his Motion for Relief from Judgment that is consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>his position here; Mr. Jones avers in that document that his wife did not relay the February 1998 conversation to him and that he did not discover that Diamond-Falk had not filed an appeal until late-1998 after a different attorney researched the case. This issue presents a simple factual question that can and should be uncovered with a more developed record.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The parties have spent considerable time discussing the judge-made doctrine of equitable tolling. Although we initially requested that they do so, further evaluation of the case leads us to conclude that, if equitable tolling exists independently of \u00a7 2255 K 6, <em>see, e.g., Montenegro, </em>248 F.3d at 594, Mr. Jones does not meet the very high threshold necessary to invoke the doctrine. Equitable tolling is granted sparingly, <em>United States v. Marcello, </em>212 F.3d 1005, 1010 (7th Cir.2000), and the present situation does not present the kind of \u201c[ejxtraordinary circumstances far beyond the litigant\u2019s control\u201d that would warrant relief. <em>Id.; see also Montenegro, </em>248 F.3d at 594 (refusing to apply equitable tolling despite language barrier, attorney\u2019s nonresponsiveness to prisoner\u2019s letter, prisoner\u2019s limited education and lack of knowledge of prison system, and prisoner\u2019s transfer between prisons). Thus, the district court is left to decide at what point Mr. Jones should have with due diligence discovered that his former counsel had not filed a notice of appeal. If that date is within one year of his \u00a7 2255 motion, then to ultimately obtain relief under \u00a7 2255 Mr. Jones will need to establish conclusively that he specifically instructed attorney Diamond-Falk to file an appeal. <em>See, e.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000); <em>Montenegro, </em>248 F.3d at 590; <em>Castellanos v. United States, </em>26 F.3d 717, 718 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The district court\u2019s decision is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
