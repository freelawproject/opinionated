Garcia\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of sufficiency of the evidence. Garcia has filed a supplemental pro se brief raising the additional issue of whether his conviction and sentence violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim on appeal, we must sustain the verdict if the record contains \u201csubstantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Applying this standard, we give due regard to the fact finder\u2019s prerogative to resolve questions of credibility. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996). We conclude that the Government presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find Garcia guilty of the charges listed in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Regarding Garcia\u2019s claim that he was sentenced beyond the statutory maximum, we have considered Garcia\u2019s sentence under the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and find no error. Garcia\u2019s term of imprisonment does not exceed the statutory m\u00e1ximums set out in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) (West 1999). <em>United States v. White, </em>238 F.3d 537, 542-43 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 2235, 150 L.Ed.2d 225 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence. We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
