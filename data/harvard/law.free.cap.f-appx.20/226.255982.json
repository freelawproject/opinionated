Robinson alleges that his jury instructions were erroneous in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We first note that because Robinson was sentenced within the statutory maximum, his convictions are unaffected by the <em>Ap-prendi </em>opinion. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-200 (4th Cir. 2000) <em>(Apprendi </em>does not apply to a judge\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion within a statutory range so long as a defendant\u2019s sentence is not set beyond the maximum term specified in the substantive statute), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). Second, we find that the jury was properly charged to find drug amounts, in any event. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>233 F.3d 223, 231 (4th Cir.2000), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Mar. 19, 2001) (No. 00-9234). Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
