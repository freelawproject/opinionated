The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b34-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment filed October 19, 2000, be affirmed. Appellant has not demonstrated that the reasonable doubt jury instruction constituted error, much less plain error. <em>See United States v. Merlos, </em>8 F.3d 48, 50 (D.C.Cir.1993) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). The district court did not commit error when it instructed the jury on reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Dale, </em>991 F.2d 819, 853 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>510 U.S. 1030, 114 S.Ct. 650,126 L.Ed.2d 607 (1993) (approving the same Redbook model jury instruction used by the district court). Moreover, looking at the instruction as a whole, we conclude that there appears no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in an unconstitutional manner. <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 6, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994). Furthermore, as neither the instruction nor any portion of it has been disapproved by a court, the asserted error would not be plain. <em>See Merlos, </em>8 F.3d at 51. Finally, even if the instruction constituted plain error, it did not seriously affect \u201cthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736,113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-21\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
