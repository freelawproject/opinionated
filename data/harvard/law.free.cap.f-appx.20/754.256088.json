Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the transitional rules apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, 133 </em>F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and we therefore have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), <em>as amended by </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c), <em>Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1195 n. 4 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Bobadilla\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Even assuming that Bobadilla complied with the procedural requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), her claim must fail because the record does not show that she suffered any actual prejudice due to ineffective representation. <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Mohsseni v. INS, </em>796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The BIA did not err in holding that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Bobadilla\u2019s motion for a continuance to seek medical records. <em>De La Cruz v. INS, </em>951 F.2d 226, 229 (9th Cir.1991). The matter was continued two times for other reasons, and Bobadilla had ample time to obtain and introduce additional medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
