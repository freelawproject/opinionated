On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he argues that the government induced Norris to plead guilty by orally promising to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and that its decision not to do so breached the promise and was irrational and made in bad faith because the government\u2019s decision was based on grand jury testimony Norris had given in an unrelated case. Counsel asks that we remand the case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>an evidentiary hearing on this issue. Norris has filed a pro se brief in which he contends that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred by not making a specific finding that he willfully obstructed justice before imposing a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, that the evidence does not support the enhancement, and that the government violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 by failing to notify him of its intent to enhance his sentence. We reject each of these arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Norris\u2019s plea agreement specifically preserved the government\u2019s discretion to determine whether Norris had provided substantial assistance, and made the government the sole arbiter of whether he would receive a section 5K1.1 motion. <em>See United States v. Romsey, </em>975 F.2d 556, 558 (8th Cir.1992). Norris did not limit his agreement to provide grand jury testimony to matters involving only the instant offense, and he has failed to show that the government\u2019s decision not to file a section 5K1.1 motion was irrational or motivated by bad faith, or was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). We do not address Norris\u2019s contention that he was induced into pleading guilty by the government\u2019s oral promise of a section 5K1.1 motion, because Norris did not assert this argument below, <em>see United States v. Torres, </em>258 F.3d 791, 793 n. 4 (8th Cir.2001), and in any event his plea agreement and plea-hearing representations negate such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We also reject Norris\u2019s contention that the district court failed to make a finding as to whether he willfully obstructed justice. The district court found that Norris had verbally threatened potential witnesses, and implicit within this determination was the court\u2019s finding that Norris willfully obstructed justice. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>207 F.3d 452, 455 n. 2 (8th Cir.2000). The finding was supported by the testimony of a police officer and a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who testified that two potential witnesses reported being threatened by Norris. <em>See </em>U.S .S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a), p.s.; <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>234 F.3d 1047, 1048 (8th Cir. 2000). This was enough to support the section 3C1.1 enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.4); <em>United States v. Shepard, </em>207 F.3d 455, 457 (8th Cir.2000) (defendant obstructed justice by attempting to persuade former girlfriend not to speak to investigating agents).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Norris\u2019s related contention concerning section 851 is meritless, and after reviewing the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no other non-frivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">.
