R.App. P. 34\u00ae. The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Mr. Flowers, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cGOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas and seeks to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. For the reason stated below, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">In 1996, Mr. Flowers pleaded guilty to one count of maintaining a place for the purpose of distributing cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1). He was sentenced to 240 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $50.00. On appeal, we affirmed the conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Flowers, </em>No. 97-6044, 172 F.3d 63, 1999 WL 88957 (10th Cir. Feb.23,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">In his habeas petition, Mr. Flowers contends that he was (1) denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing and on appeal and (2) that his plea was involuntary. The district court, after noting that both claims were procedurally barred because they were not raised on direct appeal, examined both claims and concluded that they failed on the merits. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">We construe Mr. Flowers\u2019s allegations liberally, pursuant to <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Flowers must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he raises are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The district court first determined that Mr. Flowers\u2019 ineffective assistance claim was procedurally barred. We note that in <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>56 F.3d 1239,1242-43 (10th Cir.1995), we held that \u201cclaims of constitutionally ineffective counsel should be brought on collateral review, in the first petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u201d and that \u201c[n]o procedural bar will apply to claims which could have been brought on direct appeal; but were brought in post-conviction proceedings instead.\u201d We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the procedural bar of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The district court subsequently examined the merits of Mr. Flowers\u2019 ineffective assistance claim. The district court determined that Mr. Flowers could not demonstrate that \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d Rec. doc. 3 at 2 (district court order filed June 27, 2000) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>674 (1984)). We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment of the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We have received Mr. Flowers\u2019s request for a COA, his appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, the transcript of the sentencing proceedings held in the district court, the plea agreement, and the entire appellate record and conclude that Mr. Flowers has failed to make the required showing for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Accordingly, with the exception noted above, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s June 27, 2000 order, we GRANT Mr. Flowers\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis, DENY his request for a COA, and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b808-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms Bind conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
