Echevarria contends that his base offense level was improperly enhanced by sixteen levels as a result of the district court\u2019s determination that his state felony conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (\u201cDUI\u201d) qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Echevarria also contends that the district court erred by construing his prior felony conviction as a sentencing enhancement factor rather than as an element of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In May of 1995, Echevarria was convicted of an aggravated DUI in Pima County, Arizona. Echevarria was sentenced to 2.5 years of imprisonment for the offense. Deportation proceedings were initiated upon completion of Echevarria\u2019s prison sentence, and he was removed from the United States on April 12, 1999. Shortly thereafter, Echevarria reentered the United States without permission, and was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Arizona. On January 4, 2000, Echevarria pled guilty to an information charging him with the crime of reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">An alien who reenters the United States without permission following deportation is subject to two years imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). The prison sentence is increased if the alien was deported following an aggravated felony conviction. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The sentencing guidelines increase the base offense level for illegal reentry following deportation by sixteen levels if the defendant was convicted of an aggravated felony prior to his deportation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">To determine whether an offense is an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d application note one of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 refers the sentencing court to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. 2L1.2, comment (n.l). Included in the definition of aggravated felony set forth in section \u00a7 1101(a)(43) is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, that carries a term of imprisonment of at least one year. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). A crime of violence is defined, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United, States v. Ceron-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1169, 1172 (9th Cir.2000). In sentencing Echevarria, the district court increased the base level by sixteen levels, concluding that his state felony DUI offense qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">At the time the district court sentenced Echevarria in May of 2000, only the Fifth Circuit had reached the issue of whether a felony DUI constituted a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Although the Fifth Circuit concluded that it did, the opinion was later withdrawn when the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>pellant filed a motion to withdraw his petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See Camacho-Marroquin v. INS, </em>188 F.3d 649 (5th Cir. 1999), <em>opinion withdrawn, rehearing dismissed by Camacho-Marroquin v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1040 (5th Cir.2000). Since the imposition of Echevarria\u2019s sentence, five circuits, including this one, have spoken on the issue. <em>See United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that a felony DUI offense is not a crime of violence under section 16(b)); <em>Dalton v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 200 (2d Cir. 2001) (same); <em>Bazan-Reyes v. INS, </em>256 F.3d 600 (7th Cir.2001) (same); <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001) (same); <em>Tapia Garcia v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1216 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that a felony DUI offense is a crime of violence under section 16(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">In <em>Trinidad-Aquino, </em>we held that a felony conviction under a California DUI statute for driving under the influence of alcohol with negligent injury to another is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), and is, therefore, not an aggravated felony for sentencing enhancement purposes. The Arizona statutes under which Echevarria was convicted do not include the element of bodily injury found in the California statute. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 28-692(A)(l), 28-697(A)(l);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cal. Veh. Code \u00a7 23153. Given the holding in <em>Trini-dadr-Aquino, </em>we conclude that Echevar-ria\u2019s felony DUI does not constitute a crime of violence, and is, therefore, not an aggravated felony. Accordingly, the district court erred when increasing Echevar-ria\u2019s sentence by 16 levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Echevarria also contends that the information was deficient because it did not allege a prior felony conviction, and, therefore, violates the principles set forth in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have previously rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court did not err in treating Echevarria\u2019s prior felony conviction as a sentencing enhancement factor rather than as an element of the offense of illegal reentry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">.

Arizona has renumbered its statutes since the time of Echevarria's 1995 conviction. Section 28-692 of the Arizona Revised Statutes is renumbered as section 28-1381.
