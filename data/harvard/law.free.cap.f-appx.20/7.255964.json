He also argues that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective, inter aha, in permitting the trial to go forward. Finally, he claims that jury instructions on malice aforethought and deliberate premeditation (not objected to at trial) were constitutionally offensive. He asserts that the state court decisions ruling against him on these points were contrary to, and an unreasonable application of, established federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-22\">Vo\u2019s murder conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. <em>Commonwealth v. Vo, </em>427 Mass. 464, 693 N.E.2d 1374 (1998). The trial judge\u2019s determination, made after an evidentiary hearing more than three years after trial, that Vo was not incompetent was also affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 467-69, 693 N.E.2d 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-23\">This case is a tragedy originating in a love triangle and culminating with one man dead and another in prison for life. The woman involved, Ambrose, testified for the state and was, apparently, never charged for her role. The facts underlying the conviction and the analysis of the issues on habeas are set forth ably in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>was adopted by the district court in a succinct Memorandum Order. Both courts were correct in their decision to deny the habeas petition and there is no need to repeat their analysis. The state supreme court decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, established federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We add only this. This petition is brought within the constraints on federal habeas power established by the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 8, 18, 22, 28, 40 and 42 U.S.C.). A habeas petition may not be granted unless the state court decision: 1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or 2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (Supp. II 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The primary issue argued on habeas concerns the competency determination. The determination of whether Vo was competent to stand trial was essentially a fact determination. <em>Thompson v. Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 111, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995), <em>citing Maggio v. Fulford, </em>462 U.S. 111, 117, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 76 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (per curiam). AEDPA established a presumption of correctness of \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court\u201d as provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Vo thus must show error in the state court\u2019s factual determination of competency \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d This he has not done. That factual determination was made by the judge who presided over the trial, saw Vo testify, and who later evaluated the witnesses as to the competency issue. Credibility determinations are committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Vo was competent finds ample support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
