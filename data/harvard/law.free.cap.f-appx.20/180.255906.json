Davis appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2001) complaint. Defendants cross appeal the denial of their motion for attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Davis v. Town of Holly Springs, </em>No. CA-00-368-5 BE (E.D.N.C. Apr. 25, 2001). In addition, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions. Thus, we affirm that order as well. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
