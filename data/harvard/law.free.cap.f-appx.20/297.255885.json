The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-21\">In 2000, Servin-Gomez pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after being convicted of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Ser-vin-Gomez had previously been convicted of theft of property valued at more than $1,000 in the Tennessee state courts. The district court applied the sixteen-point enhancement for a crime classified as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), and sentenced Servin-Gomez to seventy-seven months of imprisonment. Servin-Gomez has filed a timely appeal, arguing that his prior theft conviction does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-22\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error when it determined that Servin-Gomez\u2019s prior conviction constituted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and USSG \u00a7 2L1.2. The court may only review Servin-Gomez\u2019s sentencing claim for plain error because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>did not present any objections to his enhanced sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) in the sentencing court, and thus he has forfeited his right to assert this issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Kincaide, </em>145 F.3d 771, 784 (6th Cir.1998). This court may review an error to which no objection is made if it constitutes plain error that affects the substantial rights of a party. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Barajas-Nunez, </em>91 F.3d 826, 830 (6th Cir.1996). To establish plain error, a defendant must show that: 1) an error occurred in the district court; 2) the error was plain, i.e ., obvious or clear; 3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and 4) this adverse impact seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>53 F.3d 769, 770 (6th Cir.1995). For the reasons expressed below, the district court did not commit plain error when it sentenced Servin-Gomez.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">A defendant convicted of illegal re-entry after removal is subject to a much longer sentence if he was previously removed \u201csubsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The Sentencing Guidelines implement this enhancement in \u00a7 2L1.2, which increases the base offense level for a \u00a7 1326 violation from eight to twenty-four \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction ... for an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d by referencing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 comment. (n.l). Section 1101(a)(43)(G), in turn, includes \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [sic] at least one year\u201d as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d The annotated footnote to that section states that the missing verb should probably be \u201cis.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (Footnote 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Servin-Gomez\u2019s prior theft conviction constitutes an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Contrary to Servin-Gomez\u2019s argument, the rule of lenity does not apply in this case. The rule of lenity is not a doctrine of first resort whenever a criminal defendant identifies a potential ambiguity in a statute, and the rule \u201cis not invoked by a grammatical possibility.\u201d <em>Caron v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 308, 316, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998); <em>United States v. Maldonado-Ramirez, </em>216 F.3d 940, 943 (11th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1114, 121 S.Ct. 860, 148 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001) (accord). Moreover, \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) has consistently been construed to mean that the sentence <em>imposed </em>controls whether an offense constitutes an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Christopher, </em>239 F.3d 1191, 1194 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>234 F.3d 449, 455 (9th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Pacheco, </em>225 F.3d 148, 153-54 (2d Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 2246, 150 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001); <em>United States v. Tejeda-Perez, </em>199 F.3d 981, 982 (8th Cir.1999). Hence, because Servin-Gomez was sentenced to two years of imprisonment on his prior theft conviction, the district court properly applied the sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
