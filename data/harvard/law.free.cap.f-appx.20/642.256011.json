Massanari was appointed Acting Commissioner for the Social Security Administration, and is therefore substituted for Kenneth S. Apfel as the named defendant in this action. Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AP9\">Plaintiff-appellant Pauline Haslacker appeals from the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) in Has-lacker\u2019s action for Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">On appeal, Haslacker argues that the ALJ erred in disregarding her subjective pain testimony. Haslacker testified at the hearing that even before she broke her ankle, she could not walk more than two blocks, and that walking even that distance caused her pain in her lower back and hips. She also testified that she could not stand for more than a half hour to forty-five minutes at a time, and that she could lift and carry only between five and ten pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">When the ALJ asked Cynthia Ward (\u2018Ward\u201d), the vocational expert, to consider a hypothetical claimant who suffered from Haslacker\u2019s physical impairments, including those subjective complaints, Ward concluded that under Step Four of the five-part sequential analysis, such a claimant would not be able to perform Haslacker\u2019s past relevant work. Ward also concluded that under Step Five of the five-part sequential analysis, again considering Haslacker\u2019s subjective complaints, Has-lacker would also be unable to \u201cperform any other work for which she had transferable skills.\u201d When the ALJ inquired as to the basis for this conclusion, Ward responded: \u201cThe description of difficulty in maintaining any comfortable position for any period of time and her description of pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Ward\u2019s testimony establishes that Has-lacker would be entitled to benefits if the ALJ considered Haslacker\u2019s subjective pain testimony. Thus, the critical question we must consider is whether the ALJ properly disregarded Haslacker\u2019s subjective pain testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">In <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc), we held that once a claimant produces objective evidence of an underlying impairment that is \u201creasonably likely\u201d to cause some degree of pain, the ALJ may not reject the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints regarding the extent and severity of her pain merely because the severity of the pain cannot be supported by objective medical evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 343 (citing <em>Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403, 1407 (9th Cir.1986)). Rather, \u201c[f]or the ALJ to reject the claimant\u2019s complaints, [the ALJ] must provide specific, cogent reasons for the disbelief.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">Here, the ALJ found that Haslacker satisfied the \u201cthreshold\u201d for application of the <em>Bunnell </em>test. Thus, we must determine whether the ALJ provided legitimate and specific reasons for disregarding her subjective pain testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The ALJ provided two reasons for disregarding Haslacker\u2019s testimony: (1) her alleged failure to report and seek treatment for her physical impairments prior to 1994; and (2) her alleged ability to engage in \u201cextensive daily activities\u201d despite her impairments. Although these justifications are legitimate reasons for disregarding subjective pain testimony, <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989), neither is supported by the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">A. Haslacker\u2019s Alleged Failure to Report and Seek Treatment for Various Physical Impairments Prior to 1994</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The ALJ found significant the fact that Haslacker allegedly failed to report and seek treatment for many of her physical impairments prior to 1994. Many of his statements, however, are belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">First, Haslacker reported both knee and hip pain to Dr. Moelleken in 1992, two years before 1994. Indeed, Haslacker\u2019s complaints of knee and hip pain continued in 1994, as she reported such pain to Drs. Heyn and Edelbaum. Second, although the ALJ correctly concluded that Haslacker did not \u201ctake[ ]\u201d any \u201cspecial medication\u201d for her elbow pain, he failed to note that Haslacker was receiving \u201ctreatment\u201d for her elbow condition with cortisone shots. Because Haslacker was receiving active medical treatment for her elbow condition, her failure to \u201ctake[ ]\u201d medication is not a valid reason for rejecting her testimony. Third, with respect to Haslacker\u2019s failure to use back support for her lower back, the ALJ failed to cite any medical evidence to support his assumption that a physical back support would alleviate Haslacker\u2019s lower back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The ALJ\u2019s final reason for concluding that Haslacker failed to report and seek treatment for her physical ailments is that \u201cher treating records reveal that she did lift heavy objects.\u201d This statement is based on a nearly undecipherable entry in a December 1992 handwritten medical report by Neil Hollander, M.D. Although Dr. Hollander\u2019s notes are barely legible, the page cited by the ALJ appears to state: \u201cLifted something heavy 4 days ago c o severe LB Pain and R leg pain.\u201d In view of Dr. Hollander\u2019s other notes, this reading of the entry does not support the ALJ\u2019s statement that Haslacker could lift heavy objects. To the contrary, it indicates that she should not lift heavy objects without suffering severe pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">B. Haslacker\u2019s Alleged Ability to Engage in \u201cFairly Extensive Daily Activities\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The second reason the ALJ cited for disregarding Haslacker\u2019s subjective pain testimony is that her testimony was contradicted by her ability to engage in \u201cfairly extensive daily activities.\u201d Again, many of the ALJ\u2019s statements are belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">First, although the ALJ stated that Has-lacker \u201cdress[es]\u201d and \u201cgrocery shops in the morning,\u201d the record demonstrates that Haslacker requires assistance with both activities. Similarly, while there is some record evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Haslacker is able to do light housework, such as washing the dishes and dusting, Dr. Edelbaum\u2019s notes reveal that she also has \u201cdifficultly] doing housework, such as bending, stooping, vacuuming, or sweeping.\u201d Finally, although the ALJ cited the fact that Haslacker is able to watch television to suggest that she is exaggerating her pain, Dr. Heyn noted that \u201c[s]he walks around and watches television <em>because </em>of pain\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">C. Because the ALJ Failed to Provide Legitimate Reasons for Disregarding Haslacker\u2019s Testimony, She is Entitled to Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">In sum, we find that the ALJ\u2019s asserted reasons for disregarding Haslacker\u2019s sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>jective pain testimony are not supported by the record. We therefore decline to disregard her testimony regarding the severity of her pain. Moreover, because it is clear on the record before us that Haslacker qualifies for benefits if we consider her pain testimony, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner and remand with instructions to award benefits. <em>See Varney v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Sevs., </em>859 F.2d 1396 (9th Cir. 1988) (stating that if the record is complete, the court may award benefits rather than remand for further consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The decision of the district court is REVERSED, and this case is REMANDED with instructions to remand to the Commissioner to enter an award of benefits in favor of Haslacker.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
