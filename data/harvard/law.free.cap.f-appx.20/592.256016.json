Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 submissions on appeal, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) (motions for relief from judgment because of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect must be made within one year); <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. FAG Bearings Corp., </em>153 F.3d 919, 924 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review); <em>Inman v. Am. Home Furniture Placement, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 117, 118-19 (8th Cir.1997) (affirming district court\u2019s refusal to set aside default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) because litigants had relied on their attorney, who had not filed an answer to the complaint or responded to discovery requests; \u201c[l]itigants choose counsel at their peril\u201d); <em>Zimmer St. Louis, Inc. v. Zimmer Co., </em>32 F.3d 357, 359-61 (8th Cir.1994) (Rule 60(b)(6) may not be used to cure problems of lack of notice). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We deny Kilmartin\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\">. The Honorable Scott O.
