With the 300 grams included Griffin\u2019s sentencing range is 292-365 months; otherwise the range would be 235-293 months. Griffin\u2019s sentence, 292 months, is at the intersection of these ranges, but, because the district judge did not declare that he would have imposed the same sentence no matter which range prevails, we must address Griffin\u2019s contention that the relevant-conduct calculation was erroneous. See <em>United States v. Mount, </em>966 F.2d 262 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Griffin did not present any evidence at sentencing, but his lawyer asserted that the drugs found in the stash house did not belong to Griffin. Instead, according to counsel, they belonged to other offenders (who counsel did not identify), and Griffin\u2019s only role had been to \u201ccook\u201d this crack from powder cocaine. Given the lack of evidence to support this story, the district judge did not commit clear error in rejecting it. What is more, we cannot see how Griffin would have been better off if the judge had believed the tale. It depicts Griffin as a member of a larger conspiracy, and as a conspirator he would be responsible for any reasonably foreseeable quantities of drugs \u2014 including, at a minimum, the crack Griffin \u201ccooked\u201d himself. See <em>United States v. Willis, </em>49 F.3d 1271 (7th Cir.1995). Griffin was the beneficiary of the district judge\u2019s approach to ascertaining relevant conduct. Had the judge accepted counsel\u2019s story, the court would have been obliged to determine how much cocaine the conspiracy distributed (to Griffin\u2019s knowledge) over its entire existence. Instead the judge imputed to Griffin only the inventory held on a single day. He has no complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
