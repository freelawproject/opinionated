In her complaint, Bond seeks review of the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security denying her application for disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Social Security Income</p>\n<p id=\"b50-22\">Bond contends that she suffers disabling pain, migraine headaches and visual deficits stemming from a mishap with the passenger doors of a bus she was entering. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>She further contends that these symptoms prevent her from returning to her past employment as a secretary and as a freelance writer.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The ALJ denied Bond\u2019s request for benefits on the basis that she was capable of her past relevant work, despite her impairments. Specifically, the ALJ found that the \u201cobjective medical evidence\u201d indicated that Bond could perform work involving the lifting and carrying of 20 pounds; sitting, standing, and walking up to 2 hours at a time; and occasional reaching, pushing, pulling and bending. In arriving at this conclusion, the ALJ did not give controlling weight to the opinion of Bond\u2019s treating physician, Dr. James Jealous, an osteopathic physician. Specifically, the ALJ did not afford controlling weight to Dr. Jealous\u2019s conclusion that Bond could not accomplish activities of daily living or perform work activity, and that any task of employment would require Bond to take an unreasonable number of rest periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The question presented on this appeal is whether the ALJ erred in not giving controlling weight to Dr. Jealous\u2019s diagnosis. Generally, the opinion of the treating physician is given controlling weight if the opinion is \u201c(1) well supported by medically-acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques <em>and </em>(2) is not inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) (emphasis added). The ALJ asserted both bases for not affording Dr. Jealous diagnosis controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s failure to give controlling weight to Dr. Jealous\u2019s opinion. As the district court noted in its September 5, 2000 opinion and order, there is \u201csubstantial evidence in the record that directly conflicts with Jealous\u2019s opinion\u201d and this alone is sufficient to deny it controlling weight. A few examples of the various medical opinions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">A psychology intern, Michelle Macrorie, characterized Bond as engaging in \u201ctheatrical displays of exhaustion, pain and inability to function\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">Dr. Sheldon Cooper suggested that \u201cLauren ... [cut] treatments to once a week [and] increase her exercises at home \u2014 as well as seeking outside employment or volunteer work\u201d and undergo \u201cmental health counseling\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">Dr. Karen Nepveu concluded that \u201cBond\u2019s symptoms did not meet the criteria for fibromyalgia\u201d and that \u201cBond had signs and symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome involving the muscles of her back and ... that exercise would be the key to ultimate improvement of this problem\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">Dr. Butaney of the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital noted that \u201cBond\u2019s evaluation showed that she did not have any clear etiology for her symptoms\u201d and recommended that she \u201cstop wearing a cervical collar because it would weaken her muscles\u201d and pressed Bond to increase her activity to condition herself;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">Dr. A. Kenneth Ciongoli found \u201cno specific abnormality\u201d with Bond and stated that she was \u201ctotally against [taking] medication.\u201d Dr. Ciongoli also stated she suspected that Bond was exaggerating the pain due to \u201csome psychological overlay\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">Given the number of competing diagnoses, it simply cannot be said that the ALJ erred in declining to give controlling weight to Dr. Jealous\u2019s diagnosis, which was by far the most pessimistic one. Moreover, as the district court concluded, considering the competing diagnoses as a whole, there was substantial evidence for the ALJ to conclude that plaintiff Bond could continue to perform the secretarial work she had engaged in prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action in its entirety is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
