Carroll, Wanda L. Mitchell, and Shirley J. Harris appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Appellees Walter B. Jones Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center and its operator, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Appellants alleged racial discrimination, disparate treatment, a hostile working environment, and retaliation based on failure to promote and other alleged acts under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">We have reviewed the briefs and joint appendix in this case as well as the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Carroll v. North Carolina Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>No. CA-00-159-4-H (E.D.N.C. July 17, 2001). We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
