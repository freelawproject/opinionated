Brice\u2019s motion alleged both a double jeopardy violation and impermissible double counting under the Sentencing Guidelines in the calculation of his sentence. However, Brice\u2019s motion raises no basis for proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his motion fails to identify any guidelines range modified pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) (1994) as required by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Furthermore, to the extent Brice seeks collateral review of his conviction and sentence on the aforementioned bases, we find Brice cannot obtain relief on either. With respect to Brice\u2019s double jeopardy challenge, a conviction under both 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(d) (West 2000) and \u00a7 924(c) for the same offense does not constitute double jeopardy. <em>United States v. Shavers, </em>820 F.2d 1375, 1377-78 (4th Cir.1987). Furthermore, Brice\u2019s claim concerning the computation of his sentence under the Guidelines alleges non-constitutional error which may not now be assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ed on collateral review. <em>See Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brice\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
