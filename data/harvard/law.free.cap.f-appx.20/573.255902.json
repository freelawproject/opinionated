Wills, who suffers from total renal failure, alleged in his complaint that Nurse Haines of the Center\u2019s dialysis unit \u201cnegligently misplaced a hemodialysis needle in [his] left arm,\u201d causing irreparable nerve damage as diagnosed by an \u201coutside neurologist.\u201d The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) (permitting dismissal of inmate civil complaint if it fails to state claim upon which relief may be granted) because negligence claims are not cognizable under <em>Bivens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-20\">In his timely motion to reconsider, Wills added allegations that Haines, angry because Wills insisted she follow established procedure for correct identification of his artificial kidney, had \u201cdeliberately stabbed him\u201d with the needle; he provided a consulting neurologist\u2019s report opining that Wills\u2019s nerve damage was consistent with traumatic injury. The district court denied Wills\u2019s motion and denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. Wills has renewed his IFP motion in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">After de novo review, <em>see Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam), we find that the allegations in Wills\u2019s motion for reconsideration were sufficient to allege an Eighth Amendment violation by Nurse Haines. <em>See Hudson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992) (contemporary standards always are violated when prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, whether or not significant injury is evident). Therefore, dismissal of Wills\u2019s claim was premature. <em>See Williams v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>208 F.3d 681, 682 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (when complaint did not state claim but court could infer, from pro se prisoner\u2019s post-judgment pleadings, allegation of retaliation for engaging in constitutionally protected activity, prisoner should have been given opportunity to amend complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Accordingly, we grant Wills permission to proceed IFP, leaving the fee-collection details to the district court in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b); and we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-16\">. <em>Bivens v.
