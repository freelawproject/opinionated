Learner claims on appeal that the District Court (1) abused its discretion when it upwardly adjusted Learner\u2019s sentence upon finding that his actions involved \u201cmore than minimal planning,\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4)(A); and (2) erred when it decided not to depart downward after Learner asserted at sentencing that he would pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Learner\u2019s claims are without merit. A district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Kim, </em>193 F.3d 567, 575 (2d Cir.1999). The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the offense involved \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d An upward departure for \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d can be found in situations in which the same offense conduct was done repeatedly over time \u201cunless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\u201d <em>See United States v. Barrett, </em>178 F.3d 643, 649 (2d Cir.1999). In the instant case, the District Court found the criminal conduct to have occurred over a course of years and that the conduct was not simply opportunistic. Although the crime may be described as not particularly complex, the scheme involved \u201cdetailed and deliberate action\u201d in committing the offense and in covering aspects of it up, which sufficiently reflects more than minimal planning. <em>United States v. Walsh, </em>119 F.3d 115, 120 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">The District Court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is not appealable because Learner has not shown that the District Court committed an error of law or misapprehended its power to depart. <em>See United States v. Acevedo, </em>229 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1027, 121 S.Ct. 602, 148 L.Ed.2d 514 (2000). The District Court considered all the arguments made by the defendant before deciding to reject them. The District Court did not commit any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
