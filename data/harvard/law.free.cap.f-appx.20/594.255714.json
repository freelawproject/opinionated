(CMI), alleged that CMI discriminated against her on account of her pregnancy when it failed to select her for a permanent Senior Processor position, ultimately resulting in her layoff. Although Ms. Vaughn alleged that her supervisor, Lorenzo Baylor, had participated in the selection of Senior Processors, and had admitted to her that her pregnancy was the reason she was not selected, we agree with the district court that Ms. Vaughn failed to produce evidence \u2014 other than hearsay and her own speculation \u2014 that Mr. Baylor was a decisionmaker with respect to the Senior Processor positions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802; <em>McLaughlin v. Essette Pendaflex Corp., </em>50 F.3d 507, 512 (8th Cir.1995). We also find no inconsistency in CMI\u2019s evidence regarding its reasons for selecting other candidates, and we agree with the district court that Ms. Vaughn failed to show that CMI\u2019s proferred reasons for choosing other applicants (that it gave preference to permanent employees, and that the two selected Citiflex employees were better qualified than she) were pretextual. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 806, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">. The Honorable Stephen N. Limbaugh, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-24\">. Although Ms. Vaughn initially made claims under several federal statutes and the Missouri Human Rights Act, she appeals only the disposition of her claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
