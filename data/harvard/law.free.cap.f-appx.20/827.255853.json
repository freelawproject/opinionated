RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">The underlying petition for habeas corpus from a state conviction was filed four days after the expiration of the statute of limitations established by the AEDPA. The trial court carefully reviewed the procedural sequence as it applied the AEDPA to the facts of this case. With a well-reasoned opinion, it dismissed the petition as time-barred. The trial court denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">Petitioner has requested a certificate of appealability from this court. Appeal is not warranted when the district court correctly invokes a procedural bar to deny a habeas petition because \u201ca reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473,120 S.Ct. 1595,1604,146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). In this case, the correctness of the trial court\u2019s determination is not debatable among jurists of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">The petition for a certificate of appeala-bility is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b857-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
