Moreover, we agree with the BIA that a violation of Rev.Code Wash. \u00a7 9A.36.021(e) is an aggravated felony. Looking to the \u201cstatutory definition of the offense,\u201d <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000), we determine that all the conduct reached by the statute involves either \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\u201d or \u201cis a felony ... that by its very nature, involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Trang was sentenced to one year in prison, and, under Washington law, second degree assault is a felony. The offense of which Trang was convicted therefore meets all the statutory conditions to be an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Trang argues that even if he is deportable for having been convicted of a crime that counts as an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) does not strip this court of jurisdiction because the INS\u2019s Order to Show Cause charged Trang with excludability, not deportability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). However, our holding in <em>Briseno v. INS, </em>192 F.3d 1320 (9th Cir.1999), and the language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) itself make it clear that as long as the INS included the underlying offense in the Order to Show Cause, it does not matter if the INS did not characterize the offense in the way it now characterizes the offense for purposes of the jurisdiction statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In this instance, the INS charged Trang with inadmissibility due to prior convictions for two crimes of moral turpitude, including the second degree assault conviction discussed above. Because the removal order \u201cwas necessarily based on that crime, and it qualifies as an aggravated felony, we have no appellate jurisdiction even though the deportation order did not characterize the crime as an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Briseno, </em>192 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In addition, the text of U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) restricts this court\u2019s jurisdiction without regard to the INS\u2019s theory of removability. The statute simply states that if an alien is \u201cremovable\u201d for having been convicted of certain crimes, then our jurisdiction is restricted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Having determined that Trang is removable by reason of coming within one of the categories listed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we must dismiss his petition. <em>Flores-Miramontes v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1133, 1135 (9th Cir.2000). As a result, we cannot reach Trang\u2019s principle arguments on appeal: that his second-degree assault conviction is not a crime of moral turpitude and that <em>Rosenberg v. Flueti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963), prevents the INS from treating Trang as an arriving alien. However, nothing in this opinion or in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) precludes Trang from making these arguments in a petition for habeas corpus relief. <em>See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, </em>533 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 2268,150 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b754-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
