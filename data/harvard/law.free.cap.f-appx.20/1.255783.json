The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b).

Appellant\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 constitutes an attack on the validity of his conviction and sentence, which should be pursued via a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755-56 (6th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Appellant has not demonstrated that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>effective.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Moreover, appellant made clear that he did not intend that his petition be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
