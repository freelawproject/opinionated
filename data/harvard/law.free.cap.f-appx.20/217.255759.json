Carter seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s judgment adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissing the case for failing to prosecute. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Carter\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-22\">Parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v.
