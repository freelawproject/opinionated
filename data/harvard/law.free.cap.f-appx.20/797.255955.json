Mr. Spring was convicted of eleven counts of bank robbery and firearms offenses for his acquisition of a firearm and participation in a series of bank robberies in Utah and Colorado. <em>United States v. Spring, </em>80 F.3d 1450, 1453 (10th Cir.1996). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 &amp; 2253(c), and deny Mr. Spring\u2019s COA application and dismiss his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-22\">Mr. Spring was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, <em>Spring, </em>80 F.3d at 1462, and received 802 months of imprisonment and was ordered to pay $30,996.07 in restitution. <em>Id. </em>at 1455. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>appeal, we affirmed on all counts, except for one which was reversed and remanded for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1466. The government dismissed the remanded count, and the judgment was amended accordingly. I R. doc. 31 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">On January 12, 1998, Mr. Spring filed a federal habeas petition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. I R. doc. 1. In his petition, Mr. Spring asserted three related claims: (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of Counts 6 through 9, (2) that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this claim on appeal, and (3) that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) jury instructions were incorrect. I R. doe. 3, at 5 13. Subsequently, Mr. Spring filed a plethora of motions with the court: (1) a motion for appointment of counsel, I R. doc. 15, (2) a motion for modification of the restitution order, I R. doc. 19, (3) a motion \u201cquestioning the federal jurisdiction of bank robbery,\u201d I R. doc. 20, (4) a motion for \u201crelease from custody and a stay of restitution payments pending habeas corpus,\u201d I R. doc. 21, (5) a motion for \u201cthe appointment of a paralegal service,\u201d I R. doc. 22, (6) a motion for trial transcripts, I R. doc. 23, (7) a motion \u201cquestioning the amount of the restitution order,\u201d I R. doe. 24, (8) a motion for evidence, I R. doc. 25, (9) a motion for grand jury transcripts, I R. doc. 26, (10) a motion \u201crequesting in which constitutional jurisdiction this court was acting under in criminal case,\u201d I R. doc. 27, (11) a motion to compel, I R. doc. 28, and, finally, (12) a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing, I R. doc. 29.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 10, 1999, the district court denied Mr. Spring\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. I R. doc. 17. On December 8, 2000, the court denied Mr. Spring\u2019s petition. I R. doc. 31, at 9. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support Mr. Spring\u2019s conviction for counts 6 through 9 and that, therefore, Mr. Spring\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim failed for lack of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 5-9. The court also denied each of Mr. Spring\u2019s remaining motions, <em>id. </em>at 9, including Mr. Spring\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order denying Mr. Spring\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. I R. doc. 18. The court concluded that the motions were \u201ceither moot or without merit.\u201d I R. doc. 31, at 9. Mr. Spring now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition and motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">We must first consider whether a COA should issue. Because the district court did not address the issue, the district court is deemed to have denied a COA. General Emergency Order of October 1, 1996. A GOA should issue only if Mr. Spring has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). That is, Mr. Spring must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Because Mr. Spring appears pro se, we liberally construe his pleadings. <em>Hunt v. Uphoff, </em>199 F.3d 1220, 1223 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Mr. Spring cites a litany of grounds for the issuance of a COA. We decline to consider those alleged errors which Mr. Spring failed to raise in his habeas petition to the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992). We also decline to consider Mr. Spring\u2019s argument that the district court \u201cillegally ordered [Mr. Spring] to pay restitution\u201d because \u201cpayment [was] established by the B.O.P.,\u201d Pet. Br. at 3, and that he was \u201csentenced to pay restitution to parties that [he] was not indicted for.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. This claim is procedurally barred because Mr. Spring failed to raise this argument on direct appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and has not shown cause or demonstrated a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result if we do not consider the claim. <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). We therefore address only one issue raised in Mr. Spring\u2019s COA application:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that Mr. Spring was not a career offender because two of his prior seven state convictions, <em>see Spring, </em>80 F.3d at 1455 n. 2, upon which his career offender status was premised, were dismissed twenty days after he was sentenced. Pet. Br. at 3,14-15. We agree with the district court that this claim is meritless. Other than his conclu-sory allegation, Mr. Spring provided no evidence as to which of his seven prior convictions were dismissed and has provided absolutely no evidence supporting his allegation that <em>any </em>of the convictions were in fact dismissed. Accordingly, Mr. Spring suffered no prejudice by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise this claim on appeal, and, for this same reason, appellate counsel was not ineffective. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number><em>Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 393 (10th Cir.1995). Mr. Spring has therefore not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Accordingly, Mr. Spring\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED, his COA application is DENIED, and his ha-beas petition is DISMISSED. Mr. Spring\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AUJ\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-5\">. In this motion, Mr. Spring argued that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to also argue that Mr. Spring could not be sentenced as a career offender because two of his prior state convictions had been dismissed, failing to raise <em>United States v. Tolliver, </em>61 F.3d 1189 (5th Cir.1995), failing to argue prosecutorial misconduct, failing to argue that Mr. Spring's co-conspirator was a minor \"that was never certified by the attorney general and thus all photo\u2019s, surveil[l]ance footage, et cetera that was used at trial was illegally used, and failing to argue that a fingerprint introduced into evidence in support of Count 3 of the indictment was unreliable. I R. doc. 29, at 2-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-5\">. Specifically, Mr. Spring asserts in his COA application (1) a double jeopardy violation (insofar as he was charged with three separate counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)), Pet. Br. at 3, 15; Pet. Supp. Br. at 3 (filed May 24, 2001), (2) prosecutorial misconduct, Pet. Br. at 3, 15, (3) insufficiency of the evidence, <em>id. </em>at 3, (4) ineffective assistance of trial counsel, <em>id. </em>at 3, 15, Pet. Supp. Br. at 5, (5) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel (insofar as counsel failed to argue that Mr. Spring\u2019s double jeopardy rights had been violated), Pet. Br. at 15, (6) actual innocence, <em>id. </em>at 17, Pet. Supp. Br. at 1, 7, (7) judicial bias, Pet. Supp. Br. at 2-3, (8) unreliable fingerprint evidence, <em>id. </em>at 5, (9) that he was questioned by an undercover officer outside of the presence of counsel, <em>id. </em>at 7, (10) that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender because two of his prior state court convictions were dismissed, Pet. Br. at 3, 14, and (11) other evidentiary issues. Pet. Supp. Br. at 6. Mr. Spring did not raise any of these issues in his habeas petition to the district court. We do, however, address Mr. Spring's claim that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender in our analysis of his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\">. Mr. Spring argued only that he should not be required to pay the full amount of restitution for the robbery of a Fruita, Colorado bank. <em>Spring, </em>80 F.3d at 1463.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\">. Notably, Mr. Spring does not argue, as he did in his habeas petition filed in district court, that there was insufficient evidence to support Counts 6 through 9 or that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue insufficient evidence for these counts. Nor does Mr. Spring argue that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue prosecuto-rial misconduct, that Mr. Spring\u2019s co-conspirator was a minor \"that was never certified by the attorney general and thus all photo\u2019s, sur-veil[l]ance footage, et cetera that was used at trial was illegally used,\" or that a fingerprint introduced into evidence in support of Count 3 of the indictment was unreliable. I R. doc. 29, at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">Even if Mr. Spring asserted insufficient evidence and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel as bases, we would deny Mr. Spring a COA. We have obtained the trial transcript and agree with the district court that there was sufficient evidence to support Mr. Spring's conviction of Counts 6 through 9. Therefore, it necessarily follows that appellate counsel was not ineffective. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 393 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
