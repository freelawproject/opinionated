The case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-21\">In 1996, Blair filed her application for disability benefits. Upon review of the application, the administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that Blair suffered from the severe impairments of cardiomegaiy, abdominal pain secondary to irritable bowel syndrome, left shoulder pain secondary to chronic rotator cuff tear, back pain secondary to degenerative disc disease, bilateral knee pain secondary to patellofemoral arthrosis, and heel spurs. However, she did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or equaled the requirements set forth in the Commissioner\u2019s Listing of Impairments. The ALJ also concluded that Blair retained the ability to perform sedentary work. In light of her residual functional capacity, the ALJ determined that, while Blair could not perform her past relevant work, she had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ability to perform other work available in the national and regional economies. Therefore, Blair was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Following the Appeals Council\u2019s decision affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination, Blair sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The district court concluded that substantial evidence existed to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and the court granted summary judgment for the defendant. Blair has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were employed in reaching the conclusion. <em>Garcia v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Sens., </em>46 F.3d 552, 555 (6th Cir. 1995). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance, <em>Bell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>105 F.3d 244, 245 (6th Cir.1996), and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Buxton v. Halter, </em>246 F.3d 762, 772 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s decision. Blair argues that the ALJ improperly relied on her refusal to undergo surgery in denying her benefits application. Blair maintains that the benefits from surgery were too questionable to justify undergoing the procedure. However, the ALJ\u2019s notation regarding Blair\u2019s lack of surgery merely supported his ultimate conclusion that she could perform sedentary work and was not dispositive in reaching this conclusion. Blair\u2019s refusal to undergo this treatment did not significantly impact the decision in this case or direct the conclusion that she is capable of performing sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
