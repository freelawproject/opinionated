Appellant contends that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed an upward departure on the basis that Appellant\u2019s criminal history was under-represented. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-24\">The district court imposed a three-level upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, which provides that a departure \u201cis warranted when the criminal history category significantly under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes.\u201d The court\u2019s reliance on Appellant\u2019s repeated immigration violations and on the fact that his numerous prior convictions \u201chave not deterred him from illegally reentering the United States\u201d to justify the departure did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sablan, </em>114 F.3d 913, 915-16 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>fencing Guidelines); see <em>also United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 985 (9th Cir. 1998) (stating that \u201c[departure is also justified purely on the basis of Defendant\u2019s likelihood of recidivism\u201d). Moreover, the three-level departure imposed by the court, increasing Appellant\u2019s sentencing range from 24-30 months to 33-11 months, was not unreasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Roston, </em>168 F.3d 377, 379 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (9th Cir.) (affirming an increase from 151-188 months to 324-405 months), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 843,120 S.Ct. 112,145 L.Ed.2d 95 (1999); <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>90 F.3d 400, 402-04 (9th Cir.1996) (affirming an increase from 100-125 months to 151-188 months). The sentence imposed by the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
