Hunnicut appeals from two orders: (1) an order entered by Judge Eginton, denying Hunnicut\u2019s motion for injunctive relief; and (2) an order entered by Magistrate Judge Fitzsimmons, imposing monetary sanctions against Hunnicut and denying Hunnicut\u2019s motion for sanctions, his motion to strike defendants\u2019 motion, and his motion to disqualify defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\n<em>1. Judge Eginton\u2019s order denying in-junctive relief.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">In December 1998, Hunnicut filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against various prison officials alleging both excessive use of force and failure to provide proper medical treatment. In May 2000, the district court dismissed most of Hunnicut\u2019s claims, preserving only Hunnicut\u2019s claim for inadequate medical care of his hand pain. In August 2000, Hunnicut moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop the defendants from seizing and destroying his legal materials, documents, and personal property. The district court denied Hunnicut\u2019s motion, concluding that \u201cclaims regarding cell searches and removal of legal papers are beyond the scope of [Hunnicut\u2019s] complaint and, thus, are not properly before the court.\u201d <em>Hunnicut v. Mangiafico, </em>No. 3:98-2455, slip op. at 5 (D.Conn. Nov. 1, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">Section 1292(a)(1) of 28 U.S.C. provides that \u201ccourts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from: (1) Interlocutory orders of the district courts ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\u201d However, \u00a7 1292(a)(1) renders appealable only those injunctive orders that affect the substance of the plaintiffs basic claim. <em>See Shakur v. Malcolm, </em>525 F.2d 1144, 1147 (2d Cir .1975). \u201cIt is well settled that an order of the district court that merely continues a case and does not reach the merits of parties\u2019 opposing claims is merely a step in the processing of a case and does not fall within the range of interlocutory orders appealable under ... \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d <em>Frutiger v. Hamilton Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>928 F.2d 68, 72 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">The district judge\u2019s order denying Hunnicut\u2019s motion for injunctive relief is entirely separate from the merits of Hunnicut\u2019s claim concerning the alleged failure to provide adequate medical care, and \u201cmerely continues a case and does not reach the merits of parties\u2019 opposing claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The order therefore is not immediately appealable and this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">\n<em>2. Magistrate Judge Fitzsimmons\u2019s order concerning sanctions, disqualification, and other matters.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">An order from a magistrate judge is not directly appealable to this Court unless, upon the consent of the parties, the magistrate judge is given plenary jurisdiction by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1). <em>See LoSacco v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir.1995). Instead, review of such orders must first be sought from the district judge. <em>Id. </em>at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Since the magistrate judge was not given plenary jurisdiction in this case, and since Hunnicut did not appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s order to the district judge, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal from the magistrate judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">For the reasons set forth above, it is hereby ordered that this appeal be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
