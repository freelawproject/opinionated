We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). <em>Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258,1260 (9th Cir,1992). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Following Jackson\u2019s failure to appear for a hearing, the district court issued an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt, explicitly warned Jackson that failure to appear would result in dismissal, and ensured that the U.S. Marshall personally served a copy of the order to Jackson\u2019s home address. Because Jackson failed to appear and because Jackson failed to establish that he was not able to comply with the court order, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his complaint with prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 1261-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Contrary to Jackson\u2019s contention, his consent was not required for the district court to designate a magistrate judge to conduct hearings and to submit proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition by a district court judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B); <em>Houghton v. Osborne, </em>834 F.2d 745, 748 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Jackson\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
