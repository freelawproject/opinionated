The district court applied these elements and its factual findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Mezas de Jesus, </em>217 F.3d 638, 642 (9th Cir.2000) (district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing are reviewed for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">McNeil next contends that the district court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences. A sentencing court has the power to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences in a multiple-count case. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). Although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) establishes a concurrent sentencing structure for multiple-count convictions, the district court may deviate from this structure if circumstances warrant it. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b). The district court is required to consider and harmonize U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Pedrioli, </em>931 F.2d 31, 32-33 (9th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Scarano, </em>76 F.3d 1471, 1479 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that \u201clengthy criminal history\u201d and \u201clack of reformation\u201d are relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). We have held that \u201cthe district court retains discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) to sentence either concurrently or consecutively despite the guidelines.\u201d <em>Pedrioli, </em>931 F.2d at 32 (citation and footnote omitted). The district court methodically discussed and applied each of the relevant factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>ER 95, 100-104. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">Finally, McNeil contends that the district court\u2019s factual findings were insufficient to support a $10,000 fine. The Sentencing Guidelines require the district court to \u201cimpose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>able to pay any fine.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a). District courts must also consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay the fine and any burden imposed on the defendant and his or her dependents by the imposition of the fine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d)(2)-(3). Here, with McNeil\u2019s total offense level at 20, the Sentencing Guidelines provided a range of $7,500 to $75,000 for the applicable fine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3). The $10,000 fine imposed by the district court fell within this range and near its lower end. McNeil made no showing of financial burden or inability to pay such fine before or during the sentencing hearing. To the contrary, the presentence report indicated that McNeil owns real property in North Dakota valued at over $9,000 and that he maintains an account at a brokerage house. This account generated $3,466 in interest, capital gains, and dividends in 1999. The district court did not clearly err in imposing a $10,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b737-16\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
