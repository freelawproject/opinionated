Clay, Jr. appeals the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cCAVC\u201d) that dismissed his appeal from a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d) decision for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the appeal was untimely. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs argues that we lack jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292 to hear the appeal. We agree, and therefore we dismiss Mr. Clay\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">Mr. Clay served in the Air Force on active duty from January to March of 1971. He claims that during basic training he suffered a fall that resulted in back and neck injuries and hernia and stomach ailments. In October of 1982, the BVA issued a decision denying Mr. Clay\u2019s claim of service connection for his back disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">In 1994, Mr. Clay attempted to reopen his claim at the Veterans Administration\u2019s regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) in New Orleans. After the RO denied his claim, Mr. Clay filed a notice of disagreement and appealed the denial to the BVA. On July 1, 1998, the BVA issued a decision holding that Mr. Clay had not presented new and material evidence on which to reopen his claim. Enclosed with the denial was a Notice of Appellate Rights, informing Mr. Clay that an appeal to the CAVC could be taken if a Notice of Appeal was submitted within 120 days of the date of the decision. Alternatively, the notice provided that Mr. Clay could make a motion for reconsideration to the BVA. Mr. Clay filed a motion for reconsideration on November 3, 1998. The BVA denied the motion in a letter dated February 23,1999. Accompanying the letter was a notice informing Mr. Clay that he had \u201c120 days from the date of the mailing of the enclosed letter denying your motion for reconsideration within which to file a Notice of Appeal with the Court.\u201d The following language was also included in the BVA\u2019s letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-17\">Your motion for reconsideration, which has been carefully reviewed in light of the Board\u2019s decision in your appeal, does not demonstrate that the BVA decision contains obvious error---- For these reasons, I must deny your motion for reconsideration. I have referred your presentation to the Jackson, Mississippi, regional office for initial consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-v\">The reference to \u201cyour presentation\u201d apparently was in response to Mr. Clay\u2019s submission of what he considered to be \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d along with his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">Following the BVA\u2019s decision, Mr. Clay began to focus his efforts on the RO in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Jackson, Mississippi. Correspondence between the RO and Mr. Clay continued through June of 1999. The following month, Mr. Clay resumed correspondence with the New Orleans RO with respect to his original claim and was told that the BVA decision had become final after 120 days had passed without appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Mr. Clay submitted a second motion for reconsideration with the BVA on December 23, 1999. The motion was denied on February 29, 2000. Following this denial, Mr. Clay filed a Notice of Appeal with the CAVC. On August 14, 2000, the CAVC dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on Mr. Clay\u2019s failure to file a Notice of Appeal within 120 days of the BVA\u2019s July 1, 1998 decision, as required by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a) and Rule 4 of the CAVC. The appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Our authority to review a decision of the CAVC is limited. \u201cExcept to the extent that an appeal under this chapter presents a constitutional issue, the Court of Appeals may not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Therefore, unless a constitutional issue is presented, we are without jurisdiction to review Mr. Clay\u2019s appeal if it involves a determination of facts or the application of law to facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Whether the CAVC properly determined that a Notice of Appeal filing was untimely is a question of fact. <em>See Leonard v. Gober, </em>223 F.3d 1374,1376 (Fed.Cir. 2000). In <em>Leonard, </em>a claimant whose Notice of Appeal was filed just beyond the 120 day deadline argued that principles of equitable tolling should apply to prevent a dismissal of the appeal as untimely. <em>Leonard, </em>223 F.3d at 1375. This court followed Supreme Court precedent, <em>Irwin v. DVA, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), in application of the doctrine of equitable tolling. In <em>Irwin, </em>the Supreme Court stated that equitable tolling is permissible in situations \u201cwhere the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary\u2019s misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.\u201d <em>Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. 453. The court noted that, in cases where a filing is late, a showing of due diligence is usually necessary in order for tolling to occur. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Leonard, </em>the appellant offered a number of justifications for the late filing, including the delayed response of an attorney and the early closing of a post office on the day she tried to mail her appeal. <em>Id. </em>Leonard\u2019s appeal required the court to consider whether the professed justifications were sufficient to establish due diligence. The court determined that applying the <em>Irwin </em>criteria to the specific facts of the case would be an application of law to fact, expressly prohibited by \u00a7 7292(d)(2). <em>Leonard, </em>223 F.3d at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The same result is required in the case of Mr. Clay\u2019s appeal. In this case, in order to determine whether the CAVC\u2019s ruling on timeliness was correct, it would be necessary for us to review the pertinent facts to determine whether the BVA\u2019s referral of Mr. Clay\u2019s \u201cpresentation\u201d to the Jackson, Mississippi RO was misleading. Such an inquiry would require an application of law to fact; it therefore is beyond the scope of our jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C \u00a7 7292. Accordingly, Mr. Clay\u2019s appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">No Costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
