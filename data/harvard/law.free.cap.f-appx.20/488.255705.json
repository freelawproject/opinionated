This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorney\u2019s fees, Robert L. Voit sued the Louisville and Jefferson County (Ky.) Board of Health, Jefferson County, three employees of the board (Michael Humphrey, Robert Crabtree, and Melinda G. Rowe, M.D.) and a host of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d employees in their individual and official capacities. In essence, Voit challenged the results of his criminal conviction in Jefferson District Court for occupying dilapidated housing in violation of Chapter III, Rule 4 of the Louisville and Jefferson County Board of Health Sanitary Code. Voit claimed that his conviction was obtained by fraud and deceit, and that the offense for which he was convicted is a \u201csham offense\u201d because no one is prosecuted under the offense unless they fail to make complete necessary repairs within a reasonable period of time. Voit argued that he was the subject of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d of the sham offense in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The district court dismissed Voit\u2019s complaint pursuant to the doctrine set forth in <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 483 n. 16,103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) and <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). Voit appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">Upon de novo review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Voit\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, federal courts lack jurisdiction to review a case litigated and decided in state court as onk the United States Supreme Court has jurisdiction to correct state court judgments. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 483 n. 16; <em>Rooker, </em>263 U.S. at 415-16; <em>Patmon v. Michigan Supreme Comt, </em>224 F.3d 504, 506-07 (6th Cir.2000). Federal courts also lack jurisdiction to review constitutional claims that are inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s decision. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 486-87; <em>Patmon, </em>224 F.3d at 509-10. A plaintiffs claims are inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s decision if the federal claims can succeed only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it, <em>Catz v. Chalker, </em>142 F.3d 279, 293 (6th Cir.1998), and if the federal claims assert specific challenges to the state court proceedings, rather than a general challenge to the constitutionality of the state law. <em>Patmon, </em>224 F.3d at 509-10; <em>Catz, </em>142 F.3d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">A fair reading of the complaint reveals that Voit merely disagrees with the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ner in which he was found guilty of occupying dilapidated housing, and Voit\u2019s complaint in this action asserts claims against the persons and entities involved in the prosecution of the sanitary code violations. Since Voit is merely raising specific grievances regarding decisions of Kentucky\u2019s district court, his federal case is essentially an impermissible appeal of the state court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Accordingly, all outstanding motions are hereby denied, and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit, for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion of February 8, 2000.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
