Hodges appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2001) complaint and denying his motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Hodges v. Hudson, </em>No. CA-01-74 (E.D. Va. Apr. 4 <em>&amp; </em>20, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented \u25a0 in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
