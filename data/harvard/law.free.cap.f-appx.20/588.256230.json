Woods pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Overruling his drug-quantity objection, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Woods to 92 months imprisonment and 4 years supervised release. Woods renews his drug-quantity argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining Woods\u2019s drug quantity. <em>See United States v. Milton, </em>153 F.3d 891, 898 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review), <em>cert, denied, </em>525 U.S. 1165, 119 S.Ct. 1082, 143 L.Ed.2d 83 (1999). The court properly relied on expert evidence, <em>see United States v. Hunt, </em>171 F.3d 1192, 1196 (8th Cir.1999), and properly estimated the capacity of Woods\u2019s laboratory based on an amount of precursor chemicals, <em>see United States v. Anderson, </em>236 F.3d 427, 429 n. 5 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam). The court was entitled to believe the defense expert\u2019s testimony that Woods\u2019s laboratory could have theoretically produced the drug quantity urged by the government, while disbelieving the expert\u2019s testimony about the unlikelihood that a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory would have been able to do so. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>212 F.3d 441, 446 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">We decline to consider Woods\u2019s argument that the purity of a small quantity of methamphetamine seized from the laboratory should be used to estimate the laboratory\u2019s capacity because he presents it for file first time on appeal. <em>See Tarsney v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>225 F.3d 929, 939 (8th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1364, 149 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AHH\">. The Honorable Gary A.
