We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U .S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits de novo. <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2000). The decision of the Commissioner must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence and the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094,1097 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Where, as in this case, medical evidence establishes \u201can objective basis for some degree of pain and related symptoms\u201d and there is \u201cno evidence affirmatively suggesting that the claimant was malingering,\u201d the Commissioner must give \u201cclear and convincing\" reasons supported by specific findings for rejecting the claimant\u2019s pain testimony. <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993). This standard applies to all \u201csubjective symptom\u201d testimony by the claimant, not just to pain testimony. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996). Furthermore, the ALJ cannot meet this standard by making only general findings; \u201che must state which pain testimony is not credible and what evidence suggests the complaints are not credible.\u201d <em>Dodrill, </em>12 F.3d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">In this case, the ALJ made a general statement that Chadwick\u2019s testimony \u201cconcerning his impairments and their impact on his ability to work\u201d was only partially credible but made no reference to Chadwick\u2019s testimony regarding his back pain and right hand impairment. The only testimony that the ALJ discussed in <em>connection </em>with his credibility finding related to Chadwick\u2019s alleged \u201cwar dreams,\u201d his breathing disorder, and his alleged <em>arm </em>and leg impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Although there is adequate evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding, a reviewing court can affirm an administrative agency decision only on grounds that the agency itself relied upon. <em>Vista Hill Found, v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 556, 559 (9th Cir.1985). Therefore, because the ALJ failed both (1) to identify any of the specific testimony Chadwick gave about his back pain or the limitations with his right hand that he was discounting, and (2) to provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons for discounting this testimony, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s discussion was insufficient to reject the claimant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">The claimant also argues that the ALJ improperly rejected the testimony of Tamara Chadwick. Here we conclude that the ALJ did not err. An ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting lay witness testimony need only be \u201cgermane\u201d to the particular witness\u2019 testimony. <em>See Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996). Tamara Chadwick\u2019s testimony was often vague, speculative, or about peripheral matters, and the ALJ gave sufficient reasons for rejecting the only significantly probative portion of her testimony. Therefore, the ALJ properly discounted her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>We also conclude that the ALJ did not err by failing to take into account that Chadwick\u2019s skills were allegedly outdated in determining that he could perform his past relevant work. \u201cObsolescence of skills\u201d is not to be considered in determining whether a claimant can perform past relevant work. <em>See Ray v. Bowen, </em>813 F.2d 914 (9th Cir.1987). Moreover, the Social Security Act requires that inability to engage in substantial gainful employment must be by reason of some \u201c \u2018medically determinable physical or mental impairment----\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A)). Therefore, the outdated nature of Chadwick\u2019s skills cannot be a basis for a disability finding, and the ALJ\u2019s decision not to consider them in determining whether Chadwick could perform past relevant work was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In conclusion, because the ALJ erred in not supporting his discounting of Chadwick\u2019s testimony regarding his back pain and right hand impairment with clear and convincing reasons, we reverse and remand the district court\u2019s decision with directions that it further remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
