See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b710-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">Petitioner-Appellant Doi Phung was convicted of murder, street terrorism, possession of stolen property, and carrying a loaded firearm for his role in killing a fifteen-year-old innocent bystander during gang warfare. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">Because Phung filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Phung must show that the state court\u2019s decision on the merits \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established [fjederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An \u201cunreasonable application of clearly established Federal law\u201d occurs where a state court\u2019s application of Supreme Court law is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">Phung first claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel (1) stipulated to the admission into evidence of transcripts of police interviews with two other gang members and (2) decided not to call several witnesses to testify. To prevail on his ineffective assistance claim, <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>requires Phung to show that his attorney\u2019s conduct fell below a standard of objective reasonableness and thus prejudiced the petitioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In applying <em>Strickland, </em>we show deference to the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tions of trial counsel and do not engage in \u201csecond-guessing\u201d or question what might be \u201csound trial strategy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We reject Phung\u2019s claim that his trial counsel, Mark Naughton, was ineffective for stipulating to the admission of the tapes. Naughton was faced with the task of proving self-defense without Phung\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He chose to show the jury that Phung was in a gang and thus would reasonably perceive the situation in which he found himself to be a drive-by shooting and an imminent attack on his life. Although the stipulated-to testimony indicated that Phung had fired first, it also provided facts supporting Naughton\u2019s theory, facts the jury otherwise would not hear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state court found that Phung\u2019s counsel weighed his alternatives and strategically chose to stipulate to the tapes. The court thus did not clearly err in finding that Naughton provided effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Phung\u2019s next attack on Naughton also fails. Phung claims that Naughton provided ineffective assistance by fading to seek admission of transcripts of the police interview of another gang member, Loi Van Nguyen, and by failing to call three additional eyewitnesses to testify. The trial court found that Naughton\u2019s decision not to seek admission of Loi Van Nguyen\u2019s statements amounted to effective assistance, and we do not find this to be clear error. As to the testimony from the three other eyewitnesses, while a lawyer has a \u201cduty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a particular decision not to investigate may nevertheless be reasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, the district court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> found that these witnesses\u2019 statements would have been marginally helpful to Phung, at best. It was thus not clear error to find that Naughton was effective despite avoiding introduction of this witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">Phung\u2019s second habeas claim is that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing, at Phung\u2019s trial, that Phung was the aggressor, and then arguing, at the trial of Phung\u2019s rivals, that Phung had been ambushed. Prosecutors have a duty to ensure fundamentally fair trials by, among other things, resisting the temptation to knowingly use false evidence against a defendant in a proceeding.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As an extension of this principle, the Ninth Circuit has ruled that a prosecutor violates due process by pursuing \u201cfundamentally inconsistent theories in separate trials against separate defendants charged with the same murder... if the prosecutor knowingly uses false evidence or acts in bad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Court has emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>that reversal in such a situation is required only where the prosecutor presents theories that are \u201ctotally inconsistent,\u201d and not \u201cwhere the underlying theory \u2018remains consistent.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">We addressed this exact issue on these exact facts in <em>Nguyen v. Lindsey, </em>Loi Van Nguyen\u2019s appeal from his conviction for murder due to his role in the same gun battle for which Phung was convicted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We there held that it was not prosecutorial misconduct for the prosecutor to argue at each separate trial that each party had been the initial aggressor. We reasoned that the prosecutor\u2019s overall theory of the case that a shot from Phung\u2019s weapon killed a fifteen-year-old innocent bystander in the mutual combat situation of voluntary gang warfare-was consistent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We find no reason in the record before us to reach a different result and thus find no prosecuto-rial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The petition for a writ of habeas corpus is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b710-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-13\">. <em>Shackleford v.
