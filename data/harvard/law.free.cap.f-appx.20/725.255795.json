He claims that the district court erred by finding that the victim\u2019s injuries were permanent or life-threatening and by departing upward on the ground that Butler\u2019s criminal history had been under-represented. We vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing to allow the district court to provide a more detailed explanation of its reasons for departing upward based on criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">I. Permanent or Life-Threatening Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Butler claims that the district court erred in finding that the victim had suffered permanent or life-threatening injury. This finding resulted in an increase of six levels, whereas a finding of serious bodily injury would have elevated the sentence only four levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(3)(C). The guidelines define \u201cpermanent or life-threatening bodily injury\u201d as \u201cinjury involving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, commentary 1(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">Dr. Sibley, the general surgeon who treated the victim, Bordeaux, testified at trial regarding the extent of Bordeaux\u2019s injuries. When Bordeaux arrived at the hospital, he was categorized as a \u201clevel-one trauma,\u201d the level for patients with \u201cany possibly life-threatening injury.\u201d He initially suffered from low blood pressure and fluid loss from ongoing bleeding. Dr. Sib-ley operated immediately to remove a pellet lodged in his colon and repair damage to that organ. She was concerned because \u201ca bowel injury can kill you and needs to be obviously addressed\u201d due to the fact that \u201cthe colon has the highest bacterial content of any of the bowel and is a problem in terms of infectious complications if it\u2019s missed.\u201d Bordeaux suffered from other wounds scattered throughout his body. Some of the BB pellets came close to seriously harming his liver, kidney, and lungs, but examination revealed no significant damage to those organs. Dr. Sibley removed three pellets, but left others inside Bordeaux\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">Dr. Sibley\u2019s testimony supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Bordeaux suffered life-threatening or permanent injury. The low blood pressure, loss of blood, and internal harm threatened his life, as reflected by the hospital\u2019s decision to categorize him as a level one trauma patient. <em>Cf. United States v. Hinton, </em>31 F.3d 817, 826 (9th Cir.1994). Dr. Sibley testified that the specific injury to his colon may have resulted in death without immediate and proper treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Butler argues that there was only a possibility that Bordeaux\u2019s injuries were life-threatening, but after a full diagnosis, the injuries were deemed only serious. This argument is unpersuasive. The blood loss and damage to the colon threatened Bordeaux\u2019s life despite the fact that the threat was averted by skillful treatment. In addition, a victim\u2019s injury can be life-threatening if he or she is placed in a life-threatening situation, even if he or she does not suffer from life-threatening injuries. <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>238 F.3d 1180, 1188 (9th Cir.2001). Bordeaux was left alone next to a canal after being shot and hit in the head. He was bleeding profusely and had to drag himself onto the street to signal for help. This situation threatened his life, even if his injuries were later repaired. Therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that Bordeaux\u2019s injuries were life-threatening or permanent was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">II. Upward Departure Based on Criminal History</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Butler next argues that the district court erred in departing upward one criminal history level. He argues that the district court provided inadequate justification at sentencing for its decision and that the guidelines sufficiently accounted for his prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">A court may depart upward from the guidelines if the criminal history category \u201cdoes not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3. Such a departure is only appropriate in the exceptional case because a defendant\u2019s criminal history is already expressly taken into account by the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Carrillo-Alvarez, </em>3 F.3d 316, 320 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">A sentencing court must clearly explain its decision for imposing an upward departure. <em>United States v. Ponce, </em>51 F.3d 820, 833 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Wells, </em>878 F.2d 1232, 1233 (9th Cir.1989). Such a clear statement of reasons is required by statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); <em>Wells, </em>878 F.2d at 1233. This requirement also furthers the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s purpose of doing away with uncertainties and disparities in sentencing. <em>Wells, </em>878 F.2d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The district court that sentenced Butler did not provide a sufficient explanation for its upward departure. Its explanation consisted of one sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">The Court, however, does depart upward pursuant to Sentencing Guideline 4(a)(1.3) because a review of the defendant\u2019s criminal history other than the offenses set forth in paragraph 34 of the pre-sentence report significantly under represents his criminal history calculation as determined by the Court, and so the Court does depart upward one criminal history level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The district court did not point to any particular facts that made Butler\u2019s record more serious than that of others in the same criminal category. <em>United States v. Carrillo-Alvarez, </em>3 F.3d 316, 324 (9th Cir. 1993). Moreover, its statement that Butler\u2019s criminal history was under-represented in his sentence was the type of conclusory statement disallowed in <em>Carrillo-Alvarez. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">The government argues that the facts contained in the pre-sentence report justify an upward departure. However, it is not enough that there are legitimate grounds available in the record; rather the district court must have based its departure on those legitimate grounds. <em>United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 983 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Singleton, </em>917 F.2d 411, 412 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The government also argues that the court\u2019s rehance on the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) provided sufficient facts for its decision. It quotes the court\u2019s statement that it \u201chas reviewed the pre-sentence report\u201d along with other material \u201c[a]nd based upon all of those material, the Court is now prepared to impose sentence.\u201d Although it is true that the district court \u201cmay build the appropriate factual record by adopting a presentence report that has made specific findings of fact that support the decision,\u201d <em>Singleton, </em>917 F.2d at 412-413, the district court\u2019s mere recitation that it reviewed all of the documents, including the PSR, is insufficient to meet its requirement of explanation. <em>See Ponce, </em>51 F.3d at 833. Butler\u2019s PSR did not include any conclusions about whether the court should depart from the sentencing range or why. The report merely summarized Butler\u2019s prior criminal activity and stated, \u201cAn upward departure may be considered for under representation of criminal history.\u201d <em>Cf. Singleton, </em>917 F.2d at 412-413.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Because the district court did not provide a specific enough explanation to fulfill the statute\u2019s requirements and allow appellate review, we vacate Butler\u2019s sentence and remand for the district court to set for the specific reasons for its departure from the sentencing guidelines. <em>Ponce, </em>51 F.3d at 833; <em>Wells, </em>878 F.2d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Sentence VACATED and ease REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
