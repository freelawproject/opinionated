In such business it is frequently necessary to have tramways and railroads as parts of the manufacturing plant. The articles in question would not authorize the corporation to buy, lease, or operate a railway for traffic. Perhaps it was not necessary to make special mention of this part of the manufacturing appliances, hut such mention cannot vitiate the incorporation. Such an incorporation could not use the right of eminent domain to acquire rights of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We think the court properly sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The court refused to allow the plaintiff to amend the complaint. This is generally a matter of absolute right, and when it is refused the court must be able to see that the complaint cannot he so amended as to state a good cause of action. This the court will not often he able to do, but I think it was properly so determined here.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Henshaw, J., and McFarland, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
