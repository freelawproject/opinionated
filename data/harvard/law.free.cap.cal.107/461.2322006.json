He appeals from the judgment and an order denying him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">One Kane, a witness called by the state, was permitted, against the objection of defendant, to testify that, on the evening of the day preceding the one on which the homicide was committed, the witness saw Assalena, the deceased, at La Grange, just before, the latter left for Sonora, where the killing took place, and that Assalena then stated that he had discovered that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\"had been writing to his (Assalena\u2019s) wife, and was trying to get his wife and child to run away with him, defendant. And another witness for the prosecution, one Watt, was permitted to state that on the same evening at La Grange, Assalena told him, \u201cI am in trouble. I have' a family in Sonora, and a few months ago I took a young man in as partner with me, and here \"lately I have discovered that he is about to get away with my wife and child, and I want to get to Sonora as quick as possible. I want to save my boy, and that\u2019s my hurry for coming here.\u201d This evidence was clearly hearsay, and was wholly inadmissible upon any possible theory of the case, or upon any principle or rule of evidence known to the law. It was no less hearsay because the declarations were those of the deceased, since proof of such declarations are only admissible when made <em>in </em>extremis\u2014dying declarations, having reference to the circumstances of the death, or when they constitute a part of the <em>res gestae. (People </em>v. <em>Carkhuff, </em>24 Cal. 642.) In this ease they were neither. The mortal blow had not been struck, nor were they in any manner connected with the renconter which resulted in Assalena\u2019s death. Obviously the admission of this evidence was highly prejudicial to the defendant, since its inevitable tendency \u2022 would be to greatly inflame and prejudice the minds of the jury against him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carlton, </em>57 Cal. 84; 40 Am. Rep. 112; <em>People </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>77 Cal. 494.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">It was also error to admit the evidence of Mrs. Assalena as to the defendant\u2019s efforts to ihduce the witness to leave her husband. Under the circumstances of this case the evidence was not pertinent to any issue before the jury. Were the case one of circumstantial evidence, and the fact in doubt as to whether defendant did the killing, such evidence might be admissible upon the question of motive <em>(Pierson </em>v. <em>People, </em>79 N. Y. 424; 35 Am. Rep. 524); but here the killing was admitted, and the only issue was whether it was in necessary self-defense. In such a case evidence of this character serves no competent purpose, while its effect was necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>prejudicial to defendant\u2019s case. These errors necessitate a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Garoutte, J., McFarland, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
