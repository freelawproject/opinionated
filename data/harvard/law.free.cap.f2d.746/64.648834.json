FERC rejected NYSERDA\u2019s application on the ground that it was not timely filed at the Office of the Secretary as required by FERC\u2019s Rule 2001. <em>See </em>18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.-2001 (1983). This rule was promulgated and took effect while NYSERDA\u2019s comparative licensing proceeding was pending. NYSERDA maintains that its application was properly filed under the predecessor to Rule 2001 and that this predecessor rule should have been applied here in the interest of justice. We agree with NYSERDA and conclude that FERC\u2019s ruling was arbitrary and capricious. We therefore reverse and order FERC to deem NYSERDA\u2019s application timely submitted to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-23\">NYSERDA is a state authorized public benefit corporation, N.Y.Pub.Auth.Law \u00a7 1852.1 (McKinney 1981), which seeks to promote the \u201cdevelopment and utilization of safe, dependable renewable and economic energy sources.\u201d N.Y.Pub.Auth.Law \u00a7 1850-a (McKinney 1981). As a political subdivision of the State of New York, NYSERDA is recognized to be a \u201cmunicipality\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>within the meaning of section 3(7) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(7) (1982). NYSERDA has total assets of $14,-917,000 and has previously filed at least five license and permit applications with FERC. All of those applications were properly filed and have been accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">FERC is the agency which Congress has empowered to license the development of the nation\u2019s water resources. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 791a <em>et seq. </em>(1982). Recently, FERC has received over two thousand license applications a year from persons and organizations seeking to operate small scale hydroelectric projects. In order to manage its overwhelming caseload, FERC has adopted strict filing deadlines and procedures in the small scale hydro area.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">On October 31, 1981, the Long Lake Energy Corporation (\u201cLong Lake\u201d) applied for a license to construct and operate a hydroelectric power project to be known as the Phoenix Project. The proposed project was to be situated on the Oswego River in Oswego and Onondaga Counties, New York. On April 14, 1982, FERC published an official notice of Long Lake\u2019s application in the Federal Register. 47 Fed.Reg. 16,848 (1982). That notice expressly direct- , ed that all competing applications should be mailed to the following address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">Kenneth F. Plumb, Secretary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-s\">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At4\">825 North Capitol Street, N.E.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUME\">Washington, D.C. 20426</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agp\">Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">In response to the FERC notice of April 14, NYSERDA decided to file a competing license application for the Phoenix Project. NYSERDA informed FERC of its intent to file such an application on June 23, 1982, and under FERC\u2019s filing regulations NYSERDA\u2019s application thus became due by October 25, 1982. <em>See </em>18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(c) (1982). NYSERDA thus had actual notice that its application was due in the Secretary\u2019s Office at 825 North Capitol Street on October 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">NYSERDA hired an engineering firm, Tippetts-\u00c1bbett-McCarthy-Stratton (\u201cTAMS\u201d), to make the necessary studies and all appropriate filings with the Commission regarding the Phoenix Project. TAMS had been working on NYSERDA\u2019s application since January 20, 1982 and was therefore aware of the April 14 notice that FERC had published in the Federal Register. J.A. at 15. TAMS had extensive experience in hydroelectric project engineering; however, it had never before filed documents with FERC. In attempting to ascertain what were the Commission\u2019s procedural rules, TAMS first consulted a guide to the Commission\u2019s rules known as the \u201cBlue Book\u201d and published by the Commission in April, 1982. <em>See </em>FERC, <em>Application Procedures for Hydropower Licenses, Exemptions and Preliminary Permits </em>(Apr. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">The Blue Book\u2019s discussion of the filing regulations did not make reference to the Commission\u2019s new Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 C.F.R. Part 385 (1983). In particular, the Blue Book did not mention the revised rule at issue here, Rule 2001,18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.2001 (1983). While it did refer to this rule\u2019s more general predecessor, the Blue Book did not include the text of that provision. Because of these lacunae in the Blue Book, TAMS endeavored to obtain clarification of FERC\u2019s submission and filing requirements from the staff of the FERC\u2019s Division of Hydropower Licensing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">Mr. Robert Bell, the member of the Division of Hydropower Licensing responsible for the Phoenix Project, directed TAMS to the Docket Section of the Office of the Secretary. This Section told TAMS that it should deliver the NYSERDA license application to the Division of Hydropower Licensing. J.A. at 15-16. Specifically, the Docket Section instructed TAMS to deliver the license application to the following address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">FERC</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-17\">Division of Hydropower Licensing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-18\">Railway Building</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-19\">400 1st Street, N.W.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-20\">Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-21\">202-376-9171</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Id. </em>When TAMS called the telephone number it had been given, an employee of the Division of Hydropower Licensing confirmed these directions. Moreover, the same FERC employee informed TAMS that the application would be deemed timely and properly submitted if it were received before closing time at the above address. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">On October 22, 1982, or three days before the due date, a TAMS messenger delivered the application by hand to the Division of Hydropower Licensing. As FERC\u2019s rules require, TAMS submitted an original and fourteen copies of the application. A cover letter attached to the application was addressed to FERC Secretary Kenneth F. Plumb and listed the proper address to which the application should in fact have been delivered. TAMS made timely service of the application on all other parties to the proceeding. An additional copy of the application was delivered to Mr. Bell on October 22, and this copy was ultimately routed to the Office of the Secretary through FERC's internal mail. However, the application was delayed in transit within FERC, and it was not until October 27 that the Office of the Secretary stamped the application as \u201creceived.\u201d J.A. at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">At some later date, NYSERDA\u2019s application was returned to the Division of Hydro-power Licensing, which rejected it as untimely. On November 30, 1982, the Deputy Director of the Office of Electric Power Regulation wrote a letter rejecting NYSERDA\u2019s application and stating that NYSERDA should direct all inquiries regarding the rejection to Mr. Bell. When TAMS contacted Mr. Bell, he indicated for the first time that NYSERDA\u2019s application should have been submitted to the Office of the Secretary and not to the Division of Hydropower Licensing. <em>See </em>J.A. at 21. In its Order Denying Appeal and Order Denying Rehearing, FERC relied on NYSERDA\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 2001, a new rule governing filings with the Commission which had gone into effect on August 26, 1982. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.2001 (1983). Rule 2001 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">(a) <em>Filings with the Commission: </em>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any document required to be filed with the Commission must comply with Rules 2001 to 2005 and must be submitted to the Secretary by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">(i) Mailing the document to the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, D.C. 20426; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">(ii) Hand delivering the document to Room 3110, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">(2) Any document is considered filed on the date stamped by the Secretary, unless the document is subsequently rejected. Any document received after regular business hours is considered filed on the next regular business day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFL\">18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.2001 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">In rejecting NYSERDA\u2019s application, FERC declined to act pursuant to Rule 101(c)(2), which allows it to apply its prior Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 C.F.R. Part 1 (1982), to proceedings pending on August 26, 1982, where such use is warranted \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.101(c)(2) (1983). The preamble to FERC\u2019s new Rules clarifies that the Commission may exercise this discretionary authority \u201cin light of any inequities that may result from the imposition\u201d of the new Rules. 47 Fed.Reg. 19,014, 19,016 (1982). FERC gave no reasons for its refusal to employ Rule 101(c)(2). NYSERDA has appealed FERC\u2019s denial of its application claiming that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">If NYSERDA\u2019s application were untimely filed under both the old and the new rule, there would be no question about the legality of FERC\u2019s action in rejecting it. Therefore, in reviewing the Commission\u2019s behavior, we take up first the question of whether NYSERDA\u2019s application was properly filed under the old rule. Rule 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>superseded 18 C.F.R. which provided as follows: \u00a7 1.14(a) (1982),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\">The filing of written applications ... with the Commission as required or allowed by these rules ... shall be made by filing them with the Office of the Secretary of the Commission in Washington, D.C. <em>Any such papers must be received by the Commission in Washington, D.C. within the time limit, </em>if any, for such filing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">18 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.14(a) (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Unlike the new rule, which states that a submission is not considered filed unless \u201cstamped by the Secretary,\u201d the old rule provided that a submission was timely if it was in the possession of the \u201cCommission in Washington, D.C.\u201d within the applicable time limit. NYSERDA\u2019s application was addressed to the \u201cOffice of the Secretary\u201d and was received by the Commission\u2019s Washington office a full three days before the relevant deadline. Accordingly, it would appear that NYSERDA\u2019s application satisfied the literal terms of the old rule and was therefore timely filed. This conclusion is borne out by the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The leading case was decided by this court and concerned an application for rehearing that did not arrive in the Secretary\u2019s Office until after the statutory deadline. <em>Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. v. FPC, </em>251 F.2d 875, 877 (D.C.Cir.1957). <em>See also Pressentin v. Seaton, </em>284 F.2d 195, 198 (D.C.Cir.1960). We held that the application satisfied the deadline because the Commission\u2019s General Counsel received a single copy of the application on time and he was \u201cthe very official in charge of the proceedings.\u201d 251 F.2d at 877. In this case, NYSERDA submitted a copy of its application three days before the filing deadline to Mr. Robert Bell, the FERC official responsible for ruling on the Phoenix Project. Under <em>Dayton Power, </em>NYSERDA appears to have met FERC\u2019s deadline by timely filing its application with the FERC official in charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The Commission itself has followed the <em>Dayton Power </em>rule in yet another case presenting similar facts. Thus, in <em>Village of Elbow Lake, Minnesota v. Otter Tail Power Co., </em>46 F.P.C. 1363 (1971), an application for rehearing was deemed timely even though it was not received by the Secretary until a week after the deadline. Relying on <em>Dayton Power, </em>the Commission found it dispositive that Staff Counsel had received a copy of the application in a timely manner. Once again, this case suggests that NYSERDA\u2019s application was timely filed under the old rule since it was delivered to the FERC official in charge three days before the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">NYSERDA\u2019s position is also supported by several cases that suggest that under the old rule late applications were often accepted where there had been either \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d or where a good-faith effort to comply had been made. Thus in <em>Power Authority of New York, </em>31 F.P.C. 962, 963 (1964), the Commission accepted a late application after holding that a document mailed to the Commission from New York City should be presumed received the next day. And in <em>Firman 0. Gotzinger, </em>Project No. 5965-000, Notice Reinstating Appeal (Oct. 26, 1982), the Commission accepted a filing that arrived in the building on time, but was not processed and file stamped until the next day. In both of these cases, technical noncompliance with FERC deadlines was excused in part because there had been substantial good-faith compliance. Similarly, in cases involving other agencies, we have also sometimes required that late documents be accepted as timely. <em>See, e.g., Yohalem v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission, </em>412 F.2d 1124 (D.C.Cir.1969); <em>Valley Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>237 F.2d 784, 787 (D.C.Cir.1956). Both <em>Yohalem </em>and <em>Valley Broadcasting </em>were cases where late filing parties had made a substantial good-faith effort to satisfy their deadlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">In this case, NYSERDA\u2019s actions in hand-delivering the documents three days early clearly satisfy the requisite test of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>substantial good-faith compliance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We thus find that NYSERDA\u2019s application would clearly have been deemed timely under FERC\u2019s old rule. We now consider whether that result is affected by the implementation of the new FERC Rule 2001. This rule went into effect on August 26, 1982, while NYSERDA\u2019s application was being prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Under the new rule, NYSERDA clearly missed the October 25 deadline. Rule 2001 requires both that applications be delivered to the Office of the Secretary and that they be stamped by the Secretary for the deadline to be met. However, Rule 2001 is qualified by a proviso which allows application of the old rule to proceedings pending on August 26, 1982. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.-101(e)(2) (1983). This proviso authorizes application of the old rules \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d and for the purpose of correcting any \u201cinequities that may result from the imposition\u201d of the new rules. 47 Fed. Reg. 19,014, 19,016 (1982). Since NYSERDA\u2019s application was pending on August 26, we must consider whether FERC acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d by failing to invoke the proviso in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Under the totality of the circumstances presented here, we conclude that FERC did act arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to invoke its proviso and accept NYSERDA\u2019s application. We reach this conclusion because numerous circumstances taken together weigh in favor of the petitioner. We consider it significant that (1) NYSERDA\u2019s application was timely submitted under the old rules; (2) the application was delivered three days before the deadline to Mr. Robert Bell, the FERC official in charge of the Phoenix Project; (3) the application was timely served on all interested parties; (4) the application would have been timely filed had it not been delayed for five days in FERC\u2019s internal mail; (5) senior FERC employees, who were questioned by the applicant, were themselves unaware of the new rules; (6) the applicant made a great effort to ascertain what the rules were and to comply with the information it received; (7) FERC\u2019s official guide to its own filing requirements failed to mention the new rules which in any event were not yet available in the Code of Federal Regulations; (8) the proviso to Rule 2001 contemplated problems such as this during the transition from the old to the new rules and provided for use of the old rules where warranted \u201cin the interest of jus'tice\u201d; and finally (9) FERC has never given a plausible reason for refusing to apply the proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">When unpacked, FERC\u2019s position is that NYSERDA erroneously delivered its application three days early to the official in charge of the Phoenix Project when it should have been delivered instead to a file clerk in another office. Rejection of NYSERDA\u2019s application on these grounds is rough justice indeed; too rough to be countenanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Given these facts, we find it incomprehensible that FERC has refused to accept NYSERDA\u2019s application \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d FERC lawfully adopted the proviso agreeing to correct inequities resulting from the imposition of its new rules. And having lawfully adopted that proviso, FERC became obligated to apply it. <em>Service v. Dulles, </em>354 U.S. 363, 372, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1157, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957) (Harlan, J.); Note, <em>Violations by Agencies of Their Own Regulations, </em>87 Harv.L.Rev. 629 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>(1974). This case clearly implicates all of the central concerns of the proviso. In fact, few cases could more clearly call for application of the proviso. We are therefore compelled to hold that FERC has ignored its own proviso and has thus acted illegally in rejecting NYSERDA\u2019s application. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In so holding, we wish to emphasize that our conclusion is based on all of the nine circumstances present in this case and that no single factor alone dictates the outcome. We also stress that our holding rests upon the existence of a proviso that FERC put in place and thus obligated itself to apply where application is called for. For that reason we need not consider the general rule, or possible exceptions to it, that estoppel cannot be invoked against the government because of the acts of its employees. <em>Schweiker v. Hansen, </em>450 U.S. 785, 101 S.Ct. 1468, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981) (per curiam); <em>Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, </em>332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947) (Frankfurter, J.). Nor do we require an agency to publish every new regulation instantaneously in every one of its official publications. Rather, we hold that under all the circumstances of this case FERC ignored its own proviso limiting the application to old cases of the new, strict filing provisions of Rule 2001. Since this was unlawful, we order the Commission to deem NYSERDA\u2019s application timely filed. We, of course, express no opinion on the merits of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. FERC relies heavily on four orders that it issued in 1980 denying untimely petitions to intervene. Riceland Electric Cooperative, Inc., 13 F.E.R.C. (CCH) fl 61,146 (Nov. 19, 1980); <em>Arkansas Valley Electric Cooperative Corp., </em>13 F.E.R.C. (CCH) (f 61,150 (Nov. 20, 1980); Rice-land Electric Cooperative, Inc., 13 F.E.R.C. (CCH) If 61,151 (Nov. 20, 1980); Riceland Electric Cooperative, Inc., 13 F.E.R.C. (CCH) ff 61,152 (Nov. 20, 1980). FERC claims that these orders announced a policy of strict adherence to all of its application deadlines. We find these cases inapposite because the late applications in question were submitted as much as 32 days after the deadline had passed. In addition, FERC essentially rejected these applications because they were not submitted in good faith. By contrast, in this case NYSERDA\u2019s actions clearly demonstrate substantial good-faith compliance. <em>See Superior Oil Co. v. FERC, </em>667 F.2d 1180 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
