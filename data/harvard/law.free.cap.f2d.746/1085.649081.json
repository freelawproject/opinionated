Eddie Stites and Debbie Towler, husband and wife, filed a pro se complaint and motion for a temporary writ of prohibition in the district court. In their complaint Stites and Towler named numerous entities and individuals as defendants, including the United States Government, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, an individual IRS officer, and Stites\u2019 employer, Houston Lighting and Power Co. Stites and Towler, as \u201cfree, soverign [sic], and natural citizen(s)\u201d, demanded the return of \u201call taxes erroneously and illegally collected through fear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>intimidation for the years of 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982.\u201d They also asked that the IRS be prohibited \u201cfrom seizing, attempting to seize or placing any liens against any of Plaintiffs Assets and/or to remove any lien already in place____\u201d Stites and Towler in addition demanded a trial by jury in order to assess damages for the defendants\u2019 alleged violations to their rights in regard to forcing payment of the disputed taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">As ground for their demand for relief, Stites and Towler maintained that federal income and social security taxes are unconstitutional under Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9, of the United States Constitution, and that \u201cDefendants are part of a giant conspiracy to deprive Plaintiffs of their Property under the erroneous idea that Wages are Income____\u201d Lastly, taxpayers made broad conclusionary allegations that defendants interfered with certain of their constitutional rights, such as their freedom of speech, right to work, and right to petition the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">The district court responded with an order in which it held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the taxpayers\u2019 request for injunctive relief and the refund of previously paid taxes. The district court found the remainder of taxpayers\u2019 complaint frivolous, but granted them 20 days in which to file an amended complaint. After the taxpayers by way of their \u201camendment\u201d repeated essentially the same arguments and requests for relief, the district court issued a memorandum order, stating that it did not have jurisdiction over their action by reason of Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a). It also found that taxpayers\u2019 suit was founded upon frivolous grounds. Taxpayers filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">The courts have time and again rejected taxpayer attacks on the constitutionality of the income tax laws. <em>E.g., Davis v. United States Government, </em>742 F.2d 171 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Parker v. C.I.R., </em>724 F.2d 469, 471 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Edwards v. C.I.R., </em>680 F.2d 1268, 1270 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Lonsdale v. C.I.R., </em>661 F.2d 71, 72 (5th Cir.1981). In <em>Lonsdale, </em>the Fifth Circuit in rejecting a taxpayer attack on the constitutionality of the tax laws stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4m\">Appellants\u2019 contentions are stale ones, long settled against them. As such they are frivolous. Bending over backwards, in indulgence of appellants\u2019 pro se status, we today forbear the sanctions of Rule 38, Fed.R.App.P. We publish this opinion as notice to future litigants that the continued advancing of these long-defunct arguments invites such sanctions, however.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Since that warning, we have assessed double costs for frivolous appeals in <em>Davis, Parker, </em>and <em>Edwards. </em>Equally without merit is appellants\u2019 claim that they were improperly denied their Seventh Amendment rights to a jury trial of their claims. <em>Mathes v. C.I.R., </em>576 F.2d 70, 71 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">The Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a), provides, with certain exceptions which are inapplicable to this case, \u201cthat no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person____\u201d The district court correctly held that taxpayers\u2019 request for injunctive relief was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, and that \u201c[their] entire suit is grounded on the clearly frivolous proposition that wages are not taxable income____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-15\">Frivolous suits such as this impose an unjustified burden on the federal judiciary. Further, the extensive costs of the judicial process in such cases is paid ultimately by those citizen taxpayers who recognize their responsibilities to support their government. This Court can at least tax these appellants double costs for this frivolous, utterly groundless, appeal. The district court is affirmed, and appellants will be taxed with double costs under Fed.R. App.P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
