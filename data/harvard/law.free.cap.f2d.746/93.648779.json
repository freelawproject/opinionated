Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1916 they are entitled to do so \u201cwithout prepaying fees or costs or furnishing security therefor.\u201d Relying thereupon, they refused the U.S. Marshal\u2019s request for advance payment of custodial and insurance expenses which the Marshal demanded pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921. The marshal has no funds, or statutory source of funds, and under the statute he is required to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-22\">\u201ccollect, in advance, a deposit to cover the initial expenses for such services and periodically thereafter such amounts as may be necessary to pay such expenses until the litigation is concluded____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-25\">Having no one to collect from, except plaintiffs, he, accordingly, refused to act. Plaintiffs sought an order compelling him to proceed without prepayment, and, the court refusing, they bring this interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-26\">Plaintiffs would hang their seamen\u2019s caps on an alleged conflict between the exemption in section 1916 and the prepay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>merit requirement in section 1921. While, concededly, the exemption applies only to \u201cfees and costs,\u201d and the marshal\u2019s disbursements are described as \u201cexpenses,\u201d which they clearly are, plaintiffs point to section 1921\u2019s provision that these expenses are to be \u201ctaxed as costs.\u201d Hence, they say, section 1916, as the \u201cspecific,\u201d must prevail over section 1921, which is the \u201cgeneral.\u201d They further say that any doubts are to be resolved in their favor as seamen, as wards of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We are not so clear as to which statute is the specific. Although plaintiffs are supported by the Second Circuit, <em>Thielebeule v. M/S NORDSEE PILOT, </em>452 F.2d 1230, 1232 (2d Cir.1971), we note the contrary view expressed in <em>Araya v. McLelland, </em>525 F.2d 1194, 1196 (5th Cir.1976). Nor can we think that, in addition to a cap, a seaman wears a cloak of total protection. But, in any event, we do not find a necessary conflict in the statutes. The most apparent references in section 1916 are to, usually minimal, court fees, the prepayment of which Congress is content to waive, and to those of defendants\u2019 ultimately recoverable costs against which defendants are normally entitled to be secured. The marshal\u2019s section 1921 out-of-pocket expenses are quite different. Even though a losing defendant may ultimately be charged therewith, who pays these very sizeable expenses if the defendant wins? By hypothesis, the indigent seaman cannot, or certainly may not, and Congress has not provided that the government will. We are reminded of the words of the old song, \u201cWhere, in the world, does the money come from? <footnotemark>**</footnotemark>\u201d Although asked, plaintiffs do not answer; nor did the <em>Thielebeule </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Given this very different statutory concept, we do not construe the words \u201cfees or costs\u201d in section 1916 to include marshal\u2019s expenses in section 1921. However, we need pursue this no further, in light of the comprehensive opinion supporting the marshal\u2019s position in <em>Araya v. McLelland, </em>ante.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\"> \"I\u2019d like to ask it, Who fills the basket?
