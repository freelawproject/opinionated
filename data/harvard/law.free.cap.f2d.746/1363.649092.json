The sole issue on appeal is whether Parkhill has a right to a portion of these funds by reason of a provision in the will of her mother, Mary Clagett. On the issue presented to us, we hold that she does not,' and affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1442-15\">The will contained the following devise: To my beloved son, Weldon Kenway Clagett, I give the 220 acre River Farm Place in Newton County, Arkansas, together withall [sic] improvements thereon, in fee simple, with the understanding that he shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the property during his lifetime, and that upon his death it shall pass to his surviving child or children equally. <em>In the event that the property </em>or any portion thereof is <em>sold or otherwise disposed of </em>by the said Weldon Kenway Clagett, <em>the proceeds of any such sale shall be divided equally among my other surviving children. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1442-16\">In 1979, the United States condemned a portion of the property. Pursuant to a stipulation, just compensation was fixed at $192,000. Parkhill, who is Weldon Clagett\u2019s sister, argued that the condemnation effected a sale or disposal as contemplated by the will and claimed a one-fifth share. Mary Clagett\u2019s other children, and Weldon Clagett's children, surrendered their interests in the land to Weldon by quitclaim deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-17\">The district court interpreted the will as giving Parkhill a possibility of reverter in the subject land. Parkhill does not contest this characterization. To the extent that Parkhill\u2019s rights can be construed as a possibility of a reverter or other future interest, the established rule is that the compensation for condemnation must be paid to the owner of the defeasible fee without apportionment to the holder of the reversionary interest, unless the event on which the defeasible fee is to terminate is imminent or likely to occur within a reasonably short period of time, independent of the eminent domain proceeding. <em>Woodville v. United States, </em>152 F.2d 735, 737-38 (10th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>328 U.S. 842, 66 S.Ct. 1021, 90 L.Ed. 1617 (1946); <em>United States v. 635.76 Acres of Land, </em>319 F.Supp. 763, 767-68 (W.D.Ark.1970), <em>aff'd, </em>447 F.2d 1405 (8th Cir.1971); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number><em>v. 16 Acres of Land, </em>47 F.Supp. 603, 604 (D.Mass.1942); <em>United States v. 1119.15 Acres of Land, </em>44 F.Supp. 449, 449-50 (E.D.Ill.1942); <em>Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority v. City of St. Joseph, </em>560 S.W.2d 285, 287-88 (Mo.App.1977); Restatement of Property \u00a7 53 (1944). <em>See Midwestern Developments, Inc. v. City of Tulsa, </em>374 F.2d 683, 688 (10th Cir.1967); <em>see also </em>29A C.J.S. <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 199, at 888-90 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\">Applying this rule, the district court considered whether termination of Weldon Clagett\u2019s estate was imminent at the time of condemnation. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-5\">The pivotal question is whether the occurrence of the terminating event \u2014 the sale \u201cor otherwise dispose of the property [\u201d] by Weldon Ken way Clagett \u2014 was probable or imminent as viewed from the time of the commencement of this eminent domain proceeding by the Government. Stated differently, was a sale of Tract 50-106 by Weldon Kenway Clagett sufficiently \u201cimminent\u201d or probable, at the time this action was instituted, to make Doris Ruth Clagett Parkhill\u2019s possibility of reverter a valuable property right for which she is entitled to compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-6\">The prevailing view seems to be that the holder of a possibility of reverter does not possess an interest that is compensable when land is taken by condemnation proceedings for public use unless the event upon which the property is to revert is imminent at the time of the taking [citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-7\">Upon carefully reviewing the record in this proceeding, the Court finds that there is no evidence that the terminating event was imminent. On the contrary, the evidence plainly demonstrates that at the time these proceedings were instituted, the reasonable expectation of all concerned was that the possessary estate of Weldon Kenway Clagett would remain in him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-8\">Weldon Kenway Clagett opposed the condemnation proceedings. He was divested of the lands pursuant to a Court order. Petitioner resided on the lands in question practically all of his lifetime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-10\">The Court concludes and holds that the entire condemnation award belongs entirely to Weldon Kenway Clagett.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-11\">Insofar as Parkhill\u2019s claim is based on a future interest in the. land, the district court\u2019s ruling contained no error of law. Accordingly, we affirm its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-12\">We make the following further observation regarding Parkhill\u2019s rights in the subject property. Under Mary Clagett\u2019s will, no circumstances could exist by which the testatrix\u2019s other children would acquire the land in question. At most, they were entitled to receive payment from the proceeds of a sale. Thus, it appears that the will gave Weldon Clagett a fee simple subject only to a restraint on alienability. <em>See </em>Restatement of Property \u00a7 413(2)(b) (1944). Illustration 3 to comment a of section 413 presents the following hypothetical case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWKL\">A, owning Blackacre in fee simple absolute, makes an otherwise effective conveyance thereof \u201cto B and his heirs, and B covenants for himself, his heirs, executors and assigns that if he ever sells Blackacre, and C is then still alive, he will pay 25% of the sale price to C.\u201d C is in being at the time of the conveyance. The promissory restraint is invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-13\">Although the Parkhill interest may represent a promissory claim rather than a possibility of reverter, we have no reason to discuss this issue because the parties have not presented it on appeal. Appellant has demonstrated no error in the ruling of the trial court; therefore, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
