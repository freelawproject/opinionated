We conclude that in the circumstances of this case there was no such duty and, as a result, affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-18\">The plaintiff, William Freeman, worked for Roadway Express (\u201cRoadway\u201d) until he was discharged on July 29, 1981. The next day, Freeman filed a grievance protesting the discharge. The collective bargaining agreement between Roadway and the defendant union, Local 135, established a grievance-arbitration procedure for handling employer-employee disputes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Freeman\u2019s grievance went through the stages provided in the contract, culminating in a hearing before the grievance committee. The committee \u2014 whose decisions are final and binding under the contract \u2014 ruled unanimously to deny plaintiff\u2019s grievance on September 1, 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-19\">Freeman did not file the instant action until May 25, 1982. The heart of the complaint is that Local 135 acted arbitrarily and in bad faith in refusing or failing to assist plaintiff in requesting relief from the alleged wrongful discharge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Freeman claims that his cause of action did not accrue until December 1, 1981, when the time expired to seek judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s award in an Indiana court. Ind.Code Ann. \u00a7 34-4-2-13(b) (West 1983). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>Local 135 contends that Freeman\u2019s cause of action accrued on September 1, 1981, when the committee rendered its decision, and was therefore untimely; the union argues that it had no duty to bring suit to vacate the award. The parties agree that the relevant statute of limitations is the six-month period provided in \u00a7 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b) (1982). <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">As we read plaintiff\u2019s briefs, he makes two arguments in support of his contention that his cause of action accrued on December 1, 1981 and was therefore not time-barred. First, Freeman asserts that the union violated its duty of fair representation during the grievance procedure and that his discharge did not become final until the time for judicial review elapsed. Second, plaintiff contends that the union\u2019s refusal to file an action to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award was an independent breach of the duty of fair representation. We will address these issues seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">Freeman\u2019s finality argument can be disposed of quickly. The collective bargaining contract provides that the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final. Subject to very limited judicial review, plaintiff is bound by the committee\u2019s ruling. <em>DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2290. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is the final step in the remedies provided by the agreement which an employee is required to exhaust before he or she may bring suit for breach of the contract. <em>Id. </em>We have found no precedent, nor has plaintiff provided any, supporting the proposition that an arbitrator\u2019s award is not final until the time for judicial review has expired. The cases implicitly assume, absent contract provisions to the contrary, that an employee\u2019s discharge is final when the arbitrator has reached a decision. <em>See, e.g., DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2291 n. 16, 2294 (cause. of action accrues when grievance committee\u2019s decision rendered);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ernst v. Indiana Bell Telephone Co., Inc., </em>717 F.2d 1036, 1038 (7th Cir.1983) (claim accrued at end of arbitration), certiorari denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 707, 79 L.Ed.2d 171; <em>Metz v. Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc., </em>715 F.2d 299, 303 (7th Cir.1983) (union\u2019s decision not to file grievance has same finality as arbitration award), certiorari denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 976, 79 L.Ed.2d 214. <em>See also Ranieri v. United Transportation Union, </em>743 F.2d 598, 601 n. 1 (7th Cir. 1984) (employee conceded that duty of fair representation claim. acrued on date of arbitration award). At the time the committee reached its decision, Freeman knew or should have known facts supporting the allegations in his complaint, namely that the union refused or failed to assist plaintiff during the grievance procedure. <em>Metz, </em>715 F.2d at 304. Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action concerning the alleged inadequacy of Local 135\u2019s assistance during the grievance process accrued when the arbitrator reached a final, binding decision. Suit was not brought on this claim within six months of that date and, consequently, was untimely. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-15\">Freeman\u2019s second theory presents a more difficult issue, but one which is no more meritorious than his first argument. Plaintiff contends that the union owed him a duty to file suit to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s allegedly <em>ultra vires </em>award.. A number of courts have considered similar arguments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>In some of these cases, the courts rejected plaintiffs' assertions that the unions acted arbitrarily or in bad faith<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and did not discuss the question whether such a duty existed. <em>See Harris v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., </em>437 F.2d 167, 172 (5th Cir.1971); <em>Acuff v. United Papermakers, </em>404 F.2d 169, 171 n. 4 (5th Cir.1968), certiorari denied, 394 U.S. 987, 89 S.Ct. 1466, 22 L.Ed.2d 762; <em>Capobianco v. Brink\u2019s, Inc., </em>543 F.Supp. 971, 976 (E.D.N.Y.1982), <em>aff'd by unpublished order, </em>722 F.2d 727 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Baker v. R.H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., </em>519 F.Supp. 657, 662 (E.D.N.Y.1981). Other courts have implied that there is no such duty, <em>Crusco v. Fisher &amp; Brother, Inc., </em>458 F.Supp. 413, 422 (S.D.N.Y.1978) (\u201cHaving submitted the dispute to arbitration before an independent decisionmaker, the union was entitled, if not required, to abide by the award\u201d), that there is a duty, <em>Local 1902, Allied Service Division v. Safety Cabs, Inc., </em>414 F.Supp. 64, 66 (M.D.Fla. 1976) (union has duty to prosecute grievance over employer\u2019s contributions to employees\u2019 health and welfare funds through arbitration and to enforce arbitration decision by legal action), or have ignored the issue altogether after it is raised by a discharged employee, <em>Walden v. Local 71, Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>468 F.2d 196, 197 (4th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-9\">Only one court has discussed the issue in detail and concluded that a union has no duty to appeal an arbitrator\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Sear v. Cadillac Automobile Co. of Boston, </em>501 F.Supp. 1350, 1360 (D.Mass. 1980), the court ruled that a union\u2019s bad faith failure to appeal a fairly conducted arbitration is not a breach of the duty of fair representation. On appeal, the First Circuit affirmed, but on a narrower ground. \u201cWhile we need not hold, as did the district court, that a union\u2019s failure to appeal could <em>never </em>breach its representational duty, it is obvious that courts ought to allow such actions, if at all, only in unusual instances where unfairness is blatant.\u201d <em>Sear v. Cadillac Automobile Co. of Boston, </em>654 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir.1981). We conclude \u2014 based on our understanding of the relevant statute, \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor-Management Relations Act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the scope of the duty of fair representation \u2014 that on the facts presented here, the union owed Freeman no duty at all when it decided not to appeal the committee\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">' [5,6] A union\u2019s statutory duty of fair representation is coextensive with its authority under \u00a7 9(a) of the National Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to act as the exclusive representative for the members of the collective bargaining unit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Schneider Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Robbins, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1844, 1851 n. 22, 80 L.Ed.2d 366; <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. Foust, </em>442 U.S. 42, 46 n. 8, 99 S.Ct. 2121, 2125 n. 8, 60 L.Ed.2d 698; <em>Kolinske v. Lubbers, </em>712 F.2d 471, 481 (D.C.Cir.1983). The scope of the duty of fair representation, however, extends no further. If a union does not serve as the exclusive agent for the members of the bargaining unit with respect to a particular matter, there is no corresponding duty of fair representation. <em>Dycus v. NLRB, </em>615 F.2d 820, 827 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Kuhn v. National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, Branch 5, </em>528 F.2d 767, 770 (8th Cir.1976). \u201c[A] union ... can be held to represent employees <em>unfairly </em>only in regard to those matters as to which it represents them at all \u2014 namely, \u2018rates of pay, wages, hours ... or other conditions of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local No. 310 v. NLRB, </em>587 F.2d 1176, 1183 (D.C.Cir.1978) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">When a labor contract provides, as many do, that the processing of employee-employer disputes under the grievance-arbitration procedure is to be handled solely by the union, individual employees are required to follow the contract\u2019s commands; they cannot seek redress on their own. <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, </em>379 U.S. 650, 652-653, 85 S.Ct. 614, 616, 13 L.Ed.2d 580. Instead, the individual\u2019s rights are protected by the union\u2019s duty of fair representation. The union is obligated to \u201cserve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any, to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct.\u201d <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 177, 87 S.Ct. 903, 910. If, however, a particular form of redress is not relegated to the exclusive domain of the union, an individual employee is free to seek that avenue. <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, </em>379 U.S. at 657-58, 85 S.Ct. at 619, 13 L.Ed.2d 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-10\">In this case, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the collective bargaining agreement gives the union the exclusive right to seek judicial review to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award. Accordingly, Freeman had the right to file suit to set aside the committee\u2019s decision as long as he exhausted the contract\u2019s grievance procedures and alleged that Local 135 breached its duty of fair representation during the arbitration process. <em>FW. Woolworth Co. v. Miscellaneous Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local No. 781, </em>629 F.2d 1204, 1210 (7th Cir.1980), certiorari denied, 451 U.S. 937, 101 S.Ct. 2016, 68 L.Ed.2d 324. If Freeman wanted to appeal the award, he was at liberty to do so; having exhausted the remedies provided by the contract, he had individual access to remedies outside of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight Inc., </em>424 U.S. 554, 567, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 1058, 47 L.Ed.2d 231. Once the arbitrator denied plaintiff\u2019s grievance, the rationale for the duty of fair representation evaporated; Freeman no longer needed the protections provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>the duty of fair representation because he had access to extra-contractual remedies. That being the case, the union owed plaintiff no duty in deciding whether to seek judicial review of the committee\u2019s ruling because, with respect to that decision, it was not acting as his exclusive representative. The union was under no duty to provide Freeman with more legal assistance than bargained for in the contract or required by law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">In addition, a decision for plaintiff \u2014 ruling that Local 135 may have breached its duty of fair representation by not appealing the arbitrator\u2019s decision \u2014 would be inconsistent with the policies underlying federal labor law. Such a holding would probably encourage more employees\u2019 fair representation actions against unions and more suits seeking judicial review of arbitrators\u2019 awards. The result would undermine the presumption of- finality that is accorded arbitrators\u2019 decisions, <em>see W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, </em>461 U.S. 757, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2182, 76 L.Ed.2d 298; <em>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., </em>424 U.S. at 562-63, 96 S.Ct. at 1055, \u201cpreclude the relatively rapid final resolution of labor disputes favored by federal law,\u201d <em>DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2292, and perhaps weaken reliance on the arbitration process by employers and unions. \u201c[T]he advantages of grievance arbitration \u2014 the informal, speedy, inexpensive <em>nonjudicial </em>settlement of disputes\u201d \u2014 might be eroded. <em>Sear v. Cadillac Automobile Co. v. Boston, </em>654 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir.1981). Moreover, to the extent that the time for seeking judicial review of arbitrators\u2019 awards varies from state to state, there would be a lack of uniformity as to when an employee\u2019s cause of action accrues. <em>See DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2294, <em>quoting United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 70, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 1568, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (Stewart, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">The union had no obligation to appeal the arbitrator\u2019s award. Whatever claim Freeman had against Local 135 with respect to the duty of fair representation accrued on September 1, 1981. This suit, therefore, is untimely and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-10\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to file within the statute of limitations is affirmed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">. Our knowledge of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement is sketchy at best. Plaintiffs appendix contains only part of the complaint, one paragraph of which includes excerpts from the agreement. Defendant\u2019s brief contains several assertions about the agreement, none of which are challenged by Freeman. The record is of no help: plaintiff has filed only a short record in this court and it contains no information about the collective bargaining contract. Consequently, our statements about the agreement are derived from the portion of the complaint found in plaintiffs appendix and the information in defendant\u2019s brief. If our summary of the contract\u2019s provisions is less than complete, plaintiff-appellant bears the responsibility for not assembling an adequate record for this court to review. <em>In re UNR Industries, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 1136, 1138 n. 3 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Casualty Indemnity Exchange v. Village of Crete, </em>731 F.2d 457, 460 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1396-20\">. The parties refer to the committee\u2019s decision as an arbitrator\u2019s award. Apparently, the contract provides that grievances are arbitrated by a committee consisting of an equal number of union and industry representatives. In this opinion, we use the appellations \"committee\u201d and \"arbitrator\u201d interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1396-21\">. Plaintiff claims that his discharge was wrongful because Roadway\u2019s notice of discharge was improper. Plaintiff contends that he received the notice eleven days after the date of the notice. Because the contract provides that grievances about discharges must be filed within ten days from the date of the notice, the committee denied Freeman\u2019s grievance as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">. In <em>DelCostello, </em>the Supreme Court remanded one of the cases for consideration of a tolling argument. 103 S.Ct. at 2294-95. Freeman does not argue that the statute of limitations should be tolled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">. In <em>DelCostello, </em>the Court stated that it may not be easy to determine when an employee\u2019s cause of action accrues. 103 S.Ct. at 2291 n. 16. The Court noted, however, that application of a statute of limitations \u201cseems straightforward enough when a grievance has run its full course, culminating in a formal award by a neutral arbitrator,\" <em>id., </em>suggesting that the statute begins running at the time the award is handed down. Moreover, the Court followed this approach in deciding whether petitioners\u2019 suits were timely. <em>Id. </em>at 2294.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">. \u201cA breach of the statutory duty of fair representation occurs only when a union\u2019s conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\" <em>Vaca v.

In two of this court\u2019s opinions, there have been intimations that a duty of fair representation claim could conceivably be based on a union\u2019s failure to appeal an arbitrator\u2019s award, <em>Ranieri v. United Transportation Union, </em>743 F.2d 598, 601 n. 1 (7th Cir.1984), or a union's decision not to appeal a district court order overturning an arbitration award, <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. v.

In neither case, however, did we do anything more than raise the possibility that such a claim might theoretically be stated. We did not decide, or even analyze, the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">.

Unlike <em>Sear, </em>Freeman has alleged that the union breached its duty of fair representation in the grievance-arbitration process.

There is no basis for the union's request that this court impose attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against Freeman, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, for filing a frivolous appeal. As we stated at the outset, this case presents an issue not decided previously in this circuit. Although it is true that plaintiff cited no cases in support of his contention that the union had a duty to appeal the grievance committee\u2019s decision, his position on the issue is not unreasonable. Moreover, there is no indication of subjective bad faith on the part of plaintiffs attorney. <em>See Suslick v. Rothschild Securities Corp., </em>741 F.2d 1000, 1006 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Gilles v.
