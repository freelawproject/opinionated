The district court struck down most of the regulations, and modified the others, in an unpublished opinion of 26 April 1984. On appeal the plaintiff-appellees and intervenors contend that the district court\u2019s findings are not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and that this court should defer to those findings in what is essentially a factual dispute. The government, as defendant-appellant, urges reinstatement of the original regulations. It defends the regulations as reasonable time, place and manner restrictions which further substantial governmental interests, most notably the security of the President and the aesthetics of the White House view. We agree with the latter position and uphold the regulations as originally written.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-4\">The restrictions embodied in the regulations are of three types. The first set governs the size, construction, and placement of signs on the White House sidewalk. The primary purpose of the sign restrictions is to prevent signs from being used as weapons, as concealment for explosives, or as a means of breaching the White House fence. In light of recent Supreme Court cases which clarify the role of judicial review in the first amendment context, we conclude that the sign restrictions are reasonable as originally drafted. A second type of regulation restricts, but does not prohibit, demonstrations within the \u201ccenter zone\u201d of the sidewalk. We conclude that this restriction, too, is constitutional as a reasonable means of regulating the place of demonstrations. The government\u2019s interest in preserving a relatively unobstructed view of the White House for tourists and passersby constitutes a legitimate aesthetic goal which is not outweighed by the insubstantial infringement on the demonstrators\u2019 ability to engage in expressive activities. Moreover, while unrestricted access to the center zone might provide demonstrators with optimal media exposure, appellees have no first amendment <em>right </em>to such exposure. The third type of regulation prohibits the placing of parcels, except momentarily, on the sidewalk. Such activity has no expressive content; at most, it may be said to facilitate expression. It is unclear whether the facilitative activity proscribed here implicates the first amendment. Even if it does, however, the parcels restriction is constitutional as a reasonable restriction on the manner in which speech may be exercised; it is narrowly tailored to prevent the concealment of explosive devices within parcels left unattended on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-11\">In late 1982 representatives of the National Park Service, the Park Police, the Secret Service and the Department of Justice met to consider ways of protecting the White House and its occupants from terrorist attack.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The need for increased presidential security had been tragically illustrated by the events of 8 December 1982, when Norman Mayer, a regular protestor on the White House sidewalk, was killed by police officers after threatening to blow up the Washington Monument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the agencies reviewed existing regulations and drafted new ones,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> terrorist activity continued at an alarming rate both at home<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and abroad.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>The National Park Service published interim regulations on 22 April 1983;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they were to become effective immediately.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The regulations required that signs and placards displayed on the White House sidewalk<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> be hand-held by individuals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, they prohibited the deposit of parcels on the sidewalk for longer than one hour and provided that parcels placed on the sidewalk were subject to inspection by police officers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1599-5\">On 27 April officers of the United States Park Police arrested three long-time protestors on the White House sidewalk<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for failing to comply with the interim regulations. Those arrested, along with other regular White House demonstrators, filed suit in U.S. District Court two days later seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the regulations infringed their first amendment rights of free expression.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Following an evidentiary hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, Judge William B. Bryant concluded that the Park Service had failed to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for dispensing with the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> when it issued the interim regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He enjoined enforcement of the regulations pending publication of a final rule.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1599-12\">The Park Service complied immediately. It republished the regulations as a proposed rulemaking on 17 May 1983, with a public comment period extending to 31 May.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Service received fifteen comments, seven of which supported the regulations as proposed and eight of which opposed some portion of them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Service studied the comments, modified its interim regulations and published a \u201cfinal rule\u201d on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>17 June 1983.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiffs amended their complaint seven days later to take account of the new provisions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1600-4\">The regulations impose three types of restrictions on activities conducted on the White House sidewalk. The first set of provisions governs the construction, size and placement of signs carried by demonstrators and other individuals. Signs must be constructed of cardboard, posterboard or cloth, while sign supports must be made of wood.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Signs can be no larger than three feet in height,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> twenty feet in length, and one-quarter inch in thickness, while sign supports must have cross-sectional dimensions of no greater than three-quarters of an inch.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> All signs on the sidewalk must be \u201cattended,\u201d a requirement which is met only if the sign is in physical contact with a person.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Stationary signs may be no closer than three feet to the White House fence,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and no sign may be leaned against or attached to the fence or other structure on the sidewalk.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1600-5\">A second type of restriction concerns the \u201ccenter zone,\u201d an area defined as the central twenty yards of the sidewalk.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Within the center zone, signs may not be held, placed or set down, but \u201cindividuals may demonstrate while carrying signs ... if they continue to move along the sidewalk.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1600-10\">The third type of restriction prohibits the deposit of parcels and other property on the ground. An exception is made for items which are \u201cmomentarily placed or set down in the immediate presence of the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1600-11\">The Park Service prefaced its final regulations with a concise explanation of the governmental interests they were designed to serve. Those interests were threefold: \u201cto minimize potential threats to the [White House] and its occupants and visitors ... to provide opportunities to the visitor to view the White House, and to maintain the free flow of pedestrian and emergency traffic.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Service described in detail the manner in which its regulations were designed to accomplish those ends; in doing so, it relied on its own experience as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number>well as that of other federal agencies charged with the protection of the White House and its grounds. The Park Service discussed at length the objections which various commentators had registered to the interim regulations, and it noted modifications which it had made in the regulations to take account of criticisms it found valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-5\">Following an evidentiary hearing the district court entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of many of the restrictions on 19 July 1983.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In the court\u2019s view, \u201cthe governmental interests served by the regulations could be attained through alternative means which are less intrusive on first amendment freedoms.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The court proceeded to \u201cfinetune\u201d the regulations: not only did it uphold some restrictions and reject others, it modified the content of individual provisions by substituting its factual judgment for that of the agency. The court approved the twenty foot limit on the length of signs, but created a special exception for those held parallel to the fence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It endorsed the concept of restricting sign and parcel placement, but held that the \u201cphysical contact\u201d requirement for signs and the prohibition on parcel placement were unnecessarily restrictive.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In their place, the court fashioned a rule which allowed signs and parcels to be placed on the sidewalk if they were \u201cattended at all times,\u201d with \u201cattendance\u201d defined to mean \u201cin the immediate presence of the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The court approved without modification only three provisions: the restriction on sign materials,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the center zone restriction,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and the absolute prohibition on the placement of <em>structures </em>on the sidewalk.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1601-12\">The government appealed the district court\u2019s order, and its appeal was heard on an expedited basis. In a brief <em>per curiam </em>opinion this court modified the preliminary injunction to take greater account of the government\u2019s interest in presidential security.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> It noted that review of a preliminary injunction ordinarily proceeds under the abuse-of-discretion standard,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> but that an appellate court has greater authority to modify such an injunction where the security of the President is at stake.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The modifications which this court undertook to make, however, were of the same genre as-those which the district court itself had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>made earlier.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> An \u201cattended\u201d sign was now defined as one \u201cwithin three feet of the person responsible for controlling it\u201d;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> no explanation was given for the arbitrary three-foot figure and no attempt was made to define \u201ccontrol.\u201d Signs could be leaned against, or placed within three feet of, the White House fence, but the district court was instructed to set a limit \u201cas to the size, number, and spacing\u201d of such signs.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Hollow metal tubes were to be permitted as sign supports, but only if their ends were \u201cpermanently secured.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The parcels restriction was allowed to stand, but plaintiffs were permitted to request an exemption for \u201ca reasonable inventory of pamphlets, leaflets and similar writings.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1602-4\">This court\u2019s modifications only applied to the preliminary injunction; they did not preclude <em>de novo </em>consideration of the merits.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> On 23 August the district court modified its order to take account of this court\u2019s decision and set the case for trial on an expedited basis.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1602-11\">At trial the court heard testimony from more than twenty witnesses. Among those who testified for the government were several Secret Service and Park Police officials with special expertise in the field of White House security.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Those officials testified at length as to the security rationales underlying each regulation; they emphasized the need to anticipate ingenious and unprecedented forms of terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-12\">On 26 April 1984, the district court issued the decision and order appealed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>here.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It invalidated virtually all of the restrictions on the ground that they did not advance the government\u2019s interest in security. In order to prevail, the court wrote, \u201cthe government must show at least a <em>probable danger </em>to the security of the President and the White House created by the plaintiffs\u2019 activities. That is to say, it must establish a nexus between the activity it would proscribe and a threat to presidential security.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The court found that the demonstrators\u2019 activities posed no <em>direct </em>threat to the safety of the President.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Despite the fact that \u201csecurity measures should be predicated on a \u2018better safe than sorry\u2019 premise,\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> the court described the challenged regulations as \u201ctotally ineffective\u201d and \u201cdemonstrably too restrictive.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Its analysis of individual provisions was equally conclusory. The ban on wooden signs was \u201cunjustified,\u201d and any testimony to the contrary was \u201cincredible.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The requirement that protestors maintain physical contact with their signs, and the prohibition on stationary signs within three feet of the fence, was \u201coppressive.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The government\u2019s fear that terrorists might conceal explosives or rockets inside hollow metal supports was \u201cgrossly exaggerated.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The center zone restriction was \u201cnot justified on any score,\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> while a flat ban on the deposit of parcels was \u201cclearly overbroad and unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1603-16\">Having concluded that the regulations as originally written were in violation of the first amendment,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the district court proceeded to reject some provisions and to rewrite others. The government had argued that <em>\u201c[United States v. </em>] <em>O\u2019Brien </em>[391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968) ] does not contemplate ad hoc regulatory supervision by the courts over the details of an administrative scheme, and that in fact, the Supreme Court has warned that \u2018[t]he logic of ... elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all [regulatory] powers\u2019 <em>(United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 557, n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3082, n. 12, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976).\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The district court rejected the applicability of <em>MartinezFuerte. </em>Because that case dealt with the fourth amendment\u2019s protection against un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>reasonable searches and seizures, the court concluded that it did not state the standard of judicial scrutiny to be applied in first amendment cases. As a matter of \u201cconstitutional necessity,\u201d courts should engage in a much more stringent review of governmental action when first amendment interests are at stake.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1604-4\">The court permanently enjoined the enforcement of every provision as written except for the one-quarter inch limitation on the thickness of signs.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The requirement that signs be attended and the restriction on the deposit of parcels also survived, but in significantly different form from that which the agency had adopted. Signs were considered \u201cattended\u201d when they were within five feet of the person controlling them.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Parcels were permitted on the sidewalk when they were within the \u201cimmediate presence\u201d of the owner; the same five-foot rule was to be applied in determining \u201cimmediate presence.\u201d <footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1604-5\">The government appealed to this court. While the case was pending and before oral argument the Supreme Court decided two cases of major import for the reasonable restriction of free speech within public fora.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> It is primarily our responsibility on this appeal to determine what significance these and other recent Supreme Court decisions have for the regulation of demonstrations on the White House sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-16\">II. The Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-17\">Certain types of places are so vital to a healthy and robust public discourse that they are accorded special status under the first amendment. The government cannot constitutionally prohibit all expressive activities in these public fora;<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> access to them is a small but invaluable part of every American\u2019s heritage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-18\">The public sidewalk here is one such forum.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Sidewalks, like streets and parks, are places whose title has \u201cimmemorially been held in trust for the use of the public.\u201d <footnotemark>68</footnotemark> As such, they occupy a privileged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>position in the hierarchy of first amendment jurisprudence.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1605-4\">The government is not precluded, however, from <em>regulating </em>expressive activities conducted on the White House sidewalk.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> It may adopt reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions on the exercise of free speech, so long as the restrictions are content-neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1605-5\">The regulations challenged here are clearly not based \u201cupon either the content or subject matter of speech.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> There is nothing in the text or the history of the regulations to suggest that one group\u2019s viewpoint is to be preferred at the expense of others. They meet the test of being content-neutral. Appellees contend that the Park Service has <em>applied </em>the regulations in a discriminatory fashion, favoring demonstrators who espouse Administration views and disfavoring those with contrary positions, but we find the evidence for such discrimination speculative and unpersuasive. The government has offered cogent explanations for the handful of instances in which the regulations were applied unevenly; we conclude that those aberrations were the product of happenstance and unavoidable circumstances rather than of improper motives. Needless to say, no court will tolerate any attempt to discriminate among protestors on the basis of viewpoint or subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-14\">Nor do we believe that the purpose underlying the regulations was to ban speech entirely. Appellees direct our attention to a memorandum, dated 13 January 1983, from then-Seeretary of the Interior James Watt to an aide, Moody Tidwell. Watt requested \u201ca briefing on the regulations that allow demonstrations and protestors in Lafayette Park and in front of the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. My intention is to prohibit such activities and require that they take place on the Ellipse.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> In March 1983 Watt received a briefing from the principal drafter of the new regulations and told him to \u201ckeep up the good work.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1605-15\">On the circumstances existing during the relevant time here, a strong argument could have been made that a regulation banning all demonstrations on the White House sidewalk and in Lafayette Park would have been unconstitutional.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> But .the institution of a total ban is not the approach the Park Service took; indeed, it is one the Service explicitly <em>rejected. </em>In its preamble to the final regulations, the Service stated that \u201clegal precedent in the District of Columbia Circuit would prevent prohibiting demonstrations altogether on the White House sidewalk.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> More relevant now may be recent precedent in the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> but, whether currently accurate as a statement of law or not, this is but one of several indications that the Park Service dealt with constitutional values with scrupulous care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1528\">*1528</page-number>The regulations also clearly satisfy the constitutional requirement that they leave open ample alternative channels of communication. Demonstrators on the sidewalk are free to engage in a rich variety of expressive activities: they may picket, march, hand out leaflets, carry signs, sing, shout, chant, perform dramatic presentations, solicit signatures for petitions, and appeal to passersby. The content of the message they espouse is theirs and theirs alone; they may express views and employ verbal formulae that would be punished as seditious libel, blasphemy or obscenity in less free societies. Although they may not engage in <em>stationary </em>protest within the center zone of the sidewalk, they are in no way precluded from engaging in other forms of expression there, and they may stand still on the remaining 93% of the sidewalk. Should they find the government\u2019s regulations too restrictive they may always carry their demonstration immediately across Pennsylvania Avenue to Lafayette Park. In short, the regulations leave unaffected a multitude of possibilities for meaningful protest on the sidewalk and within a few yards in adjoining areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-4\">The regulations also clearly serve a \u201csubstantial governmental interest.\u201d No one can deny the substantiality or the significance of America\u2019s interest in presidential security.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> At stake is not merely the safety of one man, but also the ability of the executive branch to function in an orderly fashion and the capacity of the United States to respond to threats and crises affecting the entire free world. Nor is the interest in pedestrian safety and traffic insubstantial; the value of sidewalks as public fora would be considerably vitiated were the state unable to provide for the orderly passage of those persons who use them.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Finally, the government has a substantial interest in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment; aesthetics are a proper focus of governmental regulation.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1606-10\">As in most \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d cases, the decisive inquiry here is as to the requisite narrowness of the means employed by the government to advance its substantial interests.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Appellees contend that this is primarily a factual matter, and that an appellate court should refrain from overturning the decision of the trial court unless that decision is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Furthermore, appellees suggest that a trial court has the power to substitute its factual judgment for that of an agency where the agency has chosen not to adopt the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d regulatory alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-11\">We reject both contentions. The issue for decision on this appeal is not factual, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>is legal: did the Park Service draft regulations that were \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest\u201d? The <em>agency </em>in this case was the institution charged with the principal resolution of factual issues; the court\u2019s role was limited to determining whether the regulations which the agency adopted were within the boundaries of constitutionality prescribed by the first amendment. If they were, it is not the province of the court to \u201cfinetune\u201d the regulations so as to institute the single regulatory option the court personally considers most desirable. Courts possess no particular expertise in the drafting of regulatory measures;<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> their role is to uphold regulations which are constitutional and to strike down those which are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-5\">Our analysis is informed by recent Supreme Court interpretations of the \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d requirement. In <em>Clark v. Community for Creative </em>Non-Violence<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> the Court upheld a Park Service regulation which prohibited camping in certain parks in Washington, D.C. The Service had used the regulation to deny plaintiffs\u2019 request for permission to sleep in Lafayette Park and the Mall as part of a vigil symbolizing the plight of the homeless in America. This court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>held by a six to five vote that application of the regulations so as to prevent sleeping in the parks would infringe the demonstrators\u2019 first amendment rights.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1607-6\">The Supreme Court reversed.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Assuming but not deciding that sleep may be an expressive activity,<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> it noted the substantiality of the government\u2019s interest. in \u201cmaintaining the parks in the heart of our capital in an attractive and intact condition.\u201d <footnotemark>88</footnotemark> It concluded that the Park Service regulation was a reasonable restriction on the time, place and manner of speech.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> In doing so it criticized the majority of this court for second-guessing the Park Service\u2019s judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1607-12\">We are unmoved by the Court of Appeals\u2019 view that the challenged regulation is unnecessary, and hence invalid, because there are less speech-restrictive alternatives that could have satisfied the government interest in preserving park lands. There is no gain-saying that preventing overnight sleeping will avoid a measure of actual or threatened damage to Lafayette Park and the Mall. The Court of Appeals\u2019 suggestion that the Park Service minimize the possible injury by reducing the size, duration, or frequency of demonstrations would still curtail the total allowable expression in which demonstrators could engage, whether by sleeping or otherwise, and these suggestions represent no more than a disagreement with the Park Service over how much protection the core parks require or how an acceptable level of preservation is to be attained. We do not believe, however, that either <em>United States v.

Time, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>91</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court considered a federal statute which made criminal the publication of photographs of United States currency in color or within a specified size range. The Court upheld the color and size requirements as reasonable restrictions on speech.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> In doing so Justice White and a plurality of the Court again rejected the notion that courts may arbitrarily substitute their judgment for that of legislative or administrative institutions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1608-5\">Time contends that although the color restriction serves the Government\u2019s interest in preventing counterfeiting, it is nonetheless invalid because it is not narrow enough. Time asserts that the color restriction applies to an illustration of currency regardless of its capacity to deceive and is thus broader than is necessary to achieve the Government\u2019s interest in preventing counterfeiting. However, Time places too narrow a construction on the Government\u2019s interest and too heavy a burden on those enacting time, place, and manner regulations____ It is ... sufficiently evident that the color limitation serves the Government\u2019s interest in a substantial way. That the limitations may apply. to some photographs that are themselves of no use to counterfeiters does not invalidate the legislation. \u25a0 The less-restrictive-alternative analysis invoked by Time has never been a part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place, and manner regulation. It is enough that the color restriction substantially serves the Government\u2019s legitimate ends.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1608-15\">Justice Stevens expressed a similar view in his concurrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1608-16\">It may well be, as Time argues, that \u201cCongress can do a much better job in preventing counterfeiting than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>present \u00a7 474 and \u00a7 504,\u201d Br. for Appellee 46. The question for us, of course, is not whether Congress could have done a better job, but whether the job it did violates Time\u2019s right to free expression. It does not____<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1609-4\"><em>Clark v. CCNV </em>and <em>Regan v. Time </em>clarify the respective institutional roles of administrators and judges. The expertise of administrators lies in selecting policy goals and in devising techniques with which to pursue them. In the course of performing their twin roles administrators consider evidence which is predominantly factual in nature. Such inquiries, however, seldom lead to a single, determinate result. More often they suggest a number of feasible alternatives, each of which is capable of accomplishing the agency\u2019s goals within acceptable parameters of accuracy and effectiveness. Where a regulation restricts the time, place or manner of speech, however, feasibility is not enough: the regulation must also satisfy the first amendment requirement that it be \u201cnarrowly tailored.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s test defines a subset of regulatory options which are both feasible <em>and </em>constitutional; it is within this zone of constitutionality that agencies are permitted to exercise discretion in selecting regulatory initiatives.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1609-10\">The expertise of courts lies in determining whether an agency\u2019s decision is within the zone of constitutionality, not in choosing between options within that zone.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> A court may not require that the agency adopt the \u201cleast restrictive alternative,\u201d thereby substituting its judgment for that of the regulators.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> In short, if the regulation lies within the zone prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>by the first amendment it is constitutional and must be affirmed as such by a court before which it is challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-4\">We turn, then, to an examination of the individual regulatory measures adopted by the Park Service, bearing in mind that the expertise of several federal agencies, including that of the Secret Service, contributed to their content.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-5\">III. The Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-6\">A. <em>Sign Restrictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1610-7\">The first set of regulatory provisions governs the construction, size and use of signs carried on the White House sidewalk. They prohibit persons from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-8\">a. leaning or attaching signs against the fence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-9\">b. demonstrating with signs that are not \u201cattended,\u201d with attendance defined as the maintenance of physical contact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-10\">c. holding stationary signs closer than three feet to the fence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-12\">el. holding signs not made of cardboard, posterboard or cloth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-13\">e. holding signs larger than three feet in height, twenty feet in length, and one-quarter inch in thickness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-14\">f. using sign supports not made of wood with cross-sections larger than three-quarters of an inch by three-quarters of an inch.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1610-15\">The district court permanently enjoined the enforcement of all but two of the sign provisions. It upheld the one-quarter inch limitation on the thickness of signs;<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> it also approved the requirement that signs be \u201cattended,\u201d but redefined \u201cattendance\u201d to mean \u201cwithin 5 feet of the persons responsible for controlling them.\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Appellees defend the trial court\u2019s modification; appellants urge us to reinstate the original language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-16\">While the Park Service advanced other governmental interests as a justification for the sign provisions,<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> it is clear that the principal interest they are designed to serve is that of presidential security. This court has described the safety of the Presi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1533\">*1533</page-number>dent as a \u201cparamount interest\u201d;<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> we have held that the protection of the White House and its occupants justifies \u201ca greater limitation than would be applicable generally to use of public streets and parks.\u201d <footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5F\">Just as the White House area is a \u201cunique situs\u201d for first amendment activity,<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> it is also a unique situs for considerations of presidential and national security. Despite the significant amount of time modern Presidents spend travelling, they and their families are in residence at the White House far more than they are away. Not only the President, but the Vice-President, the White House Chief of Staff and other high Administration officials have their offices in the Mansion. The White House is the nerve center for America\u2019s national security network, with facilities for coordinating the activities of American diplomats, intelligence agents and military personnel around the globe. Indeed, it is not surprising that the \u201chot line\u201d and the Situation Room, both located within the Mansion, have become two of the most evocative symbols of national security in an increasingly dangerous age of nuclear tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-6\">For a structure of such obvious significance to presidential and national security, the White House is singularly exposed to potential terrorist attack. It is located in the middle of a densely populated metropolitan area. A major thoroughfare, Pennsylvania Avenue, runs alongside the White House sidewalk, while busy E Street bounds the Mansion\u2019s lawn to the south. Although airplanes are legally prohibited from flying over the White House, the presence of the National Airport flyway a mile to the west presents a latent security danger. So, too, does the construction of tall office buildings within a few blocks of the Mansion.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-12\">In short, the need for effective security in the vicinity of the White House is great, but the geographical position of the Mansion renders it inherently insecure. Several federal agencies have brought considerable experience and expertise to bear on the problem of White House security; the regulations challenged here are but one fruit of their endeavors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-13\">Considered as part of a larger effort to safeguard the Mansion and its occupants, the sign provisions clearly represent an appropriate means of promoting the substantial governmental interest at stake. They are narrowly tailored to avert specific forms of terrorism.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Thus, the size limitations are designed to ensure that activities occurring on the sidewalk are not obstructed from police view. The interest at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number>stake is one which cannot be promoted solely through the assignment of additional police officers to the sidewalk: no matter how large the police presence, large signs make observation and communication among officers more difficult. The requirement that signs be constructed of nonrigid materials is designed to prevent them from being used to scale the White House fence, or turned upon police-officers or other demonstrators as weapons. The restriction on the composition of sign <em>supports </em>similarly prevents their use as weapons, either in hand-to-hand struggle or as a means of launching projectiles. The prohibition on the leaning of signs against the White House fence ensures that terrorists will not be able to hide explosives or other deadly objects in the triangular area between the sign and the fence ledge. Finally, the requirement that a demonstrator maintain physical contact with his or her sign is another means of ensuring that signs are not turned into weapons or used to conceal dangerous items.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">The measures adopted by the Park Service are clearly not the <em>only </em>means by which that agency could have sought to deter illegal activity on the sidewalk. There may even be options the Service rejected which would have promoted its interests in a more effective fashion. We are not at liberty, however, to replace the agency\u2019s judgment with our own. It is sufficient that the means selected be \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d: that they lie within the range of feasible options the agency was constitutionally permitted to consider. The sign provisions clearly satisfy this element of the time, place and manner test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-8\">B. <em>Center Zone Restriction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1612-9\">The challenged regulations provide in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-10\">No signs or placards shall be held, placed or set down on the center portion of the White House sidewalk, comprising ten yards on either side of the center point on the sidewalk; Provided, however, that individuals may demonstrate while carrying signs on that portion of the sidewalk if they continue to move along the sidewalk.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1612-11\">The asserted governmental interest in imposing additional restrictions for demonstrations within the \u201ccenter zone\u201d is that of preserving unimpaired the public\u2019s view of the Presidential Mansion from Pennsylvania Avenue and Lafayette Park.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> No considerations of security or safety are at stake; the governmental interest derives wholly from aesthetic concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-12\">It is well established that the government\u2019s power to regulate private affairs encompasses the power to promote aesthetic goals.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> While judgments based on aesthetic considerations are inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1535\">*1535</page-number>more subjective than other types of decisions, they nonetheless reflect values of great significance in everyday life. A decision to ban all billboards from a residential neighborhood may be as important to the people who live there as the assignment of additional police officers to the area; the presentation of an historic building<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> may do more to enhance the quality of life in a city than the construction of a new freeway.</p>\n<p id=\"AkCj\">Recent decisions of the Supreme Court establish that aesthetic considerations may justify otherwise reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on speech.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Re-cause the interests at stake are inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>subjective, however, they must be \u201ccarefully scrutinized to determine if they are only a public rationalization of an impermissible purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">We are convinced that the restriction challenged here does not mask constitutionally improper motives. Three factors are relevant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">First, the government has regulated for the benefit of the <em>public </em>rather than for the promotion of its own aesthetic preferences. It is the view <em>of </em>the White House, <em>not from </em>it, which is being preserved. Whatever would be our ruling in the latter case, the purpose of the regulation here is clearly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-6\">In order to establish the constitutionality of an aesthetic regulation of speech, the government must show that the regulation was enacted for purposes other than the effectuation of its drafters\u2019 personal tastes. Some resort must be had to societal preferences. To be sure, the preference ultimately embraced need not be that held by a majority of the populace. The government is entitled to rely on the expert judgment of artists, architects, urban planners, design consultants, historians, and other professionals; it is not limited to the prevailing style, but may embrace the innovative and the avantgarde. The aesthetic judgment it makes need not sit well with all citizens, for the debate sparked by an unconventional choice often leads to a richer and more complex appreciation of what is aesthetically pleasing.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> In short, the government need not endorse that which is popular or prevalent, but it must always act on society\u2019s behalf rather than its own.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1614-13\">Arbitrariness or capriciousness in the selection of aesthetic goals may indicate the presence of an impermissible motive either to enact the preferences of individual government officials or to burden unreasonably the exercise of free speech.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> A requirement that all signs carried on the White House sidewalk be of a certain color, for example, would be suspect because it appears to serve no legitimate social interest in aesthetics. For similar reasons the center zone restriction would be suspect were it shown that the public regards the presence of stationary signs directly in front of the White House as aesthetically pleasing. This in essence is what appellees argue; they contend that for many tourists the \u201cWhite House experience\u201d includes the presence of stationary demonstrations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>the center portion of the sidewalk. This may be true, although <em>why </em>signs in the center zone as well as for more than a hundred yards on either side are essential for some visitors\u2019 \u201cWhite House experience\u201d has not been explained. As the public comments reveal, however, <em>many other </em>tourists believe that the proliferation of stationary signs within the center zone substantially detracts from their ability to view the White House and its grounds. The Park Service was therefore required to choose between two conflicting views of what is aesthetically pleasing.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> Its decision to preserve twenty yards of the White House sidewalk was not unreasonable; the Service could conclude that most Americans share the latter aesthetic preference, and that stationary protests block more of the White House view than do mobile ones.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Far from being arbitrary, the Service\u2019s decision represented an exercise of informed discretion based upon what a sizable portion of society regarded as aesthetically significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-8\">The second factor we must consider in assessing the center zone restriction is the <em>extent </em>to which it burdens speech. The more restrictive an aesthetic regulation, the closer a court must look to determine if it is based on constitutionally improper motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-9\">The center zone restriction burdens speech only in an indirect and insubstantial way. Protestors are free to engage in a wide variety of expressive activities within the center zone; they are only precluded while there from engaging in stationary protest. The center zone occupies no more than seven percent of the total length of the sidewalk; protestors may remain stationary along any portion of the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-10\">Appellees contend, however, that the regulation makes it more difficult for them to attract media attention to their cause. They assert that the center zone of the sidewalk is a particularly evocative site for symbolic protest, and that stationary demonstrations there are given preferential coverage by the news media. To deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>them the opportunity to engage in such protest, they argue, is to deny them effective access to the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">We find appellees\u2019 contentions unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the government introduced into evidence several photographs which show that the Mansion can clearly be seen from non-central locations on the sidewalk. Second, and more importantly, our caselaw does not recognize a constitutional right to attract media attention to one\u2019s cause. As this court stated in <em>Vietnam Veterans Against the War v. Morton,</em><footnotemark><em>119</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cWhat the litigant\u2019s press agent seeks and what the public interest requires differ widely. Although every man is entitled to make his remonstrance, no man is entitled to make such a remonstrance that it will be carried on all three television networks.\u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">The final consideration relevant to our analysis is that the center zone restriction is not an <em>isolated </em>attempt to regulate the aesthetics of the White House view. If it were we might engage in a more searching inquiry to ensure that the agency has regulated for genuinely aesthetic reasons and not for the purpose of curtailing protected expression. The regulation here, however, is but one element of a continuing effort by the Park Service to preserve and enhance the view of the White House for tourists and passersby. The White House and its grounds are maintained year-round in a scrupulously manicured condition; indeed, only this summer the north facade of the Mansion underwent extensive restoration. The White House lawn is designed and maintained such that tourists on the sidewalk are afforded an excellent view of the Mansion. The fence which separates the sidewalk from the White House grounds is designed to facilitate rather than obstruct that view. It is obvious that the Park Service has promoted, in a <em>number </em>of ways, the ability of Americans to enjoy the beauty of the White House and its grounds. The center zone restriction is only one example of the Service\u2019s commitment to aesthetic values and their effective implementation.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-12\">We find no evidence that the center zone restriction was enacted for any purpose other than the preservation and enhancement of the White House view for tourists and passersby. Because the Park Service based its aesthetic judgment on societal preferences rather than the preferences of individual officials, because the regulation it adopted is not unduly restrictive of free expression, and because the regulation constitutes part of a comprehensive effort to preserve the aesthetics of the White House view, we conclude that the provision is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-13\">C. <em>The Parcels Restriction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-14\">The regulations provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>No parcel, container, package, bundle or other property shall be placed or stored on the White House sidewalk ... Provided, however, that such property, except structures, may be momentarily placed or set down in the immediate presence of the owner on those sidewalks.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">The district court found this prohibition \u201cclearly overbroad and unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> It rewrote the rule to provide that \u201cparcels or other property be in the immediate presence of the owner, where \u2018immediate presence\u2019 shall be defined as within 5 feet of the owner.\u201d <footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Appellees urge this court to affirm the modifications.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> They argue that the original provision makes it more difficult for protestors such as the elderly and handicapped, or mothers with small children, to take part in prolonged demonstrations. These protestors, they contend, must have available to them such items as medical supplies and infant necessities to be able to remain on the sidewalk for any extended period of time. The government, by contrast, seeks reinstatement of the original language.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1617-12\">We are not entirely convinced that the first amendment protects the conduct proscribed by the parcels restriction.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> That amendment only protects activity which may be fairly characterized as speech. Courts have correctly recognized that some forms of <em>conduct </em>are sufficiently expressive to warrant constitutional protection,<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> but by no means all conduct which is intended by the actor to express an idea is speech.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> Intent is but one half the calculus; <footnotemark>130</footnotemark> a court must also consider whether \u201cin the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.\u201d<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Those types of conduct which the Supreme Court has held are within the ambit of the first amendment \u2014 most notably, demonstrating,<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> marching,<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> picketing,<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> wear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>ing armbands,<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> leafletting,<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> and affixing a peace symbol to the American flag<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> \u2014 clearly satisfy both the subjective and objective requirements of the constitutional test.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">By contrast, the activity at issue here\u2014 placing parcels on the sidewalk \u2014 appears to satisfy neither. Appellees have made no credible claim that such activity is \u201cin-ten[ded] to convey a particularized message\u201d; <footnotemark>139</footnotemark> nor have they shown that onlookers would regard their conduct as communicative.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> Parcels are, of course, inherently less expressive than signs; while the requirement that demonstrators maintain physical contact with their signs directly implicates expressive activity, the parcels restriction does not.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1618-15\">At most, the activity proscribed by the parcels restriction <em>facilitates </em>expression.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> The first amendment protects facilitative activity only insofar as its restriction imposes burdens on expression itself.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Neither the Supreme Court nor the lower federal courts, however, have enunciated a test for determining <em>how substantial </em>a burden on expression is necessary before the first amendment is implicated.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> While it is obvious that not just any minimal effect will do, this court is left without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>guidance for determining whether the alleged burden in this case is sufficient to trigger constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-4\">It is unnecessary for us to resolve this potentially thorny issue, however, because the parcels restriction clearly survives scrutiny under the reasonable time, place and manner test. The provision is narrowly tailored to address a security problem of the greatest magnitude, that of parcels left unattended on the White House sidewalk. Because any such parcel <em>could </em>contain an explosive device, all unattended parcels must be regarded as potentially suspect.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">The fact that the regulation limits the \u201cnature, extent [or] duration\u201d of demonstrations conducted on the White House sidewalk does not necessarily render it unconstitutional; <footnotemark>146</footnotemark> the burden it imposes on expression must be weighed against the government\u2019s substantial interest in presidential security and the safety of persons on the sidewalk. It is clear that the elderly, the handicapped and infirm, and those with young children to care for will still be able to engage in protest despite the regulation. Organizations (such as NOW) which stage vigils of extended duration will, in many instances, be able to accommodate the special needs of such participants through the use of \u201cfacilitators.\u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> Such persons can supply demonstrators with the items they require either by carrying the items on their person or by bringing them across Pennsylvania Avenue from Lafayette Park. Even if an organization does not use facilitators or if a demonstrator is engaged in a lone vigil, we are convinced that protest of a meaningful duration will remain possible for any persons who would have been able to demonstrate before adoption of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\">The regulations challenged here reflect the same variety of reasoned decisionmaking approved of by the Supreme Court in <em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence </em>and <em>Regan v. Time. </em>It is not the prerogative of this or any other court to question regulatory provisions affecting the time, place and manner of speech which lie within the zone of constitutionality prescribed by the first amendment. While the temptation to engage in judicial rulemaking may be powerful, our Constitution is best preserved by adherence to the proper judicial role.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-10\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1598-5\">.

No reference is made to the requirement that the regulation be narrowly tailored. We decline to interpret <em>Regan </em>and <em>Heffron </em>as establishing a more lenient st\u00e1ndard than that followed by the Court in other recent cases.

Judge Wald contends that Justice White qualified his explicit rejection of less-restrictive-alternative analysis in a footnote, in which he wrote that \u201d[i]f Time is exempted from the color requirement, so must all others who wish to use such reproductions. While Time may consistently use negatives and plates that are of little use to counterfeiters, there is no way of ensuring that others will adhere to that practice.\" <em>Id. </em>at 3272 n. 12. From this passage Judge Wald derives the principle that \"[a] time, place, and manner regulation is not unconstitutional as applied to situations that do not threaten the governmental interest at stake if that application <em>is an unavoidable consequence of regulating other conduct that does threaten the interest at stake.\" </em>Op. at 1544 (emphasis in original). According to the opinion, <em>Regan </em>stands for this and nothing more. What the opinion fails to mention, however, is that Justice White was merely applying in his footnote the familiar principle that \u201cthe effectiveness of [a] regulation should not be measured solely by the adverse consequences of exempting a particular plaintiff from the regulation.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 3272 n. 12 (citing <em>Clark, </em>104 S.Ct. 3065, 3070-71; <em>Heffron v.

Judge Wald praises the district court for engaging in a <em>de novo </em>review of factors underlying the challenged regulations. Such a review she finds consistent with this court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>A Quaker Action Group v. Morton, </em>516 F.2d 717 (D.C.Cir.1975); <em>see </em>Op. at 1542-1543. Whether Judge Wald\u2019s reading of that case is correct or not, judicial review of time, place and manner restrictions must now proceed under the framework established by the Supreme Court in <em>Clark </em>and <em>Regan. See Clark, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3072 (time, place, and manner decisions do not assign to the judiciary the authority to replace the Park Service as the manager of the, Nation's parks), <em>quoted supra </em>pp. 1552-1553.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-8\">It is axiomatic that government regulations which restrict the exercise of free speech are subject to closer scrutiny than other types of administrative decisions, and that <em>courts, </em>not agencies, are the ultimate arbiters of constitutionality. It by no means follows, however, that courts are required or permitted to duplicate the extensive factual inquiries undertaken by agencies when they draft regulations. Not only is such duplication highly inefficient, it reflects a lack of judicial respect for the unique expertise of administrative agencies. The agency may as well not have engaged in exhaustive and detailed fact-finding if a court before which the agency's regulation is challenged takes it upon itself to do the same thing <em>de novo.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"97\">\n<p id=\"b1609-12\">. We agree with Judge Wald that <em>Clark </em>and <em>Regan </em>\"refine but do not revamp settled principles in first amendment law.\u201d Op. at 1542. What those decisions do is establish once and for all that least-restrictive-alternative analysis is not a part of the constitutional inquiry for determining the validity of time, place and manner restrictions. Because the Supreme Court has <em>never </em>considered that analysis to be an integral element of the constitutional test, <em>see Regan, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3262, 3271-72, 82 L.Ed.2d 487 (plurality), <em>Clark </em>and <em>Regan settle </em>but do not revamp first amendment law. The \"zone of constitutionality\u201d analysis which we adopt today is nothing more or less than the doctrinal reverse of least-restrictive-alternative analysis. Only if one incorrectly assumes that the latter form of analysis was historically a part of the time, place and manner test can one conclude, as Judge Wald does, that our approach accords the government \"greater latitude than previously to burden protected expression.\u201d Op. at 1542.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-15\">Judge Wald also contends that <em>United States v. Grace, </em>461 U.S. 171, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1984), sanctions the result reached by the district court in the present case. Op. at 1546. The challenged statute in <em>Grace </em>prohibited the \"display [of] ... any flag, banner, or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization, or movement,\u201d in the \"Supreme Court Building or grounds.\u201d 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k (1982). The Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>grounds encompassed, <em>inter alia, </em>the public sidewalks surrounding the Court'building, <em>see </em>40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13p (1982); those sidewalks are a public forum, <em>Grace, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1708. Because the statutory restriction did not substantially serve the government's interests, the Court held that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the sidewalks, <em>id. </em>at 1708-10, even though the statute did not specifically distinguish between the sidewalks and other parts of the Supreme Court grounds. Judge Wald\u2019s opinion equates the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Grace </em>to focus exclusively on public sidewalks with the district court's creation of a \"five foot rule\u201d for parcel and sign placement in the present case, concluding that \u201d[i]f one was \u2018rewriting,\u2019 so was the other.\" Op. at 1547. This fails to appreciate, however, the crucial distinction between what the Supreme Court did in <em>Grace </em>and what the district court did here. The reason the <em>Grace </em>Court considered \u00a7 13k exclusively in the context of public sidewalks was that it could thereby avoid a needless constitutional inquiry into the status of the other parts of the Supreme Court grounds and building. There was no need to determine whether those areas were also public forums, because \"the controversy presented by appellees concerned their right to use the <em>public sidewalks.\" </em>103 S.Ct. at 1706 (emphasis added). Early in its opinion, therefore, the Court stated that it would \"address only whether the proscriptions of \u00a7 13k are constitutional as applied to the public sidewalks.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1610-18\">It is beyond dispute that courts are permitted to assess the constitutionality of a statute or regulation by drawing distinctions that are not explicitly embraced within the text of the provision. What courts may <em>not </em>do is substitute their factual judgment for that of the politically responsible body when that institution\u2019s judgment lies within the parameters of first amendment constitutionality. The district court here did precisely that when it arbitrarily rewrote the Park Service\u2019s regulations. The difference between <em>Grace </em>and the district court\u2019s opinion is therefore not only great, it is of constitutional dimensions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"98\">\n<p id=\"b1610-19\">. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19(e)(9) (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"99\">\n<p id=\"b1610-20\">. <em>White House Vigil for the ERA Comm. v.

It is true that Justice Stevens, in his majority opinion, used words to that effect in the course of distinguishing <em>Schneider v. State, </em>308 U.S. 147, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939); <em>see Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2131. The Court in <em>Schneider </em>struck down an ordinance that prohibited handbilling on the streets; it held that the municipality's aesthetic interest in avoiding litter could have been protected through an ordinance which penalized persons who actually litter. We believe, however, that the basis of Justice Stevens\u2019s discussion of <em>Schneider </em>is not the distinction urged by appellees, but rather the distinction <em>explicitly </em>adopted by the Justice in another passage of his opinion;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1613-15\">With respect to signs posted by appellees ... it is the tangible medium of expressing the message that has the adverse impact on the appearance of the landscape. In <em>Schneider, </em>an anti-littering statute could have addressed the substantive evil without prohibiting expressive activity, whereas application of the prophylactic rule actually employed gratuitously infringed upon the right of an individual to communicate directly with a willing listener. Here, the substantive evil \u2014 visual blight \u2014 is not merely a possible by-product of the activity, but is created by the medium of expression itself. In contrast to <em>Schneider, </em>therefore, the application of ordinance in this case responds precisely to the substantive problem which legitimately concerns the City. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>The ordinance curtails no more speech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1614-8\">104 S.Ct. at 2132. The visual blight in the present case is \"created by the medium of expression itself\" \u2014 stationary protests within the center zone, which obstruct the view of the White House and its grounds.

Judge Wald\u2019s opinion questions the utility of our distinction between aesthetic regulations which enact societal preferences and those which enact the preferences of individual government officials. Such a distinction, Judge Wald suggests, may run afoul of the principle that the first amendment protects unpopular minorities from the prejudices of hostile majorities. Op. at 1551. The approach we adopt today, however, is not blind to the fact that majority tastes sometimes mask disapproval of the substantive content of expressive activities. Our analysis does nothing to alter the familiar proscription of content-based restrictions. <em>See supra </em>pp. 1549-1550.

The debate over the \"White House experience\u201d is essentially a debate over cultural identity; as such, it is more susceptible to objective resolution than a disagreement over which of two views is more \"pleasant\" or \"beautiful.\u201d <em>See </em>Costonis, <em>supra </em>note 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-6\">It is not at all clear why appellees and intervenors regard <em>stationary </em>protest within the center zone as essential to the White House experience. Surely the additional cultural significance of stationary protest over mobile protest is, at most, insignificant. The government\u2019s decision to allow only mobile protest within the zone enhances the White House experience for many (and perhaps most) tourists, while it diminishes that experience for other tourists in only an insubstantial and indirect fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"118\">\n<p id=\"b1615-7\">. The concurrence-dissent contends that the center zone restriction is unnecessary to further the government\u2019s aesthetic interests; in doing so, however, the opinion seriously underestimates the degree to which stationary demonstrations within the center zone have the potential to obscure the view of the White House. While the size restrictions and the prohibition on unattended signs reduce that potential to some extent, a proliferation of hand-held signs of legal dimensions may well obscure a significant portion of the White House view. For example, the height limitation applies only to signs themselves and not to their supports; some signs may therefore be considerably higher than others. Because different signs can obscure different <em>levels </em>of view, the cumulative effect may be to block vision for a significant range of height above the sidewalk. Such problems are far less pronounced when demonstrators are required to remain moving within the center zone: stationary signs have the potential of blocking considerably <em>more </em>of the White House view than do mobile signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-12\">Nor is it any mystery why the Park Service decided to allow non-stationary protests within the center zone, even though such protests will admittedly obscure <em>some </em>of the White House view. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a ban on non-stationary protests would have been constitutional, the effect of instituting such a ban would be to demarcate a \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d in the middle of the sidewalk. Protestors on either side of the zone would have considerable difficulty communicating with one another, for they would be prohibited from carrying their signs across the demarcated area. The regulation the Park Service adopted represents a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of such protestors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"119\">\n<p id=\"b1616-6\">. 506 F.2d 53 (D.C.Cir.1974) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"120\">\n<p id=\"b1616-7\">. <em>Id. </em>at 58; <em>see also Heffron v.

Because the Court was able to resolve the case on other grounds, the constitutional status of sleep remains uncertain.

It is clear that the Park Service did not intend for the parcels restriction to apply to signs or banners. <em>See White House Vigil for the ERA Comm. v.

Besides the fact that Justice Marshall\u2019s test was proposed in <em>dissent </em>and therefore carries no precedential weight, a \u201cclose relationship\u201d standard would be too amorphous for objective application.

The district court\u2019s modification, allowing parcels to be placed on the sidewalk if the owner remains within five feet of them, must be rejected not only because it constitutes impermissible \"finetuning\u201d of the regulatory mechanism, but also because it is <em>more arbitrary </em>and <em>less effective </em>than the original provision. A rule which prohibits <em>any </em>deposit of parcels on the sidewalk, except momentarily, is capable of being easily enforced.

The appellees in this case, all of whom frequently demonstrate on the White House sidewalk, argue that the government has needlessly infringed their right \u201cpeaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\u201d at this center of executive power, and the district court sustained that view. While I agree with the majority that most of the Park Service regulations are not unconstitutional as written, in my view the majority opinion does not adequately dignify the constitutional interests at stake in this claim, and does not examine those interests with sufficient particularity. The majority tautologically informs us that if a regulation \u201clies within the zone prescribed by the first amendment it is constitutional,\u201d Maj. Op. at 1532, but unfortunately tells us very little about where the boundaries of that \u201czone\u201d are found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\">Prior cases of the Supreme Court and this court concerning time, place, and manner restrictions do not permit such uncritical deference to agency decisionmaking. Because we are deciding the content of constitutional principles with significant effect on future cases, I believe our differences merit the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">I. The Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-6\">I have problems with the majority\u2019s legal analysis in three respects. First, I believe it discounts the district court\u2019s primary obligation to do the constitutional balancing for itself, and as a result overrates the appropriate scope of our appellate review. Second, it does not heed closely enough the requirement that time, place, and manner restrictions be \u201cnarrowly tailored.\u201d Recent Supreme Court cases on which the majority relies expressly reaffirm this test. Yet I read in the majority opinion hints that the government \u2014 as a result of those cases \u2014 now has greater latitude than previously to burden protected expression. As I parse those cases, however, they refine but do not revamp settled principles in first amendment law that govern our decision here. Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the limited responses available to federal judges when they decide regulations are unconstitutional in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-9\">The majority explains its refusal to review the district court\u2019s findings under the usual Fed.R.Civ.P. 52 \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard by asserting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxS\">The issue for decision on this appeal is not factual, it is legal: did the Park Service draft regulations that were \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest\u201d? The <em>agency </em>in this case was the institution charged with the principal resolution of factual issues; the court\u2019s role was limited to determining whether the regulations which the agency adopted were within the boundaries of constitutionality prescribed by the first amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1620-10\">Maj. Op., text at n. 83 (emphasis in original). The majority appears to reason that (1) the district court should have reviewed agency factfinding under a more deferential standard; (2) the district court\u2019s own \u201cfindings\u201d are really conclusions of law, since it had no independent factfinding responsibility; and (3) therefore those \u201cfindings\u201d are reviewable on appeal under the liberal standard for assessing legal error. I do not agree that this is an accurate statement of what a trial or appellate judge\u2019s responsibility is in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-11\">Judge Leventhal offered a balanced appraisal of judicial responsibility in first amendment cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1620-12\">[Tjhis case is not a normal review of an executive action or administrative proceeding. When the executive or the administrative process abridges constitutional rights, it is subject to closer scrutiny than otherwise, and ultimately it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>the court rather than the agency that must balance the competing interests. The question in this case is not whether some support for the regulations may be adduced, by reference to evidence in the record and a claim of reasonable inferences or concerns, but is whether the regulations at issue here are \u201cunnecessarily restrictive for the purpose they are designed to serve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1621-5\">We now have ... a judicial determination based upon factual evidence adduced at a trial, indeed at a rather extensive and complete trial. To this determination we owe greater deference than to the untested administrative judgments with which we have been previously confronted. This decision being appealed was rendered by a district judge after consideration of both constitutional considerations, for which a judge has special concern, and the security considerations brought forward by the government officials. Moreover, the district judge had the benefit of the live testimony of the various witnesses whose assertions could be tested and probed on cross-examination. Thus, unless we discern clear error in the district court\u2019s findings of fact, or a mistake in its legal approach, we have no warrant for reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1621-6\"><em>A Quaker Action Group v.

It was required to give the government\u2019s witnesses the attention their expertise warranted. But that evidence still had to undergo the judge\u2019s independent appraisal and judgment, and his factual findings deserve our approval unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-13\">As the majority rightly notes, time, place, and manner restrictions must be justified without regard to the content of the message expressed; must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest; and must leave open ample alternative channels of communication. <em>See, e.g., Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3069, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984). The crux of this case involves the second element of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-16\"><em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), required that the incidental restrictions a regulation imposes on protected expression be no broader than is essential to the furtherance of the governmental interest at stake. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 88 S.Ct. at 1681.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That standard has been further broken down into two subsidiary inquiries. First, the challenged regulation must not unnecessarily contain provisions that entirely fail to advance the relevant governmental interest. If a regulation prohibits an identifiable class of expressive activity that does not pose any threat of the evil against which the regulation is directed, the courts will declare the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>regulation unconstitutional as it applies to that class of expression. <em>See </em>Ely, <em>Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment Analysis, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. 1482, 1485-90 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-4\">The second aspect of O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u201cnarrow tailoring\u201d requirement looks to see if an alternative regulation would serve the government\u2019s interest nearly as efficiently but would be demonstrably less intrusive on protected expression. Of course, any regulation could be made a little less intrusive on speech, at the cost of a little more protection for first amendment concerns. In this case, for example, adding six inches to the maximum permissible sign dimensions would surrender some marginal protection for security interests for a marginal benefit to free expression, but this sort of whittling is not what the \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d requirement is about. Instead, the court must look to see if the burden on speech is approaching an unreasonable level, or a serious loss to speech is being imposed for a disproportionately small governmental gain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1622-5\">The government here offers two purposes for its regulations: a compelling interest involving security of the White House occupants and the law enforcement officers and individuals on its sidewalks, and a more limited aesthetic interest in an unobstructed view of the White House for visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-6\">Before considering the regulations in detail, however, I want to register my disagreement with an insistent theme in the majority opinion that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions have changed the character or the mood of appropriate judicial scrutiny for time, place, and manner restrictions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Maj. Op., text at n. 95. I believe those decisions are consistent with the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>framework outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-9\">The recent Supreme Court pronouncements in <em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) and <em>Regan v. Time, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3262, 82 L.Ed.2d 487 (1984), emphasize that a time, place, and manner regulation is not unconstitutional simply because some alternative regulation would, <em>on the facts of the case before the court, </em>satisfy the government\u2019s aims equally well and yet not restrict the expressive rights of that particular challenger. <em>Regan </em>yields a corollary to that principle: A time, place, and manner regulation is not unconstitutional as applied to situations that do not threaten the governmental interest at stake if that application <em>is an unavoidable consequence of regulating other conduct that does threaten the interest at stake. </em>In other words, if a regulation cannot reasonably be drafted so as to prohibit all the conduct the state really needs to suppress, without marginally prohibiting some expressive activity that is harmless, it will pass muster. It seems to me the majority\u2019s approach to interpreting <em>Clark </em>and <em>Regan </em>blurs these well-defined principles into a far more diffuse deference to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">In <em>Clark, </em>demonstrators for the homeless challenged the constitutionality of a Park Service regulation forbidding overnight camping in the park. The Court rejected the argument that the Park Service should be required to adopt some other regulatory scheme to protect the parklands from overuse without forbidding sleeping by those demonstrators, such as restricting the size, duration, or frequency of demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>strations. The Court observed that such measures \u201cwould still curtail the total allowable expression in which demonstrators could engage, whether by sleeping or otherwise,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthese suggestions represent no more than a disagreement with the Park Service over how much protection the core parks require or how an acceptable level of preservation is to be attained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 3072. The proposed alternative regulations were less speech-restrictive on the facts presented in <em>Clark; </em>but viewed more generally, they were simply another regulatory scheme that would have allowed more expressive activity in some situations, and less expressive activity in others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-4\">In <em>Regan, </em>Time magazine challenged an anti-counterfeiting statute prohibiting, among other things, reproducing United States currency in color. <em>See id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 3264-65 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 474 If 6, \u00a7 504). The Court rejected Time\u2019s arguments that the color ban was too broad because it included photographs so distorted that they were entirely incapable of aiding counterfeiting. <em>Id. </em>at 3274 &amp; nn. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-5\">Writing for a plurality of four, Justice White commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1623-6\">That the limitations may apply to some photographs that are themselves of no use to counterfeiters does not invalidate the legislation. The less-restrictive-alternative analysis invoked by Time has never been a part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place, and manner regulation. It is enough that the color restriction substantially serves the Government\u2019s legitimate ends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1623-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 3271-72 (footnote omitted). In a footnote to this paragraph, Justice White stated that \u201c[i]f Time is exempted from the color requirement, so must all others who wish to use such reproductions. While Time may consistently use negatives and plates that are of little use to counterfeiters, there is no way of ensuring that others will adhere to that practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3272 n. 12.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In sustaining the color provision, Justice White thus relied on the notion that the government could not frame a narrower statute that adequately protected against the evil to be prevented.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1623-11\">It is crucial, I believe, to consider the exact context in which Justice White wrote his rejection of least speech-restrictive analysis in time, place, and manner restrictions. In <em>Regan, </em>because no alternative was available that could have prohibited only the speech that the government had a legitimate interest in suppressing, the Court ruled the statute could be enforced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>in <em>all </em>its applications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Clark </em>ruled that a challenger to a time, place, and manner restriction cannot win by merely conjuring up an alternative regulation that does not prohibit <em>its </em>conduct, regardless of the alternative regulation\u2019s effects on the expression of others. Seen in that light, the basic structure of the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test is still alive and well, and must be applied to these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-5\">The majority informs us that \u201cit is not the province of the court to \u2018finetune\u2019 the regulations so as to institute the single regulatory option the court personally considers most desirable,\u201d and that the role of courts \u201cis to uphold regulations which are constitutional and to strike down those which are not.\u201d Maj. Op., text at n. 83. Based on these unexceptionable generalizations, the majority expresses disapproval that \u201cnot only did [the district court] uphold some restrictions and reject others, it modified the content of individual provisions.\u201d Maj.Op., text at n. 32; <em>see also id. </em>n. 97. I do not share in that disapproval, for it seems to me the district court did exactly what it had to, assuming that its judgment of partial unconstitutionality was a correct one. The trial judge here simply indicated at what point he believed a regulation strayed over the bounds of constitutionality. In so doing he did not \u201crewrite\u201d the regulation, but only elucidated what the results of his constitutional balancing permitted. The agency is always free to withdraw the regulations altogether rather than amend or apply them to conform to his views. Indeed, it can prepare new and different ones. The trial court's judgment is a clearcut one \u2014 that the regulation as written is or is not constitutional or that it may be applied to some but not other situations. For example, in <em>United States v. Grace, </em>461 U.S. 171, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1984), the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a statute barring certain demonstrations in the Supreme Court building or on its grounds, which included the surrounding sidewalks. The statute did not distinguish between the Supreme Court sidewalk and the rest of the building grounds, but the Court had no difficulty in finding the statute unconstitutional only as it applied to the sidewalk. <em>See id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 1706, 1710.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, the district judge declared the parcels and sign attendance regulations unconstitutional as they applied to parcels and signs within five feet of the person owning or controlling them, but otherwise constitutional. <em>See White House Vigil for the ERA Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number><em>mittee v. Clark, </em>No. 83-1243 (D.D.C. Apr. 26, 1984) (order). If one was \u201crewriting,\u201d so was the other. I believe both courts were acting in time-honored fashion to decide whether the unconstitutional portion of a statute can be pared away without unduly disrupting the intended regulatory plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-5\">II. The Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"AhN\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-6\">The first group of contested regulations concern the material, size, and placement of signs on the White House sidewalk. The regulations provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1625-7\">No signs or placards shall be permitted on the White House sidewalk except those made of cardboard, posterboard or cloth having dimensions no greater than three feet in width, twenty feet in length, and one-quarter inch in thickness. No supports shall be permitted for signs or placards except those made of wood having cross-sectional dimensions no greater than three-quarter of an inch by three-quarter of an inch. Stationary signs or placards shall be no closer than three feet from the White House sidewalk fence. All signs and placards shall be attended at all times that they remain on the White House sidewalk. Signs or placards shall be considered to be attended only when they are in physical contact with a person. No signs or placards shall be tied, fastened, or otherwise attached to or leaned against the White House fence, lamp posts or other structures on the White House sidewalk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1625-8\">36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19(e)(9) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-9\">According to the demonstators, the main problem with the \u201cmaterials\u201d provision, requiring all signs to be made of cardboard, posterboard, or cloth, is that it bans plywood signs which are more sturdy and durable and pose no security hazards. The government said that plywood signs could be used to scale the White House fence or as shields or weapons in fights, and that splinters from such signs would be dangerous in the event of an explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-12\">After considering the evidence, the district court found that, given its decision to uphold the regulation limiting the thickness of all signs to one-fourth inch,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1625-13\">The total ban on signs made of wood is unjustified. It appears clear to the court that any sign with a thickness not exceeding <em>Vi </em>inch, including one made of wood, would be of no assistance to anyone bent upon scaling the fence. As a matter of fact, it would be an impediment and utterly foolhardy for one to attempt to make use of such a sign for that purpose. <em>Contrary testimony is incredible. </em>The possibility that sheet explosives might be concealed in wooden signs is adequately dealt with by the thickness requirement of not more than <em>Vi </em>inch on all signs. The testimony is that the thinnest sheet explosive is itself <em>Vi </em>inch, and that a sign of that thickness regardless of its composition has no capacity to conceal such explosives. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>No signs or placards shall be held, placed \u25a0 or set down on the center portion of the White House sidewalk, comprising ten yards on either side of the center point of the sidewalk; Provided, however, that individuals may demonstrate while carrying signs on that portion of the sidewalk if they continue to move along the sidewalk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1625-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number><em>White House Vigil for the ERA Committee v. Clark, </em>No. 83-1243, slip op. at 23-24 (D.D.C. Apr. 26, 1984) (emphasis added). The district court also found no evidence that any sign had ever been used to scale the White House fence, and that in any event it can be \u2014 and has been \u2014 readily scaled without the assistance of a flimsy plywood sheet. <em>See id. </em>at 22-23. After a careful review of the evidence, I cannot see any grounds for overriding the district court\u2019s conclusion that based on weight and credibility of the testimony, as well as undisputed historical facts, the government made out no case that plywood signs, one-fourth inch thick, posed a danger to the security of White House occupants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The potential use of plywood signs as weapons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>and the minimization of flying debris in an explosion involve security on the sidewalk itself. While that interest is certainly a legitimate one, it is far from unique to the White House sidewalk. The government\u2019s evidence on any special sidewalk dangers of plywood signs, as opposed to those made of plexiglass, was entirely speculative and not sufficient to overcome the appellees\u2019 considerable testimony that cloth and cardboard signs would not withstand prolonged use and would collapse or disintegrate in bad weather.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I therefore agree with the district court that the government\u2019s evidence failed to establish any significant relationship between its interest in maintaining order on the sidewalk and this part of the materials ban. Because in this instance the regulation prohibits a discrete, readily segregated class of expressive activity, <em>i.e., </em>the display of plywood signs that present no adequately documented danger to the interests asserted by the government, I would uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling that the materials ban is unconstitutional as applied to plywood signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-10\">On the other hand, I agree with the majority that the restriction on size and placement of signs and on the type of sign supports deserved to be upheld. The district court invalidated the restriction on large signs on the ground that the Secret Service can adequately survey crowds on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>the sidewalk through elevated observation posts and closed circuit television cameras. <em>See White House Vigil for the ERA Committee v. Clark, </em>No. 83-1243, slip op. at 21-22 (D.D.C. Apr. 26,1984). Law enforcement officers testified that while a few large signs might not create a security hazard, many of them would obscure the ability of officers patrolling on the sidewalk to observe the activities of persons in front of the White House. <em>See, e.g., </em>Lindsey Tr., R. 162 at 164-65, 233-36. Even accepting the district court\u2019s conclusion that demonstrators\u2019 signs would not block perusal of the sidewalk from other vantage points, I nonetheless believe the district court gave too little weight to the government\u2019s legitimate interest in assuring that the officers actually on the scene \u2014 those making immediate decisions about crowd management, rather than those on platforms or watching television monitors\u2014 also be aware of what is going on. <em>Cf. White House Vigil for the ERA Committee v. Watt, </em>717 F.2d 568, 572 (D.C.Cir. 1983) (discussing dangers of very large signs). This interest also implicates building security to some degree, since the government seeks to <em>prevent </em>the firing of any dangerous objects towards the White House, not merely to observe it. Those in the best position to act immediately will often be the sidewalk officers. Finally, this regulation does not by itself impose an overwhelming burden on expression: a banner measuring three feet by twenty feet is a large and very visible one by most viewers\u2019 standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">Sign supports are restricted to those no larger than three-quarters of an inch by three-quarters of an inch and made of wood. Government security experts testified that the commonly used aluminum hollow tubular sign supports could be used to fire projectiles or conceal explosives. <em>See </em>Parr Tr., R. 163 at 35-37. This testimony was somewhat undercut by other testimony that the smallest rocket launcher now developed is substantially larger than the largest support authorized by the regulation. Nonetheless, the regulation was not designed to protect against projectile danger alone. Considering the stakes at issue, the district court failed to adequately credit the government\u2019s interest in preventing serious harm. The danger that hollow supports might conceal potential weapons like blast marbles and flares, possibly even explosives, was, according to the testimony, a more realistic concern.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1627-8\">In addition, concerns that large supports could be used as weapons have prompted the District of Columbia to regulate the size of sign supports on the public streets, and that danger must be taken into account here as well. <em>See </em>Hensdill Dep., R. 145D at 63-64. The testimony did show that the regulation would inconvenience some demonstrators. Large banners can more easily be displayed with stronger supports.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But even crediting all of the appellees\u2019 evidence, as the district court apparently did, I do not think that the burden this regulation imposes on expression outweighs the dangers the regulation addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-9\">The regulations also ban stationary signs within three feet of the White House fence and attaching signs to, or leaning signs against, the fence or other structures on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>the White House sidewalk. The justification for these regulations is that signs close to the fence create a triangular space bounded by the sidewalk, the solid ledge at the base of the White House fence, and the sign, in which explosives or contraband could be concealed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Parr Tr., R. 162 at 52-53. The government\u2019s principal expert witness on security matters admitted that the three-foot regulation bans some conduct that presents no threat to security, such as simply holding a sign aloft in the zone without obscuring the area under the ledge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But the government claimed that a regulation requiring signs to be held aloft in this area would require continuous surveillance of each demonstrator,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and would likely require frequent admonitions from police officers to enforce, possibly precipitating confronta-. tions between demonstrators and police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-4\">The challengers alleged substantial burdens stemming from the placement restrictions. They prevented demonstrators with signs but not others from sitting on the ledge, whether or not the signs are located in a way that enables anyone to conceal objects behind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-5\">A regulation is valid even if it unavoidably prohibits harmless conduct in order to cover similar but dangerous conduct. Despite qualms, I believe that on essentially undisputed facts, the government showed that the three-foot regulation was directed to a substantial danger, and that a narrower regulation might well be less effective because of difficulties with its enforcement. For me, however, the question is a very close one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-9\">I have less trouble with the leaning ban. Appellees urge that police officers could look around signs, moving leaning signs to inspect beneath them, or use mechanical devices and dogs to \u201csniff\u201d for explosives. But that answer does not seem adequate under the <em>OBrien-Clark </em>test where a substantial harm is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-10\">Finally, the government supports its regulation requiring that signs be attended at all times by arguing that unattended signs create an opportunity for others to place explosives in or under them. The district court\u2019s factual findings on this issue are unclear,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but it recognized the substantiality of the government\u2019s concern by upholding the regulation to the extent of requiring that demonstrators remain within five feet of their signs. The government objects to this compromise, pointing out that in a crowd, police officers cannot quickly determine what sign belongs to what individual. The district court\u2019s resolution might work well most of the time, but serious harm could be threatened where a large crowd on the sidewalk made it impossible to identify a sign owner within five feet. The government is entitled to promulgate regulations broad enough to reach all instances in which a grave danger is threatened, even though they incidentally affect speech. On that principle this regulation may be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-12\">The center zone restriction provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>36 C.P.R. \u00a7 50.19(e)(9) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-6\">I have no quarrel with the majority\u2019s view that aesthetic concerns may justify some time, place, and manner restrictions on expression. However, it is equally clear that courts must be especially careful in scrutinizing restrictions on first amendment expression that the government seeks to justify on eye-pleasing grounds. Aesthetic concerns will in close cases involving first amendments rights weigh in at a lower poundage than, say, public safety or national security considerations. Because of their subjective nature, aesthetic concerns are easily manipulated, and not generally susceptible of objective proof. The danger is not just, as the majority suggests, that government might adopt an aesthetic rationale as a pretext for an impermissible motive, but rather that so many forms of robust expression are by their very nature boisterous, untidy, unsightly, and downright unpleasant for unsympathetic viewers. Distaste for the vig- or with which a message is asserted can too easily be cast as an aesthetic interest in compelling others to be more moderate and decorous \u2014 and, in consequence, less effective \u2014 in conveying their message.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-7\">If, as I agree, aesthetics are nonetheless to be recognized as legitimate governmental objectives, we must face squarely the implications of applying them to first amendment eases. The government has justified its 20-yard picture window regulation 'by citing the aesthetic interests of the visiting public in being able to see and photograph the White House against a tranquil foreground. The majority upholds this regulation in part because the government has regulated in accordance with the public\u2019s aesthetic views, not just its own. I am not entirely sure of the utility of this distinction in first amendment analysis, in light of that amendment\u2019s traditional function of protecting unpopular minorities against majoritarian excesses. But in this case, the government has an obvious interest of its own: its natural ambivalence toward the existence of vociferous demonstrators at the very gates of the White House, attracting news coverage and often raising unwelcome complaints about administration policies. We must therefore examine the government\u2019s asserted purpose and the efficacy of this regulation in satisfying that purpose with particular care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-10\">The evidence showed that the main complaints from members of the public involved the proliferation of large, billboard-like signs left for extensive periods propped up against the White House fence. Under separate portions of the regulations upheld today, that complaint is assuaged; the maximum vertical dimension of signs is now three feet, and signs cannot be left unattended or leaned against the fence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Photographs submitted by the government show that the view of the White House from the street is not seriously obscured by demonstrators with signs of these modest dimensions. <em>See </em>Defendants\u2019 Exhibits AAAA(1)-(14), Joint Appendix at 332-45. There was also evidence that demonstrators are generally cooperative in moving out of the way if tourists want to take unobstructed photographs. But most perplexing, the twenty-yard zone is closed only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>to stationary demonstrators with signs, not moving demonstrators carrying the same signs, although the latter could surely block as much of the view as much of the time.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I agree with the district judge that in the aggregate, the evidence does not come near to demonstrating that a prohibition on stationary signs of the kind allowed under the new regulations will add discernibly to aesthetic enjoyment of the White House. To the extent that ordinary visitors carrying possessions who stop within this zone obstruct the view as much as demonstrators, the regulation moves perilously close to selectively penalizing those who visit the White House for the purpose of political demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-4\">On the other hand, the record revealed that the regulation does impose a real burden on demonstrators. The majority brushes away their concerns with the declaration that there is no first amendment right to media attention, but I do not think that is the pertinent inquiry. When government bans stationary demonstrators from one section of a uniquely important public forum, it has obviously burdened their speech rights. If, as the district court found on ample evidence, the media are most likely to cover a demonstration in the center zone, then that fact is relevant in determining the extent of the burden and the need for its justification. It is not that protesters have an absolute right to the prime spot, but that the government must have an acceptable reason for excluding them from it or regulating the way they protest in it, and the means it chooses to implement its goal must be geared to achieve that end. The restriction on stationary as opposed to moving demonstrators, on the basis of aesthetics alone, does not, in my view, meet these requirements of the \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-6\">The parcels regulation provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-11\">No parcel, container, package, bundle or other property shall be placed or stored on the White House sidewalk ... Provided, however, that such property, except structures, may be momentarily placed or set down in the immediate presence of the owner on those sidewalks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.19(e)(10) (1983). While not deciding the issue, the majority expresses doubt that \u201cthe first amendment protects the conduct proscribed by the parcels regulation.\u201d Maj. Op., text at n. 127. I believe it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-12\">As a general matter, carrying parcels is not, of course, \u201cspeech\u201d within the meaning of the first amendment. However, the conduct this regulation prohibits not only arises in the immediate course of a demonstration, but according to the district court is necessary if some demonstrators are to convey their messages at all. <em>See White House Vigil for the ERA Committee v. Clark, </em>No. 83-1243, slip op. at 26 (D.D.C. Apr. 26, 1984). A regulation on facilitative conduct that cuts off or sharply restricts expression itself certainly burdens that expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-13\">I do not think we are required to ignore the fundamental proposition that it is people, with the basic needs of people, who exercise first amendment rights. Practically, old people, handicapped persons, mothers with children and children\u2019s paraphernalia, and even young and unencumbered demonstrators can demonstrate or distribute literature only for limited periods if they are not permitted to put down their possessions more than \u201cmomentarily.\u201d A demonstration is not some kind of ritualistic marathon dance, the prize dependent on how long a participant can stay on her feet and moving. In the trial below, an organizer for the White House Vigil for the ERA Committee testified that as a result of the parcel regulation, the Vigil had been forced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>to curtail the distribution of leaflets and petitions. According to the organizer, carrying literature, petitions, and clipboards on which people could sign the petitions, as well as banners, poles, and personal belongings on one\u2019s person at all times, simply proved too burdensome. <em>See </em>Beall Tr., R. 170 at 121-22. Since organizers were not certain how many people would attend each demonstration, <em>see id., </em>it became difficult to gauge how much material to bring. We evidenced similar concerns about the effect of the regulation on distribution of leaflets in our opinion directing modification of the preliminary injunction. <em>See White House Vigil for the ERA Committee v. Watt, </em>717 F.2d 568, 570 (D.C.Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-5\">The first amendment looks to realities, not mere formalities. Justice Marshall, dissenting in <em>Clark, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1631-6\">[FJacilitative conduct that is closely related to expressive activity is itself protected by First Amendment considerations____ [T]hat linkage, itself \u201csuffices to require a genuine effort to balance the demonstrators\u2019 interests against other concerns for which the government bears responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1631-8\"><em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3077 n. 7, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Watt, </em>703 F.2d 586, 607 (1983) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judgment)).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The government \u201ccannot foreclose the exercise of constitutional rights by mere labels,\u201d <em>NAACP v. Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 429, 83 S.Ct. 328, 336, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963), and neither should it be able to lower the level of scrutiny of a law that directly and substantially abridges protected expression by calling it \u201cfacilitative.\u201d If the first amendment does not permit the government to impose unreasonable restrictions on leafletting, surely it cannot suppress the same expression by over-regulating conduct that \u201cfacilitates\u201d leafletting. Otherwise, government could more easily discourage the presence of people at a demonstration than regulate the signs they carry. A demonstrator forbidden to set down a receptacle in which leaflets are carried for more than a moment may lack the endurance to leaflet at all, or to do so for any appreciable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-13\">In other contexts, the Supreme Court has recognized that the first amendment requires attentive concern with protecting the conditions that are necessary for effective communication. Thus, the amendment offers protection against undue financial burdens on expression, <em>see Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>460 U.S. 575, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983) (newspaper taxation); <em>Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley, </em>454 U.S. 290, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981) (contributions to political committees concerned with referendum votes); <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (campaign expenditures), as well as restrictions on access to certain highly newsworthy events, <em>see Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk, </em>457 U.S. 596, 102 S.Ct. 2613, 73 L.Ed.2d 248 (1982) (criminal trials); <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980) (same), and impermissible discrimination among ideas disseminated through public education, <em>see Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number><em>Education v. Pico, </em>457 U.S. 853, 102 S.Ct. 2799, 73 L.Ed.2d 435 (1982) (plurality opinion) (removal of books from school library). <em>See generally Richmond Newspapers, </em>448 U.S. at 584, 100 S.Ct. at 2831 (Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment). These cases, while obviously not controlling here, nevertheless suggest that the burdens of the parcel regulation should not be too casually dismissed in this case on the ground that they do not concern \u201cspeech.\u201d \u201c[I]n an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms,\u201d <em>NAACP v. Button, </em>371 U.S. at 438, 83 S.Ct. at 340, the definition of what impedes freedom of expression must be a pragmatic one. The imposition of a substantial, direct, and immediate burden on expression should be sufficient to invoke first amendment analysis.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1632-4\">So viewed, I do not believe the parcels regulation can be sustained. This regulation is clearly not a broad rule that, in only a small portion of its applications, has incidental effects on expression. Its application is limited to a public forum of unique national significance. Although its terms literally affect all visitors to the White House sidewalk, it will plainly have its major impact on political demonstrators who stay on the sidewalk for extended periods in order to demonstrate. Moreover, it was promulgated as part of a regulating plan targeted at expressive activities, and the burden it imposes on demonstrators must be considered not only individually but cumulatively in light of the other burdens that will be imposed by dint of these regulations on expression in the same forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-5\">As discussed above, the impact of this regulation will be substantial. The majority rationalizes that demonstrators can now keep their parcels across the street in Lafayette Park, <em>see </em>Maj.Op., text at n. 147, but even if this is feasible in group demonstrations, a bar against putting down personal or demonstration-related possessions for more than an instant at a time still represents a substantial burden, in some cases an impossible one, for individual demonstrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-8\">The government\u2019s security experts testified that explosives can be concealed in abandoned parcels. <em>See, e.g., </em>Parr Tr., R. 162 at 117-19; Jones Dep., R. 193 at 62-64. The district court acknowledged the possibility but held this danger could be adequately dealt with by a less restrictive mandate that individuals remain within five feet of any parcels placed on the sidewalk. The government countered that in a large crowd law enforcement officers might not be able to identify the owners of parcels or even tell whether the owners were present within the five-foot zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-9\">Viewing the evidence offered by government security experts deferentially, it is still not apparent why a parcel on the ground is more dangerous than one held in the hand, provided that its owner is in immediate physical contact with it. Continuous physical contact is, after all, considered sufficiently safe for the care of signs under these regulations; it is unclear why it would not also suffice with parcels. The majority opinion may consider this \u201crewriting\u201d the regulation, but I view it as in accord with a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>analysis that will not allow a regulation if it prohibits an identifiable, readily segregated class of conduct with no demonstrated relationship to the governmental purpose asserted. In my judgment, the parcels requirement, as written, violates that fundamental principle.

I agree, however, that many of these regulations meet the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>\u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d test and should be upheld. I respectfully dissent from the decision to uphold the materials regulation as applied to plywood signs, and the center zone and parcels regulations, as written.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1621-8\">. <em>See also Pullman-Standard v.

Some constitutional questions, however, present special problems. <em>Cf. Bose Corp. v.

However, the Supreme Court has held that the <em>O'Brien </em>standard governs time, place, and manner restrictions as well. <em>See Clark v. Community jor Creative Non-Violence, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3071 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984); <em>id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 3076 n. 6 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1622-7\">. The handbilling cases are the classic examples: banning the public distribution of leaflets is an effective method of litter control, but its high cost to free speech and the existence of feasible alternatives, such as a prohibition on littering itself, make the tradeoff impermissible. <em>See, e.g., Schneider v. State, </em>308 U.S. 147, 161-62, 60 S.Ct. 146, 150-51, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939); <em>see also Schad v.

These cases are also discussed in Ely, <em>Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment Analysis, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. 1482, 1485-90 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1623-7\">. The majority thinks that Justice White\u2019s footnote is unrelated to his rejection of less-restrictive-alternative analysis. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at n. 93. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-8\">In the footnote, Justice White was responding to Justice Brennan\u2019s suggestion that \"the particular negatives and plates used by Time would be of little assistance to counterfeiters,\u201d <em>Regan, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3272 n. 12 (opinion of White, J.) \u2014 an argument that was basically a variation of the less-restrictive-alternative analysis urged by Time. Justice White argued that exempting Time would require the government to exempt all those who wanted to engage in similar expression, including expression that might assist counterfeiters. But if exempting Time and all those similarly situated would <em>not </em>have impaired the governmental interest at stake, Justice White\u2019s rationale would logically have required invalidation of the statute, as applied to that class of expression. For the statute would not then have \"substantially serve[d] the Government\u2019s legitimate ends,\" <em>id. </em>at 3272, no matter how much unrelated, harmful conduct it prohibited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1623-13\">. Justice Stevens, who added the decisive fifth vote to uphold the color and size provisions, argued even more emphatically that Time's publication of highly distorted images could assist counterfeiters. <em>See Regan, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3294-96 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). Since his views limit the holding of the case, <em>Regan </em>clearly cannot be read to establish that a regulation that burdens protected expression more broadly than necessary is constitutional merely because some other part of the regulation is genuinely addressed to a legitimate objective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1624-6\">. <em>Regan </em>suggests an important difference between the narrowly-tailored requirement of <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>and less-restrictive-alternative analysis as applied to first amendment cases that do not involve time, place, and manner restrictions. <em>Cf. Schad v. Mount Ephraim, </em>452 U.S. 61, 69 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2183 n. 7, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981) (suggesting that lower demands apply to time, place, and manner restrictions). Ordinarily, a law that, at the margins, regulates some harmless protected expression may not constitutionally be enforced against that expression, even if this excessive scope is insignificant enough so that the law escapes facial invalidation as overbroad. <em>See generally New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 767-74, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3360-63, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982). In the view of the <em>Regan </em>plurality, a time, place, and manner restriction that unavoidably and very marginally regulates harmless expression may be enforced against that expression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1624-7\">. The challengers in <em>Grace </em>sought only to demonstrate on the sidewalk, and the Court there<em>i\u00f3te </em>had no occasion to rule on the constitutionality of the statute as it applied to other parts of the building and grounds. <em>See </em>103 S.Ct. at 1706. However, the Court\u2019s rationale centered on the public character of the sidewalk and the harmlessness of the prohibited activities when conducted there. <em>See id. </em>at 1708-10. Obviously, quite different considerations would apply to enforcement of the statute against, for example, demonstrations inside the building. <em>Grace </em>certainly did not foreclose enforcement of the statute in such a case, as it would have if courts were really empowered only \"to uphold regulations [or statutes] which are constitutional and to strike down those which are not.\u201d Maj.Op., text at n. 83. My point is that courts may \u2014 and traditionally do \u2014 find regulations valid as applied to some situations and invalid as applied to others, which is all the district court did in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1625-10\">. The Assistant Director of Protective Research for the Secret Service testified that plywood could be used to scale the fence, and he stated that one person had used plywood to do so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>Parr Tr., R. 162 at 53. However, later questioning by the court suggested that the single episode in question apparently involved a \"structure,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 73, and not a simple plywood sheet. <em>Cf. </em>Defendant\u2019s Exhibit MMM, Joint Appendix at 264 (Secret Service report on event referring to \"structure\"). The Assistant Director stated that about sixty people had gotten over the fence during the previous couple of years, and that no other person had used a sign or structure. Parr, R. 162 at 87. He agreed that the White House fence was constructed so that it was almost a ladder. <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-5\">The Assistant Director did testify that he might utilize a plywood sheet in attempting to scale the fence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-6\">\"[i]f I was more athletic than I am right now, your honor. But I think I could use [the sheet]. Plywood is incredibly resilient, and it would probably bend before it would break, and all you would have to do is get one handhold on the top of that fence and be vaulted over, if you got a running jump, especially if you had a nice ramp to it____ Well, if you went back to Pennsylvania Avenue and ran toward this ramp effect here, it would probably bend in the middle, and you could get a handhold and be right over that fence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An1\">Parr Tr., R. 162 at 70-72. It was evidently this testimony that the judge disbelieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-8\">The plaintiffs introduced a plywood sheet in evidence, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 133, which the judge was able to inspect. <em>See </em>R. 162 at 74 (recording receipt). The Assistant Director also told th\u00e9 district judge that the Secret Service would know immediately if someone jumped the fence even if no officer was watching, Parr Tr., R. 162 at 83, that the Secret Service is perfectly able to respond if someone does get over the fence, <em>id. </em>at 84, and that a coricealed \"counter-sniper\u201d is always stationed so that he could shoot a fence-jumper if necessary, <em>id. </em>A government witness testified that plexiglass signs had caused problems in demonstrations on the sidewalk, <em>see </em>Lindsey Tr., R. 162 at 163-64, but no episodes involving plywood were described.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1626-12\">. The Park Service official responsible for park police operations in the District of Columbia expressed general concern about the use of rigid signs as weapons or shields, <em>see </em>Lindsey Tr., R. 162 at 163-64, Pegula Dep., R. 195 at 15-16. The single episode he described in which rigid signs were so used involved plexiglass signs. <em>See </em>Lindsey Tr., R. 162 at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-13\">Appellee Picciotto testified that cardboard or cloth signs cannot stand up under the long hours of use her vigil on the sidewalk requires; particularly in bad weather, such signs are difficult to control and likely to be destroyed. <em>See </em>Picciotto Tr., R. 157A at 48-49; Picciotto Tr., R. 170 at 134-35, 161-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-14\">In essence, neither side disputes the evidence offered by the other; instead, dispute centers on whether the clear burden on speech is offset by the marginal increase in security on the sidewalk. In my view, it is not. This regulation differs from, for example, the sign support regulation in that (1) law enforcement officers testified to the actual use of thick wooden dowels as weapons, <em>see </em>Lindsey Tr., R. 162 at 165-66, but did not do so as to plywood signs; (2) a demonstrator wielding a two-by-four is a good deal more dangerous than one with a thin plywood sheet; and (3) banners of the maximum size allowed can be adequately supported with the permitted wooden supports, <em>see infra </em>note 11, but demonstrators for whom long-term presence on the sidewalk is a part of their message must use plywood signs or face the constant destruction of signs made from less permanent materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1627-6\">. <em>See </em>Lindsey Tr., R. 162 at 166 (recounting episode in which demonstrators \u201cstarted dropping flares out of the hollow tubing, plus other materials that were used against [the] officers. They lit the flares and threw them at us, along with crimped nails, marbles, and a few other items.\u201d). Appellees argue that these items could easily be concealed on the person of demonstrators, but common sense suggests that hollow tubing cduld enable demonstrators to carry a greater number of dangerous objects more easily-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1627-10\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness on flags testified that a cloth banner of the maximum permissible size supported only by two persons might sag in the middle, and that demonstrators might break the supports in an effort to hold the banner aloft. <em>See </em>Christianson Tr., R. 179 at 12-14, 20-22. However, the same expert also agreed that a banner of that size, if supported in the middle as well as at the ends, could be effectively displayed. <em>See id. </em>at 8, 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1628-6\">. <em>See </em>Parr Tr., R. 162 at 61. The government's witness characterized the three-foot limit as \"arbitrary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 60, but he followed that comment by observing that \"[w]e could have four feet, we could have one foot.\u201d Any linedrawing in this area necessarily has an arbitrary element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1628-7\">. The district court invalidated the three-foot restriction at least in part based on the possibility of this less restrictive alternative. <em>See White House Vigil for the ERA Comm. v. Clark, </em>No. 83-1243, slip op. at 21, 24 (D.D.C. Apr. 26, 1984). However, security officials testified to their preference for regulations that do not require frequent interference with demonstrations, <em>see </em>Lindsey Tr., R. 162 at 167, and a demonstrator within three feet of the ledge who did not at one moment obscure any area under the ledge might quickly and entirely innocently change position or location so as to create a visual obstacle. <em>Cf. </em>Parr Tr., R. 162 at 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1628-14\">. <em>See White House Vigil for the ERA Comm. v. Clark, </em>No. 83-1243, slip op. at 24 (D.D.C. April 26, 1984) (categorically stating that \u201c[t]he requirement that a demonstrator maintain contact with a sign is oppressive, and has little or nothing to do with security of any other government interest\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1629-8\">. The majority says that even signs three feet high can be held \"at different levels.\u201d Maj.Op. at n. 118. This is true, of course, but it scarcely establishes that such signs so held will create a visual obstruction anywhere near as formidable as that which previously might have been possible. Actually, there is no evidence in the record to back up the majority's concern that large numbers of demonstrators frequently block the view in this way. The government does not, I believe, have as much leeway in regulating for the \"worst case\" scenario based on aesthetic concerns as it is granted when security is at stake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1630-7\">. The majority observes that a total ban on sign-carrying demonstrators in the center zone would make it difficult for protesters to get from one side of the zone to the other. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at n. 118. This may be so, but it is largely irrelevant. The question is whether the regulation as presently written significantly advances the purpose claimed for it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1631-10\">. Bafflingly, the majority concludes that Justice Marshall would \"apparently apply the first amendment to some restrictions of facilitative activity that have no effect on expression itself.\u201d Maj.Op. at n. 144. I can find nothing in his opinion to support such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-11\">The <em>Clark </em>Court commented that the main value of sleeping in the park \u201cwould be facilitative.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 3070. It did so, however, in the course of explaining that the kind of demonstration sleep would facilitate \u2014 prolonged demonstrations that might damage the park \u2014 was exactly the kind of demonstration the Park Service had a legitimate interest in regulating. Despite the discussion in the dissent and in the opinions in the court of appeals, the Supreme Court conspicuously declined to make any broad statement about the application of the first amendment to regulations of facilitative conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1632-6\">. The majority is uncertain <em>\u201chow substantial </em>a burden on expression is necessary before the first amendment is implicated.\u201d Maj.Op., text at n. 144 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). In my view, the parcels regulation imposes a burden well beyond any reasonable threshold, and I therefore need not decide precisely where the threshold is. Certainly a regulation of facilitative conduct need not absolutely bar expression in order to trigger first amendment concerns. In evaluating time, place, and manner restrictions, courts are traditionally called upon to weigh the substantiality of the burden a regulation imposes on speech. I would adapt the analysis developed in those cases in determining when the burden a facilitative regulation imposes on speech is substantial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
