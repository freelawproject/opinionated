The complaint alleged negligence and rested on diversity jurisdiction. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Frigitemp, concluding that under the law of Mississippi it was immune from state common law negligence actions and that, in any case, Frigitemp was not negligent because it neither provided the ladder that injured Martin nor knew of the ladder\u2019s alleged defect. We are persuaded by Martin\u2019s argument, doubtlessly more elaborate than was presented to the district court, that the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>was applicable. Because a recent Act of Congress makes it clear that Frigitemp was not Martin\u2019s statutory employer under the LHWCA, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Martin was a painter\u2019s helper employed by Bagwell Coatings, Inc., which was under contract with Frigitemp to sand, paint and clean furniture and fixtures aboard a vessel being constructed for the U.S. Navy. Frigitemp was itself a subcontractor to Litton Systems, Inc., which held the contract with the Navy. The vessel was docked on the Pascagoula River in Pascagoula, Mississippi. After Frigitemp employees installed furniture and fixtures in a compartment of the vessel, Martin and other Bag-well employees entered the compartment to sand and paint. Martin used a ladder found in the compartment and was injured when a step of the ladder twisted and she fell off the ladder. Since her fall, Martin has received compensation payments under LHWCA from her employer, Bagwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">The district court applied the law of Mississippi and relying on <em>Doubleday v. Boyd Construction Co., </em>418 So.2d 823 (Miss.1982) and <em>Nations v. Sun Oil Co. </em>(Delaware), 695 F.2d 933 (5th Cir.) <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>705 F.2d 742, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 239, 78 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983), found Frigitemp immune from state common law negligence actions because, as a contractor who required its subcontractor to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance, Frigitemp was Martin\u2019s statutory employer. <em>See </em>Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 71-3-1 <em>et seq. </em>(1972 and Supp.1983). Martin does not appeal this ruling, but instead argues that her claim is controlled by the LHWCA. Frigitemp\u2019s argument that the claim could not be laid under the LHWCA because construction of the vessel had not been completed is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Thornton v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>707 F.2d 149 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 735, 79 L.Ed.2d 194 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">Furthermore, Congress has recently confirmed that Frigitemp is not Martin\u2019s statutory employer under the LHWCA, and is therefore not entitled to immunity from suit under section 905(a) of the Act. Section 4(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act Amendments of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-426, adds the following language to \u00a7 905(a): \u201cFor purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be deemed the employer of a subcontractor\u2019s employees only if the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tion as required by section 4.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This amendment is applicable' to pending claims. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 28(a). Because Bagwell, the subcontractor, paid compensation to Martin, Frigitemp is not Martin\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-16\">. The amendment overturns the holding in <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2827, 81 L.Ed.2d 768 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
