MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">These are consolidated appeals from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cboard\u201d), opinion reported at 220 USPQ 438 (TTAB 1983). In Docket No. 84,746, International Diagnostic Technology, Inc. (\u201cInternational\u201d) contests the board\u2019s decision sustaining the opposition of Miles Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cMiles\u201d) and its holding that International\u2019s mark STIQ, for \u201cimmuno-assay equipment for medical laboratories, namely, a sampler to be used in conjunction with test tubes,\u201d so resembles the marks of Miles, consisting of the letters STIX as the suffix of a number of marks, all previously used or registered for medical laboratory tests and/or equipment, as to be likely to cause confusion when applied to International\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">In Docket No. 84-859, Miles contests the board\u2019s decision sustaining International\u2019s counterclaim to cancel Miles\u2019 registration of STIX alone for \u201cchemical test for analysis of body fluids,\u201d registration No. 1,047,-918, dated September 14, 1976. The board based its decision on its holding that Miles\u2019 own application to register STIX alone was void <em>ab initio, </em>being \u201can attempt to reserve a mark for the future.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">We affirm the board\u2019s decision on the likelihood of confusion issue, vacate its decision sustaining the counterclaim to cancel on the basis that Miles\u2019 own application was void <em>ab initio, </em>and remand for further findings and reconsideration of its holding that said application was void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">All of Miles\u2019 marks have been used in connection with reagent strips at its Ames division, which makes diagnostic products, including reagent strips and instruments with which the strips are used. The strips, to which reagent pads are applied, are used in the analysis of body fluids, including blood and urine, to screen, diagnose, and monitor various diseases, and the board found that Miles had, prior to International\u2019s adoption of its mark STIQ, developed a family of marks ending in the suffix STIX which the purchasing public and users associate with these strips. It appears that the mark STIX was considered by Miles for use in connection with several of Miles\u2019 products: a reagent strip for urinalysis which tested for nine different chemical components or characteristics in urine, eventually sold under the mark N-MULTISTIX-C; a reagent strip which included a test for specific gravity, eventually sold under the mark N-MULTISTIX SG; a control strip to test the accuracy of some of Miles\u2019 other strips, eventually sold under the mark CHEKSTIX; and a reagent strip which tested for ascorbic acid in urine, eventually sold as C-STIX. The reagent strip (Ascorbate II) on which the mark STIX was eventually used is an improved version of the C-STIX strip. Although development of Ascorbate II commenced in 1975, it was not marketed until the last quarter of 1979. The application for registration of the mark STIX alone was filed March 1, 1976, with claimed use since December 8, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Miles\u2019 goods are sold to hospitals, both civilian and military, private and commercial laboratories, group practices, solo practitioners, and public health departments, and are used by laboratory technicians, clinical chemists, and doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">International markets a line of diagnostic reagent tests and instruments (fluorometers) that \u201cread\u201d the tests by measuring the amount of fluorescence produced by a chemical reaction that occurs on the end of a \u201csampler\u201d which bears the mark STIQ. The samplers are a component of a kit which forms an immuno-assay system to diagnose and monitor the treatment of a number of diseases by identifying antibodies in body fluids, primarily blood. International\u2019s goods are sold to many of the same ultimate purchasers as are Miles\u2019 goods, including clinical laboratories in major health centers, large hospitals, private commercial laboratories, military medical facilities, and public health departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">\n<em>Likelihood of Confusion Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Comparing International\u2019s mark to Miles\u2019 family of marks, the board found that the marks are \u201cclosely similar in sound, appearance and connotation.\u201d It also found that, although the goods of the parties are different, their similarities \u201care striking\u201d; that both constitute chemical laboratory diagnostic reagent equipment designed to be used with a diagnostic instrument; that both are relatively easy to use; that the products of both parties comprise a family of diagnostic tests; that both may be used as complementary tests for the same disease of the same patient; that the parties have advertised their products in some of the same medical journals and have promoted their products at some of the same medical conventions. The board added that the evidence demonstrates \u201cthe renown of opposer\u2019s [Miles\u2019] line of -STIX products acquired over many years of use and through sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d and that Miles \u201chas also spent millions of dollars in advertising its product through various media.\u201d Accordingly, it concluded that International\u2019s mark, used in connection with samplers employed with its diagnostic equipment, so resembles Miles\u2019 -STIX family of marks for Miles\u2019 diagnostic reagent strips that confusion is likely, because purchasers and users are likely to believe that International\u2019s products are another line of Miles\u2019 medical laboratory products. We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\n<em>Validity of Application Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">The board quoted testimony of record showing that the strips sent with the application to establish trademark usage of STIX alone could have been any of the strips that were currently in inventory. \u201cIt is clear,\u201d the board said, \u201cthat the product that was eventually marketed under the mark STIX (the improved ascorbic acid test) was not available for marketing at the time of the intial <em>[sic </em>] shipment on December 8,1975.\u201d It referred to evidence \u201cthat opposer [Miles] had not determined at the time the labels were printed what the <em>specific nature </em>of the reagent product would be\u201d (emphasis added), and found that \u201cthe product which opposer [Miles] shipped bearing the mark STIX on December 8, 1975, was not the product which eventually came into being.\u201d Accordingly, it held that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">since the mark STIX per se was not used on the goods in question until long after the filing date, ... the application to register the mark was void ab initio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Unfortunately, the basis for the board\u2019s holding appears to be that the goods in Miles\u2019 token shipments<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were not identical to the product eventually marketed under the STIX mark, viz. Ascorbate II, which Miles\u2019 manager of new business development for urine chemistry products stated \u201cwas in development at that point, or at least in conceptual development.\u201d In its opinion of even date in <em>Ralston Purina Co. v. On-Cor Frozen Foods, Inc., </em>746 F.2d 801 (Fed.Cir.1984),- this court has effectively held that, considering the realities of the marketplace, the \u201cidentical goods\u201d test is invalid where the \u201cinherent and identifiable character\u201d of a product under development which is intended to be marketed under the mark in question has not been changed from that of the product used in a token shipment, as described in the application. However, although it appears that the \u201cinherent and identifiable character\u201d test has been satisfied here, the board\u2019s findings on Miles\u2019 developmental activities (and the intent they may or may not support) are so sparse that the board\u2019s decision sustaining International\u2019s counterclaim to cancel Miles\u2019 registration must be vacated and the case remanded for further findings by the board and reconsideration of its holding in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED; REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\">. In an amended answer to Miles\u2019 opposition, International asserted that Miles was guilty of unclean hands and was estopped to oppose its registration because Miles filed an application to register the STIX mark alone to obtain a registration of a mark more similar to International\u2019s mark STIQ after obtaining confidential information about International\u2019s intent to market a stick-like product. International also asserted that Miles was guilty of fraud because, at the time of filing its own application, it had made no bona fide commercial use of the mark sufficient to support the application; that Miles never sold any goods under the mark; and that Miles had abandoned the mark by failing to sell any goods or services under the mark for over three years preceding the date of the amended answer. All of which Miles denied. The board found no \"clear and convincing evidence\u2019\u2019 of fraud and no proof that Miles\u2019 employees had been told about the STIQ trademark when some of International\u2019s officers had visited Miles\u2019 plant in Indiana. The board observed that, at the time International decided to use its STIQ mark (application filed April 21, 1976, claiming use since April 6, 1976), Miles had already established a family of STIX suffixed marks and had been considering using the mark STIX alone. We agree with the board's treatment of these issues. Moreover, since the board decided that Miles\u2019 own application was void <em>ab initio, </em>there was no need to consider the abandonment issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">. International argues that this court should, under the doctrine of comity, give weight to decisions of foreign tribunals, such as Great Britain, France, and West Germany, where its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>mark has been registered, and Sweden, where its registration was upheld on inter partes appeal and likelihood of confusion was an issue. However, we believe that this argument properly belongs before the Congress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-19\">. The board quoted cross-examination and testimony of Miles\u2019 manager (of the Ames division) which indicates that there were three initial shipments of bottles of reagent strips with STIX on the labels on the bottles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
