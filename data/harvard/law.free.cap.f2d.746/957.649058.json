Judge J. William Ditter, Jr. sentenced Morrone to two consecutive twenty-year terms, one for the RICO substantive count and one for the RICO conspiracy count. Morrone then moved for correction and reduction of his sentence, alleging that the two RICO counts had merged for sentencing purposes. Judge Ditter, relying on <em>United States v. Rone, </em>598 F.2d 564 (9th Cir.1979), denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-20\">In <em>Rone, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that a RICO \u201centerprise\u201d count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) does not merge with a RICO conspiracy count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d). The Ninth Circuit applied the test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), under which a legislative intent to authorize consecutive sentences for separate offenses arising from a single transaction is inferred where \u201ceach requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. <em>See Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1293, n. 17, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975). An enterprise offense under \u00a7 1962(c) may be committed by an individual acting alone, while a conspiracy offense under \u00a7 1962(d) cannot; and an enterprise offense, unlike a conspiracy offense, requires commission of choate acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>(conducting the affairs of an enterprise \u201cthrough a pattern of racketeering activity\u201d). For that reason, the Ninth Circuit in <em>Rone </em>concluded that consecutive sentences for RICO substantive and conspiracy offenses could properly be imposed. Most of the other courts that have considered this question have reached the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Bagaric, </em>706 F.2d 42, 63 n. 18 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 283, 78 L.Ed.2d 261 (1983); <em>United States v. Cagnina, </em>697 F.2d 915 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 175, 78 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">Morrone urges us to eschew the <em>Block-burger </em>test altogether and follow what he perceives as a Third Circuit \u201ctrend\u201d against consecutive sentencing, relying on <em>United States v. Gomberg, </em>715 F.2d 843 (3d Cir. 1983) and <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>593 F.2d 210 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 948, 99 S.Ct. 2172, 60 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1979). In those cases we invalidated consecutive sentences under provisions of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 et seq. (1982). We had no occasion to resort to the <em>Block-burger </em>test because a legislative intent against consecutive sentencing could be discerned from the Act. No such contrary legislative intent can be discerned from RICO, and the <em>Blockburger </em>test is applicable. <em>See Albemaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 340, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1142, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">In <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>642 F.2d 1001 (6th Cir.1980), the Sixth Circuit held that, where the proofs supporting convictions of a RICO enterprise offense and a RICO conspiracy offense were identical, the convictions merge for sentencing purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 1040. Arguing that his convictions of all counts rested entirely on the testimony of one government witness, Morrone urges us to follow <em>Sutton. </em>We decline to do so. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1293, n. 17 (1975), the <em>Blockburger </em>test \u201cfocuses on the statutory elements of the offense. If each requires proof of a fact that the other does not, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, notwithstanding a substantial overlap in the proof required to establish the crimes.\u201d We agree with the Second, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) and (d) satisfy the <em>Blockburger </em>test, and that consecutive sentences under these provisions are proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1044-15\">. Morrone was also convicted of nine counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1982), which are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
