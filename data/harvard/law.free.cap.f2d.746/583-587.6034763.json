We hold that the district court abused its discretion in denying fees and therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-23\">The plaintiff, Don Ray Smith, brought this action against the CMTA-IAM Pension Trust to recover benefits which he claimed had been wrongfully withheld for a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>of over 3V2 years. Smith represented himself until faced with the trust\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, and for fees. He then hired counsel, but the district court dismissed Smith\u2019s action with prejudice nevertheless. On appeal this court affirmed in part and reversed in part. <em>Smith v. CMTA-IAM Pension Trust, </em>654 F.2d 650 (9th Cir.1981). Upon remand, the parties settled. Included in the settlement agreement was the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvB\">C. The parties hereto will seek to reach an agreement concerning the payment of attorney\u2019s fees for Don Ray Smith. In the event of a failure by the parties to reach such an agreement, Don Ray Smith or his attorney may petition the Court for said fees. Failure of the parties to reach an agreement concerning attorney\u2019s fees shall not have any effect upon the finality of this settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The parties could not agree on the payment of plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, and Smith moved for fees before the district court pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). His motion was denied and he appeals. Smith also seeks fees and costs for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">ERISA provides that \u201cthe court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d \u00a7 502(g)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). A decision denying fees will be set aside if the district court (1) abused its discretion, <em>Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 452 (9th Cir. 1980); (2) failed to state the reasons for its decision, <em>id. </em>at 452-53; or (3) used incorrect legal standards to reach its decision. <em>Lummi Indian Tribe v. Oltman, </em>720 F.2d 1124, 1125 (9th Cir.1983). If the district court fails to state the reasons for its decision a remand for a statement of reasons may be necessary. <em>Hummell, </em>634 F.2d at 452-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In support of its decision, the district court recited the factors this court listed in <em>Hummell, </em>634 F.2d at 453, as necessary to consider when a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under ERISA is denied. We hold that the district court abused its discretion, however, by misapplying the factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">ERISA, like the Civil Rights Acts of 1871 and 1964, and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, is remedial legislation which should be liberally construed in favor of protecting participants in employee benefits plans. Section 502(g)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), authorizes the court to award attorney fees. This section \u201cshould be read broadly to mean that a plan participant or beneficiary, if he prevails in his suit under \u00a7 1132 to enforce his rights under his plan, \u2018should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 \u201d <em>Landro v. Glendenning Motorways, Inc., </em>625 F.2d 1344, 1356 (8th Cir. 1980) (quoting <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">As in cases involving section 1988 awards, <em>see Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424,103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, a district court considering a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under ERISA should apply its discretion consistent with the purposes of ERI-SA, those purposes being to protect employee rights and to secure effective access to federal courts. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b); S.Rep. No. 93-127, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 4639, 4838, 4871. As a general rule, ERISA employee plaintiffs should be entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee \u201cif they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d at 50 (quoting <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.1978)). <em>See Lummi Indian Tribe, </em>720 F.2d at 1125. <em>See also Central States Southeast v. Hitchings Trucking, </em>492 F.Supp. 906, 909 (E.D.Mich. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">In this case although the district court used the five factors listed in <em>Hummell, </em>634 F.2d at 453, it did not have the remedial purposes of ERISA in mind. The underlying purposes of ERISA are to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans. An important aspect of that protection is to afford them effective access to federal courts. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The five <em>Hummell </em>factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">(1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of fees; (3) whether an award of fees against the opposing parties would deter others from acting in similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d at 453. \u201cNo one of the <em>Hummell </em>factors, however, is necessarily decisive, and some may not be pertinent in a given case.\u201d <em>Carpenters Southern California Administrative Corp. v. Russell, </em>726 F.2d 1410, 1416 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In considering these factors to justify a failure to award fees to Smith, a prevailing employee participant, the district court stated that \u201cone of the main prerequisites is that there\u2019s bad faith.\u201d Although bad faith is a factor that would always justify an award, it is not required. As there was no bad faith on either side, this factor should not have been considered decisive. The relative ability of the parties to satisfy an award of fees is, however, relevant. Generally, when an employee participant brings suit under ERISA, whether it is against the trustees or the employer, the resources available to the pensioner are limited. <em>Cf. Marquardt v. North America Car Corp., </em>652 F.2d 715, 718-19 (7th Cir. 1981). As the Supreme Court said in <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 13, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 1950, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973), a case involving attorney\u2019s fees under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cNot to award counsel fees in cases such as this would be tantamount to repealing the Act itself by frustrating its basic purpose. It is difficult for individual members of labor unions to stand up and fight those who are in charge. The latter have the treasury of- the union at their command and the paid union counsel at their beck and call while the member is on his own____ An individual union member could not carry such a heavy financial burden. Without counsel fees the grant of federal jurisdiction is but a gesture for few union members could avail themselves of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">412 U.S. at 13, 93 S.Ct. at 1950 (quoting <em>Cole v. Hall, </em>462 F.2d 777, 780-81 (2d Cir.1972)). Based on this factor alone, absent special circumstances, a prevailing ERISA employee plaintiff should ordinarily receive attorney\u2019s fees from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Consideration of the other three factors also leads to the conclusion that prevailing employee plaintiffs should ordinarily recover attorney\u2019s fees from ERISA defendants. In this case the trust defendant chose to oppose Smith\u2019s interpretation of the pension plan and section 203(a), the nonforfeiture provision of ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053(a). <em>See Smith v. CMTA Pension Trust, </em>654 F.2d at 656-66. An award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees would deter trustees from opposing employee participant claims if the amount of the claim and the reasonableness of the employee\u2019s claim are such that the plaintiff\u2019s chances of success are great. If the employee\u2019s claim is frivolous, however, the trust will not be deterred from denying the claim as it would not run the same risk of liability for a judgment or for fees. On the other hand, when the positions of both parties have some merit, as in this case, a decision clarifying the terms of a plan after litigation would \u201cbenefit all participants and beneficiaries\u201d by settling a disputed provision or an ambiguity. This would be helpful to the trustees in future administration, but \u201coften depend[s] on a plaintiff\u2019s initiative in bringing suit.\u201d <em>Carpenters Southern California Administrative Corp. v. Russell, </em>726 F.2d at 1416.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">The fifth <em>Hummell </em>factor, the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions, is, in the final analysis, the result obtained by the plaintiff. When the plaintiff receives what he or she sued for by way of voluntary settlement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">the fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>vail on every contention raised in the lawsuit. Litigants in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court\u2019s rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. The result is what matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52 (citation omitted). By way of settlement, Smith received a portion of what he brought suit to recover, and so crossed the \u201cstatutory threshold\u201d entitling him to recover fees from the defendant. <em>See id. </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">On remand, the district court should reconsider the award of fees in light of the remedial purposes of ERISA. That the dispute was ultimately settled after remand should not detract from the fact that plaintiff recovered $4,151.04, which covered the amount of back payments he sought on remand, and that he was forced into federal court to recover it due to a dispute regarding the interpretation of section 203(a) of ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053(a). <em>See Lummi Indian Tribe, </em>720 F.2d 1124 (9th Cir.1983); <em>White v. City of Richmond, </em>713 F.2d 458 (9th Cir.1983). Costs for this appeal should be determined and included in the fees award. <em>Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., </em>399 U.S. 222, 90 S.Ct. 1989, 26 L.Ed.2d 534 (1970) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b677-9\">WALLACE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AXE\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"Aju\">In my opinion, the majority reaches the correct result for the wrong reason. The procedural posture of this case makes it a poor vehicle for establishing broad propositions about the remedial nature of the pension statute vis-a-vis attorney\u2019s fees. I find a more narrow reason for deciding that the district court abused its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees in its failure to consider the settlement agreement Smith reached with the trust that assumed liability but did not fix an amount for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Before addressing the majority\u2019s analysis of the case under the <em>Hummell </em>test, I will comment on its questionable reliance on two authorities. First, the majority relies on <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973), for the proposition that \u201ca prevailing ERISA employee plaintiff should ordinarily receive attorney\u2019s fees from the defendant.\u201d Maj. op. at 593. <em>Hall </em>differs from the case before us because the issue in <em>Hall </em>had public importance. The language of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(b) indicates that the rights and interests to be vindicated in member-union litigation are those of \u201cemployees and the public <em>generally.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Without a major public impact, a particular dispute becomes merely \u201cprivate feuding having no general significance.\u201d <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. at 16, 93 S.Ct. at 1951 (White, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Our initial opinion, <em>Smith v. CMTA-IAM Pension Trust, </em>654 F.2d 650 (9th Cir.1981), dismissed Smith\u2019s complaint on all grounds except the one involving suspensions, remanding on this issue because the record had not been fully developed. When the parties later settled, therefore, the sole open issue was whether, interpreting the suspension provision of this particular pension plan, Smith continued to be employed \u201cin the same trade or craft\u201d as when the benefits commenced. <em>See </em>ERISA \u00a7 203(a) (3)(B)(ii), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053(a)(3)(B)(ii). Because it is difficult to see the general public importance of attorney\u2019s fees for the narrow issue presented, this case is a slim reed on which to rest broad pronouncements about the statute\u2019s remedial reach. It seems unarguable that a judgment for Smith on the \u201csame trade or craft\u201d issue would have a limited impact on other participants in the pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">The majority apparently finds general importance by reasoning that, like civil rights laws, ERISA must be liberally construed to further its remedial purpose. Maj. op. at 592. Such an analysis has no limitation, however. Every statutory scheme is \u201cremedial\u201d with respect to at least one of the groups with which it is concerned, and can thus be analogized to the civil rights laws. We need legislative history. Unfortunately, the majority offers none of any significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Second, I am concerned about the majority\u2019s argument that section 1988 awards provide a persuasive basis for reversal. Maj. op. at 592. We recently rejected an analogy between 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) and another civil rights statute, Title VII, because the analogy impermissibly narrowed the scope of section 1132(g)(1). <em>See Carpenters Southern California Administrative Corp. v. Russell, </em>726 F.2d 1410, 1415-16 (9th Cir.1984) (defendant employers may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees under section 1132(g)(1) based on same standards as for plaintiffs). I do not see why an analogy to section 1988 is appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">I now turn to the majority\u2019s treatment of the district court\u2019s use of the <em>Hummell </em>test. Maj. op. at 592. <em>See Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 452 (9th Cir.1980). A review of the <em>Hummell </em>analysis, I suggest, demonstrates the majority\u2019s use of it is flawed. The majority outlines the <em>Hummell </em>factors, stating the district court did not have the remedial purposes of ERISA in mind when applying them. Maj. op. at 592. The majority fails to make clear how, given these purposes, the district court improperly applied the factors. The majority then correctly cites <em>Carpenters Southern California Administrative Corp. v. Russell, </em>726 F.2d at 1416, for the proposition that \u201c[n]o one of the <em>Hummell </em>factors ... is necessarily decisive, and some may not be pertinent in a given case.\u201d The last proposition, I take it, means that <em>sometimes </em>one of the <em>Hummell </em>factors <em>could </em>be decisive. Indeed, it <em>could </em>be only <em>one </em>because other <em>Hummell </em>factors may not be \u201cpertinent in a given case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority then properly points out that \u201c[i]n considering these factors to justify a failure to award fees to Smith,\u201d the district court said \u201cone of the main prerequisites is that there\u2019s bad faith.\u201d Maj. op. at 592. Thus, the district court took the lack of bad faith to be a pertinent factor justifying its failure to award fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The majority reversed the district court, however, on the ground that, \u201calthough bad faith is a factor that would always justify an award, it is not required.\u201d But this reasoning inverts the <em>Hummell </em>test and seems to have been developed merely for the purpose of reversal. The district court was looking at the factors to justify a <em>failure </em>to award attorney's fees and justified its failure on the ground that there was no bad faith; it was not seeking to justify granting an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The majority opinion also states that because \u201cthere was no bad faith on either side, this factor should not have been considered decisive.\u201d But the district court never said that bad faith was the <em>only </em>prerequisite that would justify a failure to make an award. Moreover, the majority certainly cannot mean that a district court may not look to a lack of bad faith to justify a failure to award attorney\u2019s fees when neither side is in bad faith. A failure to award fees can be justified on the ground that there was no bad faith if, as <em>Russell </em>recognizes to be possible, other factors are not \u201cpertinent.\u201d Nothing in the transcript suggests the district court imposed an exclusive requirement on Smith, or that the district court misapplied the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">The award of attorney\u2019s fees under ERISA would be inappropriate in this case, because there was ,no bad faith on either side. And one of the main prerequisites is that there\u2019s bad faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">An award of fees would not deter others from acting under similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">The plaintiff, from the beginning of this lawsuit, did not seek to benefit all the participants. And the narrow legal question which was decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor; namely, the applicability of section 203(A) of ERISA to any suspension of benefits after April 1, 1976, is really quite insignificant; and, in any case, did not have the effect of giving the plaintiff the relief that he sought. Because the question of whether he had worked in the same trade was remanded by the Ninth Circuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-11\">Each party\u2019s position had some merit, and with each.side prevailing on at least one issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The defendant prevailed on its interpretation of its plan, as well as on the state law issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">So it does not call for attorney\u2019s fees; and the motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">I concur with the majority\u2019s result, however, based on a proper, more comprehensible, and narrower ground for the decision. Upon remand from this court, the parties settled. Included in the settlement agreement was the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">C. The parties hereto will seek to reach an agreement concerning the payment of attorney\u2019s fees for Don Ray Smith. In the event of a failure by the parties to reach such an agreement, Don Ray Smith or his attorney may petition the Court <em>for said fees. </em>Failure of the parties to reach an agreement concerning attorney\u2019s fees shall not have any effect upon the finality of this settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">(Emphasis added.) The parties could not agree on the payment of Smith\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, and Smith moved for fees before the district court pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Without examining anything else in the district court\u2019s treatment of the <em>Hummell </em>factors, I believe we should reverse and remand for abuse of discretion in light of this settlement agreement. It is clear from the above clause that <em>both </em>parties expected and intended that Smith was to be paid at least some attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, this part of the agreement, though perhaps not specifically enforceable, strongly evidences the parties\u2019 intention. Smith secured a commitment from the trust concerning the payment of his attorney\u2019s fees. Only the amount was left open to negotiation. By way of settlement, he thus received a portion, however small, of what he brought suit to recover, and so crossed the \u201cstatutory threshold.\u201d Under these circumstances, I believe the district judge abused his discretion by not explicitly considering this factor as pertinent in the <em>Hummell </em>analysis. This is a simple, available path of decision in this case, and it is the one I would take.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
