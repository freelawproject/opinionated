Clark, </em>746 F.2d 572 (9th Cir.1984), argued and decided with this case, we hold that any aboriginal rights appellants may have had were extinguished by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-1626.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">We agree with the district court <em>(Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope v. United States, </em>548 F.Supp. 182, 188 (D.Alaska 1982)), that appellants\u2019 general trust claims are barred by collateral estoppel. <em>See North Slope Borough v. Andrus, </em>642 F.2d 589, 611-13 (D.C.Cir.1980). <em>See also California v. Watt, </em>668 F.2d 1290, 1324-25 (D.C.Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-23\">We also reject appellants\u2019 claim based upon the Final Act, Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Helsinki, <em>reprinted in </em>73 U.S.Dept. State Bull. 323 (1975) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, G.A.Res. 2200, 21 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 49, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1966). Assuming these international understandings are applicable, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>pellants point to no provision of either that could be interpreted as imposing upon the United States a greater obligation to protect the subsistence culture of the Natives than that imposed upon the United States by federal domestic law \u2014 an obligation already satisfied. <em>See North Slope Borough v. Andrus, supra. </em>Nor have appellants made any showing of a universal recognition of such a greater obligation that would be necessary to establish a claim based on the law of nations. <em>See Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, </em>630 F.2d 876, 881-84 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
