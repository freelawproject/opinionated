The jury reached a verdict of guilty on all counts at 12:45 a.m. the following day. The penalty phase com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>menced immediately upon return of the verdict, and Peek was sentenced to die. His convictions and death sentences with respect to the murders were affirmed on direct appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and relief was denied in state habeas proceedings, and again by the district court from the Middle District of Georgia on a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The defendant\u2019s primary claim in this appeal is that the district court was mistaken in holding that no constitutional error occurred when the Greene County trial court excused and replaced a regular juror, Chester Greeson, with an alternate juror, Ben Weinstein, in the final moments of jury deliberations. Affirming Peek\u2019s murder conviction would require that we hold constitutional a trial procedure in which 1) the lone juror to reserve a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt is excused because he became nervous and upset; 2) the juror is excused without first being interrogated by the trial court, notwithstanding that the juror was available for that purpose; 3) the decision to excuse the juror is assented to by defendant\u2019s counsel outside defendant\u2019s presence and without consultation with the defendant; and 4) the juror is replaced by an alternate juror without any supplemental instruction whatsoever to the alternate or the other jurors, moments after which a guilty verdict is returned. This we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">For a fuller understanding of the circumstances in which juror Greeson was excused, we begin by reproducing here the entire proceeding as shown on the record beginning at 10:27 p.m., when the jury retired to consider its verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">THE JURY IS OUT OF THE COURTROOM AT 10:27 P.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">THE COURT: Mr. Briley, any exceptions to the Charge on behalf of the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aur\">MR.

The Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia, the court which entertained the state habeas petition, did not make specific findings of fact arid conclusions of law with respect to this primary question; rather its determination is in general terms and narrative in form.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court found that after the jury had deliberated on its verdict for three hours, the foreman \u201cemerged from the jury room and told the judge that one of the jurors was sick,\u201d that after the trial judge announced that Greeson was unable to continue as a juror, \u201cthe first alternate was sent to the jury room and a guilty verdict was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>turned a few minutes later\u201d; and that the trial judge did not err \u201cwhen it had been made to appear to the court a juror was ill and unable to continue.\u201d The court then stated that although Greeson had a reasonable doubt concerning Peek\u2019s guilt, \u201che was not asserting that doubt in the form of a certain vote<footnotemark>2a</footnotemark> in the jury room but was, because of his physical and emotional condition not participating in the deliberations at all.\u201d The habeas court concluded: \u201c[T]he replacement of juror Greeson with the first alternate Weinstein was done for good cause. The procedure followed complied with applicable Georgia statutes and did not violate any federal constitutional rights of Petitioner.\u201d The court went on to state that \u201calternate Weinstein testified that he went over the evidence with the other jurors,\u201d and concluded that the amount of time the jury deliberated with alternate Weinstein before returning the guilty verdict was of \u201cno legal significance.\u201d No decisional law was cited in support of the court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">At the threshold of reaching a decision, we face the conformance with the provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981) <em>(Mata I), </em>and <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982) <em>(Mata II). </em>In <em>Mata II, </em>the Supreme Court characterized the holding in its prior decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">We-held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) requires federal courts in habeas proceedings to accord a presumption of correctness to the state court findings____ We held that if a federal court concludes that a presumption of correctness does not control, it must provide a written explanation of the' reasoning that led it to conclude that one or more of the seven factors listed in \u00a7 2254 were present or the reasoning which led it to conclude that the state finding was \u201cnot fairly supported by the record.\u201d 449 U.S. at 551 [101 S.Ct. at 771].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">455 U.S. at 593, 102 S.Ct. at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">In the instant case, the state habeas court, after an evidentiary hearing, made purported findings with respect to the replacement of juror Greeson by alternate juror Weinstein. Because none of the first seven factors listed in \u00a7 2254(d) is present, <em>Mata II </em>directs us to defer to those findings unless they are not fairly supported by the record. Upon a close examination of the historical facts occurring during the trial as shown by both the trial record and the habeas hearing, we are unable to say that all the state habeas \u201cfindings\u201d find support in the record, and therefore we need not give them the presumption of correctness to which they would otherwise be entitled. (The magistrate to whom the district court referred the federal habeas claim based his recommended findings and conclusions, which were adopted by the district court, upon the state court record and the evidence submitted to the state habeas court. He conducted no additional evidentiary hearing. His findings parallel the state court's findings. We conclude, therefore, that the magistrate\u2019s findings, though entitled to our respect and consideration, have no binding effect per se upon our decision.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">The trial record and the supplementation evidence submitted to the habeas court depict a story significantly different from the impressions gained from the state habeas court\u2019s factual commentary. To bring that story into full focus, we refer to the evidence submitted to the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">Juror Greeson testified that deliberations had been under way for what seemed to be three or four hours, when he began to get \u201csick.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He indicated that his sickness was due not to physical illness, but rather to the \u201cpressure of the decision.\u201d (H.C. I Tr. 21). Greeson further recalled that be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tween thirty and forty minutes prior to his removal, the jury had shifted to eleven to one in favor of guilt, he being the one holdout. (H.C. I Tr. 22-24). Greeson testified that he remembered in particular the portion of the trial court\u2019s instruction charging members of the jury to acquit the defendant if they harbored a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt; Greeson further testified that he had such a doubt with respect to the guilt of Peek.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Greeson recalled that as time passed with the jury deadlocked at eleven to one, his nervousness and upset condition intensified and it began to seem as if he could not make a decision. The foreperson discussed the problem with him and the two agreed it would be best if Greeson were excused. Greeson recollected that the foreperson then left the jury room to talk over the matter with the judge, and shortly thereafter returned and notified Greeson that he had been dismissed. Prior to his dismissal, he did not speak with the trial court, nor was he voir dired by any party. He further recalled that as he left to go home, he encountered the trial judge and the judge asked him if he needed to go to the hospital. Greeson responded, \u201cNo. I believe I\u2019ll be all right in a little bit,\u201d and drove himself home. He also testified that once outside, he began to feel better. (H.C. I Tr. 20-21).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Lawrence Smith, the jury foreman, testified after Greeson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He recalled that at midnight, when he requested an additional fifteen minutes for deliberation, \u201ca division\u201d existed in the jury and that he had no recollection as to whether Greeson was ill at the time. (H.C. I Tr. 38-39). He also testified that around midnight, Greeson\u2019s complexion reddened and he began to perspire and make frequent trips to the rest room. Smith stated that Greeson became \u201cuncooperative\u201d and that Greeson\u2019s conduct was not \u201cmy idea of jury deliberation.\u201d (H.C. I Tr. 52-53). Smith also indicated that everyone had agreed to a verdict but Greeson, and that Greeson ceased to participate in deliberations, although he continued to cast his vote in favor of acquittal. The foreperson also testified that he spoke to Greeson, and that it was the consensus of the jury that he be excused. While Smith first remembered testifying that he then told the trial court that Greeson was sick, he corrected himself and stated that he probably told the court that Greeson was extremely nervous. (H.C. I Tr. 44). He further indicated that the possibility of postponing deliberations until morning was never discussed. Finally, Smith recalled that after alternate Weinstein entered the jury room, a verdict was reached in a \u201cshort time,\u201d in fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel, W. Seaborne Ashley, Jr., testified. He indicated the trial judge summoned him and the district attorney over to the side of the bench where the judge and the foreman were talking. Counsel recalled the foreman stating that one of the jurors had withdrawn and become pale. The county sheriff, a fifth party to the conversation, then left to confirm whether Greeson had any past medical problems. (H.C. I Tr. 93). When the sheriff returned shortly thereafter, he said that Greeson had a history of having a mild form of epilepsy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court asked both the district attorney and counsel whether Greeson should be excused. Counsel testified that he did not oppose the excusal because he understood that the jury was split nine to three. (H.C. I Tr. 93). He further testified that, had he known that the jury was split eleven to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>one, he would not have concurred in Greeson\u2019s discharge. He also remarked that he did not confer with petitioner prior to informing the court that he had no objection to the excusal of Greeson.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Weinstein testified that he had been the first alternate, and had been in the courthouse from 9:00 a.m. until he was placed on the jury at 3:00 a.m., the following morning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (H.C. I Tr. 57, 74). He expressed confusion as to how much time elapsed from the time that he entered the jury room until a verdict was reached. While he stated that that period of time was \u201ca very short time,\u201d he recalled that it was long enough for him to be informed of the high points of the case. (H.C. I Tr. 59-60). Yet, he later confirmed that, upon his entry into the jury room, the decision on guilt \u201cdidn\u2019t take long,\u201d and that it was not until the penalty phase of the trial that the jury went over the highlights of the case in his presence. (H.C. I Tr. 77-78).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">At a second hearing held before the state habeas court on December 14, 1979, the state offered the testimony of the prosecuting attorney and the deposition of the trial court. The prosecutor recalled that when the foreperson approached the bench to explain to the court the problem with a juror, he and defense counsel were called to the bench, but neither participated in the discussion. (H.C. II Tr. 5). He recalled that the foreperson stated that one of the jurors was in a highly emotional state. (H.C. II Tr. 5). He then recalled that the foreperson momentarily returned to the jury room, and returned to the courtroom to say that the juror did not feel like continuing, and that the juror did not want to \u201cmake a big deal of the situation.\u201d (H.C. II Tr. 6). While the prosecutor stated that he did not hear any specific conversation as to how the jury was split, he did gain \u201cthe impression\u201d that juror Greeson was in the minority, and that certain jurors were trying to get him to commit himself one way or another. (H.C. II Tr. 9). He further testified that after the court had replaced Greeson with alternate Weinstein, the jury reached its verdict of guilty in \u201cplus or minus five minutes.\u201d (H.C. II Tr. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In his deposition, the trial judge recalled that at midnight, all the jurors had been in the jury box when they had requested fifteen more minutes to deliberate. (Duke Dep. 22). During that time, he testified that he noticed nothing unusual about any of the jurors. He recalled that the jury had been deliberating for roughly three hours at this time. (Duke Dep. 5). He was first informed that one juror was having a problem when the foreperson came into the courtroom and said one juror- was in \u201cmighty bad shape.\u201d (Duke Dep. 3). After calling the district attorney and defense counsel to the bench, he learned that the juror, Greeson, was nervous rather than physically ill. (Duke Dep. 6). At this point, Sheriff Wyatt, who was also present at the bench conference, stated that he thought that Greeson had a history of epileptic seizures, and the judge sent the sheriff to check on this. (Duke Dep. 4). After the sheriff returned, the court discharged juror Greeson without objection of either party. (Duke Dep. 4-6). He indicated that he excused Greeson to avert the risk that the juror would go into epileptic seizure, and he stated that his decision not to interrogate Greeson personally was made in light of the foreman\u2019s remark that the jur- or wished to avoid embarrassment. The court then ordered Weinstein, the first alternate, into the jury room to join the deliberations. After Greeson exited the jury room, the judge talked to him. The judge recalled that Greeson seemed to have been perspiring and seemed \u201chighly nervous.\u201d (Duke Dep. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">The trial judge stated that he did not recall having inquired of the foreperson as to the split of the jury at the time he was first approached by the foreperson, but indicated that \u201cif the record shows otherwise, I stand corrected.\u201d (Duke Dep. 13). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>He further remarked that he felt that after Weinstein joined the jury, the verdict was not returned for thirty to forty-five minutes, but he was not sure of this estimation. (Duke Dep. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Based on our careful review of all the evidence, we do not find fair support for the conclusion that juror Greeson was \u201cill\u201d such that he was unable to perform his duty as a juror. To the contrary, we believe the evidence shows that he was performing his duty, but not voting for a conviction when he in good conscience was unable to do so. The record demonstrates that Greeson was very nervous because of the pressure he was under, but his condition was understandable \u2014 he was the lone holdout after fifteen hours of proceedings in a murder trial. Moreover, the record does not support the conclusion that Greeson was dismissed because of his nervous condition alone, but rather shows that the trial judge, and the attorneys who agreed to dismissal, were under the misapprehension that Greeson was epileptic. There is no evidence in the record that Greeson was, or is, suffering from epilepsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We turn now to the legal consequences of the dismissal of juror Greeson and the substitution with juror Weinstein. Juror Greeson was excused and replaced by alternate juror Weinstein pursuant to Georgia statute \u00a7 15-12-172:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">15-12-172. Replacement of incapacitated juror; effect of replacement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">If at any time, whether before or after final submission of the case to the jury, a juror dies, becomes ill, upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his duty, or is discharged for other legal cause, the first alternate juror shall take the place of the first juror becoming incapacitated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">A dismissal of a juror where there has been an inadequate showing of the statutory conditions would, of course, violate the statute: it may also violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. An erroneous replacement of a juror can in certain circumstances deprive a defendant of his right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal, his sixth amendment right to a fair, impartial and representative jury, and his due process rights grounded in the entitlement to procedures mandated by state law. <em>See Green v. Zant, </em>715 F.2d 551, 555-56 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">There can be no doubt that fundamental due process, and the right to a fair and impartial jury, entitles a defendant in a criminal case to be tried by the jury originally selected to determine his guilt or innocence, but subject to certain well-defined exceptions. This \u201cvalued right,\u201d implicitly recognized in <em>United States v. Perez, </em>9 Wheat. 579, 66 L.Ed. 165, and <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949), must \u201cin some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in jury verdicts.\u201d <em>Wade v. Hunter, supra, </em>336 U.S. at 689. One such instance is when a jury is hopelessly deadlocked. In that event, the judge may discharge the jury and order a new trial. <em>United States v. Perez, supra, </em>9 Wheat, at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">Also, the rules in many jurisdictions, like the Georgia rule, permit replacement of a regular juror with an alternate juror, whenever -the regular juror because of his physical or mental condition or for other \u201cjust\u201d cause can no longer function. For example, Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c) permits this procedure in federal prosecution at any time before the jury starts its deliberations. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>573 F.2d 330 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When the applicable rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>also permits replacements after deliberations begin, the change in the jury composition does not abridge the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights if good cause is shown for the dismissal and the jury, with its new member, is instructed to begin its deliberations anew. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 992-93 (5th Cir.1981). <em>But cf. People v. Ryan, </em>19 N.Y.2d 100, 278 N.Y.S.2d 199, 224 N.E.2d 710 (1966) (New York constitution prohibits substitution of jurors after jury deliberations begin).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">There is another constitutional dimension in this case. Georgia law provides that no criminal defendant may be convicted by less than a unanimous jury; should the jury be unable to agree, a mistrial must be declared. <em>Maddox v. State, </em>233 Ga. 874, 213 S.E.2d 654 (1975); W. Daniel, <em>Georgia Criminal Trial Practice </em>629 (2d ed. 1982); A. Shulman, W. Shulman, <em>Georgia Practice and Procedure </em>(4th ed. 1975). Although a state defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury is not a constitutional necessity,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Georgia has preserved the right as a matter of state law, and may not arbitrarily deny that right to particular defendants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFK\">Generally the failure of a state court to comply with the provisions of state law in its criminal trials is purely a matter of local concern and is not reviewable by federal courts under the due process clause of the federal constitution. The failure of a state to afford a particular defendant the benefit of established procedures under state law may, however, result in a denial of due process when the error made by the state court renders the state proceedings so fundamentally unfair or so fundamentally deficient that they are inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ-\"><em>Klimas v. Mabry, </em>599 F.2d 842, 848 (8th Cir.1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>448 U.S. 444, 100 S.Ct. 2755, 65 L.Ed.2d 897 (1980) (citations omitted); <em>see also Braley v. Gladden, </em>403 F.2d 858 (9th Cir.1968); <em>cf Gonsior v. Craven, </em>449 F.2d 20, 22 (9th Cir.1971). Thus, the trial court\u2019s failure to inquire into a juror\u2019s purported incapacity before the juror is excused acquires constitutional significance insofar as failure to make such an inquiry threatens to deprive the defendant of due process. Should a trial court make inadequate inquiry and improperly remove a juror when he is not incapacitated, thereby effectively denying the defendant his entitlement under Georgia law to a mistrial if the jury is less than unanimous, the defendant\u2019s conviction may well be regarded as inconsistent with due process and the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Whether analyzed as a fifth, sixth, or fourteenth amendment question, a fundamental concern in a case such as this is protecting the deliberative process of the jury. A just result of a trial cannot be reached if there is an inappropriate interference with or intrusion upon the deliberative process. When considering whether to replace a juror after deliberations have begun, the failure to take adequate safeguards can produce two negative consequences. First, inadequate inquiry can result in the removal of a juror who simply cannot in good conscience vote for conviction when the other jurors all agree. Yet, a jury verdict must be in accordance with the decision of each individual juror, and each juror is entitled to be free from coercion by the judge or fellow members of the jury. Each juror is required to consult with his fellow jurors and listen to their views in arriving at what he considers to be the correct verdict. At the same time, he should not \u201csurrender his honest conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>of the opinions of his fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Second, when substitution is necessary, the failure to instruct the jury to begin anew with their deliberations might result in a premature verdict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Views of the other jurors may have become hardened before the alternate has had an opportunity to participate in the deliberations. Moreover, when the others have already agreed that the accused is guilty, the inherent coercive effect upon the alternate juror is substantial. <em>See United States v. Lamb, </em>529 F.2d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We conclude that in this case the cumulative effect of the trial judge\u2019s failure to make a reliable determination of whether Greeson was incapacitated, his failure to ensure that Greeson understood his right to adhere to his view that Peek should be acquitted, and his failure to instruct the reconstituted jury to begin anew deprived Peek of his constitutional right to a trial by a fair and impartial jury and deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The trial court failed to conduct in open court a recorded inquiry into the basis for substituting alternate Weinstein for Greeson. As the record reflects, the initial conversation between the foreman and the judge was off the record. Neither Greeson nor any of the other jurors, nor Peek, are shown to be present when the decision was made to substitute the juror. Furthermore, the jury had been participating in the trial for fifteen consecutive hours except for meals and brief recesses when the substitution was made. No inquiry was made of Greeson, however, as to whether a night\u2019s recess would relieve his nervous tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">The most grievous part of the process is reflected by the trial judge\u2019s comment on the record at the time: \u201cWell, I think we ought to have the foreman to advise the, after Mr. Geeslin [sic] leaves, to advise the panel that we are not going to just, you know, start excusing at random____\u201d This strongly suggests that the trial court thought there was nothing wrong with allowing a juror to opt out of further jury participation. The habeas testimony clearly reflects that Greeson thought the evidence failed to show that Peek was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that he felt the disapproving pressure of the other eleven, and that a suggestion was made that he seek to be excused. Again, we state the obvious: alternate jurors do not serve to substitute for minority jurors who cannot agree with the majority. The trial court should have made adequate inquiry in open court to determine what steps to take: an overnight recess; an Allen-type charge; a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">After excusing Greeson, the trial court compounded the problem by sending alternate Weinstein in without instructing the jury to recommence deliberations. Whether the jury returned in three minutes as shown by the record, or in 15-30 minutes as suggested by several trial participants at the habeas proceeding, the deliberations were flawed in the absence of instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">Given all the circumstances of this case, we also cannot conclude that Peek was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s omissions. As we have already stated, the implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>state court finding that juror Greeson was too ill to serve as a juror is not fairly supported by the record as a whole. .If juror Greeson was not incapacitated, his replacement with juror Weinstein was clearly prejudicial to the defendant. <em>See Rodriguez, supra, </em>573 F.2d at 332. <em>See also Green, supra, </em>715 F.2d at 556-57.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Accepting the state habeas court\u2019s finding that \u201cit had been made to appear to the Court that a juror was ill and unable to continue\u201d does not affect our conclusion. Neither the sheriff nor the jury foreman who made it appear that juror Greeson was ill was a neutral party in the matter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The need to make inquiries of juror Greeson himself should have been apparent. If the trial court had questioned juror Greeson, he would have learned that the jury was split 11-1 and that Greeson had a reasonable doubt about Peek\u2019s guilt. There is no evidence that juror Greeson was incompetent to understand the issues at the time he was excused, or that he was not discussing the case with other jurors until immediately prior to his discharge. Knowing the source of Greeson\u2019s upset condition and aware that he had been serving for over fifteen consecutive hours in a capital case, we believe that an alternative other than substitution, with no further jury instructions, was the constitutionally-mandated course. Furthermore, there is also no need to speculate as to the prejudice Peek suffered as a result of the replacement since the verdict in this case ultimately was returned within minutes after the substitution was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Finally, the district court below held that even if the trial court erred in excusing juror Greeson, the defendant waived his right to challenge the dismissal by stipulating to Greeson\u2019s removal and substitution. When the jury foreman approached the court to request that juror Greeson be excused, the judge was off the bench, in a corner of the courtroom. (Deposition of Judge Duke at 30-31; Resp. ex. # 4 v. II at 28). The conference at which counsel stipulated to Greeson\u2019s dismissal took place there in the corner, parties present including the judge, the foreman, the district attorney, defense counsel and the sheriff. (Deposition of Judge Dukes at 26-27). Peek\u2019s trial counsel testified at the state habeas hearing that he stipulated to having juror Greeson excused without informing the defendant or receiving the defendant\u2019s approval. (Resp. ex. #4 v. I at 107-08).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In <em>Patton v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">the maintenance of the jury as a fact finding body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a place in our traditions, that, before any waiver can become effective, the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">281 U.S. 276, 312, 50 S.Ct. 253, 263, 74 L.Ed. 854 (1930). <em>Patton </em>has since been interpreted to require that the defendant himself, and not merely defendant\u2019s counsel, approve a stipulation before it can operate as a waiver of the defendant\u2019s rights respecting the jury that tries him. <em>See United States v. Virginia Erection Corp., </em>335 F.2d 868 (4th Cir.1964); <em>cf. United States v. Baccari, </em>489 F.2d 274 (10th Cir. 1973). At the very least, such a stipulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>must be entered into with the defendant\u2019s knowing and intelligent acquiescence. <em>Leser v. United States, </em>358 F.2d 313 (9th Cir.1966), <em>petition for cert. dismissed, </em>385 U.S. 802, 87 S.Ct. 10, 17 L.Ed.2d 49 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Here, however, the defendant was not among the parties present when the stipulation was agreed to; given that defense counsel never discussed the matter with him, the first time the defendant can have known anything about the stipulation to excuse Greeson is when the court went on the record as saying that the parties had so agreed. Consequently, we decline to hold that the defendant waived his right to challenge any constitutional improprieties in the dismissal of juror Greeson. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded for entry of a conditional writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">ORDER OF STATE COURT IN HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">In these paragraphs, Petitioner claims that his convictions and sentences imposed are unconstitutional because an alternate juror was substituted for a juror without a showing of good cause and in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">After the jury had been deliberating for approximately three hours during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, the foreman of the jury emerged from the jury room and told the judge that one of the jurors was sick (Trial Transcript, pp. 231-232, Habeas Transcript, 4/5/79, pp. 18-29, 41, 43-45). This was not done on the record and apparently when Court was not formally in session. However, the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the sheriff were present and heard the conversation between the foreman and the judge. (Habeas Transcript, 4/5/79, pp. 92-94). The judge then announced for the record that a juror, who was misidentified as Mr. Geesling (his name was actually Mr. Greeson) was unable to continue. Both the district attorney and defense counsel agreed to excuse this juror and substitute the first alternate. (Trial Transcript, pp. 231-232, Habeas Transcript, 4/5/79, p. 94). The first alternate was sent to the jury room and a guilty verdict was returned a few minutes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> later. (Trial Transcript, pp. 232-233). The law concerning substitution of a juror is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-14\">\u201cIf at any time ... a juror ... becomes ill, or upon other good cause shown to the Court is found to be unable to perform his duty ... the first alternate jur- or shall take the place of the ... juror becoming incapacitated ...\u201d <em>Ga. Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 59-910.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">Petitioner waived any right to object to the substitution when his counsel agreed to the same. (Trial Transcript, p. 232). But even if this were not the case, it was not error for the trial court to substitute the first alternate where it had been made to appear to the Court that a juror was ill and unable to continue. <em>Tanner v. State, </em>242 Ga. 437, 438 (1978). Although there is disagreement concerning the length of time the jury deliberated with the substituted member, it is presumed that the alternate was able to cast an intelligent vote in the absence of some showing to the contrary. Although the ill juror may have had a reasonable doubt concerning the guilt of Petitioner (Habeas Transcript, 4/5/79, p. 28); he was not asserting that doubt in the form of a certain vote<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the jury room but was, because of his physical and emotional condition, not participating in the deliberations at all. (Habeas Transcript, 4/5/79, pp. 18-20, 31-32, 39-41, 51-52). Accordingly, the replacement of juror Gree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>son with first alternate Weinstein was done for good cause. The procedure followed complied with applicable Georgia statutes and did not violate any federal constitutional rights of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">On the matter of the amount of time the jury with alternate Weinstein deliberated before the guilty verdict was returned, the Court attaches no legal significance to the issue. There is no requirement that a jury take any particular amount of time to deliberate, and alternate Weinstein testified that he went over the evidence with the other jurors. (Habeas Transcript, 4/5/79, pp. 60, 70-71).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Therefore, the Court finds the claim for relief embodied in paragraphs 9, 10, and 11 to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">GREESON\u2019S STATE HABEAS CORPUS TESTIMONY IN FULL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">BY MR.

Well, it was building up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\">Q Beg pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-12\">A It was building up all the time, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-13\">THE COURT: How long had that been the division of the Jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-14\">THE WITNESS: Well, it probably had been eleven to one for approximately thirty to forty five minutes. I couldn\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-15\">THE COURT: I think that is enough on that subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-16\">BY MR. MeLARTY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-17\">Q You stated that the Foreman went out and talked to the Judge, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-18\">Did you ever talk with the Judge prior to your being excused from the Jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-19\">A No, sir. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-20\">Q Did the Judge ever make any inquiries as to whether or not you were being subjected to any pressure in the Jury room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-21\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-22\">Q He made no inquiries at all of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\">A Well, now, as far as him \u2014 no, no. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-23\">MR. ROBINSON: Will you excuse me? Just for clarification. Was the question that there were no inquiries made as to Greeson or no inquiries made at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-24\">MR. MeLARTY: No inquiries made of Mr. Greeson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-25\">THE WITNESS: To my knowledge, there wasn\u2019t. As far as him to me, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-26\">THE COURT: You are not aware of any conversations the Judge may have had about that, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-27\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-28\">BY MR.

I can\u2019t say for sure but I think maybe so. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-31\">Q Now, did the charge urge, to the best of your recollection, charge you regarding your responsibility once you had decided the particular issue, your responsibilities in the Jury room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-32\">A Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-33\">Q Do you recall what he charged you on that regard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-34\">A Well, not all of it. No, sir. But like I told you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-35\">THE COURT: Mr. Greeson, excuse me just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-36\">Mr. McLarty, I think the testimony you have of this witness is very clear and very straight forward and direct about the circumstances under which he left and I don\u2019t want to cut you off. There has been no objection. But I will caution you not to burden the record in this case with things that don\u2019t have anything to do with the issue. And I don\u2019t really think that what he remembers about the Judge\u2019s charge and all of that has anything at all to do with any possible procedural difficulty when he left the Jury. He said he was nervous and upset. He said that the cause of that was his inability to make a decision on the case. He said that it was divided eleven to one at the time and he said he left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-37\">Now, I think for this Court or any court reviewing it, it should be fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>obvious what this man\u2019s testimony about this is. And to go into a bunch of stuff about what he remembers of the Judge\u2019s charge and everything is not going to do your case any good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">But if there is no objection, I will let you go ahead with that. You\u2019ve done real well with your witness and I would just rather you not burden the record so that it will become clouded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">But go ahead.

I hate to put it like that \u2014 I mean and not give you a definite answer. I am a hypertension person. I get upset over certain things and certain things I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-13\">Q At the time that you left that Jury, was there doubt in your mind? Was there a waivering regarding the Defendant\u2019s guilt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-14\">A Yes, sir. There was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-15\">MR.

I had been on the Jury and Grand Jury several times but I have never served on a Traverse Jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-20\">Q I may ask two or three questions that may be redundant so I\u2019ll try to keep this as short as I can but I want to be sure I am clear as to what your testimony is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-22\">Did you say that during the deliberations on this case, you just got so physically ill that you did not feel you could continue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-23\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-24\">Q And because of your physical condition, you discussed with the Jury Foreman the matter of your being removed from the Jury or asking the Judge to allow you to be removed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-25\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-26\">Q And did you ask the Jury Foreman if he would ask the Judge that very question or did you ask the Judge yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-27\">A No, sir, I didn\u2019t ask him. The Foreman asked him because there was a lot of us \u2014 in other words, kind of green on that because we \u2014 lot of us never had been on a case before and we thought the Foreman was supposed to do everything. We didn't know. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-28\">Q You said you had a history of hypertension?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-29\">A Yes, sir. In the last few years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-30\">Q Meaning how long when you say the last few years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-31\">' A Well, it probably started some four years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-32\">Q Before the Jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-33\">A Well, yes, sir but it wasn\u2019t bad. I wasn\u2019t under medication and probably six months after this, I had to go on medication and continue to take it for high blood pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-34\">Q Mr. Greeson, at the time that you asked to be removed from the Jury, did you feel that you would have difficulty making a decision? Did your physical condition really bother you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-35\">Q Yes, sir, and I think \u2014 I knew I was going to have difficulty in making a decision but I think it was more the decision\u2014 in other words, the way the other eleven had decided to go and I didn\u2019t think I was \u2014 it was a combination. I was upset. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>I didn\u2019t think I could and I was \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even think any more and I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">THE COUET: Mr. Greeson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">THE WITNESS: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">THE COUET: Is it what you\u2019re saying and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth at all, but it is very important that I understand exactly what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">THE COUET: Is what you\u2019re saying that you were not going to be willing\u2014 that you were afraid you weren\u2019t going to be willing to go along with the other eleven that that upset you so much that it made you physically ill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-10\">Is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-11\">THE WITNESS: Well, Your Honor \u2014 I really don\u2019t know because it could have. Could I say that if you have never been upset and hypertension like I am \u2014 I can\u2019t explain it to you and you can\u2019t understand. In other words, it\u2019s just driving, driving, driving and you can\u2019t even think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-12\">THE COUET: Well, what I\u2019m interested in is this. We have talked about being upset. We\u2019ve talked about physical illness. But now, it is important that I understand whether you got physically ill and that made it difficult for you to think and participate' or whether the physical illness was caused by your being upset because you couldn\u2019t make a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-13\">Now, which was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-14\">THE WITNESS: Well, it was the first. I got so physically \u2014 well, mental upset that I knew I couldn\u2019t make a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-15\">THE COUET: What were you mentally upset about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-16\">THE WITNESS: Well, about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-17\">THE COUET: Well, that\u2019s what my question was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-18\">I take your testimony to be that you couldn\u2019t make a decision that evening and you got so mentally upset that that made you physically ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-19\">THE WITNESS: Yes, that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-20\">THE COUET: And so your physical illness resulted from being mentally upset because of uncertainty about the case, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-21\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Now, that\u2019s right. I hate for you to have to put words in my mouth but that is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-22\">THE COUET: Let me go at it the other way to make sure that your testimony is what I think it is. There would be two ways that you could go at this. You could be in the Jury room and be taken ill, say to feel nauseated, say you could be getting the flu or something that had nothing to do with the case. And because of that, you would feel so bad that you just couldn\u2019t think about it. That would be one kind of physical illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-23\">The other kind would be that you got so upset about the case and having to make that decision or maybe the uncertainty about it, that that nervousness and mental upset would make you feel sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-24\">Is that what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-25\">THE WITNESS: Yes. That\u2019s what happened, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-26\">THE COUET: So any physical illness you had was caused by being that upset rather than physical illness just starting or anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-27\">Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-28\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-29\">THE COUET: All right, Mr. Eobinson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-30\">ME. EOBINSON: No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-31\">THE COUET: You may go back outside. Thank you, sir.

Do you want to know about Mr. Greeson\u2019s getting sick and all that? Just ask him about that. The record will reflect how many times he came out, unless you want to show that the record was not accurate or would not reflect it or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-19\">MR. MeLARTY: That is part of what I wish to show and in addition, I wish to go into one other matter. And we can find this in Exhibit P-1 of the petition in which the Court advised the Jury that it would be very easy to go to some place for over night, to sequester the Jury. At that time, the Foreman requests a few more minutes \u2014 fifteen minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-20\">And so, that seems to be the basis for the assumption the Foreman had that the Jury was about to reach a decision and I\u2019d like to go into that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-21\">THE COURT: Okay, ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-22\">But it would be easier if you would tell him what the record reflects. Ask him if he remembers it and go from there. He can\u2019t remember what happened three years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-23\">MR.

But I do think he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>ask you questions concerning how the Jury was divided, whether there was one or more people, two or three or however they were who might have voted differently from the rest. That sort of thing. But you aren\u2019t due anybody an explanation as to how, why anybody voted some way or anything that was said in the Jury room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">I think what he wants to know is at the time that you asked for fifteen more minutes, how was the Jury divided at that point. You don\u2019t have to say how many for guilt or how many for not guilty but how many people voted one way and how many people the other. If all twelve agreed, you would have a verdict, so you did not have a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">THE WITNESS: Who was on the Jury at that time?

At times, instead of eleven to one, it was eleven to four\u2014 eleven and then it worked \u2014 it kept working down. So I really don\u2019t know at that precise minute.

At that time, I couldn\u2019t say \u2014 I mean, from memory. I mean, I would just be taking a guess.

I went out and told the Judge we had a Juror that was sick and he wanted to be excused. And he called the two attorneys up and he asked each one of them, he said, we\u2019ve got a Juror that is sick and would it be possible, you know, do they have any objections as to the Juror being relieved. And both of them said, fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-14\">Q Did the Judge inquire as to what type of sickness or what the cause of the sickness was or whether or not the Juror was just tired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-15\">Did he make any inquiries of you, at all, of that nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-16\">A I think he, more of less, just took my word that the man was sick and it was not a temporary thing.

Yeah. If that\u2019s what the record says \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s been since \u201976 and I can\u2019t remember.

I really can\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-15\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t really think you\u2019ve been evasive. It\u2019s been almost three years and I know that this has been difficult and it also is unusual that a Juror is ever called back into a court to explain what happened. Only in the most unusual circumstance would I even allow you to be questioned about this but because of the gravity of what is involved in this case and because the record reflects a fairly unusual situation with a Juror leaving and then a verdict coming in right after that, it is necessary that we go into this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-17\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-18\">THE COURT: So, I do it somewhat apologetically but we just don\u2019t have any choice.

This testimony is completely discounted by the fact that no one knew which juror was being excused. The panel had jurors Geesling and Greeson. Both were subpoenaed to the state habeas hearing to ensure the excused juror could be interrogated. It is apparent that the trial judge thought the juror was named Gees-ling <em>{see </em>text <em>supra, </em>page 675). There is no reason to think others were not mistaken. At the habeas hearing, Greeson testified he had no physical ailments at the time of the trial but since that time had been diagnosed as having mild hypertension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\">.

(The requirement of Rule 24(c) that an alternate jur- or may replace a regular juror \"prior to the time the jury retires but if there is no replacement the alternate juror must be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict\u201d is not mandatory, contrary to the holding in <em>Lamb.)

The California Supreme Court considered the rights to a unanimous verdict and to a verdict by twelve persons as elements of a broader right to a verdict by twelve jurors who have engaged together in deliberations. This right is violated if one juror has not had the benefit of the deliberations of the other eleven. Consequently, when substitution occurs, the jury should be instructed to begin anew with its entire process of deliberations and the alternate juror should participate fully in those deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b768-6\">. Unlike <em>Green, supra, </em>we see no need to remand the case to the district court before making the prejudice determination. An important distinction between <em>Green </em>and the present case is that in <em>Green </em>the district court refused to hold an evidentiary hearing or did it apply any of the factors listed in \u00a7 2254(d) so as to obviate an evidentiary hearing. Moreover, the state habeas court made no findings relating to the historical facts (that is, what happened at the trial). Here, the state habeas court conducted an evidentiary hearing and made findings, and the district court held no evidentiary hearing because it would appear that the petitioner had a \"full, fair and adequate hearing\u201d in the state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\">.

I would, however, reverse Petitioner\u2019s death sentences for reasons not addressed by my colleagues. Petitioner asserts that the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding mitigating circumstances were unconstitutionally vague. Because the instructions given in his case were virtually indistinguishable from those requiring reversal in <em>Westbrook v.

My colleagues reach this perplexing result by way of a sequence of errors, some which have been the subject of recent Supreme Court admonitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The panel\u2019s first mistake lies in failing to accord the deference due to the state habeas court\u2019s findings of fact under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Petitioner voices no objection to the adequacy of the factfinding procedures employed on state habeas. His arguments instead go to the ultimate facts as found. <em>See Sumner v. Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 597, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 1306, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982) <em>{Sumner II). </em>In <em>Sumner I, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that under such circumstances we must give effect to the findings of the state habeas court. <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 545-47, 101 S.Ct. 764, 768, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981). Of course, findings may be inferred from the factfinder\u2019s view of the facts or from clearly articulated legal principles relied on by the state court. <em>Green v. Zant, </em>715 F.2d 551, 557 (11th Cir.1983) <em>(Green I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">In sifting through the events as narrated by the state habeas court, these principal findings emerge:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">(1) Greeson harbored a reasonable doubt as to Peek\u2019s guilt;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">(2) Greeson\u2019s emotional and physical state, however, impaired his voting and participating in the deliberations;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">(3) The foreman informed Judge Duke that a juror was ill;</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">(4) Judge Duke formed the correct impression that the juror was ill and unable to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">After acknowledging that <em>Sumner II </em>requires this court to defer to the state habeas court\u2019s findings unless they are not fairly supported by the record, the majority nevertheless embarks on its own factfinding mission and comes to the remarkable conclusion that the record does not fairly support a finding that Greeson was too ill to perform his duties as a juror. This finding is particularly remarkable in light of Greeson\u2019s own testimony at the state habeas proceeding. There, Greeson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-15\">Well, I got sick \u2014 I got so upset, I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and it looked like I couldn\u2019t make a verdict____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-16\">Well, it seemed like that I couldn\u2019t make the decision and I just kept getting more</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-17\">and more upset____ And I just got so</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-18\">upset, I \u2014 it seemed like \u2014 I had to disqualify myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-19\">... I got so physically \u2014 well, mental upset that I knew I couldn\u2019t make a decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-20\">Greeson also responded affirmatively to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-21\">And so your physical illness resulted from being mentally upset because of uncertainty about the case, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-22\">Did you say that during the deliberations on this case, you just got so physically ill that you did not feel you could continue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-23\">And because of your physical condition, you discussed with the Jury Foreman the matter of your being removed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Jury or asking the judge to allow you to be removed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\">Mr. Greeson, at the time that you asked to be removed from the Jury, did you feel that you would have difficulty making a decision? Did your physical condition really bother you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The majority\u2019s finding is even more remarkable when jury foreman Smith\u2019s testimony is also considered. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">... I thought he [Greeson] was sick and ought to be excused and he agreed and everybody else in there agreed, it would be all right if he left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">Yeah, I asked him, you know, how he was feeling. I can remember doing that. I mean, the man kept going to the bathroom and he was turning a dark shade of red and sweat \u2014 I mean, his shirt was saturated with sweat. I mean, the man looked sick to me. And I imagine anybody that saw him at that time, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-12\">I mean, the man just gave me the opinion that he was sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-13\">He indicated before I came out to the Judge that he was sick and that if there was anyway, he would like to go home and that he was just ill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">The majority has been able to determine, by looking at a cold record eight years after the fact, that juror Greeson was not as sick as he or foreman Smith thought and that he could have continued to perform his duties as a juror.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In my view this is precisely the type factfinding that <em>Sumner I </em>and <em>Sumner II </em>prohibit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The majority acknowledges that a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have his trial completed by a particular jury must yield in the event it becomes necessary to replace an ill juror with an alternate. Only last year, in <em>Green I, </em>we held that constitutional error would not inhere in a trial court\u2019s failure to investigate the proffered reason for dismissal if the juror \u201cwas [] incapacitated and if a hearing would have revealed that fact to the trial court____\u201d A defendant would not be \u201cprejudiced by the [trial] court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing\u201d to the extent a subsequent hearing substantiated cause. 715 F.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In this case, juror Greeson was unquestionably ill, too ill to debate or vote. At the state habeas hearing, he freely stated that he had been ill and had asked to be relieved. Because no prejudice therefore emanated from the decision to dismiss Greeson, Petitioner\u2019s claim must fail. <em>See Green II, </em>738 F.2d at 1533.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The majority ignores <em>Green II </em>and goes awry in reading <em>Green I </em>to require reversal whenever the trial court conducts a lackluster investigation of cause. A rigid per se reversal rule is incompatible with the prejudice standard formulated in <em>Green I </em>and applied in <em>Green </em>//.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The inquiry envisioned in those cases can effectively occur either at trial or subsequently, upon habeas review. <em>Green II, </em>738 F.2d at 1533; <em>Green I, </em>715 F.2d at 556-57. Obviously, trial courts that initiate full-fledged inquiries will avoid the potential delay, expense, and double jeopardy possibilities inherent in retrial. Obviously, a cursory investigation of a juror\u2019s claims courts reversal. An inadequate investigation <em>requires </em>reversal, however, only if Petitioner is thereby prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">By ignoring the prejudice standard, the majority\u2019s analysis flies in the face of binding circuit precedent. This alone would necessitate dissent. My strongest reservations, however, concern the underlying rationale articulated by my colleagues rather than their departure from precedent per se. In deciding to reverse, the majority takes the unprecedented step of elevating a perceived violation of Georgia state statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ipso facto into error of constitutional stature. Unless strictly cabined, this unnecessary holding promises to expand the scope of federal habeas review beyond recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">Turning finally to the question of juror Weinstein\u2019s substitution, we must again take heed of our limited role on review. \u201c[0]ur scope of inquiry is not the broad exercise of supervisory power that appellate courts possess in regard to federal district courts.\u201d <em>Green I, </em>715 F.2d at 556. \u201cBefore a state prisoner may prevail, he must show that the asserted error is of constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">To date, the only circuit court that has grappled with the question has concluded that no constitutional error attends the substitution of an alternate after the jury has retired due to lack of supplementary instructions to recommence deliberations. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>635 F.2d 1124, 1127-28 (4th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 943, 101 S.Ct. 3090, 69 L.Ed.2d 958 (1981). In <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1982), we described the rationale of <em>Evans </em>with approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-14\">In <em>Evans, </em>the trial court replaced a regular juror with an alternate after the jury had begun deliberations; however, the defendant expressed himself unequivocally in favor of proceeding with the newly constituted jury. The newly constituted jury was not specifically instructed to begin its deliberations anew, but rather was told only to continue its deliberations. Nevertheless, the appellate court concluded that the \u201cspeculative assertion of prejudice <em>..., </em>to which no objection was raised, was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to justify reversal,\u201d stating that \u201c[n]othing <em>precluded </em>the jury from starting from the very beginning all over again.\u201d 635 F.2d at 1128 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">664 F.2d at 992 n. 16. Based on <em>Evans </em>and other authority, the <em>Phillips </em>court concluded that supplementary instructions to deliberate anew would satisfy constitutional requirements. <em>Phillips, </em>however, never purported to mandate such instructions as a matter of constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">As in <em>Evans, </em>defense counsel failed to request the instruction whose omission Petitioner now deplores. Similarly, nothing in the original proceedings hindered the jury from beginning deliberations all over again. The state habeas court found that the jury reviewed the case for juror Weinstein\u2019s benefit after he joined the jury. Weinstein had listened to the entire trial and was present for the charge to the original jury. Since the prejudice that Petitioner alleges, <em>see Green I, </em>715 F.2d at 557, is speculative at best, I am unable to conclude that the circumstances surrounding alternate Weinstein\u2019s substitution were fundamentally unfair in derogation of Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">. Petitioner raises the following additional grounds for reversing his conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">(a) An asserted error in the district court\u2019s failure to provide Petitioner with an evidentiary hearing to redress the fact that transcripts of the state court proceedings had never been reviewed by a habeas court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-24\">(b) An alleged denial of Petitioner's constitutional right to a fair trial arising from the fact that one of the jurors was allowed to go home for lunch without Petitioner\u2019s consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-25\">(c) An allegedly unconstitutional exclusion of minorities from the grand and petit juries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-26\">All three contentions lack merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">. According to the majority, Greeson at state habeas indicated that his sickness was due not to physical illness but rather to emotional distress brought on by the numerical division of the jury which had shifted to eleven to one in favor of guilt, Greeson being the lone holdout. This distinction is irrelevant. Petitioner has never accused foreman Smith of lying about Greeson\u2019s incapacity. Nor has Petitioner intimated that the other jurors bullied Greeson into a state of emotional and physical collapse. In lieu of fraud or duress, I am unable to conclude as a matter of constitutional right that a mistrial must issue whenever a juror, in agonizing over a verdict, lapses into incapacity. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>654 F.2d 1328, 1333 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1157, 102 S.Ct. 1032, 71 L.Ed.2d 315 (1982). <em>Cf. Green v. Zant, </em>738 F.2d 1529, 1531-33 (11th Cir.1984) <em>(Green II) </em>(dismissal of a juror who was so ill that she could not continue deliberations not of constitutional significance). Nor does the Constitution require us to reverse a trial judge who incorrectly evaluates an impaired juror's prospects for rapid recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\">. In addition, the majority\u2019s indictment of Judge Duke\u2019s inquiry is replete with factual inaccuracies and judicial overreaching. My colleagues incorrectly state that \"Greeson testified he had no physical ailments at the time of the trial but since that time had been diagnosed as having mild hypertension.\u201d In fact, Greeson testified to the contrary. He recounted that he already suffered from mild hypertension at the time of trial, a condition which began to require medication six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">The opinion fails to note that no one \u2014 neither Petitioner nor Respondent \u2014 ever queried Greeson at the state habeas hearing whether he suffered from epilepsy or any malady other than hypertension when he served on the jury. Petitioner, of course, bore the burden of ruling out the possibility of epilepsy on habeas review. <em>Bentley v. Willis, </em>247 Ga. 461, 276 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">The opinion goes on to discredit the trial court\u2019s investigation by finding that \"no one knew which juror [Greeson or Geesling] was being excused.\u201d It is clear after <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982), however, that it is the sole province of the habeas trial court, not the appellate court, to resolve disputed facts. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 102 S.Ct. at 1791. That admonition extends to the questions whether Greeson had epilepsy and whether the sheriff understood that it was Greeson who was in distress. Were such facts determinative, the proper course would be remand. Under the precepts of <em>Green I, </em>however, no remand is necessary because voir dire would have revealed that Greeson was on the verge of breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-17\">Since the trial court had cause to excuse Greeson, it was free to dismiss him over counsel\u2019s objection. <em>See United States v. Dominguez, </em>615 F.2d 1093, 1095-96 (5th Cir.1980). In this case, of course, defense counsel expressly stipulated to the substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-18\">The majority discerns a \u201cgrievous\u201d disregard for Petitioner\u2019s rights in the trial judge\u2019s comment that \"we are not going to ... start excusing at random.\" This inference is wholly unwarranted. The comment, coming as it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>after the trial court had concluded its probe, instead reflects the court's refusal to dismiss a juror except for good cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-10\">. The majority asserts that \"there is also no need to speculate as to the prejudice Peek suffered as a result of the replacement since the verdict in this case ultimately was returned within minutes after the substitution was made,\" however, they cite no authority for this novel proposition. <em>Compare Green II, </em>738 F.2d at 1533 (finding no prejudice resulted from dismissing and replacing an ill juror who was in the minority opposing imposition of the death penalty even though the jury ultimately sentenced the defendant to death).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-16\">. This determination is reached by importing the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c), or rather its supposed requirements, into the provisions of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-12-172. Significantly, none of the Georgia courts that have reviewed Petitioner\u2019s claim has discerned a violation of that passage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"Ahg\">Before GODBOLD, Chief Judge, RO-NEY, TJOFLAT, HILL, FAY, VANCE, KRAVITCH, JOHNSON, HENDERSON, HATCHETT, ANDERSON and CLARK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<author id=\"b785-8\">BY THE COURT:</author>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">A member of this court in active service having requested a poll on the application for rehearing en banc and a majority of the judges in this court in active service having voted in favor of granting a rehearing en banc,</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">IT IS ORDERED that the cause shall be reheard by this court en banc <em>with </em>oral argument on a date hereafter to be fixed.
