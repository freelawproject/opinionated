NARUC claims that the FCC lacks authority under the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (the \u201cAct\u201d), and relevant case law to regulate the use of an intrastate WATS service, even when that service is used as part of an interstate communications network. NARUC also claims that the FCC acted arbitrarily and capriciously because it failed to make new findings of fact to support its decision in addition to findings it had made in 1980. We affirm the FCC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-21\">The American Telephone and Telegraph Company (\u201cAT &amp; T\u201d) operates an interstate telecommunications network and offers several different forms of long distance service. Long Distance Message Telecommunications Service (\u201cMTS\u201d) is the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>nary long distance service, and it allows users both to place and receive calls. Charges for MTS calls are based on use with a toll being assessed for each call. In contrast, AT &amp; T\u2019s WATS subscribers are usually entitled to unlimited use of the WATS service in exchange for a fixed fee. Accordingly, WATS is widely used by businesses and other high volume consumers in the long distance telecommunications market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-4\">The WATS and MTS systems are both heavily regulated by the FCC, which has substantial authority over the entire telecommunications industry. The Commission\u2019s authority allows it to control entry into and exit from the industry, to require just and reasonable rates, and to mandate interconnections between carriers. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 214(a), 201(a) &amp; (b) (1982). Since the early 1960\u2019s, the telephone carriers have been allowed to offer interstate WATS systems through tariffs on file with the FCC. Intrastate WATS systems on the other hand have been made available only subject to tariffs approved by the appropriate state regulatory commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-5\">For many years AT <em>&amp; </em>T and the other long distance carriers limited resale and sharing of their services through restrictions in their tariffs. As a result, it was illegal for any entity to subscribe to a long distance service and then, after adding value, resell it for a profit. <em>See Report &amp; Order, </em>60 F.C.C.2d 261, 271 (1976). Similarly, it was also illegal for several consumers to combine and use a single long distance service collectively with each consumer paying according to his pro rata usage. <em>See </em>60 F.C.C.2d at 263. Both the practices of resale and sharing were viewed as threatening because they would have undermined AT &amp; T\u2019s legal monopoly as the sole provider of long distance service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-6\">Beginning in 1974, the FCC became concerned that the prohibition of resale and sharing was working to segment markets and sustain harmful price discrimination. Prohibition was having this effect because it prevented resellers and sharers from putting pressure on AT &amp; T to help insure that its rates were cost-based. Such pressure might have been generated if arbitragers had been allowed to purchase discounted services such as WATS and then resell them to smaller users as a substitute for MTS. In that situation, AT &amp; T would be forced to reset its long distance WATS and MTS rates to make them cost-based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-8\">In light of these concerns, the FCC commenced a proceeding that led to a 1976 decision outlawing tariff restrictions on the resale and sharing of long distance private line services. <em>See Resale &amp; Shared Use, Notice of Inquiry &amp; Proposed Rulemaking, </em>47 F.C.C.2d 644, 48 F.C.C.2d 1077 (1974), <em>Report &amp; Order, </em>60 F.C.C.2d 261 (1976), <em>Reconsideration Order, </em>62 F.C.C.2d 588 (1977), <em>aff'd, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. FCC, </em>572 F.2d 17 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 875, 99 S.Ct. 213, 58 L.Ed.2d 190 (1978). These services differ from MTS and WATS in that they are made available in bulk at low rates for consumers with substantial long distance communications needs between two or more selected locations. In its 1976 decision, the Commission expressly left open the question of the lawfulness of resale and sharing restrictions on MTS and WATS, explaining that issues involving those services had not been adequately addressed in the record. In an opinion by Judge Meskill, the Second Circuit sustained the Commission\u2019s action after accepting its conclusion that resale and sharing would encourage cost-related pricing, thus leading to more efficient utilization of communications facilities. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. FCC, </em>572 F.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-9\">On July 27, 1979, MCI Telecommunications Corp. (\u201cMCI\u201d) petitioned the FCC to institute a new rulemaking that would extend the 1976 decision to AT &amp; T\u2019s interstate WATS services. Specifically, MCI asked the Commission to outlaw all of AT &amp; T\u2019s prohibitions on resale and sharing in its WATS and MTS tariffs in the interstate market. On December 18, 1980, the Commission granted MCI\u2019s petition after concluding that the tariff restrictions on resale and sharing were \u201cunjust, unreasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>... discriminatory, and hence unlawful under Sections 201(b) and 202(a) of the Communications Act.\u201d <em>Resale &amp; Shared Use, </em>83 F.C.C.2d 167, 168 (1980). The Commission based its decision in part on an extensive analysis of the economic impact of legalizing resale and sharing. The Commission concluded that resale and sharing would reduce harmful price discrimination by pressuring AT &amp; T to make its WATS and MTS rates cost-based. <em>Id. </em>at 175-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-4\">On June 7, 1982, Satellite Business Systems (\u201cSBS\u201d) commenced the instant litigation by asking the Commission to clarify the scope of its 1980 decision in <em>Resale &amp; Shared Use, </em>83 F.C.C.2d 167. Specifically, SBS sought a Declaratory Ruling that all state tariff prohibitions against resale and sharing of intrastate WATS were \u201cunlawful ... when these services are used by an interstate carrier for the termination of interstate services.\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 1. SBS, an intervenor in this appeal, is a licensed interstate communications common carrier. Among other services, SBS offers voice services that compete with AT &amp; T\u2019s WATS and MTS offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-5\">Primarily, SBS provides voice services through its own earth stations and satellites. However, it is not economically feasible for SBS to obtain enough earth stations to gain access to each of the approximately 17,000 local exchanges in the country. J.A. at 4. Accordingly, when SBS customers place calls to areas where SBS does not have earth stations, SBS leases services from the former local Bell System Operating Companies (\u201cBSOCs\u201d) and then resells them to its customers. However, the prohibitions on resale and sharing in the state tariffs of most BSOCs prevent SBS from using intrastate WATS for this purpose. As a result, SBS is often required to route its calls to an earth station far outside the state to which the call is going. SBS then uses an interstate WATS system to deliver the call, since the Commission\u2019s 1980 order unquestionably permits the resale of interstate WATS. According to SBS, this method is not merely inefficient and expensive, but also frequently causes signal quality to diminish.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other interstate communications carriers such as MCI and Western Union Telegraph Co. agree with SBS that service could be improved by legalizing resale of intrastate WATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-8\">SBS claimed in its petition to the FCC that both judicial and agency precedent gave the Commission jurisdiction over all interstate communications even if they were made on physically intrastate WATS lines. As SBS noted, the \u201ckey issue in determining the jurisdiction over facilities used to provide service is the nature of the communications which pass[] through the facility, and not the physical location of the lines.\u201d J.A. at 6, <em>quoting New York Telephone Co., </em>76 F.C.C.2d 349, 352, <em>aff'd sub nom. New York Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>631 F.2d 1059 (2d Cir.1980). Moreover, SBS claimed that the economic benefits made available by the Commission\u2019s 1980 decision in <em>Resale &amp; Shared Use </em>would be extended if the Commission legalized the resale of intrastate WATS services used as part of an interstate communications network. SBS claimed that \u201cso long as [it was] prohibited from using intrastate WATS ... it [would] be forced to utilize expensive and ... inefficient routing patterns\u201d to the detriment of its interstate customers. J.A. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>On June 15, 1982, the FCC announced that it was seeking public comments on SBS\u2019s petition. A number of state regulatory commissions and NARUC<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> generally opposed the petition on the grounds that intrastate WATS, even when used as part of an interstate communications service, was explicitly exempted from FCC jurisdiction by sections 2(b) and 221(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 152(b) and 221(b) (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Opposing comments to SBS\u2019s petition were also filed by AT &amp; T on behalf of the BSOCs. AT &amp; T agreed that the FCC had jurisdiction over the WATS service in question but urged the Commission to let the states legalize resale and sharing at their own pace. Finally, MCI, Western Union Telegraph Co., and various other interstate carriers and users filed comments in support of SBS\u2019s petition. MCI commented that \u201cthere can be no question that the Commission does have jurisdiction in this matter\u201d and accordingly it urged the FCC to \u201cissue the required declaratory ruling.\u201d J.A. at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-4\">On February 4, 1983, the Commission issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting SBS\u2019s petition. J.A. at 168. The Commission first asserted that it had jurisdiction over intrastate WATS systems where they are used to complete interstate communications. In the Commission\u2019s view, it is \u201cby now well-established\u201d that \u201cjurisdiction turns on the nature of the communications, rather than the location of the facilities links through which they pass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172. In this case, the Commission observed that there was no dispute \u201cthat the intrastate WATS connections sought here would be used to terminate communications which originate in other states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Commission concluded that it could assert jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-12\">Upon reaching the merits, the Commission based its decision entirely on the factual record developed in the 1980 proceeding on <em>Resale &amp; Shared Use, </em>83 F.C.C.2d 167. Thus, the Commission explained that although its 1980 decision had not \u201ctechnically\u201d covered resale restrictions in state tariffs, the Commission had intended by that decision to outlaw all resale and sharing restrictions affecting interstate communications. The Commission went on to note that none of the comments opposing SBS\u2019s petition had challenged the application of its 1980 economic analysis to the instant case. Accordingly, the Commission saw no reason to believe that the benefits that had resulted from its 1980 decision would not also be present with the limited resale and sharing of intrastate WATS. The Commission, therefore, rejected AT &amp; T\u2019s suggestion that it defer to the states and substantially granted SBS\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>mission emphasized, however, that its decision did \u201cnot extend to restrictions which pertain solely to the provision of WATS used in intrastate communication.\u201d J.A. at 174 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">On April 4, 1983, and without seeking reconsideration, NARUC petitioned this court for review of the Commission\u2019s decision. The People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California also petitioned for review, and the various petitions were consolidated. In addition, a number of parties intervened. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 (1982), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1) (1982), and Fed.R.App.P. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-6\">NARUC\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the Commission erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction over the resale and sharing of intrastate WATS systems. NARUC principally relies on sections 152(b) and 221(b) of the Communications Act which prohibit the FCC from regulating an intrastate communications network. NARUC claims that the Commission has exceeded its authority under the relevant case law since here the use of intrastate facilities was not absolutely required to complete an interstate communication. Accordingly, NARUC believes the Commission has encroached to an unprecedented degree on the intrastate regulatory sphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-7\">NARUC\u2019s second complaint is that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to make specific, detailed findings of fact in the instant proceeding. NARUC objects particularly to the Commission\u2019s attempt to \u201cborrow\u201d the factual findings of its 1980 <em>Resale &amp; Shared Use </em>decision. NARUC claims those findings are irrelevant because they concerned an interstate network rather than the totally intrastate system at issue here. Accordingly, NARUC claims the Commission\u2019s decision is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-8\">We consider first the jurisdictional issue and then the lawfulness of the Commission\u2019s exercise of its statutory authority. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the FCC\u2019s decision in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-13\">The Communications Act of 1934 creates a dual regulatory structure for interstate and intrastate wire communications. Interstate communications are totally entrusted to the FCC which is charged with providing \u201ca rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire ... communication service.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (1982). Purely intrastate communications, on the other hand, are to be regulated by the states. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(b) (1982). The dividing line between the regulatory jurisdictions of the FCC and states depends on \u201cthe nature of the communications which pass through the facilities [and not on] the physical location of the lines.\u201d <em>California v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d 84, 86 (D.C.Cir.1977) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1010 (1978), <em>quoting </em>56 F.C.C.2d 14, 21 (1975). <em>See also National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners v. FCC, </em>737 F.2d 1095, 1114-15 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association v. FCC, </em>693 F.2d 198, 214-18 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 938, 103 S.Ct. 2109, 77 L.Ed.2d 313 (1983). Thus purely intrastate facilities and services used to complete even a single interstate call may become subject to FCC regulation to the extent of their interstate use. Every court that has considered the matter has emphasized that the nature of the communications is determinative rather than the physical location of the facilities used. <em>United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., </em>392 U.S. 157, 168-69, 88 S.Ct. 1994, 2000, 20 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1968); <em>New York Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>631 F.2d 1059, 1065-66 (2d Cir.1980); <em>California v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d at 86; <em>General Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>413 F.2d 390, 401 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 888, 90 S.Ct. 173, 24 L.Ed.2d 163 (1969). Nonetheless, NARUC claims that the FCC has exceeded its jurisdiction in this case because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>it has chosen to regulate a purely intrastate WATS facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-4\">NARUC distinguishes the cases cited above by arguing that they all involved situations where the use of state facilities was absolutely required to complete an interstate communication. In those situations, NARUC claims that FCC jurisdiction was. warranted because state regulation \u201csubstantially affected\u201d one\u2019s ability even to complete an interstate telephone call. <em>North Carolina Utilities Commission v. FCC, </em>537 F.2d 787, 793 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1027, 97 S.Ct. 651, 50 L.Ed.2d 631 (1976) <em>(NCUC I). </em>In this case NARUC argues that state regulation creates no absolute impediment to completing an interstate call. Instead, the state regulations only increase the cost of making interstate calls while diminishing signal quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">We reject NARUC\u2019s claim that the FCC lacks jurisdiction over some interstate wire communications merely because the use of an intrastate facility is not absolutely \u201crequired\u201d to complete the call. Implicit in NARUC\u2019s argument is a rejection of our holding in <em>California v. FCC </em>that the FCC\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction depends solely on the interstate nature of the communications at issue. 567 F.2d at 86. NARUC continues to attach significance to the fact that this case involves a facility and service that is located within a single state. Every court that has considered the matter, however, has held that the physically intrastate location of that service does not preclude FCC jurisdiction so long as the service is used for the completion of interstate communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">This conclusion is obviously correct for at least three reasons. First, the Communications Act empowers the FCC to regulate \u201call interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a). The Act broadly defines \u201cwire communications\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axin\">the transmission of ... sounds of all kinds by aid of wire, cable, or other like connection <em>between the points of origin and reception of such transmission, </em>including all instrumentalities, facilities, apparatus, and services ... incidental to such transmission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1577-12\">47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(a) (1982) (emphasis added). The Communications Act thus explicitly creates FCC jurisdiction over all \u201cfacilities\u201d and \u201cservices\u201d used at any point in completing an interstate telephone call. On its face then, the Act defines the FCC\u2019s jurisdiction in terms of the interstate nature of a communication. The Act attaches no significance to the physical location of the facilities used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-13\">Second, the very structure of the Communications Act and the relationship of its terms suggests that the physical location of telecommunications facilities is unimportant. Thus, the Act confers broad powers on the FCC to regulate all aspects of the interstate telecommunications market. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-205 (1982). These powers could be totally frustrated by contrary state regulation if the Commission were barred from regulating any facility that carried interstate calls but was physically intrastate. This is especially the case since almost all telecommunications facilities are physically intrastate. As we have said before, Congress did not intend to allow \u201cinconsistent state regulations [to] frustrate [its] goal of developing a \u2018unified national communications service.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d at 86. We thus find implausible a reading of the Act that eviscerates the Commission\u2019s broad regulatory powers by focusing on the location of telecommunication facilities. It may be significant in this regard that Congress has provided a procedure under section 410(c) of the Act to guide FCC regulation of the use of facilities that serve both the interstate and intrastate markets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>dure appears to recognize national primacy by leaving the FCC discretion to follow or ignore state recommendations and requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-4\">Third, the FCC has for years exercised jurisdiction over intrastate facilities that were partially used to complete interstate telephone calls. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Separating the Jurisdictional Authorities of State and Federal Administrators in the Regulation of the Physical Equipment Within the Nation\u2019s Telephone Network, </em>8 U.Tol. L.Rev. 733, 749-58 (1977). Thus, in 1953, the Commission observed that if it \u201cexercise[d] its jurisdiction only where the telephone facilities in question were exclusively interstate in character, it would result in virtually complete abdication from the field of telephone regulation.\u201d <em>Katz v. AT &amp; T, </em>43 F.C.C. 1328, 1332 (1953). Congress has obviously been aware that for nearly forty years the Commission has claimed jurisdiction over some intrastate facilities. Congressional acquiescence in these claims is symbolized by the Joint Federal-State Board procedure of section 410(c). Congress would not have created this procedure in 1971 if it had been concerned that the FCC was inappropriately exercising jurisdiction over matters committed to state regulation. The Joint Board procedure actually augmented the Commission\u2019s powers in part by recognizing national primacy. <em>NCUC I, </em>537 F.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-5\">NARUC responds to these arguments by pointing to sections 152(b) and 221(b) of the Act which guarantee state regulatory control over intrastate communications. The construction of these sections is well settled, however, and it is clear that they do not limit FCC regulation over interstate calls. <em>See NCUC I, </em>537 F.2d 787; <em>North Carolina Utilities Commission v. FCC, </em>552 F.2d 1036 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 874, 98 S.Ct. 222, 54 L.Ed.2d 154 (1977) <em>{NCUC </em>II); <em>New York Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>631 F.2d 1059; <em>California v. FCC, </em>567 F.2d 84. Section 152(b) merely confirms that the States retain jurisdiction over purely intrastate calls notwithstanding the economic effect such State jurisdiction might have on the interstate market. Section 152(b) thus prevents the application of the so-called <em>Shreveport </em>rate decision, <em>Houston, E &amp;W Texas Ry. v. United States, </em>234 U.S. 342, 34 S.Ct. 833, 58 L.Ed. 1341 (1914) (Hughes, J.), to the communications field. <em>Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association v. FCC, </em>693 F.2d at 214-16. The section does not go beyond this to grant the states jurisdiction over all physically intrastate facilities. Were it to do so it would render the rest of the Communications Act a nullity-</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-7\">Similarly, section 221(b) affords no relief to petitioners. Although the language of the section is sweeping, two prior opinions of this court have explicitly limited it to its legislative history. <em>National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners v. FCC, </em>737 F.2d at 1113 n. 21; <em>Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association v. FCC, </em>693 F.2d at 216-17. We, of course, are bound by those determinations and thus conclude that section 221(b) \u201cwas merely intended to preserve state regulation of local exchanges that happened to overlap state lines.\u201d 693 F.2d at 216. Nothing in the section as interpreted by four circuits limits the FCC\u2019s jurisdiction over intrastate facilities used to complete interstate calls. <em>See NCUC I, </em>537 F.2d at 795; <em>NCUC II, </em>552 F.2d at 1045; <em>Puerto Rico Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>553 F.2d 694, 698-99 (1st Cir.1977); <em>New York Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>631 F.2d at 1064-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-8\">Application of these legal principles to the instant controversy indicates that the Commission clearly had jurisdiction to regulate the resale and sharing of intrastate WATS service as it did. First, it is \u201cundisputed that the intrastate WATS connections sought here would be used to terminate communications which originate in other states.\u201d <em>In re American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. &amp; the Bell System Operating Cos., </em>FCC 83-40-32674, mem. op. at 5 (Jan. 27,1983); J.A. at 172. Hence, there can be no question as to whether the ruling affects communications that are interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>in nature. Second, it is undisputed here that the ruling \u201cdoes not extend to restrictions which pertain solely to the provision of WATS used in intrastate communication.\u201d <em>Id., </em>mem. op. at 7 n. 10; J.A. at 174. Hence, the FCC is clearly not regulating purely intrastate communications in violation of section 152(b) and section 221(b). And third, we have concluded that the FCC has broad power to regulate physically intrastate facilities where they are used for interstate communications. <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>An Assessment of State and Federal Jurisdiction to Regulate Access Charges After the AT &amp; T Divestiture, </em>1983 B.Y.U.L.Rev. 376. As we have seen, the purpose of the Communications Act would be frustrated by any other conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-4\">We therefore reject NARUC\u2019s contention that the FCC cannot strike down state impediments to interstate wire communications unless the use of an intrastate facility is absolutely required to complete the call. NARUC is wrong in believing that its impediments to interstate communications somehow become tolerable when they only increase costs while diminishing signal quality. Such impediments \u201csubstantially affect\u201d both the conduct and development of interstate communications. <em>NCUC I, </em>537 F.2d at 793. They also infringe on the FGG\u2019s jurisdiction over interstate calls and offend the very purposes of the Communications Act which seeks to create \u201ca rapid, efficient, Nation-wide ... communication service.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (1982). If the Act\u2019s goal of providing uniform, efficient service is ever to be realized, the Commission must be free to strike down the costly and inefficient burdens on interstate communications which are sometimes imposed by state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-7\">For all of the reasons stated above, we conclude that the Commission acted within its jurisdiction in granting SBS\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1579-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-9\">In addition to their jurisdictional challenge, petitioners allege that the FCC acted arbitrarily and capriciously because it failed to make new findings of fact to support its decision in addition to the findings made in 1980. We disagree with petitioners and believe that the FCC has proceeded in a legitimate and reasonable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-10\">From 1974 to 1980 the Commission extensively considered the issue of resale and sharing of communications service. <em>See supra </em>pp. 1495-1496. The Commission instituted two separate proceedings concerning this issue and successfully defended its conclusions on appeal. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. FCC, </em>572 F.2d 17. Based on these proceedings, the FCC concluded that a prohibition on resale and sharing restrictions would lead to a number of benefits, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUS\">increased entry and competition by new entrants; numerous new and specialized service offerings by telecommunications managers, OCCs, and other entities; a greater possibility of innovation ... with less waste of available communications facilities!;] the creation of demand for new services ..., [and] pressures upon established carriers to align their rates with costs____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1579-11\"><em>Resale &amp; Shared Use, </em>83 F.C.C.2d at 185. Petitioners do not dispute the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>assessment of the benefits that have resulted from the resale and sharing of interstate WATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">In the ruling under review, however, the FCC acknowledged that its 1980 ruling had not \u201ctechnically\u201d covered \u201cthe case of resale and sharing restrictions on intrastate WATS used to terminate interstate communications.\u201d Mem. op. at 1495; J.A. at 173. Nevertheless, the Commission stated that it had intended in 1980 to outlaw all prohibitions on resale and sharing \u201con any form of domestic public switched network service used in interstate communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in this case the Commission sought to clarify retroactively the sweep of its 1980 Report and Order. The Commission did not, however, base a totally new rule-making on a record borrowed from an earlier proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-5\">At the outset, we note that the FCC\u2019s interpretation of its own policies and regulations is entitled to \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Washington Association for Television &amp; Children v. FCC, </em>712 F.2d 677, 684-85 (D.C.Cir.1983). <em>See also Schwartz v. Helms, </em>712 F.2d 633, 637-38 (D.C.Cir.1983). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Udall v. Tollman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1580-6\">When the construction of an administrative regulation rather than a statute is in issue, deference is even more clearly in order. \u201c[A] court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt____ [T]he ... administrative interpretation [is] of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14 [65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1580-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 16-17, 85 S.Ct. at 801. Since in this case the Commission claims to be interpreting the scope of its 1980 ruling, we are bound to follow that interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the ruling itself. In any event, the petitioners have the burden of proof in establishing that the Commission acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in relying on the 1980 factual record. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982). The \u201cstandard of review is a narrow one,\u201d and the courts are \u201cnot empowered to substitute [their] judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-10\">We do not find the ruling under review to be arbitrary and capricious. The 1980 factual record, relied on by the Commission, clearly supports the decision in this case. Indeed, petitioners have been unable to advance even a single meritorious argument as to why the 1980 record is not controlling. Thus, NARUC observes that the WATS service covered here is uniquely intrastate. Nonetheless, it fails to explain why this should in any way affect the economic analysis underlying the FCC\u2019s 1980 ruling. NARUC also objects to SBS\u2019s failure to introduce specific evidence of benefits from the resale of intrastate WATS. Nonetheless, it is unable itself to point to any valid evidence of public detriment as required by <em>Hush-a-Phone Corp. v. United States, </em>238 F.2d 266, 269 (D.C.Cir.1956). Finally, NARUC attempts to manufacture a public detriment claim by noting that intrastate WATS resale would require revision in current state tariffs because such tariffs are not cost-based. It is said that this would be expensive and disruptive. <em>See </em>Opposition of American Telephone <em>&amp; </em>Telegraph Co. at 11114-8 (filed July 15, 1982); J.A. at 36-43. However, the Commission has already correctly held that the revision of tariffs to make them cost-based actually serves the public interest and is in no way detrimental. <em>See Resale &amp; Shared Use, </em>83 F.C.C.2d 167. In sum, petitioners have advanced no substantial arguments as to why the factual record that supported the Commission\u2019s 1980 order is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-11\">Under these circumstances, we cannot find the ruling under review to be either plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s 1980 ruling. <em>Udall v. Tollman, </em>380 U.S. at 16-17, 85 S.Ct. at 801. Nor can we find that the petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>have introduced <em>any </em>evidence disproving the Commission\u2019s plausible claim that its 1980 factual findings control this case. The decision of the Commission is therefore supported by the record; <em>see Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983); and we affirm in all respects. We have considered the petitioners\u2019 additional claims and find them to be without merit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1581-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1574-6\">. In its petition to the FCC, SBS offered the following example of the inefficiencies arising from its inability to obtain intrastate WATS service to terminate its interstate communications. To complete calls from New York City (where SBS has an earth station) to Flagstaff, Arizona (where it does not have an earth station), SBS had to route the calls first to Los Angeles (the site of the SBS earth station outside of Arizona closest to Flagstaff) and then \"back haul\u201d them some 400 miles over resold interstate WATS. This circuitous routing could have been avoided, however, if SBS were allowed to . resell intrastate WATS service in Arizona. Instead of routing the calls to Los Angeles, SBS would then have been able to transmit them to its Phoenix, Arizona earth station and relay them from that point over intrastate WATS lines to Flagstaff, 110 miles away.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1575-5\">.

The Commission concluded that its 1980 decision precluded a policy of deferring to the states to allow them to legalize resale and sharing in their intrastate WATS tariffs. In 1980, the Commission recalled that it had opted for immediate legalization of unlimited resale and sharing after a short adjustment period. The Commission concluded that AT &amp; T\u2019s proposed deferral in this case would undermine its goal of swiftly realizing the full benefits of resale and sharing of interstate services and hence would be contrary to the public interest. J.A. at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-15\">The Commission denied a portion of SBS\u2019s petition that had sought an FCC order directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>the BSOCs to offer intrastate WATS service at particular terms or rates. SBS has not cross-petitioned this court for review of the partial denial of its petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1577-7\">. More particularly, \u00a7 410(c) of the Act allows the Commission to refer any matter \"relating to common carrier communications of joint Federal-State concern, to a Federal-State Joint Board\u201d which then prepares a recommended FCC decisi\u00f3n. It is hard to see what purpose \u00a7 410(c) would serve if the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction depended at all on whether a facility was physically intrastate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1579-5\">. In an argument related to their jurisdictional claim, petitioners also assert that the Commission has failed here to satisfy the appropriate standards to justify federal preemption of an otherwise lawful state regulation. <em>See, e.g., Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. de la Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. 141, 152-54, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982); <em>Conference of State Bank Supervisors v. Conover, </em>710 F.2d 878, 882 (D.C.Cir.1983). We do not agree, however, that there is any doubt concerning preemption in this case. Here the Commission has regulated <em>exclusively </em>interstate communications which are placed explicitly within the sphere of federal jurisdiction by the plain language of the Communications Act. This case is thus even easier than cases like <em>NCUC I, </em>537 F.2d 787, where the FCC preempted otherwise lawful state regulation of an intrastate service because the interstate and intrastate functions of that service could not be technically and practically separated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1581-14\">. California argues, for example, that the Commission\u2019s order permits unreasonably discriminatory access to local exchanges in a manner that is inconsistent with other FCC policies. This claim is meritless, however, since California has not yet exhausted its remedies before the Commission as is required by our decision in <em>Washington Ass'n for Television &amp; Children v. FCC, </em>712 F.2d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-21\">Similarly, California has also claimed that the FCC arbitrarily and capriciously failed to consider the harmful effects of its ruling on intrastate ratepayers. We conclude that the Commission did not ignore this issue; <em>see </em>J.A. at 173-74; and that the allegedly harmful effects were speculative and factually unsupported.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
