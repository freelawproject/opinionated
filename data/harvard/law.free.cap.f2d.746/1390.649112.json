Peters\u2019s action alleged racial discrimination in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>In 1976, Peters, a black man, was one of forty-nine applicants for the position of Compliance Officer with the Board. After screening the applicants, a search committee selected nine, including Peters, who appeared qualified. The committee members interviewed these applicants, and from them, selected five finalists. Peters was not among the five finalists. A white woman was ultimately selected for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">The district court dismissed Peters\u2019s \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983 claims and, after trial to the court, entered judgment for the defendants on his Title VII claim. We reversed the dismissal of the \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983 claims against the Chancellor on the grounds that although the Eleventh Amendment barred an award of damages against the Board, prospective relief might be available against the Chancellor. <em>Peters v. Lieuallen, </em>693 F.2d 966 (9th Cir.1982). We also reversed the judgment on Peters\u2019s Title VII claim for two reasons. First, the district court had not made a finding as to whether Peters made out a case of disparate impact. Second, the district court did not make a specific finding as to whether Peters had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment and, in rejecting his claim, had given conclusive effect to the fact that other blacks were included among the five finalists. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">On remand, the district court concluded that Peters had not made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate impact and that, although he had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, defendants had successfully rebutted the inference of discrimination. <em>Peters v. Lieuallen, </em>568 F.Supp. 261 (D.Or.1983). Accordingly, the court entered judgment for defendants on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-6\">\n<em>Discriminatory Impact.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-7\">In order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate impact, the plaintiff must show that a facially neutral selection system has a significantly discriminatory impact on a group protected by Title VII. <em>See Connecticut v. Teal, </em>457 U.S. 440, 446, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 2531, 73 L.Ed.2d 130 (1982). Here, the district court found that Peters had failed to show that the Board\u2019s requirement that the Compliance Officer possess good written and oral communication skills, as judged by the search committee, had a significant discriminatory impact on blacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-9\">We do not find the district court\u2019s conclusion clearly erroneous. <em>See Contreras v. City of Los Angeles, </em>656 F.2d 1267, 1272 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1021, 102 S.Ct. 1719, 72 L.Ed.2d 140 (1982). Although Peters showed that only a small proportion of the Chancellor\u2019s office\u2019s employees were black, there was no evidence that the selection criteria at issue here were used in choosing among applicants for positions other than that of Compliance Officer. The facts that defendants used subjective criteria and that the search committee members were all white are not enough to show disparate impact. Peters must show the effect of these criteria on the defendants\u2019 work force. <em>See Ward v. Westland Plastics, Inc., </em>651 F.2d 1266, 1270 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-10\">\n<em>Disparate Treatment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-11\">The district court found that Peters had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, but that the defendants had satisfied their burden of producing evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for rejecting Peters. 568 F.Supp. at 267; <em>see Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 252-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Ultimately, the district court concluded that Peters failed to demonstrate either that the defendants had been motivated by discriminatory intent, or that their proffered reasons for rejecting him were unworthy of credence. 568 F.Supp. at 268-69; <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-12\">We do not find these determinations by the district court to have been clearly erroneous. The court considered the fact that other blacks were on the list of finalists for the Compliance Officer position, but did not give undue weight to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>factor. <em>See Peters v. Lieuallen, </em>693 F.2d at 970. It considered the possibility that the defendants had \u201cconspired to place less qualified blacks among the top five ranked candidates in order to insure that ... a white candidate would ultimately be selected,\u201d but found \u201cno evidence of such a subterfuge by defendants.\u201d 568 F.Supp. at 268. Although the district court disagreed with some of the reasons the defendants gave for rejecting Peters, it found defendants\u2019 explanation rational and credible. <em>Id. </em>at 268-69. The. fact that a court may think that an employer misjudged the qualifications of an applicant does not in itself establish a Title VII violation. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 259, 101 S.Ct. at 1096. The district court rejected Peters\u2019 contention that the woman hired for the Compliance Officer\u2019s position did not meet its qualifications, and we find that the record supports that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-4\">\n<em>Claims Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-5\">Since Peters has failed to demonstrate intentional discrimination on the part of the defendants, his race discrimination claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 must also fail. <em>Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 2590 n. 16, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984); <em>General Building Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375, 388-391, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3148-3149, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982); <em>Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 239-241, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047-2048, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976); <em>accord, Irby v. Sullivan, </em>737 F.2d 1418, 1424 n. 7 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Beard v.
