Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order of September 13, 1983, has become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The question of the Board\u2019s previous action, in which only one member took part, is therefore moot. This appeal, raising the question of the previous action\u2019s validity, is hereby dismissed as moot, and this cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate its judgment, to the extent that it held that action by one member of the Board was invalid. 567 F.Supp. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Our order does not disturb our previous opinion and judgment in No. 83-1941. 738 F.2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
