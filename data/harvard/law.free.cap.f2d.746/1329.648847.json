Kotts appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirmance of the bankruptcy courts\u2019 refund orders under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 329. For reversal, Kotts argues that the bankruptcy court had no authority to order a refund because Kotts represented debtors rather than debtors-in-possession, and that the nature of the hearing and supporting evidence violated Kotts\u2019s right to due process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-18\">Kotts, a bankruptcy attorney, commenced ten Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings for clients between October, 1980, and August, 1981, but never applied to the court under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a) for approval of representation. Kotts or his firm performed services in- each case, but in nine of the cases, filed neither reorganization plans nor disclosure statements, and in the tenth, filed no disclosure statement. Thereafter, the United States Trustee (Trustee) moved the two bankruptcy courts handling the cases to examine the reasonableness of Kotts\u2019s fees under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 329. The bankruptcy courts, after separate hearings, ordered all or part of the fees refunded to the estates. The district court affirmed and determined what portion of Kotts\u2019s fees was attributable to work done before the Chapter 11 filings; Kotts was allowed to keep these fees, but was ordered to refund the balance to the estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-19\">Kotts distinguishes \u201cdebtors\u201d and \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d and argues that the debtor, as an individual, is entitled to separate representation which is not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>bankruptcy court review. The statute refutes this position: \u201c \u2018debtor in possession\u2019 means debtor except when a person that has qualified under section 322 of this title is serving as trustee in the case;\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(1) (1978). The Fifth Circuit has determined that this section creates no distinction between the two terms, <em>In the Matter of Triangle Chemicals, Inc., </em>697 F.2d 1280, 1290 (5th Cir.1983). On the plain meaning of the statute, when no trustee has been appointed, we agree that there is no practical distinction between the terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-4\">Concerning the due process implications of the hearings held in the bankruptcy court and district court, we have thoroughly reviewed the record and find that Kotts enjoyed the full protection of due process. Moreover, based on the record, we find that the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. <em>Boyle v. Donovan, </em>724 F.2d 681, 683 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1408-11\">. The Honorable Harry H. MacLaughlin, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
