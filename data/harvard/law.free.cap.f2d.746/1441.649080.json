The district court determined that the security interest is perfected. We agree, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-11\">Associates Commercial Corporation (Associates) was the primary lender to Sel-O-Rak Corporation (Sel-O-Rak), providing both a line of credit and an equipment loan. Sel-O-Rak granted Associates a security interest in all of its accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, intangibles, and the proceeds thereof as security for these loans. Associates took all the steps necessary under Florida law to perfect the security interest, including proper recordation of a financing statement. It failed, however, to purchase the documentary stamps required for the loan documents and the security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-12\">Sel-O-Rak filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, owing Associates approximately $1,600,000. Sel-O-Rak was named debtor-in-possession. Associates thereafter filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court seeking to replevy all of the property secured as collateral for its loans. Associates sought relief from the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and enforcement of its rights as a secured creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-14\">Sel-O-Rak defended upon the ground that Associates was a general unsecured creditor. Sel-O-Rak claimed that Associates\u2019 failure to purchase the documentary tax stamps on the underlying obligations of the security agreement, as required by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 201.08(1) (1983), prevented the filing of a valid Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statement; therefore Associates\u2019 security interest was unperfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-15\">After Sel-O-Rak raised the issue, Associates purchased the required stamps. The bankruptcy court nonetheless ruled that Associates had no perfected security interest, good as against the debtor-in-possession, because the financing statement could not be validly filed until the tax was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-16\">Associates appealed, and the district court, <em>Associate Commercial Corp. v. Sel-O-Rak Corp., </em>33 Bankr. 394, (S.D.Fla.1983), reversed the bankruptcy court, <em>Associate Commercial Corp. v. Sel-O-Rak Corp., </em>26 Bankr. 223 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1982), judgment, holding that Associates\u2019 failure to purchase the necessary documentary tax stamps had not affected the validity of the lien perfection obtained by filing a financing statement. The district court ruled that failure timely to pay the tax meant only that the lien could not be enforced until the tax was paid. Sel-O-Rak challenges the district court\u2019s decision in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-18\">This case involves interpretation of two separate and distinct areas of the Florida Statutes: Secured Transactions under the Florida Uniform Commercial Code and the Documentary Stamp Act. Neither the case law nor the statutes directly address the operative relationship between the two sections. We briefly address both statutes to provide the framework within which to decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-5\">Article 9 of the Florida Uniform Commercial Code, Secured Transactions, Fla. Stat. Chapter 679 (1983), governs the creation and perfection of security interests. The introductory comment describes the chapter as \u201cthe first comprehensive treatment of the entire system of personal property security law. Its uncomplicated purpose is \u2018to provide a simple and unified structure within which the immense variety of present-day secured financing transactions can go forward with less cost and greater certainty.\u2019 \u201d Florida Code Introductory Comments, Chapter 679 Fla.Stat. (1983), (citing Uniform Commercial Code Comment, \u00a7 9-101).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-6\">Perfection, a term of art in UCC Article 9, describes a security interest in personal property which cannot be defeated by other general creditors or the bankruptcy trustee. Florida Code Comments, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 679.301 (1973). Under the Code, \u201c[a] security interest is perfected when it has attached and when all of the applicable steps required for perfection have been taken. Such steps are specified in \u00a7\u00a7 679.-302, 679.304-679.306.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 679.303 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-7\">Sel-O-Rak only disputes the adequacy of the financing statement filed by Associates. In this case, \u201c[a] financing statement must be filed to perfect all security interests ....\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 679.302(1) (1983). Part IV of the Chapter governs the filing of financing statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1521-8\">The filing of a writing ... under this chapter shall be complete and sufficient only if the writing is recorded in the office of the appropriate clerk of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1521-9\">Fla.Stat. \u00a7 679.4011 (1983) (in pertinent part). Filing occurs upon \u201c[presentation for filing of a financing statement and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the statement by the filing officer and recording in compliance with section 679.4011, where required .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fla.Stat. \u00a7 679.403(1) (1983). Chapter 679 makes no reference to documentary stamp taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-13\">Chapter 201, Florida Statutes (1983), provides for an excise tax on documents. The law requires that documentary stamp taxes \u201cbe affixed to and placed on all recordable instruments requiring documentary stamps according to law, prior to recordation.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 201.01 (1983). The tax is owed on written obligations to pay money and security agreements. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 201.08(1) (1983). The statute further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1521-14\">The excise tax on documents provided by this chapter shall be applicable to transactions covered by the Uniform Commercial Code to the same extent that it would be if the code had not been enacted. The clerk or filing officer shall not accept for filing or filing and recording any financing statement under chapter 679, unless there appears thereon the notation that the stamps required by this chapter have been placed on the promissory instruments secured by said financing statement and will be placed on any additional promissory instruments, advances or similar instrument that may be secured by said financing statement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The failure to pay the tax required by this chapter as so stated, shall be subject to the penalties provided by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap5v\">Fla.Stat. \u00a7 201.22 (1983). The penalties set forth for failure to pay the applicable documentary stamp tax include: criminal liability for commission of second degree misdemeanor; payment of tax not paid; payment of penalty to department of revenue in the amount of 25% of the tax not paid, in the absence of fraud, and 100% of the tax not paid if fraud is involved; and payment of interest at a specified rate. Fla.Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>\u00a7 201.17 (1988). In addition, all other revenue laws are expressly made applicable to this chapter for the purpose of collecting unpaid stamp taxes. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 201.16 (1983). The statute does not explicitly provide that failure to affix documentary stamps to promissory instruments prevents either the valid filing of a financing statement or perfection of a security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-5\">Sel-O-Rak contends that the legislature intended to compel compliance with the documentary excise tax by withholding perfection of a lien until the tax is paid. Accordingly, the financing statement is a nullity until payment of the tax. We reject this argument for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-6\">Article 9 of the Florida UCC. represents a unified and comprehensive approach to secured transactions. Certainty in secured financing transactions is one goal of Article 9. Associates complied with all the requirements set forth in that chapter for perfection. Article 9 never mentions documentary stamp obligations. Sel-O-Rak\u2019s argument, therefore, does violence to the specific language and the purpose of Article 9. <em>In re LJP, Inc., Roemelmeyer v. Royal Crown Bottling Co., </em>34 B.R. 39, 40 (Bankr.S.D.Fl.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-7\">Chapter 201, Florida Statutes clearly prescribes the penalties for failure to pay the documentary stamp tax. Furthermore, other revenue laws are explicitly made applicable for the purpose of collecting the tax. By providing certain penalties for failure to pay the excise tax, the legislature probably intended all other statutes to be extraneous for enforcement purposes. Frequently the enumeration of specific items by the legislature implies the exclusion of all others, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Thayer v. State, </em>335 So.2d 815, 817 (Fla.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-9\">Furthermore, \u201cFlorida law provides that tax statutes are to be construed strongly in favor of the taxpayer and against the government.\u201d <em>State Department of Revenue v. Peterson Outdoor Advertising Co., </em>296 So.2d 120 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1974); Accord, <em>State ex rel. Independent Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. v. Dickinson, </em>212 So.2d 293 (Fla.1968). Florida courts resolve all doubts and ambiguities in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1522-10\">Absent a clearer indication of legislative intent, we will not construe the tax statute to provide another, unexpected penalty. Instead, we follow the clear command of Article 9, Florida Uniform Commercial Code. Accordingly, perfection of Associates\u2019 security interest occurred when the financing statement was accepted for recordation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1522-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1521-10\">. Associates fully complied with the Chapter 679 requirements for filing a financing statement. Sel-O-Rak only challenges the efficacy of the filing because of Associates\u2019 failure to pay the documentary stamp tax on the underlying obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1521-15\">. Associates\u2019 financing statement contained this notation. The financing statement was accepted by the clerk, along with the filing fee, and recorded in the official registry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1522-8\">. We recognize that other courts have decided similar issues differently. <em>American City Bank v. Western Auto Supply, </em>631 S.W.2d 410, 422-23 (Tenn.Ct.App.1981); <em>In re Ken Gardner Ford Sales, Inc., </em>23 B.R. 743 (E.D.Tenn.1982). They held that the public policy for punishing wrongdoers and collection of the tax require such measures. We believe, however, that such a severe intrusion into the operation of UCC Article 9 cannot be justified absent specific legislative authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
