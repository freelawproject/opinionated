This court affirmed the conviction. <em>United States v. Brooklier, </em>685 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">After the Supreme Court denied certiorari, 102 S.Ct. 1195 (1983), the defendant filed a motion for reduction of sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The district court reduced the sentence to two consecutive six month confinements in a community treatment center and two years suspended sentence, retaining the fipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Review of the transcript from the sentence reduction hearings indicates that the district judge attempted to use his power under Rule 35 to assure that the defendant would not be placed in a custodial facility selected by the Bureau of Prisons in keeping with its internal regulation concerning persons convicted of RICO offenses. By attempting to assert authority over the location of confinement, the district court exceeded its jurisdiction under the resentencing statute. While a judge has wide discretion in determining the length and type of sentence, <em>United States v. Warren, </em>610 F.2d 680, 684 (9th Cir.1980), the court has no jurisdiction to select the place where the sentence will be served. Authority to determine place of confinement resides in the executive branch of government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082(a), and is delegated to the Bureau of Prisons. Because the district court was without jurisdiction to reduce Dragna\u2019s sentence as it did, reinstatement of the original sentence is appropriate. <em>United States v. Schafer, </em>726 F.2d 155 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The district court\u2019s judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the district court\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
