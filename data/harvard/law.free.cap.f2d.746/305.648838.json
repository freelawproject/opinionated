RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b404-26\">The appellee, Affholder, having prevailed in this diversity case, seeks to recover 15% of its judgment, in addition to the judgment amount, under a Mississippi statute that assesses such a fixed penalty against a litigant who unsuccessfully appeals. We conclude that Fed.R.App.P. 38 precludes such an automatic deterrent to the right to appeal and allows a federal appellate court to chasten an unsuccessful appellant only when it finds an appeal to be frivolous. In doing so, we decline to follow a prior decision by a panel of this circuit holding the Mississippi statute applicable in federal diversity cases because that decision was rendered without consideration of Rule 38. Finding this appeal not to have been frivolous, we deny the motion to levy a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"AqF\">Section 11-3-23 Miss.Code Ann. (Supp. 1982), assesses a penalty of fifteen percent of the judgment against an unsuccessful appellant. In <em>Walters v. Inexco Oil Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a panel of this circuit held that the state statute applies in federal diversity jurisdiction eases. Another panel had earlier applied a similar Alabama penalty statute in a diversity case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both of these cases were decided on the authority of <em>Erie R. Co. v. </em>Tompkins,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which mandates the application of the forum-state substantive law in federal diversity cases. In neither case did counsel direct the court\u2019s attention to, nor did either panel consider, the possible application of the Federal Rules Enabling Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hanna v. </em>Plumer,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which held that, under the Enabling Act, even in a diversity action, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern in federal district courts whenever they plainly conflict with a state statute and the possible application of like reasoning to finding dominance of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in matters of appeal. In opposing Affholder\u2019s motion to assess damages under the Mississippi statute, Southern Rock argues that both the Enabling Act and <em>Hanna </em>are applicable, and in fact, are controlling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The first issue to be resolved is which \u201crule of decision\u201d applies in this case. Affholder contends that this is \u201ca pure <em>Erie </em>question,\u201d in that the Mississippi statute creates a substantive right that must be applied in diversity actions. Southern Rock, on the other hand, argues that, because Rule 38 is a valid rule of appellate procedure, <em>Hanna </em>requires that the federal rule control the outcome despite the existence of contrary state law. Analysis of <em>Hanna </em>and its sequelae persuades us that it provides the relevant mode of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">For purposes of determining their validity and effect with regard to contrary state law, there is no difference between the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The authority and effect of both sets of rules are identical.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">In the absence of jurisprudence dealing with the collision of state laws and federal laws or rules in federal appellate procedure, we turn to Hanna\u2019s method of analysis when such a clash emerges in the trial court. Although both <em>Hanna </em>and <em>Erie </em>address the issue of the applicability of state law in federal diversity cases, each case focuses on a different aspect of the question. In <em>Erie, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s concern lay primarily with determining what substantive law a federal court should apply to decisions on the merits when sitting in diversity actions. The Court\u2019s resolution of that question is now hornbook law: \u201cExcept in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Hanna, </em>the Court again discussed the applicability of state law in diversity cases, but this time it focused its analytical lens on which body of procedural law a federal court should apply. It unequivocally stated that <em>Erie </em>did not supply the appropriate test for determining the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, and went on to develop a separate method of analysis for resolving the procedural law issue. In doing so it distinguished <em>Erie:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">When a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical, relatively unguided Erie choice: the court has been instructed to apply the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory Committee, this Court and Congress erred in their prima facie judgment that the Rule in question transgresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor constitutional restrictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">If the federal rule in question is clearly applicable, therefore, the court need not consider whether <em>Erie </em>commands the enforcement of an allegedly substantive state rule seemingly in conflict with the federal procedural rule. <em>Erie </em>simply no longer provides the relevant inquiry.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The Supreme Court has not departed from this command. Its most recent pronouncement on the applicability of <em>Hanna </em>and <em>Erie </em>in federal diversity actions is <em>Walker v. Armco Steel Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The issue presented was whether, in a diversity action, a federal court should follow state law or Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in determining when an action is commenced for purposes of tolling the state statute of limitations. The Court traced the development and evolution of both <em>Hanna </em>and <em>Erie, </em>but focused on the <em>Hanna </em>analysis as the starting place for determining the validity and applicability of a federal rule when there is a different state law provision. \u201cThe first question must, therefore, be whether the scope of the Federal Rule in fact is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court. It is only if that question is answered affirmatively that the <em>Hanna </em>analysis applies,\u201d the Court said.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It then added in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">This is not to suggest that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are to be narrowly construed in order to avoid a \u201cdirect collision\u201d with state law. The Federal Rules should be given their plain meaning. If a direct collision with state law arises from that plain meaning, then the analysis developed from <em>Hanna v. Plumer </em>applies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The <em>Walker </em>Court then compared the scope of Fed.R.Civ.P. 3, providing that a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint, with an Oklahoma statute that provided that an action was not deemed to be \u201ccommenced\u201d for purposes of the statute of limitations until a summons was served on the defendant. The state statute further provided that, if the complaint was filed within the limitations period, the action was deemed to have commenced on the date of filing if the plaintiff served the defendant within 60 days, even though service occurred after the limitations period had run. The Court found that Rule 3 did not affect the tolling of the statute of limitation, but, in contrast, the Oklahoma statute \u201c[was] an integral part of the several policies served by the statute of limitations.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court then held that, because the scope of Rule 3 was not broad enough to control the issue before the district court, and because there was no direct conflict between the Federal Rule and the state law, the <em>Hanna </em>analysis did not apply and <em>Erie </em>required the application of the Oklahoma statute in a federal diversity action.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">In contrast to the situation in <em>Walker, </em>there is a direct conflict between Rule 38 and the Mississippi statute. Fed.R.App.P. 38 penalizes only the appellant whose appeal is found to be frivolous. The rule is not designed otherwise to deter- litigants from exercising their right to appeal. Damages may be imposed only when the appellate court finds \u201cthe appeal to be utterly without merit, the appellant\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ments totally unsound, the judges\u2019 time and energies wasted, and the appellee put to the inconvenience and expense of employing counsel to resist such a frivolous appeal,\u201d as a leading treatise notes it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The Mississippi statute is also designed to avoid frivolous appeals,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but at the same time, it also penalizes those that are merely unsuccessful, even those whose appeal has such merit as to evoke a dissenting opinion. Unlike Rule 38, the Mississippi statute makes the penalty mandatory. The mechanical application of this rule allows for no discretion, and the penalty \u201cmust be assessed even though the justness of doing so is not apparent.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Regardless of the merits of an appeal, therefore, \u201cthe ordeal of defending an appeal is viewed by Mississippi as an injury to the appellee\u201d and its statute, \u201cprovides \u2018a measure of compensation for the successful appellee, compensation for his having endured the slings and arrows of successful appellate litigation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">These two rules cannot be reconciled. The federal rule allows the appellate courts to make the determination of when the penalty should apply. It is designed not to discourage appeals that have any reasonable support, but only those without foundation. The Mississippi statute rejects this case-by-ease and on-the-merits analysis, and ordains a mandatory penalty rule. In reaching the decision to appeal, an appellant must take into account the penalty that will be exacted if he does not succeed. It thus acts as a deterrent to exercise of the right to appeal. The \u201cplain meaning\u201d of Rule 38, therefore, brings it into \u201cdirect collision\u201d with state law, and the analysis developed from <em>Hanna </em>must apply.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">If thus applied, would Rule 38 be outside the scope of the Rules Enabling Act or beyond the power of Congress under the Constitution?<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">The Rules Enabling Act confers upon the Supreme Court the power to prescribe general rules governing practice and procedure in the courts of appeals of the United States in civil actions, and provides that all laws in conflict with those rules shall be of no further force or effect after the rules have taken effect. It prescribes, however, that \u201csuch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right ____\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We examine the validity of Rule 38 in two steps: first whether the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure were properly prescribed by the Supreme Court. Second, we consider whether Rule 38 abridges any \u201csubstantive right\u201d created by Mississippi law.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-20\">As indicated in the Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Rule 1, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure were drawn under the authority of four separate statutes that, in combination, \u201cgive to the Supreme Court power to make rules of practice and procedure for all cases within the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.\u201d At the same time, these statutes do not give the Court authority to enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals. Accordingly, subparagraph (b) of Rule 1 makes it clear that the Appellate Rules are not to be construed either to extend or to limit the jurisdiction of these courts in any way. There seems to be no reason, therefore, to question that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure were prescribed by the Supreme Court in the proper manner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>and thus fall within the scope of the Rules Enabling Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The more difficult problem is whether Rule 38 abridges any \u201csubstantive right\u201d created by the Mississippi statute in the sense that this term is used in the Enabling Act. Although this circuit has held that the rule does confer an <em>Erie </em>-type substantive right on successful appellees,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we have not previously considered the <em>Hanna </em>decision or applied its analysis. This omission constitutes a fundamental flaw in our decisions for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">First, these decisions found the statutes to be \u201csubstantive\u201d in the context of only - an <em>Erie </em>analysis. Considering that the only choice was between categorizing the statute as \u201csubstantive\u201d or \u201cprocedural\u201d in the <em>Erie </em>sense, our earlier decisions declared such a statute to be \u201csubstantive\u201d in order to apply it in federal court in a diversity action. As we have already shown here, however, the <em>Erie </em>analysis is inapplicable in this situation. Moreover, what is \u201csubstantive\u201d for <em>Erie </em>purposes, and what is \u201csubstantive\u201d for purposes of the Rules Enabling Act are not necessarily the same.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While these adjectives are identical, that does not foreclose the possibility that they are used in a different sense in the two contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The Mississippi statute providing for the award of damages upon affirmance of a money judgment was not a part of Affholder\u2019s original cause of action. It, therefore, conferred no right that might have been asserted in the complaint or for which judgment might have been rendered in the trial court. The damage claim arises only as an incident of the decision to appeal by Southern Rock. It merely supplies an automatic procedure whereby the appellee may secure damages for defending an appeal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The right, therefore, was not substantive in the sense that it inhered in Affholder\u2019s legal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">If the Mississippi statute were deemed to constitute a \u201csubstantive right\u201d as that term is used in the Rules Enabling Act, and thus to defeat the application of Rule 38 in this situation, the overriding purpose of the Act \u2014 to provide for a uniform system of practice and procedure in federal courts \u2014 would be defeated by the act of a state legislature. As Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper comment, \u201cwhatever the appropriate construction of \u2018abridge, enlarge or modify\u2019 is, it presumably must accommodate the goal of a comprehensive system of procedure and allow for such impingements of substantive rights as are reasonably incidental to significant procedural objectives.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Rules Enabling Act and <em>Hanna </em>require us to give the Federal Rule deference and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>presume both its validity and applicability until its invalidity is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u201c[T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within an uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either,\u201d the Supreme Court stated in <em>Hanna.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This places a constitutional imprimatur on Rule 38. Because the Mississippi statute confers no substantive right upon Affholder, there can be no doubt as to the constitutionality of applying the Rule in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">For these reasons, we consider Rule 38 applicable and the Mississippi statute superseded by it. <em>Walters v. Inexco Oil Co. </em>and <em>Proctor v. Gissendaner </em>no longer express the law of the circuit. Mindful of the law of the circuit rule, which forbids one panel to overrule another save when a later statute or Supreme Court decision has changed the applicable law, this opinion has been considered not only by all members of the panels in those two cases but also by all judges in active service who were not members of those two panels. By unanimous agreement the court has sua sponte reconsidered those two opinions, authorized their overruling, and chosen to adhere to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The motion for damages filed by Affholder is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\">. 725 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">. <em>Proctor v.
