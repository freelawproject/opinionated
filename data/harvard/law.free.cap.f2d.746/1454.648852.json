No. DC0752811216). Following the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s favorable decision on the merits, petitioner moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) (1982) (Reform Act), and corresponding Board regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.87(a) (1984). The Board denied petitioner\u2019s motion, and he now seeks review in this court. Because attorney\u2019s fees in this case are, in the words of the statute, \u201cwarranted in the interest of justice,\u201d we reverse the decision of the Board and remand for further proceedings on the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-4\">Petitioner is a nursing assistant at a VA hospital in Washington, D.C. In March 1982 the VA removed petitioner from government service, alleging that he had physically and verbally abused a patient in his care. The patient, William Young, suffered from brain damage and semi-paralysis. Mr. Young was occasionally violent to the point where he required restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-5\">The VA charged petitioner with three separate instances of misconduct. The first two charges alleged that, on separate occasions, petitioner struck Mr. Young. The VA also alleged that, during the second episode, petitioner called Mr. Young \u201cwhite boy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-6\">After a Board hearing before Presiding Official Stephanie Marks, it was held that the VA failed to prove any of its charges. To substantiate its first charge, the VA presented the testimony of Neil Hadley, Mr. Young\u2019s hospital roommate. At first, Mr. Hadley\u2019s testimony was unclear as to whether he had actually seen petitioner strike Mr. Young.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When questioned by the presiding official, however, Mr. Hadley stated definitively that he did not see petitioner strike Mr. Young, but only heard a slapping noise which he assumed was the sound of petitioner striking the patient. Petitioner explained the slapping sound by demonstrating that, when Mr. Young became violent, the effort to place him in restraints required sharp physical contact. Presiding Official Marks called this \u201ca clear and convincing demonstration.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1533-7\">The VA also introduced notes, written by Mr. Young, stating that he had been hit and that he feared for his life. The notes were largely unintelligible and contradictory. Moreover, they never mentioned petitioner specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-12\">In support of the second charge of physical abuse, the presiding official heard the testimony of Nurse Juanita Davis, a coworker of petitioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of the hearing, Nurse Davis was under a psychiatrist\u2019s care. She was prone to fabricating outlandish tales, <em>e.g., </em>that she was involved in the Watergate scandal. Presiding Official Marks found Nurse Davis\u2019 testimony to be self-contradictory, often incoherent, and utterly incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-13\">The only evidence regarding the verbal abuse was a statement by Nurse Davis to a VA investigator. The presiding official assigned the investigator\u2019s hearsay testimony \u201clittle weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-14\">Presiding Official Marks dismissed all of the charges against petitioner and ordered him reinstated. The VA did not appeal this decision either to the full MSPB or to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-15\">Petitioner then presented the Board with a motion for an award of $3,587.09 in attorney\u2019s fees. The VA did not initially contest the motion. Prior to a decision, Presiding Official Marks resigned her position with the Board. The motion therefore went before a substitute presiding official, William C. Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-16\">Presiding Official Jenkins reviewed the record of the hearing on the merits and concluded that petitioner failed to demonstrate proper grounds for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Petitioner sought review by the Board, which the VA then contested. The Board issued an order refusing to review the decision below, stating that it could find no error in Presiding Official Jenkins\u2019 reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-4\">Under the Reform Act, the Board may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board ... determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency\u2019s action was clearly without merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) (1982). The Board\u2019s regulations reiterate the pertinent portions of the statute. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.37(a) (1984). In <em>Sterner v. Department of the Army, </em>711 F.2d 1563, 1565-66 (Fed.Cir. 1983), we ruled that an employee is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the statute if two prerequisites are established: (1) the employee is a prevailing party on the merits of the case, and (2) the award is warranted in the interest of justice. The Board does not contest here that petitioner prevailed on the merits. The sole issue, therefore, is whether the second prerequisite has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-6\">The parties correctly cite <em>Allen v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>2 M.S.P.B. 582 (1980), as embodying the MSPB\u2019s prevailing standard for interpretation of the \u201cwarranted in the interest of justice\u201d part of \u00a7 7701(g)(1). <em>Allen </em>began with the proposition that the two examples in the statute concerning when an award would be warranted in the interest of justice are illustrative and not exclusive. <em>Id. </em>at 587. The Board then reviewed the legislative history of the statute to glean other instances in which an award would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-7\">The Board in <em>Allen </em>found very illuminating the comments of Senator Mathias, author of the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d language and member of the Reform Act\u2019s conference committee. Senator Mathias described four situations in which the Board might appropriately award attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXG\">[Wjhere he [the employee] is substantially innocent of the charges that are leveled against him, or where the agency acted in bad faith, or where there was some gross procedural error, or where the agency knew or should have known that it couldn\u2019t prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1534-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 589, <em>quoting </em>Transcript of Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs\u2019 Markup Session on S. 2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 124-25 (1978). With the statutory examples and Senator Mathias\u2019 illustrations as a base, the Board developed a set of five broad categories of cases in which an award of attorney\u2019s fees fits within the statutory framework:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-10\">1. Where the agency engaged in a \u201cprohibited personnel practice\u201d (\u00a7 7701(g)(1));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-11\">2. Where the agency\u2019s action was \u201cclearly without merit\u201d (\u00a7 7701(g)(1)), or was \u201cwholly unfounded,\u201d or the employee is \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d of the charges brought by the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-12\">3. Where the agency initiated the action against the employee in \u201cbad faith,\u201d including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-13\">a. Where the agency\u2019s action was brought to \u201charass\u201d the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-14\">b. Where the agency\u2019s action was brought to \u201cexert improper pressure on the employee to act in certain ways\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-15\">4. Where the agency committed a \u201cgross procedural error\u201d which \u201cprolonged the proceeding\u201d or \u201cseverely prejudiced\u201d the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-16\">5. Where the agency \u201cknew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits\u201d when it brought the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1534-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 593 [footnotes omitted]. The Board dubbed these headings \u201cdirectional markers toward \u2018the interest of justice\u2019 \u201d rather than conclusive or fixed definitions. <em>Id. </em>We confirmed the validity of the <em>Allen </em>guidelines in <em>Sterner, supra, </em>711 F.2d at 1570.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-18\">The petitioner focuses on category 2 and category 5 to support his request for attorney\u2019s fees. The parties\u2019 briefs on the standards contained in. these categories reveal two points: first, there is confusion as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>the difference between category 2 and category 5; second, a concern exists (particularly on the Board\u2019s part) that the substantially innocent standard is merely a restatement of the prerequisite that the employee prevail. We turn to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-5\">Category 5 requires a sensitive evaluation of the agency\u2019s original action, <em>i.e., </em>whether the agency \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that it would not prevail on the appeal. In analyzing a request for fees under category 5, therefore, the appropriate procedure is to appraise the agency\u2019s decision to carry through the action against the employee. If the agency never possessed trustworthy, admissible evidence, or if the agency was negligent in its conduct of the investigation, then the agency \u201cknew or should have known\u201d not to take the action. Attorney\u2019s fees are then warranted in the interest of justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1535-6\">Category 2, on the other hand, refers to the result of the case in the Board, not to the evidence and information available pri- or to the hearing. Because this category encompasses the Board\u2019s decision (on the merits) in this particular case, we need not decide whether fees could also be awarded under category 5, <em>supra. </em>It is plain that petitioner prevailed on all the charges against him, and that the original presiding official considered (on the basis of the hearing record) that the VA\u2019s charges were \u201cwholly unfounded\u201d \u2014 based on incredible or unspecific evidence fully countered by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-7\">The Government\u2019s arguments and' the MSPB\u2019s fee decision muddy the waters by seeking to excuse the VA, as if the only fee criteria were contained in category 5. For instance, it is argued that Mr. Hadley\u2019s testimony that he had not actually seen petitioner strike Mr. Young caught the VA by surprise. Given Mr. Hadley\u2019s want of clarity at the hearing, we have no reason to doubt that conclusion. In addition, the record shows that the presiding official\u2019s request to call Nurse Davis was unexpected. But all that is irrelevant under the category 2 standard of \u201csubstantial innocence.\u201d The end result here was that Mr. Hadley and Nurse Davis failed to corroborate the VA\u2019s charges, according to the final decision of the presiding official who heard their testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1535-10\">The Government, in sum, seeks to defend the Board and the VA by pointing out that further agency investigation would not have revealed in advance the surprises in store at the hearing. Petitioner enters this debate with charges that the VA mishandled the investigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This entire discussion, however, rests on a faulty premise, at least insofar as category 2 is concerned. That aspect of the attorney\u2019s fee provision in the Reform Act is not punitive; rather, it is an effort to minimize the burden an unsubstantiated accusation places upon innocent employees. <em>Sterner, supra, </em>at 1570. When dealing with the \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d standard for award of attorney\u2019s fees, the question of an agency\u2019s original fault need never arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-11\">We are told that this definition of the \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d standard will lead to an award of attorney\u2019s fees for every prevailing employee. As <em>Allen </em>makes em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>phatically clear, this is not the law. 2 M.S.P.B. at 587.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For one thing, the employee must prevail on substantially all the charges to be found \u201csubstantially innocent.\u201d In Sterner,. for example, we affirmed the Board\u2019s denial of fees to an employee who confessed to two of the five charges against him and successfully defended the other three \u2014 on the ground that he was not \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d despite our recognition that the employee prevailed before the Board on every contested charge. 711 F.2d at 1567-68.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Sterner, </em>\u201c[T]he extent of a party\u2019s victory is clearly relevant generally to the justice of his cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1567.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-5\">We now consider the question of whether petitioner was substantially innocent. Of course our review of Board decisions is limited. This court may interfere with a Board decision only upon a conclusion that the decision was an abuse of discretion, contrary to law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-6\">In his opinion, Presiding Official Jenkins ruled that \u201cthe record in this case ... fails to show that appellant was \u2018substantially innocent\u2019 of the charges.\u201d Mr. Jenkins felt that \u201cthe agency had reasonable support for its belief that appellant had acted as charged.\u201d This ruling is erroneous for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-11\">First, Presiding Official Jenkins considered the evidence accumulated prior to the hearing as support for his conclusion that petitioner was not substantially innocent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He refers, for example to the signed statements of two witnesses, presumably Mr. Hadley and Nurse Davis, that petitioner struck Mr. Young. As explained in Part II <em>supra, </em>this evidence is irrelevant under the \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d standard, no matter that it may have initially appeared to support the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-12\">Second, the substitute presiding official slighted the original presiding official\u2019s characterization of the evidence. He apparently gave this rejected evidence more credence than the original presiding official. This was incorrect. The Board should have evaluated petitioner\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees from the vantage point of the original presiding official. This view comports with the Board\u2019s procedure for an award of fees; the decision on the fee motion is an addendum to the decision on the merits and not a reconsideration of the evidence in a new light. Furthermore, the Board has ruled that this addendum should reflect the \u201cinsights and reasoning of <em>the presiding official who heard the case.\u201d Allen, supra, </em>at 592 (emphasis added). When that ideal situation is impossible, as here, the substitute presiding official should adopt as much as possible the original\u2019s point of view, and certainly the substitute should never re-characterize the evidence in the case con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>trary to the position of the original presiding official.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">Presiding Official Marks found no evidence supporting any of the charges against petitioner. She stated that Mr. Young\u2019s notes were \u201cvery suspect\u201d and did not identify appellant. She found \u201cno witness that can testify that this alleged incident occurred.\u201d The only witness to the second slapping incident was \u201cnot credible and [her testimony] should be given no weight.\u201d The agency\u2019s evidence regarding the verbal abuse charge was hearsay and \u201centitled to little weight.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a word, the VA presented no credible evidence that petitioner engaged in any misconduct. By any reading of Presiding Official Marks\u2019 opinion, petitioner was substantially innocent of the charges brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-7\">The decision of the Board in this case is contrary to law. The original presiding official ruled that the agency presented no credible, probative evidence to support any of the charges. Petitioner was, therefore, \u201csubstantially innocent,\u201d and the attorney\u2019s fees are \u201cwarranted in the interest of justice.\u201d Because the parties did not raise the issue of whether the petitioner\u2019s request for $3,587.09 was reasonable in amount, we remand the case to the Board for further proceedings on the amount of the fee allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-8\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1533-8\">. Initially, Mr. Hadley stated that he had a \u201cvery clear view\u201d of the entire incident. At the hearing, petitioner objected when counsel for the VA asked if Mr. Hadley actually saw petitioner hit Mr. Young. Counsel for the VA then moved to another topic without receiving a direct answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1533-9\">. There was also a report of a pre-hearing statement by Mr. Hadley (prepared by a VA investigator) that petitioner \u201csmacked\u201d Mr. Young. The presiding official assigned \u201cvery little weight to it\u201d because it was \u201cdouble hearsay\u201d and conflicted with Mr. Young\u2019s oral testimony at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1533-18\">. The VA did not wish to call Nurse Davis as a witness, but the presiding official insisted on hearing her testimony. Presiding Official Marks refers only to Nurse Davis\u2019 testimony in her discussion of the second charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1535-8\">. For example, in <em>Piper v. Department of Justice, </em>4 M.S.P.B. 89, 90 (1980), the Board ruled that the agency should have known it would not prevail on the merits when its only evidence was the inconsistent statements of the employee\u2019s co-worker. Similarly, in <em>Cicero v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>4 M.S.P.B. 145, 146 (1980), the Board awarded the employee attorney\u2019s fees because, in light of the evidence accumulated by the agency, it \"should have known that the demotion of appellant could not be sustained.\u201d <em>See also, Steger v. Defense Invest. Service, </em>717 F.2d 1402, 1406-07 (D.C.Cir.1983) (fees awarded when agency failed to investigate exonerating evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1535-12\">. As a practical matter, if the agency possesses no credible evidence prior to the hearing before the Board (category 5), the result of the case will <em>usually </em>be in favor of the employee (category 2). Thus, category 5 can merge into category 2. The Board has recognized that the categories overlap. <em>Allen, supra, </em>at 592. This may account for the confusion in some of the cases. <em>See Cicero, supra, </em>at 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1535-13\">. As indicated <em>supra, </em>petitioner seeks to recover fees under either category 2 or category 5 (or both).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1536-7\">. The statute says that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is proper if the employee is a prevailing party <em>and </em>the award is \"warranted in the interest of justice.\u201d This indicates that something more than an overall employee victory is necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1536-8\">. In rebuttal, the Government points to <em>Lewis v. Department of the Navy, </em>674 F.2d 714 (8th Cir. 1982), as a case in which the agency\u2019s mere presentation of damaging evidence precluded an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Lewis </em>is not so simple, however. At the first hearing in <em>Lewis, </em>the presiding official ruled in the agency\u2019s favor. Lewis prevailed only after a remand from the Board for further consideration. Furthermore, even though he prevailed at the second hearing, the presiding officer found that the agency\u2019s charges were not \u201cclearly without merit.\u201d 674 F.2d at 716. This in itself distinguishes <em>Lewis </em>from the instant case. Therefore, we will not at this time consider petitioner's suggestion, presented at oral argument, that we repudiate <em>Lewis.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1536-14\">. <em>See also, Allen, supra, </em>at 593 n. 35: \"In making such [an award] determination, the presiding official should examine <em>the degree of fault </em>on the employee\u2019s part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency\u2019s action.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1536-15\">. Presiding Official Jenkins stated: \"For the reasons outlined above the record in this case also fails to show that appellant was substantially innocent of the charges.\u201d The \"reasons\u201d are, however, merely a recapitulation of the discredited evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1537-10\">. In <em>Hoska v. Department of the Army, </em>677 F.2d 131, 141 (D.C.Cir.1982), the court ruled that such uncorroborated, questionable hearsay 746 F.2d \u2014 33 could not, in itself, support a charge of misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
