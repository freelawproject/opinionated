We hold that although government permission, in the form of an Office of Foreign Assets Control license, is required prior to the execution of any transaction reaching the assets of a designated Cuban national, the Office of Foreign Assets Control lacks authority to condition the bare formation of an attorney-client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>relationship on advance government approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The administrative authority asserted in this case has never been asserted on any prior occasion; the controlling legislation, were we to read it as contemplating a government license prior to obtaining counsel, would trench on a right of constitutional dimension. We therefore decide this appeal in a manner that both is consistent \u201cwith the policy of the legislation as a whole,\u201d <em>Shapiro v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 1, 31, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 1391, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1948) (quoting <em>United States v. American Trucking Associations, </em>310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940)), and avoids a constitutional inquiry. <em>See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346-48, 56 S.Ct. 466, 482-83, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brand\u00e9is, J., concurring); <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 441, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">The named plaintiff-appellant, American Airways Charters, Inc. (AAC), is a closely-held corporation, incorporated under the laws of Florida on February 15, 1977. Joint Appendix (J.A.) 15. AAC formerly provided charter service for tourist flights between the United States and Cuba. On April 7, 1982, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), acting pursuant to section 5(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 5(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> specially designated AAC a Cuban national. This designation, under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), 31 C.F.R. pt. 515 (1983),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> effectively froze or blocked all of AAC\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">At the time of the designation, and for over five months thereafter, AAC was represented by Allen L. Lear, a member of the bar of the District of Columbia. Lear advised AAC on OFAC\u2019s regulations, applied for licenses to carry out various transactions, and generally represented AAC in its dealings with OFAC. Lear held no OFAC license to represent AAC; he never requested OFAC\u2019s permission to represent AAC; he was never told by OFAC that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>representation of AAC was contingent upon application for and receipt of a license. After April 7, 1982, however, he sought and obtained licenses authorizing payment for services he rendered to AAC. <em>See </em>J.A. 34-35 (Lear affidavit); Brief for Appellees at 7 (hereafter, OFAC Brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Lear ceased representing AAC on September 10, 1982, when he left his law firm to commence service as a Department of Justice trial attorney. To provide for continued representation of AAC upon Lear\u2019s withdrawal as counsel, AAC\u2019s then president, Fernando Fuentes, engaged Harold A. Mayerson of the New York bar, and his law firm, Mayerson &amp; Smith, P.C., to represent the corporation. Fuentes authorized Mayerson, on or about September 8 or 9, 1982, to be AAC\u2019s legal advocate before OFAC and for all other purposes relating to AAC\u2019s corporate status. J.A. 27 (Mayer-son affidavit); <em>id. </em>at 32-33 (Fuentes affidavit); <em>see </em>OFAC Brief at 7-8. Both Fuentes, by letter dated September 13, 1982, and Mayerson, by letter dated September 15, 1982, notified OFAC that Mayerson &amp; Smith, P.C., had been retained as AAC\u2019s counsel. J.A. 18-19. In addition, on or about September 9, 1982, Mayerson called OFAC to schedule a meeting to discuss his substitution as counsel and the orderly transfer of AAC\u2019s legal work from Lear to Mayerson &amp; Smith, P.C. J.A. 27 (Mayerson affidavit); <em>see </em>OFAC Brief at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The meeting took place on September 16, 1982, at OFAC\u2019s offices. At the meeting, OFAC\u2019s director, Dennis M. O\u2019Connell, told Mayerson that legal representation of a \u201cdesignated national\u201d required a specific license, and that the letter Mayerson had written to OFAC was inadequate to be deemed a license request. In the absence of a proper application for and grant of a specific license, O\u2019Connell stated, Mayerson could not represent AAC. J.A. 28-29 (Mayerson affidavit); <em>id. </em>at 71 (O\u2019Connell affidavit); <em>see </em>OFAC Brief at 8. OFAC did not supply to, or identify for, Mayerson the application form to which its director referred. Nor, in response to Mayerson\u2019s inquiries, did OFAC officers cite any prior instance in which OFAC had in fact conditioned counsel\u2019s mere representation of a \u201cdesignated national\u201d on an advance application for and grant of a government license. J.A. 28-29 (Mayerson affidavit).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">On September 17, 1982, the day following Mayerson\u2019s meeting with OFAC officials, OFAC\u2019s director notified Fuentes, by letter, that he was henceforth \u201cprohibited from engaging in any transactions for, on behalf of, or with [AAC], without a specific license from this Office.\u201d J.A. 20. The letter stated that the prohibitions would \u201cprevent [Fuentes] from functioning as the president and chief executive officer of AAC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It further stated that the director ordered the prohibitions \u201cin the interests of conserving and liquidating AAC\u2019s assets and the proper settlement of its accounts,\u201d and in view of the \u201ca) control of AAC by Cuba or Cuban nationals while [Fuentes was] its president and chief executive officer, b) the transfer out of the U.S. of AAC assets on the day AAC was designated as a Cuban national, and c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>[Fuentes\u2019] indictment for violations of the Trading With the Enemy Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Thereafter, OFAC chose to recognize and deal with Frank Masdeu, one of AAC\u2019s two then vice-presidents, as the sole individual authorized to act on behalf of AAC. <em>See </em>J.A. 31 (Fuentes affidavit); <em>id. </em>at 76 (O\u2019Connell affidavit). OFAC has advised Masdeu that he has the right to select counsel for AAC and to apply for a license for the retention of such counsel. J.A. 68 (Masdeu affidavit); <em>id. </em>at 76 (O\u2019Connell affidavit). There is no indication in the record that OFAC ever consulted Florida law when it determined that Masdeu, and no other person, may properly speak for AAC. Nor is there any indication that Masdeu, on OFAC\u2019s recommendation or on his own initiative, ever attempted to secure a Florida court determination that he is currently the proper spokesman for AAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The instant action, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief allowing Mayerson to represent AAC, was commenced on November 3, 1982. Both sides filed dispositive motions. On July 11, 1983, the district court dismissed the complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>American Airways Charters, Inc. v. Regan, </em>Civ. No. 82-3143 (D.D.C. July 11, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 4-8. The district judge reasoned that on April 7, 1982, the day AAC was designated a foreign national, the corporation lost capacity to act; since that day, the court declared, AAC has \u201clack[ed] the capacity to retain counsel to bring this action in its own name.\u201d J.A. 5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> OFAC, according to the district court, \u201chas plenary authority to control [AAC\u2019s] operation.\u201d J.A. 7 n. 4. Thus, the district court apparently concluded, without OFAC\u2019s license, no attorney may prosecute this suit as AAC\u2019s agent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>But cf. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Fernandez, </em>741 F.2d 355 (11th Cir. 1984) (Cuban national need not obtain a license prior to initiating an in personam lawsuit in a United States court).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">We think the district court stumbled in attributing to OFAC more power than Congress conferred upon the Executive. AAC\u2019s assets are blocked, and may not be touched without OFAC\u2019s permission. But Congress has not authorized the Executive to seize the corporation, control all its internal operations, decide \u2014 with no regard to state law \u2014 who shall act as its president in lieu of the board-elected officer,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and impose a prior license requirement before the corporation can designate an attorney to represent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Facts not in dispute reveal that in early September 1982, when Fuentes authorized Mayerson to represent AAC, Fuentes was AAC\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Nor is it seriously disputed that, absent a valid prior license requirement, AAC\u2019s president would have authority to obtain counsel for the corporation. Because we conclude that Congress did not commit to the Executive power to condition a designated Cuban national\u2019s bare representation by counsel upon advance government approval, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with directions to enter appropriate relief for AAC.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Section 5(b) of TWEA confers upon the President authority to control, through any agency he designates, \u201ctransactions in foreign exchange\u201d; \u201ctransfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or to any banking institution\u201d; \u201cthe importing, exporting, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion, currency or securities\u201d; and finally \u201cany ... transactions involving [] any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.\u201d 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 5(b)(1) (1982) . The CACR prohibitions track this TWEA language. <em>See </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 515.201 (1983) .</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">First enacted in 1917 as a wartime measure, TWEA \u201cevince[d] the purpose to clothe the President with definitely restricted powers in respect of seizing property of those designated as enemies.\u201d <em>Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. v. Miller, </em>266 U.S. 457, 462, 45 S.Ct. 165, 165, 69 L.Ed. 374 (1925). The drafters of the original Act described it as designed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-13\">to mitigate the rules of law which prohibit all intercourse between the citizens of warring nations, and to permit, under careful safeguards and restrictions, certain kinds of business to be carried on. It also provides for the care and administration of the property and property rights of enemies and their allies in this country pending the war.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">S.Rep. No. 113, 65th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1917), <em>quoted in Markham v. Cabell, </em>326 U.S. 404, 414 n. 1, 66 S.Ct. 193, 198 n. 1, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945) (Burton, J., concurring). The Act, as amended to extend to peacetime national emergencies, OFAC points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>out, serves three principal foreign policy purposes: It \u201cprevents] [designated countries] from receiving any economic benefit from transactions with persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d; it \u201climit[s] the flow of currency to specified hostile nations\u201d; and it \u201cden[ies] [designated countries] outlet[s] for [their] goods in the United States market.\u201d OFAC Brief at 5-6 (quoting Malloy, <em>Embargo Programs of the United States Treasury Department, </em>20 ColumJ. Transnat\u2019l L. 485, 487-88 (1981)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">In asserting authority to control a designated foreign national\u2019s formation of an attorney-client relationship, OFAC relies dominantly on the TWEA power/ carried over into the CACR, to license transactions involving \u201cproperty in which any foreign ... national ... has any interest.\u201d Fuentes\u2019 purported retention of Mayerson as counsel for AAC on or about September 9, 1982, OFAC maintains, can only be viewed as an attempt to contract for services. Any contract, as OFAC reads the CACR and TWEA, constitutes a \u201ctransfer\u201d of AAC\u2019s \u201cproperty,\u201d and therefore cannot be consummated absent OFAC\u2019s advance permission. <em>See </em>OFAC Brief at 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The Act\u2019s catch-all reference to \u201cproperty,\u201d on which the agency relies, was added to TWEA when the statute was rewritten in 1941.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The addition did not attract large attention, and congressional intent regarding its scope is less than crystalline.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress recognized generally that the legislation enacted in 1941 concentrated \u201cextraordinary\u201d war powers in the President. <em>See, e.g., </em>87 Cong.Rec. 9858 (1941) (statement of Rep. Sumners, chairman, House Judiciary Committee). Certain aspects of the section 5(b) amendments \u2014 matters not in question here \u2014 occasioned substantial debate, most notably, whether section 5(b) could or should be read to impose government control over property owned by persons not \u201calien enemies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9859; <em>see id. </em>at 9861 (concern of many Congress members that the Act clearly reflect \u201cthe intention of the [Judiciary] committee ... to deal only with foreign property\u201d). It seems safe to say, however, that Congress, immediately concerned with other issues and more obvious forms of property, never explicitly contemplated the specific application of TWEA authority first announced by OFAC when OFAC told Mayerson that his substitution for Lear as AAC\u2019s counsel could not be accomplished without government license.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">We have no occasion in this case to address the claim implicit in plaintiff\u2019s brief, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant at 9, that the Act and regulations thereunder should never be read to cover the formation of executory contracts, absent any actual transfer of assets. Nor does the matter at hand involve any contest whether AAC was properly designated a \u201cCuban national,\u201d or whether its holdings are properly considered Cuban property. We limit our inquiry to the sole question properly before us for review: Does the bare formation of an attorney-client relationship lie outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the reach of the Act and its implementing regulations? In deciding that question in plaintiffs favor, we are guided by the reminder in <em>Real v. Simon, </em>510 F.2d 557, 564 (5th Cir.1975), that interpretation of TWEA terms must \u201chave the support of the congressional policies behind the Act,\u201d and by the due process concerns implicated in the asserted right to choose counsel without interference by officialdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">It is doubtful whether any of the exclusively economic purposes, <em>see generally Regan v. Wald, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3026, 82 L.Ed.2d 171 (1984), legitimately served by the Act would be advanced by upholding OFAC\u2019s novel position. If AAC is allowed to retain \u2014 although not to pay\u2014 counsel without government license, Cuba will not thereby receive economic benefit from transactions with persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; the goal of limiting the flow of currency to Cuba will remain unimpaired; and Cuba will not gain any outlet for its goods in the United States market. <em>See supra </em>p. 871. OFAC asserts an interest in preserving the blocked assets of AAC against improper disposition by Mayerson, or exorbitant claims asserted by him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But counsel for a designated national has no authority to dispose of the designated national\u2019s assets; and no fee can be paid counsel absent a separate, and express, authorization from OFAC. At one point in this litigation, OFAC indicated a desire to protect AAC from the baleful effects of a conflict of interest on Mayerson\u2019s part. <em>See supra </em>note 7. The disqualification of counsel for a conflict of interest, however, is a function generally entrusted to the judiciary,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> not to an executive agency that is, in significant respects, the adverse party. An interpretation of TWEA and the CACR with an eye to \u201cthe congressional policies behind the Act,\u201d in short, offers scant support for OFAC\u2019s newly-minted claim of authority to preview, and then permit or restrain, a designated national\u2019s choice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The nature and purpose of the attorney-client relationship, moreover, impel us to review with special care any initiative by an administrative officer to expose to licensing the very creation of that relationship.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We stress particularly that, in our complex, highly adversarial legal system, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>an individual or entity may in fact be denied the most fundamental elements of justice without prompt access to counsel. As this court observed in <em>Martin v. Lauer, </em>686 F.2d 24 (D.C.Cir.1982): \u201c[Wjhile private parties must ordinarily pay their own legal fees, <em>they have an undeniable right to retain counsel to ascertain their legal rights.\u201d Id. </em>at 32 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">The invalidity of a governmental attempt to deny counsel to a civil litigant was recognized in dictum over fifty years ago in <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9B\">The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel____ If in any case, civil or criminal, a state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">More recent decisions have elaborated on the same basic theme. <em>See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 270, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1021, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) (AFDC recipient \u201cmust be allowed to retain an attorney [in benefits termination hearing] if he so desires\u201d); <em>Mosley v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway, </em>634 F.2d 942, 945 (5th Cir.) (\u201cThe right to the advice and assistance of retained counsel in civil litigation is implicit in the concept of due process, and extends to administrative, as well as courtroom, proceedings.\u201d) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 906, 101 S.Ct. 3032, 69 L.Ed.2d 407 (1981); <em>see also United Mine Workers, District 12 v. Illinois State Bar Association, </em>389 U.S. 217, 221-22, 88 S.Ct. 353, 355-56, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967) (striking down, on first amendment grounds, state rule barring union from hiring attorney to assist its members in the assertion of their legal rights).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">We place against this backdrop OFAC\u2019s assertion of power to stop AAC from obtaining counsel unless and until the government licenses the corporation to do so. Even in the absence of a marked constitutional dimension to the problem, sensible construction of the Act would not encompass OFAC\u2019s current, unprecedented, reading of highly general clauses. The agency, we believe, has gone beyond mere interpretation. It has effectively legislated in an area in which our tradition indicates the lawmakers themselves \u2014 Congress\u2014should speak with a clear voice in advance of administrative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">When we add to our consideration the constitutional dimension plaintiff\u2019s aecessto-counsel plea entails, we find the case against OFAC\u2019s position overwhelming. As OFAC would have it, once an entity, although incorporated in the United States, has been administratively designated a foreign national, and therefore placed under government control regarding commercial matters, the designated corporation can be subjected to the decision of a government office, bounded by no standards that have been presented to us, even as to the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>question whether the corporation can meaningfully challenge the designation through counsel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We reject that bold view. Instead, we construe the Act and regulations thereunder \u201cin a manner that not only upholds their constitutionality but also steers clear of uncertainty on that score.\u201d <em>Kelsey v. Weinberger, </em>498 F.2d 701, 708 (D.C.Cir.1974) (footnote omitted); <em>see also Tagle v. Regan, </em>643 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir.1981) (construing TWEA).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See generally NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, </em>440 U.S. 490, 500-01, 99 S.Ct. 1313, 1318-19, 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979) (courts should prefer plausible construction of statute that avoids \u201cserious constitutional questions\u201d to agency\u2019s construction raising such questions, unless agency\u2019s position reflects \u201cthe affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">We thus conclude that Mayerson was properly retained by AAC as its counsel on or about September 9, 1982. No termination of that relationship by a person speaking for AAC is reflected in the materials supplied to us; the relationship thus continues in effect.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At such time as a person with authority to speak for AAC terminates the relationship, it will come to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">To clarify and summarize our disposition, we add these closing remarks. TWEA, as implemented by the CACR, gives OFAC authority to control, in almost every respect, AAC\u2019s commercial relations with the outside world. AAC does not argue otherwise. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 16. OFAC\u2019s power, however, extends only to the freezing or blocking of AAC\u2019s assets and the licensing of its transactions; OFAC has no authority to seize the corporation itself, to vest its assets,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or \u2014 beyond the power it has over employment contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>entered into by AAC \u2014 to rearrange its internal affairs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">OFAC has undisputed power to deny AAC permission to engage in specified commercial transactions. We caution here that nothing in our disposition is properly read as authorizing payment to counsel without the approval of OFAC. But OFAC may not, to give an extreme example, take a member of its own staff and, without regard to AAC\u2019s corporate structure, install that person as AAC\u2019s new chief executive officer, thereby controlling AAC\u2019s operations from the inside. If it could, then the entire CACR licensing scheme, predicated on <em>external </em>control, would be superfluous as applied to corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">State law, beyond question, is preempted when it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941). But OFAC has not demonstrated why it is insufficient to control, through licensing, all transactions reaching the assets of AAC, a Florida-chartered corporation now designated a Cuban national, or how taking the corporation over from the inside, incidentally eliminating any genuine possibility of judicial review at the corporation\u2019s behest, furthers the balancing of interests embodied in the congressional external control scheme. The internal structure of a designated national corporation remains properly governed by state law, not by agency fiat, in the absence of a concrete showing that state law in fact conflicts with federal purposes and objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">OFAC has repeatedly taken the position that it recognizes only Frank Masdeu as having any authority to speak for AAC, or to request any license on the company\u2019s behalf. We express no opinion as to whether Masdeu, or anyone else, may properly speak for the company. We emphasize, however, that questions of AAC\u2019s internal structure, and of who may speak for AAC when certain of its officers have been incapacitated by OFAC or by other federal action, are questions properly referred in the first instance to state law. Thus Florida law is the appropriate initial reference in determining who has authority to terminate the relationship between AAC and Mayerson or to hire other counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">In enforcing section 5(b) of TWEA, OFAC must seek resolution of \u201cthe paradox posed by the need for emergency power in a constitutional regime.\u201d Note, <em>The International Emergency Economic Powers Act: A Congressional Attempt to Control Presidential Emergency Power, </em>96 Harv.L.Rev. 1102, 1112 (1983). We are a constitutional regime in which even emergency power is subject to limitations under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>our highest law. OFAC\u2019s unprecedented action in this case has disturbing implications. The government agency charged with control over a corporation\u2019s external transactions, and the distribution of any of its assets, appears here to seek as well to stifle any voice the corporation might wish to raise before the courts in protest. We doubt that such an attempt is \u201cworthy of our great government.\u201d <em>Brandt v. Hickel, </em>427 F.2d 53, 57 (9th Cir.1970). We find no congressional authorization for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\">.

These affidavits inform that attorneys for designated nationals did obtain licenses <em>for payment </em>of legal fees, but had never known or heard of any case, prior to this one, in which OFAC conditioned <em>mere representation </em>of a designated national on an advance application for and grant of a license. <em>See </em>J.A. 29 (Mayerson affidavit); <em>id. </em>at 35 (Lear affidavit); <em>id. </em>at 36-37 (Rabinowitz affidavit); <em>id. </em>at 38-39 (Faulkner affidavit). OFAC, in face of these affidavits, did not call to the district court's attention any past occasion on which OFAC had announced or proposed that a designated national must seek and receive a license <em>before </em>obtaining legal representation. Nor has OFAC contended in this court that it has, at any time prior to the episode in suit, asserted that representation, without more, requires a license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b955-9\">. The district court compared AAC, once it was designated a Cuban national, to a principal incapacitated by death or insanity. J.A. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b955-10\">. We note the Catch-22 quality of this reasoning: the named plaintiff's incapacity to \"prosecut[e] ... this suit by counsel,\u201d J.A. 7, the district court essentially held, can be overcome only if the named defendants grant a license \"authorizing] the[ir] prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. See also infra </em>note 15 and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">In this court, OFAC has elaborated on the district court's terse disposition. OFAC asserts that no case or controversy exists because suit was not properly authorized by AAC. According to OFAC, neither AAC\u2019s authorization (through Fuentes) of Mayerson on or about Sept. 9 to \"take any and all actions necessary to represent [AAC] and to protect [its] rights and interests with respect to OFAC or any other legal matter,\u201d J.A. 32-33, <em>see </em>OFAC Brief at 14, nor any actions that were or could have been taken at a subsequent meeting, styled a Special Meeting in lieu of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, of Fuentes and Roger Dooley (AAC\u2019s sole shareholders), constituted valid authorization for the litigation. OFAC points out that Frank Masdeu, the person it recognizes as sole \"spokesman\u201d for AAC, OFAC Brief at 20, did not request Mayerson to commence this civil proceeding. Masdeu is a vice-president of AAC but, unlike Fuentes and Dooley, he holds no shares in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">We need not address the particulars of OFAC\u2019s \"no case or controversy\u201d contention. This suit, given the facts not in dispute, <em>see infra </em>p. 870, received adequate and appropriate \u201csanction of the directors or other proper officer.\" 2 Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 483 (1982). Under Florida law, the president of a corporation has authority to engage the services of counsel and institute suits on the corporation\u2019s behalf. <em>See Conlee Constr. Co. v. Cay Constr. Co., </em>221 So.2d 792, 795 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b955-14\">. No contest has been raised in this proceeding concerning OFAC\u2019s decision prohibiting Fuentes, on and after September 17, 1982, from \"engaging in any transactions for, on behalf of, or with [AAC], without a specific license from [OFAC].\" J.A. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">. OFAC additionally maintained on brief and at oral argument that AAC\u2019s suit should be dismissed because the company had not exhausted its administrative remedies by filing a formal license request, or having one filed by Mayer-son. That position is no longer tenable. Upon consideration of the representation of Dennis O'Connell, OFAC\u2019s director, that OFAC was \"prepared to act quickly on any application AAC may wish to make to hire the counsel of its choice,\" and the indication of OFAC\u2019s counsel at oral argument that the agency would give prompt consideration to a filing by counsel relating to AAC\u2019s retention of Mayerson, we instructed Mayerson to file</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHm\">a [formal] application with OFAC ... to confirm his representation of appellant American Airways Charters, Inc., pursuant to the September 1982 exchange of correspondence between Mr. Fuentes, Mr. Mayerson, and Mr. O'Connell ..., and to confirm his representation of appellant in the instant litigation for a declaration of appellant's right to retain counsel of its choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgeO\">We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A47\">This instruction is without prejudice to the position advanced by Mr. Mayerson that the relevant federal law does not mandate, and the Constitution forbids, a requirement of OFAC licensing for the retention of counsel by a designated national.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-16\"><em>American Airways Charters, Inc. v.

In addition, OFAC required Mayerson to answer a number of questions assertedly directed to whether representation of AAC by Mayerson might lead to a conflict of interest. OFAC subsequently informed Mayerson that \"you have not met the conditions spelled out in the license\u201d because \u201cyou have provided no indication that Mr. Masdeu seeks your services for AAC.\u201d Letter from Dennis M.

We would face a different case if Congress itself inaugurated the prior license requirement. We note that in 1938, Congress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act, ch. 327, 52 Stat. 631 (1938) (codified as amended at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 611-621 (1982)), requiring agents of foreign principals to register with the Secretary of State. This Act requires <em>registration only; </em>it confers on the Secretary no authority to deny a registrant permission to act on behalf of the foreign principal. Initially, the legislation contained no explicit exemption for lawyers, and the Supreme Court refused to read such an exemption into the Act. <em>Rabinowitz v. Kennedy, </em>376 U.S. 605, 84 S.Ct. 919, 11 L.Ed.2d 940 (1964) (attorneys representing Republic of Cuba required to register).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Although the Foreign Agents Registration Act serves only a notice, not a licensing function, Congress has indicated sensitivity to the lawyer\u2019s role. After the decision in <em>Rabinowitz v. Kennedy, </em>Congress amended the statute to exempt lawyers insofar as they engaged or agreed to engage in the legal representation of a disclosed foreign principal before a court of law or in the course of established agency proceedings. Act of July 4, 1966, Pub.L. No. 89-486, \u00a7 3(b), 80 Stat. 244, 246 (codified at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 613(g) (1982)). Congress further amended a separate section of the Act to ensure that attorneys engaging in \"routine ... advising and counseling [of] foreign clients\u201d would be exempt. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1470, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 9-10, <em>reprinted in </em>1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2397, 2405. This congressional action, when only registration was at stake, adds to our grave doubts that Congress ever entertained the notion that an executive officer might extract from highly general statutory language authority to initiate a prior license requirement governing an attorney's response to a client's request for representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">. It appears beyond sensible debate that corporations, in our society, do indeed enjoy the right to retain counsel. Corporations may not assert \"purely personal\u201d rights but, no less than natural persons, they are entitled to due process and the equal protection of the laws. <em>Grosjean v. American Press Co., </em>297 U.S. 233, 244, 56 S.Ct. 444, 446, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936). As our sister court observed, \"the right to effective assistance of counsel is not so peculiarly applicable to individuals that corporations should not be entitled to it.\" <em>United States v. Rad-O-Lite of Philadelphia, Inc., </em>612 F.2d 740, 743 (3d Cir.1979). In fact, denying a corporation the right to retain counsel may be tantamount to stripping the corporation of its right to defend itself in court, for \"it is established that a corporation, which is an artificial entity that can only act through agents, cannot proceed <em>pro se.\" Jones v. Niagara Frontier Transp. Auth., </em>722 F.2d 20, 22 (2d Cir.1983). A human shareholder's right to representation, of course, does not obviate the need for counsel to the corporation. No shareholder \u2014 not even a sole shareholder \u2014 has standing in the usual case to bring suit in his individual capacity on a claim that belongs to the corporation. <em>See, e.g., Sherman v. British Leyland Motors, Ltd., </em>601 F.2d 429, 439-40 (9th Cir.1979); <em>see also, e.g., Blum v. Morgan Guar. Trust Co., </em>539 F.2d 1388, 1390 (5th Cir.1976) (individual shareholder will not be permitted to sue <em>derivatively </em>on the corporation's behalf if court concludes that conflict of interest prevents him from serving as an appropriate representative).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b960-6\">. If OFAC is correct, AAC would also be precluded from litigating in the Florida courts any issues relating to its corporate existence, including the identity of its lawful spokesman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\">. OFAC maintains that plaintiff's effort to implicate constitutional concerns is \"no different,\u201d OFAC Brief at 25, from the first amendment argument rejected in <em>Veterans &amp; Reservists for Peace in Vietnam v. Regional Comm\u2019r of Customs, </em>459 F.2d 676 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 933, 93 S.Ct. 232, 34 L.Ed.2d 188 (1972). In <em>Veterans &amp; Reservists, </em>the Third Circuit upheld OFAC\u2019s requirement that plaintiff secure a license before receiving \u201cRed Chinese literature,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 679, in the form of English-language newspapers mailed from North Vietnam. The court found the government's interest in regulating the flow of money to designated countries compelling, <em>id. </em>at 682, and indicated that requesters would be entitled to a license upon certifying that they did not intend to pay for the materials, either directly or indirectly. <em>Id. </em>at 683. The merits of the <em>Veterans &amp; Reservists </em>decision are not before us. We note, however, that the government concern asserted in that case was the threat of transfer of currency to North Vietnam and (at the time of the seizure still subject to our embargo) the People's Republic of China, a concern at the heart of the Act. In this case, OFAC identifies no interest of comparable dimension that reasonably supports its actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b960-8\">. Even if OFAC\u2019s view of the law did not implicate constitutional concerns, the agency\u2019s insistence that we owe its construction deference would be dubious. Far from representing a consistent, longstanding agency interpretation, OFAC\u2019s current position apparently represents a sharp departure from prior practice, <em>see supra </em>note 3, first made public as a result of the events that precipitated this lawsuit, and explained, so far as the record shows, only in briefs and other papers generated by the litigation. <em>See Tagle v. Regan, </em>643 F.2d at 1068 n. 13 (\"[T]he Treasury\u2019s interpretation of its authority [under TWEA] is neither contemporaneous with the statute's enactment, nor consistent with its earlier views. These facts considerably reduce the deference paid to its current position____\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b960-12\">. Counsel for OFAC stated at oral argument that even if an attorney-client relationship was formed on September 9, it was extinguished one week later, when OFAC barred Fuentes from engaging in further transactions on behalf of AAC. The attorney-client relationship lapsed, counsel argued, when Fuentes became disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">OFAC\u2019s portrayal of agency law is novel indeed. When OFAC barred Fuentes, <em>his </em>ability to serve as AAC\u2019s agent ended; but we do not comprehend how that act served as well to terminate the pre-existing, ongoing agency relationship between AAC and Mayerson. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 121 comment c, illustration 2 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b960-14\">.

The <em>General Aniline </em>court, however, held only that the Treasury Department had authority, during the Second World War when the executive power in question reached its height, to order the termination of an employment contract between a German national corporation and plaintiff, an industrial chemist. We do not touch that holding here. Nor do we wrench language from the <em>General Aniline </em>decision out of context and transpose it to the different time and regulatory setting of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Other cases relied on by OFAC for its pronouncement that \"state corporate law cannot justify a result contrary to ... the federal policies and purposes served by [TWEA],\u201d OFAC Brief at 20, are similarly unhelpful. In <em>Nielsen v. Secretary of the Treasury, </em>424 F.2d 833 (D.C.

GREENE, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AUyz\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a minor Treasury Department bureau, has decided that, because it had listed appellant as a Cuban national, it also had the authority to prevent that corporation from being represented by counsel. This decision, if upheld, would have the effect of precluding appellant, through counsel, from contesting OFAC\u2019s actions either administratively or in the courts, from litigating in the Florida courts OFAC\u2019s decision to recognize its chosen individual as the official head of the corporation, or from handling any other legal business. This assertion of authority is unprecedented in the annals of the Trading with the Enemy Act or any other law to which we have been referred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I agree entirely with Judge Ginsburg\u2019s analysis of the applicable law as not permitting such an exercise of power, and I also agree with her that, were OFAC\u2019s position sustained, the implications would be both far-reaching and dangerous. Whatever authority our society may have granted to government, it has always placed a high value on the ability of those at the receiving end of bureaucratic edicts to contest in the courts the legality of what was done to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">The Catch-22 label from Joseph Heller\u2019s book of the same name has been applied so often to so many situations that it has by now acquired the status of a clich\u00e9. But it is difficult to imagine a situation where that label is more apt: a corporation is summarily designated by a governmental agency as a \u201cCuban national,\u201d but it is not allowed effectively to defend itself against that designation on the theory that, because it is a \u201cCuban national,\u201d the designating agency need not permit it to be represented by counsel to challenge the designation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If there are precedents in American law to such circular processes, they have not been pointed out to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Two basic points made in support of OFAC\u2019s position deserve further note.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">First, OFAC has informed the Court that some of those involved in the management of the corporation were engaged in improper or even unlawful activities involving Cuba. But that is hardly a reason for depriving that corporation of the right to choose and retain counsel. We do not deny counsel to murderers or to rapists, to those accused or convicted of treason or espionage, or to those who sue the government to seek access to sensitive national security documents, to cite but a few examples, and I therefore see no basis for depriving this appellant of its retained counsel because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>some of its officers may be unsavory. Whatever the corporation and its officers may be, they surely do not represent such a menace to this country \u2014 in excess of the danger presented by those in the categories enumerated above \u2014 that the corporation must be so singled out. If the claims appellant may wish to assert before the administrative agency or in the courts are without validity, that will become apparent soon enough, whether or not counsel continues to represent it; if appellant does have valid claims, it should be allowed to present them in an effective manner, irrespective of the backgrounds or histories of its officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Second, OFAC contends that, if appellant is allowed to be represented by its previously retained counsel, the next step will be. to require counsel to be paid, in violation of the freezing regulations. Insofar as I am concerned, there is nothing in our disposition of this case that would give counsel any claim to payment if such payment is prohibited by the appropriate regulations. Thus, I do not share OFAC\u2019s concern about appellant\u2019s lawyer or the issue of his payment. If that attorney wants to proceed with his representation on what may turn out to be a volunteer basis, well and good. But this Court has not by its decision created for him a means for securing a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The dissent would return the case to the District Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to explore issues relating to Florida law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to the exhaustion of administrative remedies. But there are neither new facts nor Florida legal principles for the District Court to consider. Moreover, OFAC made it clear both initially and after our inquiry following oral argument that it had no intention of granting a license to appellant which would enable the corporation to continue to employ counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whatever powers the Treasury may have\u2014 and I agree that they are extensive \u2014 they do not include the power to deny a designated individual or corporation the right to hire counsel, let alone the power to cut off an attorney-client relationship previously established.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">With these additional observations, I concur fully in Judge Ginsburg\u2019s opinion for the Court and in the disposition of the appeal made by that opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-8\">. It may be \u2014 although this has not been shown \u2014 that equivalent authority was exercised during the period when the government had statutory power to \"vest,\" that is to take over, German or other enemy assets during World War I and World War II \u2014 a power which OFAC itself does not claim to possess now. The one substantive decision relied upon in this regard by the <em>dissent </em>\u2014 Alexewicz <em>v. General Aniline &amp; Film Corp., </em>181 Misc. 181, 43 N.Y.S.2d 713 (Sup. Ct.1943) \u2014 was rendered at the height of World War II, when the vesting provisions were in effect. In any event, unlike the dissent (at p. 877), I have difficulty regarding congressional inaction in the face of a decision by a court in Broome County as acquiescence in its holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-14\">. There is here yet another Catch-22 bootstrap. OFAC first unilaterally selected appellant\u2019s vice president as the corporation\u2019s single authorized spokesman; OFAC then concluded that, inasmuch as this chosen instrument did not request legal representation, it was established that the corporation did not desire counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\">. The District Court would be required to determine whether Florida law might not conceivably (1) regard appellant's vice president rather than its president as that body\u2019s proper spokesman, and (2) require ratification by the shareholders of the retention of counsel by appellant's president and of the instant lawsuit. Since appellant through its president retained counsel before OFAC imposed any license requirement on appellant and since Florida law permits the president of a corporation to retain counsel (see note 5 of Judge Ginsburg\u2019s opinion), there is no basis for inquiring into these negatives \u2014 certainly not at the behest of a stranger to the corporation such as OFAC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b963-15\">. OFAC, however, regards Florida law as irrelevant, arguing that under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, its decisions override state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b963-16\">.

That court has not been allowed to evaluate the latest developments in the case, and should be permitted to consider, in the first instance, a variety of issues which are far from clear on this record and which undermine the majority\u2019s attempt to reach the merits of the case. I do not join the majority\u2019s opinion, which relies on a record that contains far more questions than answers and which signficantly impairs the ability of the Government to supervise and control the business activities of Cuban entities within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">First, some facts which are not noted in the majority\u2019s opinion place the actions of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the \u201cControl Office\u201d) in a more reasonable light than does the majority\u2019s opinion. This is not, as the majority implies, a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>where some hapless corporation finds itself caught in the coils of a Kafkaesque bureaucracy that is systematically attempting to deprive it of its rights. It is, in fact, a case where the Government is questioning the continuing validity of an alleged employment contract under which an admittedly Cuban-controlled corporation may be charged $100 an hour in legal fees \u2014 for no specified corporate purpose \u2014 thus using up limited corporate assets that are needed to pay off the corporation\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">It is undisputed at this point that Cuba controlled American Airways Charters, Inc. (\u201cAirways\u201d), a Florida corporation. That designation has never been challenged, and is not being challenged in this litigation. Airways\u2019 president and co-owner, Fernando Fuentes, already has been convicted of violating the Trading With the Enemy Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), for allowing assets of Airways to come into Cuban hands <em>after </em>it had been determined to be a Cuban national. His criminal conviction is not being challenged here. Fuentes\u2019 partner in Airways, Roger Dooley, was also indicted, and is now a fugitive from justice outside the United States. The present validity of an \u201copen-ended\u201d employment contract which it is claimed was entered into by Fuentes, <em>after </em>the corporation came under the jurisdiction of the Control Office, is an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">On April 7, 1982, Airways was designated by the Control Office as a \u201cspecially designated national\u201d of Cuba (J.A. 15-16, 69).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, on the same day, Fuentes ordered one of Airways\u2019 planes to be flown on an <em>unscheduled </em>flight to Cuba. Affidavit of Dennis M. O\u2019Connell, Director of Office of Foreign Assets Control (J.A. 72-74).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plane and other assets remaining in Cuba amount to about $375,000. That flight, made in defiance of American law, deprived the United States of a valuable asset that may be necessary to pay creditors of Airways. The Government, as the majority concedes, has a valid interest in preventing United States property from coming into Cuban hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">The specific events leading to this section began on or about September 8,1982, when Fuentes (according to his affidavit) informed a lawyer, Harold Mayerson, that he wanted him to represent Airways. This was five months after Airways had been designated as a Cuban national. At a subsequent conference with representatives of the Control Office on September 16, 1982, Mayerson presented two letters: one from Fuentes (dated September 13) and one from Mayerson (dated September 15). Both letters notified the Control Office that Mayer-son had been retained to act as counsel to Airways. The Control Office advised Mayerson that a formal application was necessary under the Act and its implementing regulations. Mayerson <em>refused </em>to make formal application for a license. He later brought this action in Airways\u2019 name in the district court. The court dismissed the action for lack of a case or controversy. Mayerson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">After argument on appeal, this court ordered Mayerson to apply for a license. He did so. The Control Office replied promptly by letter of April 12,1984, as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Control Office\u2019s letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>was in the form of a \u201cconditional license,\u201d which conditioned Mayerson\u2019s employment on his furnishing additional information to the Control Office. Most of the additional information \u2014 including information regarding Mayerson\u2019s extensive contacts with other Cuban entities \u2014 has <em>not </em>been produced. Airways was subject to control under the Trading With the Enemy Act when it is claimed Mayerson was designated, and because he was hired by Fuentes (under whose presidency Airways was allowed to become a Cuban national) and because he seeks approval for his <em>continuing </em>employment as counsel, <em>for no disclosed purpose.,</em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under a contract which he contends authorizes him to bill Airways $100 an hour for his services, the Control Office has continued in its refusal to license Mayer-son, except on a <em>conditional </em>basis as heretofore noted. The inquiry by the Control Office to determine that Mayerson was properly authorized to represent the Corporation, that he was not actually intending to represent Fuentes, and that he had no conflict of interest that would disqualify him from representing Airways were all proper pre-license inquiries. So was the attempt to determine if Fuentes was trying to extend his authority and act as president of Airways <em>after </em>his disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">This case is simply not in the proper posture to permit resolution of the complex issues it contains. The district court ruled on the situation as it found it; the situation has now changed, and the case should be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">At the time the district court rendered its decision in this case, Mayerson had not applied for a license to represent Airways. On appeal, it was clear that Mayerson had not exhausted his administrative remedies before bringing suit. The situation of this case was so muddled at oral argument that this court, to try to clear up some of the confusion, took the unusual step of ordering Mayerson to apply for a license. He did so. The Control Office responded by issuing a \u201cconditional license\u201d which demanded certain information and stated that the license would become effective only when someone <em>currently </em>authorized to act for Airways requested Mayerson\u2019s services. This \u201cconditional license\u201d marks the first time in this litigation that the agency has <em>done </em>anything beyond stating that it did not consider Mayerson to be Airways\u2019 lawyer. Thus, there is <em>now </em>\u2014 for <em>the first time in this case </em>\u2014 some concrete agency action for the trial court to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Moreover, it is entirely possible that there is still no case or controversy because \u2022when it was instituted <em>the suit brought by Mayerson had not been properly authorized by responsible officers or directors of Airways. </em>This lack of specific authority to institute the lawsuit when it was filed distinguishes this case from <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Fernandez, </em>741 F.2d 355 (11th Cir.1984). The majority\u2019s approach to this problem is to assert the bald conclusion that \u201cfacts not in dispute\u201d demonstrate that the suit was properly authorized. <em>See </em>Maj. at n. 5. But on this record it is impossible to determine that Mayerson had adequate corporate authorization to bring <em>this suit. </em>The continuance of Mayer-son\u2019s authority to act as a lawyer for Airways and to institute this specific suit at the time he did are, under the Trading With the Enemy Act, valid subjects for inquiry by the Control Office. The Control Office in making the inquiries posed by its conditions is exercising a specific duty imposed upon it by Congress and is not to be considered as a stranger to the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Fuentes claims in an affidavit that, prior to his disqualification, he directed Mayer-son \u201cto take any and all actions necessary to represent [Airways\u2019] rights and interests with respect to [the Control Office] <em>or any other legal matter\u201d </em>(J.A. 32) (emphasis added). The delegation of such broad corporate authority is clearly <em>ultra vires </em>even a legal corporate president. A secret shareholders\u2019 meeting of Fuentes and Dooley in the Bahamas, that may or may not have been legal, apparently attempted to \u201cratify\u201d Fuentes\u2019 action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither this shareholders\u2019 meeting, nor a subsequent directors\u2019 meeting, purported specifically to authorize the initiation of any lawsuit. The present suit was <em>not </em>specifically \u201cratified\u201d by the shareholders. One issue is whether or not Fuentes\u2019 very broad statement, made long before this lawsuit was filed, and long before the subsequent attempted \u201cratification\u201d of that statement, authorized the attorney to bring this specific lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">The majority relies for its position on this point on a section of a general treatise, which does not support its position. The treatise states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-8\">The general rule that an attorney, who is clothed with no other authority than that arising from his employment in that capacity, has no power to compromise or settle or release and discharge his client\u2019s claim, applies equally to attorneys for corporations____ The general counsel of a corporation, in the absence of provision in the charter or bylaws, <em>has no authority to institute and prosecute suits without the sanction of the directors or other proper </em>officer____ But such an attorney may do all things <em>incidental </em>to the prosecution of the suit but which affect the remedy only and not the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">9 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 483 (rev. perm. ed. 1982) (emphasis added). The work goes on to state specifically that \u201c[a]s a general rule the control of the conduct of litigation is the responsibility of the <em>directors.\u201d </em>2 W. Fletcher, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4119 (rev.perm.ed. 1976) (emphasis added). Those provisions specifically apply to corporate general counsels; for outside retained attorneys like Mayerson, the rule is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-12\">They cannot themselves bring suits for the corporation, unless <em>specially authorized, </em>nor can they compromise or release a corporate claim; but they may do all things incidental to the prosecution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>the suit, and which affect the remedy only and not the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4220. Thus, even relying on the source cited by the majority, a lawyer cannot bring a lawsuit on behalf of a corporation unless, at the very least, he has been \u201cspecially authorized\u201d to bring that particular suit. There is no \u201cspecial\u201d authorization for this suit in the present record, nor is any such authorization claimed. The district court has not passed upon whether Fuentes\u2019 claim of direction to \u201ctake any and all actions necessary to represent\u201d Airways on \u201cany legal matter\u201d is adequate <em>special authorization </em>to bring this particular suit. On the contrary, it appears to be an attempt to delegate an overly wide discretion to institute law suits that is specifically vested by statute in the directors. This court on appeal cannot properly decide such a fact-based issue on the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s reliance on an ambiguous paragraph from a general treatise for such an important point is curious. Clearly, the question of whether an agent has authority to bring a lawsuit is a matter of state law. In this case, as the majority frequently stresses, it is <em>Florida </em>law. Although the majority repeatedly chastises the Control Office \u2014 unjustly\u2014for allegedly failing to determine Florida law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it does not attempt to determine Florida law on this issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Either Florida law governs the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>internal workings of this corporation, or it does not. It cannot be followed on some issues and ignored on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The district court has not had the opportunity to determine Florida law on this point, or to evaluate the initial validity or subsequent continuance of the FuentesMayerson relationship in light of that law. It is impossible on the present record to determine if this suit was properly authorized. That task is properly one for the <em>trial </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Despite their harsh condemnation of the Government, their claim to lofty principles of justice, and their high-sounding language, the majority and concurring opinions have merely gone a long way toward making this difficult case even more complicated. If the district court \u201cstumbled\u201d over the pitfalls of this case, <em>see </em>Maj. at 869, the majority, by contrast, has executed a half gainer onto the pavement. In its apparent eagerness to impugn the ethics and integrity of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the majority has evaded all the jurisdictional problems and simply declared its own rule of law. Because the district court should pass on these questions in the first instance \u2014 especially in a case such as this where the factual record is in a highly unsatisfactory state for meaningful appellate review \u2014 I would remand to the district court to allow it to review the conditional license upon an adequate evidentiary record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">If it were necessary or proper to reach the merits of this case, as the majority has, I would have very serious doubts as to the majority\u2019s purported resolution of the issues. Most of those doubts revolve around the majority\u2019s attempt to either (1) ignore the fact that this case involves an <em>employment contract, </em>or (2) draw some kind of line between employment contracts for lawyers and those for accountants, consultants, and mechanics. Without attempting to decide the issues or provide detailed analysis, the following are my areas of disagreement with the majority and the concurring opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">It is a basic principle that authority over the foreign affairs of the United States is constitutionally vested in the Executive Branch of our Government, subject to some legislation that must pass constitutional muster. The Judiciary necessarily has a limited role to play. As the Supreme Court recently noted, \u201cMatters relating \u2018to the conduct of foreign relations ... are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Regan v. Wald, </em>\u2014 U.S.-at-, 104 S.Ct. 3026, 3039, 82 L.Ed.2d 171 (1984) (quoting <em>Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, </em>342 U.S. 580, 589, 72 S.Ct. 512, 519, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">The authority delegated by Congress to the President under the Trading With the Enemy Act is considerable. \u201c[B]oth the legislative history and cases interpreting the [Act] fully sustain the broad authority of the Executive when acting under this Congressional grant of power.\u201d <em>Dames &amp; Moore v. Regan, </em>453 U.S. 654, 672, 101 S.Ct. 2972, 2983, 69 L.Ed.2d 918 (1981). The Supreme Court only recently refused to hold that the power originally granted to the President in the Act \u2014 and grandfathered as to Cuba under 1977 amendments to the Act \u2014 is to be narrowly construed. <em>See Regan v. Wald, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Examining the statute in light of the President\u2019s broad authority, it seems apparent that employment contracts of lawyers for countries or entities covered by the Trading With the Enemy Act would fall within the range of transactions for which the Control Office may require licenses. Section 5(b) of the Act provides that the Control Office, through \u201csuch rules and regulations as [it] may prescribe, by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise,\u201d has the authority to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-5\">investigate, <em>regulate, </em>direct and compel, <em>nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, </em>any acquisition holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or <em>exercising any right, power or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any </em>person____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">50 U.S.GApp. \u00a7 5(b)(1)(B); 91 Stat. 1625 (emphasis added). Pursuant to this delegation of power, the Secretary of the Treasury promulgated Cuban Assets Control Regulation C.F.R. \u00a7 515.201(b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-8\">(b) All of the following transactions are prohibited, except as specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury ... by means of regulations, rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-9\">(1) All dealings in, including, without limitation, transfers, withdrawals, or ex-portations of, any property____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The regulations specifically apply to \u201ctransfers of property\u201d which is specifically defined in the Regulations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-g\">any actual or purported ... <em>transaction ... </em>the purpose, intent, or effect of which is to create ... any right, ... power, ... or interest with respect to any property and ... <em>shall include the making of any power of attorney, ... contract, the appointment of any agent, </em>or the exercise of any power of appointment ... or other power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-3\">3 C.F.R. \u00a7 515.310 (emphasis added). It thus appears that hiring a lawyer at $100 an hour \u201cto take any and all actions necessary to represent [Airways\u2019] rights and interests with respect to [the Control Office] or any other legal matter\u201d (J.A. 32) constitutes \u201cmaking a power of attorney,\u201d \u201cmaking a contract,\u201d or \u201cappointing an agent,\u201d and hence is a \u201ctransaction\u201d subject to licensing by the Control Office. This authority brings attorney\u2019s contracts within the jurisdiction of the Trading With the Enemy Act in a manner similar to the way 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a) of the Bankruptcy Act brings the employment of attorneys within its jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-13\">\u00a7 327. Employment of professional persons</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-14\">(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the trustee, <em>with the court\u2019s approval, </em>may employ one or more attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons, that do not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate, and that are disinterested persons, to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee\u2019s duties under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">(Emphasis added.) Under both Acts it is legitimate for the agency charged with carrying out the terms of the Act to inquire whether an attorney purporting to act for a subject corporation does \u201chold or represent an adverse interest to the estate [or corporation] ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">The majority cites some legislative history that it admits is \u201cless than crystalline,\u201d but ignores one other indication of Congress\u2019 intent. Forty-one years ago, the court in <em>Alexewicz v. General Aniline &amp; Film Corp., </em>181 Misc. 181, 43 N.Y.S.2d 713 (Sup.Ct.1943), relying on essentially identical language, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-17\">[T]he Secretary of the Treasury, acting through his designated Treasury representative, had ample authority to condition the defendant\u2019s continuance in business upon a severance of relationships with those individuals whom the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ment believed to be improper employees. Having the power to regulate or prohibit in toto the financial operations of the defendant, it had the implied authority to condition the continuance of the license to do business upon its approval of the employment practices of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6G\"><em>Id. </em>at 724. The relevant provisions interpreted in the <em>Alexewicz </em>decision have continued substantially unchanged by Congress for these many years. This continuing Congressional acquiescence indicates that Congress did not consider such employment contracts to be beyond the reach of the Treasury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Indeed, the majority ultimately decides not to decide whether employment contracts as a class cannot be affected by the Control Office. But it seems clear that the majority would not have reached the same decision had the Office merely required a license for the hiring of an outside auditor. It is apparently the hiring of an <em>attorney </em>that makes the equation different. The majority tries to distinguish between the \u201cbare formation of an attorney-client relationship,\u201d Maj. at 871, and the actual retention of counsel, which obviously implies payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">That an attorney \u2014 rather than a pipefitter \u2014 is involved in this case does not necessarily alter the legal situation. The majority justifies its narrow restriction of the Control Office\u2019s authority as necessary to avoid possible constitutional infirmities, <em>i.e., </em>infringement of the right to counsel. But this case does <em>not </em>involve a right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment (it is not a criminal case) or a right under the due process clause. <em>The question is not whether the corporation had a right to appoint Mayerson as counsel, but whether the corporation properly authorized him to bring the suit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">I note, however, that the majority attempts to protect the right to counsel by drawing a theoretical line between issuing a license to a lawyer permitting him to enter into an employment contract, and issuing a license permitting him to be paid for performing under that contract. The majority apparently recognizes that the Control Office is free to refuse to allow Airways to <em>pay </em>Mayerson, but holds that it cannot forbid entry into the contractual relationship itself. In other words, the Office can bar <em>performance </em>of contracts for legal services, but not <em>creation </em>of such contracts. That is a <em>very </em>fine distinction, and hardly a practical one. It seems elementary that if one has a <em>right </em>to a lawyer it must include a right to pay the lawyer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An employment contract is generally considered to include both services <em>and </em>reasonable compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Mayerson claims to have been hired as Airways\u2019 lawyer. He thus contends he has a contractual relationship with the corporation. He is <em>not </em>representing it on a <em>pro bono </em>basis; he fully intends to be paid his $100 an hour fee for whatever services he renders, and he intends to be paid out of the corporate assets that the Government is trying to preserve for Airways\u2019 creditors. To assert that the Control Office cannot forbid the <em>creation </em>of a contract to provide legal services at $100 an hour, but can forbid its <em>performance, </em>would exalt form over substance. On this point, the concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ring opinion concurs with this opinion that Mayerson cannot be paid by the corporation unless authorized by the Control Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Part III of the majority\u2019s opinion attempts to buttress its case by the use of a straw man: the majority characterizes the Control Office\u2019s position as authorizing it to \u201ctak[e] the corporation over from the inside.\u201d The Government has never made such an argument. It simply claims the authority to regulate Airways\u2019 <em>external </em>relationships, including entry into a contract for legal services not properly authorized by the corporation or the Control Office.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYF\">The majority begins by asserting that [the Control Office] has no authority to seize the corporation itself, to vest its assets, or \u2014 beyond the power it has over employment contracts entered into by [Airways] \u2014 to rearrange its internal affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Maj. at 874. The Office, however, has made no attempt to \u201cseize the corporation,\u201d or \u201cvest its assets,\u201d or \u201crearrange its internal affairs.\u201d It has done only two things: (1) prohibit the president from acting for the corporation (which the majority acknowledges that it may do), and (2) prohibit the creation of an employment contract without a license from the Control Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The majority goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-9\">But [the Control Office] may not, to give an extreme example, take a member of its own staff and, without regard to [Airways\u2019] corporate structure, install that person as [Airways\u2019] new chief executive officer, thereby controlling [Airways\u2019] operations from the inside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Maj. at 875. The Control Office has not, of course, done this. Should it attempt improperly to do this at some time in the future, it can properly be reprimanded. Since it has not, the majority is just building straw men.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">Finally, the majority suggests that the Control Office has failed to show \u201chow taking the corporation over from the inside ... furthers the balancing of interests embodied in the congressional external control scheme.\u201d Maj. at 875. The Office\u2019s failure to make that showing may be due to the fact that it has never attempted to take over the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">All of this miscast argument leads up to part IV of the opinion, in which the Control Office\u2019s understandable reluctance to license the creation of an open contract obligating Airways to pay $100 an hour in legal fees is somehow found to be unworthy of the officers of our great Government. On the contrary, what evidence appears in this generally inadequate record supports an inference that the Control Office has acted in an intelligent, competent manner, and apparently within the scope of statutory and constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">In sum, the majority\u2019s attempt to draw a line between <em>creation </em>and <em>performance </em>of contracts is unconvincing; its misapplication of the right to counsel concept overlooks the fact that the real question is whether counsel under the corporate articles and bylaws and the laws of Florida was properly authorized to bring this lawsuit; and its refusal to recognize the broad foreign affairs authority of the Executive when acting pursuant to additional authority from the Congress usurps the constitutional power vested in the President and the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">Most importantly, however, it is entirely possible that there is no case or controversy, and the district court should be permitted to address that issue on remand. For that reason, I agree with the remand to the district court. As to the legal issues purportedly resolved in the majority and concurring opinions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\">.

A substantial question exists whether the shareholders\u2019 meeting in the Bahamas comported with Florida law. Florida requires that a \"majority\u201d of the outstanding shares constitutes a quorum for conducting business, unless otherwise provided in the bylaws. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 607.-094. There is no evidence in the record as to how much of Airways stock each co-owner had. The May 27, 1983, meeting was conducted nine months after Fuentes was barred from acting for the corporation by the Control Office on September 17, 1982. The question is whether Fuentes, who had been disqualified from acting for Airways, could nevertheless thereafter exert control through a shareholders' meeting. If not, it is entirely possible that there was not a valid quorum present at the secret meeting. Such a fact-based question is obviously one that is initially for the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b967-6\">. The majority repeatedly implies that the Control Office somehow failed to follow Florida law when it decided that Airways\u2019 <em>vice president </em>was the proper person to deal with when its <em>president </em>was incapacitated. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Control Office erred in recognizing Vice President Masdeu as the legal spokesman for Airways. The majority itself, since it has not consulted Florida law, is not in a position to determine whether Masdeu is or is not the proper individual, yet it is willing to criticize implicitly the Office\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Actually, Florida law provides that \u201c[ajll corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of ... a board of directors,\u201d although the articles of incorporation (which do not appear in this record) may provide otherwise. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 607.111(1). Thus, this court does not know whether the directors or the officers have the power to exercise \"all corporate powers.\u201d The only <em>required </em>officers of a corporation in Florida are (1) the president, (2) the secretary, and (3) the treasurer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 607.-151(1). And the law provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-8\">All officers and agents, as between themselves and the corporation, shall have such authority and perform such duties in the management of the corporation as may be provided in the <em>bylaws </em>or as may be determined by resolution of the board of directors not inconsistent with the bylaws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 607.151(2) (emphasis added). It thus is clear that the question of who can act for Airways is not determined wholly by the Florida statute. What is required, as is usual under corporate law, is an examination of Airways' bylaws and its corporate resolutions. As these bylaws are not conclusive and the other corporate records are not in the record, the majority is in no position to criticize the Control Office\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Similarly, the majority dismisses the Control Office\u2019s argument that Mayerson\u2019s authority lapsed when Fuentes was barred from acting by stating that the Office \"misperceives agency law.\u201d Maj. at 874 n. 17. Despite its insistance on the applicability of Florida law, the majority cites solely to the Restatement (Second) of Agency, as if there was some overriding federal common law of agency. The Restatement rule may or may not coincide with that adopted by the courts of Florida, but Florida law must be examined before summarily dismissing an argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b967-14\">. The majority does cite a Florida decision, <em>Conlee Construction Co. v. Cay Construction Co., </em>221 So.2d 792 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1969), for the uncontroversial principle that \"the president of a corporation has authority to engage the services of counsel on the corporation's behalf.\u201d Maj. at n. 5. But the question is <em>not </em>whether Fuentes could hire Mayerson to advise the corporation, but whether Fuentes himself could authorize the bringing of a particular suit, and whether Fuentes\u2019 very general statement amounted to such authorization. In <em>Conlee, </em>the board of directors deadlocked over whether to give special authorization for a suit; the president, who was a stockholder and authorized in that capacity to sue on behalf of the corporation, instituted suit to benefit the corporation. The court recognized that the Florida statute provides that \u201d[t]he business of every corporation shall be managed and its corporate powers exercised by a board of not less than three directors,\u201d <em>see </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 609.09, but noted that if directors are hopelessly deadlocked, \u201cthe president as chief executive officer of a going concern may even in the face of a deadlock take steps to protect corporate interests where immediate and vital injury threatens.\" 221 So.2d at 796. Under those circumstances, the court held that the suit was authorized. The case asserts that \"in the absence of internal conflict, the president ...\u201d may hire attorneys and institute suits. 221 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>So.2d at 795. But, internal conflict did exist here and the sanctions imposed by law as a result of the determination by the Control Office also satisfy that standard. <em>Conlee </em>did not purport to decide whether in the absence of explicit authorization from the board of directors, an earlier general designation by a corporate officer of a lawyer for no specific corporate purpose permits the lawyer on his own authority to institute lawsuits in the name of the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b968-16\">. The majority states that the case is to be remanded for \"appropriate\u201d relief, but nowhere indicates what that relief might be. The district judge who must attempt to implement the court\u2019s decision has a difficult task.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b969-11\">. <em>See </em>50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 5 for Extension of National Emergency Powers, Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515, and history of extensions from 1978 to 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b970-7\">. The majority attempts to downplay, by using bits of legislative history, the effects of the changes made in the Act in 1941. In fact, Congress granted to the President the power to define the terms used in the Act on December 18, 1941 \u2014 11 days after Pearl Harbor. It is difficult to believe that Congress, with the nation at war on two continents, intended a <em>narrow </em>power to carry out the country\u2019s war aims. As the <em>Alexewicz </em>court recognized, Congress intended the 1941 amendments to the Act to \"confer upon the President or his representative the <em>broadest possible authority </em>over the property of foreign nationals, in order to forestall the possibility that such property might be utilized for purposes hostile to the common defense.\u201d 43 N.Y.S.2d at 720 (emphasis added). So long as such powers do not offend the Constitution, the courts are obligated to give them full scope.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b970-12\">. Would the Court in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254 (1970), for example, have upheld a regulation that permitted a welfare recipient to <em>hire </em>an attorney, but prohibited him from <em>paying </em>one?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b971-11\"><em>. </em>The record here, as yet, does not prove that the authorized officers of the corporation property exercised the \"right to choose and obtain counsel\u201d or properly authorized this lawsuit which so far as appears is a request for authority to bring any lawsuit that the lawyer decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>to bring \u2014 without prior approval of the corporation. The entire analysis of the concurring opinion is misguided, misstates the actual facts and indulges in extreme exaggeration. It is true that any person charged with a crime has a right to counsel, in fact every litigant has a right to counsel; but the continuing authority of counsel appointed by an ousted corporate officer is open to serious question, especially where the directors did not approve the appointment or the instigation of specific litigation, and the corporation has come under the licensing jurisdiction of the Control Office administering the Trading With the Enemy Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
