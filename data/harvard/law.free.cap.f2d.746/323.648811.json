Because we conclude the instant action is not an appropriate one for declaratory judgment, we vacate the District Court\u2019s order and dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">Mr. Ronald S. Wozniak, an employee of Conrail, alleges that on October 30, 1977, while he was working as part of a Consolidated Rail Corporation crew engaged in the delivery of three rail cars to the Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company facility in Hamtramck, Michigan, he was struck by an object protruding from a Grand Trunk locomotive traveling on an adjacent set of tracks. On June 28, 1978, Mr. Wozniak filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, against Conrail and Grand Trunk. Mr. Wozniak\u2019s action against Conrail was based upon its alleged violation of the Federal Employer\u2019s Liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ty Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51, <em>et seq.; </em>his action against Grand Trunk was based upon its alleged common law negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On February 9, 1979, Grand Trunk filed a counterclaim against Conrail for indemnification under a March 21, 1969, interchange agreement. On April 30, 1980, the Honorable Arthur Sullivan, Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, dismissed Grand Trunk\u2019s counterclaim because, \u201capplying Michigan law to the Agreement in question, the Court finds that the Agreement contains highly malleable, ambiguous language which does not clearly set forth the intent of the parties to indemnify for the other\u2019s negligence.\u201d Grand Trunk has not appealed Judge Sullivan\u2019s decision regarding Grand Trunk\u2019s claim for indemnification in the <em>Wozniak </em>case which is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On August 19, 1981, Grand Trunk filed an action against Conrail in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan seeking a declaratory judgment that the agreement in question requires that Conrail defend and indemnify Grand Trunk in the <em>Wozniak </em>case. The District Court granted Conrail\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on December 1, 1982, on the ground that Grand Trunk\u2019s indemnity claim was barred by res judicata or in the alternative by collateral estoppel as a result of Judge Sullivan\u2019s order which, the District Court found, had fully adjudicated the merits of the indemnity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Grand Trunk then moved for rehearing on the ground that Judge Sullivan\u2019s order was not a final judgment under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 304(a), which provides that \u201can appeal may be taken from a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the parties or claims only if the trial court has made an express written finding that there is no just reason for delaying enforcement or appeal____\u201d The District Court denied Grand Trunk\u2019s Motion for Rehearing because \u201c[a]n order adjudicating fewer than all the claims of the parties may be final for purposes of res judicata and collateral estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Title 28 of the United States Code, \u00a7 2201 provides that in \u201ca case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction\u201d a federal court \u201cmay\u201d give a declaratory judgment, a power permissive, not mandatory. Although it is well settled that the granting of a declaratory judgment rests in the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the court, <em>see </em>C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2759 at 645 (1983), the standard of review of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion to grant or refuse declaratory relief is not so clear. <em>See American States Ins. Co. v. D\u2019Atri, </em>375 F.2d 761, 763 (6th Cir.1967) (reversing dismissal of declaratory judgment simply as \u201cjudicially indiscreet\u201d). Compare <em>Broadview Chemical Corp. v. Loctite Corp., </em>417 F.2d 998 (2d Cir.1969); <em>National Health Federation v. Weinberger, </em>518 F.2d 711 (7th Cir.1975); <em>Alsager v. District Court of Polk County, Iowa, </em>518 F.2d 1160 (8th Cir.1975); <em>PPG Industries, Inc. v. Continental Oil Co., </em>478 F.2d 674 (5th Cir.1973); and <em>President v. Vance, </em>627 F.2d 353, 364 n. 76 (D.C.Cir.1980), all of which take the position of the <em>Vance </em>case that in reviewing declaratory judgments the \u201cusual practice ... is for the appellate court to substitute its own judgment for that of trial court,\u201d with <em>Globe Indemnity Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>369 F.2d 102 (3rd Cir.1966) and <em>Delno v. Market St. Ry. Co., </em>124 F.2d 965, 967 (9th Cir.1942) (appellate court must find \u201cno reasonable man would take the view adopted by the trial court\u201d). Professor Moore and Judge Friendly agree with the majority view that the discretion in the trial court should not be \u201creview limiting,\u201d <em>see </em>6A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice II 57.08[2] at 57-37 (1983); Friendly, <em>Indiscretion About Discretion, </em>31 Emory L.J. 747, 778-779 (1982) (\u201cthe statements about the special discretion of the trial court on this subject are bosh\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">We believe that the standard of review applicable to the District Court\u2019s discretion exercised under the Declaratory Judgment Act should not be as narrow as the <em>Globe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u2022 and <em>Delno </em>cases suggest. We must be able to ensure that the District Court exercises its discretion to grant declaratory relief when the need for uniformity or an other overriding policy consideration suggests the need for settlement or clarification of the legal issues presented. But we should not be required to decide legal issues and give advisory relief unnecessarily. <em>See Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>372 F.2d 435, 438 (7th Cir.1967). Thus if we disagree with the District Court\u2019s reasons for rendering a declaratory judgment, as we do in this case, we should decline to advise the parties as to the law and refuse to decide the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We apply the following general principles in determining whether a declaratory ruling is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">The two principal criteria guiding the policy in favor of rendering declaratory judgments are (1) when the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue, and (2) when it will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding. It follows that when neither of these results can be accomplished, the court should decline to render the declaration prayed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">E. Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 299 (2d ed. 1941), cited with approval in <em>Broadview Chemical Corp. v. Loctite Corp., supra, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Michigan Consol. Gas Co., </em>177 F.2d 942, 944 (6th Cir. 1949); <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Boyle Constr. Co., </em>123 F.2d 558, 565 (4th Cir.1941). <em>See also </em>Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>supra, </em>at 647 n. 5. We thus consider the following factors: (1) whether the declaratory action would settle the controversy; (2) whether the declaratory action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations in issue; (3) whether the declaratory remedy is being used merely for the purpose of \u201cprocedural fencing\u201d or \u201cto provide an arena for a race for res judicata;\u201d (4) whether the use of a declaratory action would increase friction between our federal and state courts and improperly encroach upon state jurisdiction; and (5) whether there is an alternative remedy which is better or more effective. <em>See generally </em>Moore, <em>supra, </em>II 57.08[2]~[7]. <em>See also </em>Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2759. Applying each of these factors to the instant case, we conclude the District Court erred in granting declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The instant action does not involve an independent dispute because it arises from and affects a pending Illinois lawsuit. It would not clear up the legal issues in that case. Plaintiff Grand Trunk simply seeks to obtain in this lawsuit a judgment that overturns Judge Sullivan\u2019s earlier order regarding Grand Trunk\u2019s indemnity claim. The case would continue in the Illinois court, and the effect of our ruling on that proceeding is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Courts have discouraged \u201cthe use of the declaratory action as a method of procedural fencing, or as a means to provide another arena for a race for res judicata.\u201d Moore, <em>supra, </em>H 57.08[5] at 57-50. That is precisely what plaintiff seeks in this action. In <em>Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., </em>316 U.S. 491, 495, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 1175, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942), the Supreme Court directed that we prevent the \u201cgratuitous interference with the orderly and comprehensive disposition of a state court litigation.\u201d Grand Trunk\u2019s request for declaratory relief is an attempt to have the federal courts do what the state court has already refused to do. As such, Grand Trunk\u2019s request for declaratory relief is not only an impermissible attempt to race with Conrail to obtain a favorable final judgment, but also will create unnecessary friction between federal and state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Courts deny declaratory relief if an alternative remedy is better or more effective. <em>See, e.g., City of Highland Park v. Train, </em>519 F.2d 681 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 927, 96 S.Ct. 1141, 47 L.Ed.2d 337 (1975); <em>Norvell v. Sangre de Cristo Dev. Co., </em>519 F.2d 370 (10th Cir.1975); <em>Cartier v. Secretary of State, </em>506 F.2d 191 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 947, 95 S.Ct. 1677, 44 L.Ed.2d 101 (1974). If Judge Sulli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>van erred in his indemnity ruling, Grand Trunk can appeal his ruling. Grand Trunk has never attempted to have Judge Sullivan certify the question of indemnification to an Illinois appellate court under Supreme Court Rule 304, the normal avenue of interlocutory review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we conclude that the District Court erred in giving a declaratory judgment in the instant case. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
