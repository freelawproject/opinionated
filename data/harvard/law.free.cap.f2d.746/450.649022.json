We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The theory of the complaint is that the plaintiff was mentally ill at the time of her expulsion, and that canon law prohibits expulsion in this situation. Plaintiff\u2019s case was considered by the highest church court of competent jurisdiction before her expulsion took place, and that court found that she was not mentally ill. Whatever the merits of that finding as a matter of fact, it is not within our province to review it. A claim of violation of the law of a hierarchical church, once rejected by the church\u2019s judicial authorities, is not subject to revision in the secular courts. See, <em>e.g., Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, </em>426 U.S. 696, 712, 96 S.Ct, 2372, 2381, 49 L.Ed.2d 151 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">We are in substantial agreement with the District Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. See 8th Cir.R. 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\">. The Hon. Edward J.
