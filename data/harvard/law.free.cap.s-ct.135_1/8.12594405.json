The sentencing judge, however, found that they\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   engaged in the charged conspiracy and, relying largely on that finding, imposed sentences that petitioners say were many times longer than those the Guidelines would otherwise have recommended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioners present a strong case that, but for the judge's finding of fact, their sentences would have been \"substantively unreasonable\" and therefore illegal.

It unavoidably follows that any fact necessary to prevent a sentence from being substantively unreasonable-thereby exposing the defendant to the longer sentence-is an element that must be either admitted by the defendant or found by the jury. It\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   be found by a judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For years, however, we have refrained from saying so.

The present petition presents the nonhypothetical case the Court claimed to have been waiting for. And it is a particularly appealing case, because not only did no jury convict these defendants of the offense the sentencing judge thought them guilty of, but a jury\n   <em>\n    acquitted\n   </em>\n   them of that offense. Petitioners were convicted of distributing drugs, but acquitted of conspiring to distribute drugs. The sentencing judge found that petitioners had engaged in the conspiracy of which the jury acquitted them. The Guidelines, petitioners claim, recommend sentences of between 27 and 71 months for their distribution convictions. But in light of the conspiracy finding, the court calculated much higher Guidelines ranges, and sentenced Jones, Thurston, and Ball to 180, 194, and 225 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On petitioners' appeal, the D.C. Circuit held that\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   their sentences would have been substantively unreasonable but for judge-found facts, their Sixth Amendment rights were not violated.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324155,4118791\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/1362/\">\n    744 F.3d 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1369 (2014).
