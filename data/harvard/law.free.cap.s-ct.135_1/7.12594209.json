Should the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this order shall terminate automatically. In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the order shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   Justice ALITO, with whom Justice SCALIAand Justice THOMASjoin, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   There is a colorable basis for the Court's decision due to the proximity of the upcoming general election. It is particularly troubling that absentee ballots have been sent out without any notation that proof of photo identification must be submitted. But this Court \"may not vacate a stay entered by a court of appeals unless that court clearly and 'demonstrably' erred in its application of 'accepted standards.' \"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex.
