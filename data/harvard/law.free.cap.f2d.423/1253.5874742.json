Appellant Hughes opposes the motion and alleges that said agreement is null, void and of no legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-13\">The private agreement is not a part of the Patent Office record on appeal before this court. Since the validity of the agreement has been questioned by Hughes, and since neither party asserts that this court is the proper forum to determine the validity of said agreement, the court will not consider said agreement until such time as the validity thereof has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-14\">Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
