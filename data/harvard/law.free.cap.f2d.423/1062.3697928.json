Therefore, the conviction can be reversed on grounds of insufficiency of the evidence only if the conviction results in a manifest miscarriage of justice. Fitzpatrick v. United States, 410 F.2d 513 (5th Cir. 1969). There was no such manifest miscarriage in this case. Had a motion been made the evidence was sufficient for the case to be submitted to the jury on the theory that appellant was in joint or constructive possession of the large box of stolen goods although his friend and codefendant, who was walking beside him, was carrying the box unassisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-19\">During examination by the government of a store detective, the witness, in the process of explaining an answer, volunteered the information that he had been carrying in his pocket for six months a \u201cphotograph or mug shot\u201d of appellant. The prosecutor had not sought to elicit such a response. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial and forthwith, and clearly and firmly, instructed the jury that appellant was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>trial only for the matter charged in the information and that they should disregard the answer and give it no consideration. The denial of the motion was not reversible error. <em>Cf., </em>Castillo v. United States, 409 F.2d 762 (5th Cir. 1969), in which photographs were described by a government witness as pictures of \u201cknown users\u201d of narcotics, and as \u201cmug shots,\u201d and defense objections thereto were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1127-11\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 409 F.2d 804, (5th Cir. 1969), and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 417 F.2d 526 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
