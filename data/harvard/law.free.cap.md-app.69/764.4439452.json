Three months later, appellant was charged in a five-count criminal information with four counts of arson under Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, and 8, and one count of willfully setting a fire with intent to defraud an insurance company (art. 27, \u00a7 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The State eventually nol prossed three of the arson counts. After a non-jury trial in February, 1982, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County convicted appellant of the remaining count of arson\u2014maliciously setting fire to his own dwelling house\u2014but acquitted him of the insurance fraud. Four years later, it sentenced him to five years in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, this appeal, in which appellant argues that the trial court erred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">(1) \u201cin permitting a witness to testify as an expert where the State failed to disclose in discovery that the witness would testify as an expert.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">(2) \u201cin admitting evidence of Appellant\u2019s financial circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>(3) \u201cin admitting evidence of alleged statements made by Appellant during the course of a telephone conversation in the absence of a foundation establishing that Appellant was the person who made the statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">(4) \u201cin its admission of documentary evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">We find no reversible error in any of those respects, and so shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">(1) <em>The Unrevealed Expert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Appellant\u2019s first complaint concerns the testimony of County Fire Department Captain Jerry Zwick. Captain Zwick, one of the first firefighters to arrive at the scene, testified without objection to what he observed, including that the back bedroom had sustained substantial damage. The objection came when he began to describe the concept of \u201cflashover,\u201d which he defined as \u201cthe point in time where all of the combustibles within a room reach their ignition point\u201d and \u201cspontaneously burst into flames.\u201d When the prosecutor asked whether that flashover had been reached when the \u201cnozzle crew\u201d arrived, appellant objected on the ground that \u201c[s]o far I\u2019ve heard the only person to be an expert in this case is the Inspector Ruley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The State then proceeded to interrupt the examination and qualify Captain Zwick as an expert. At the conclusion of that voir dire, the court afforded appellant an opportunity to cross-examine on Zwick\u2019s qualifications, whereupon counsel said that he had no cross-examination\u2014that \u201c[t]he concern I have is now we have another individual now testifying as an expert on behalf of the State with no prior notice that this individual would be testifying as an expert and rendering an expert opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The objection was overruled and Captain Zwick was permitted to testify as an expert. He stated that the fire started right below the bedroom window and that he could not find anything in that area to indicate that it had started accidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Appellant\u2019s sole complaint here is that the State failed to disclose Captain Zwick as an expert witness, a failure that he deems violative of Md. Rule 4-263. We see no violation and no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Md. Rule 4-263(b)(l) requires the State, upon request, to disclose the name and address of \u201ceach person then known whom the State intends to call as a witness at the hearing or trial to prove its case in chief or to rebut alibi testimony.\u201d Section (b)(4) of the Rule requires the State, upon request, to \u201c[p]roduce and permit the defendant to inspect and copy all written reports or statements made in connection with the action by each expert consulted by the State ... and furnish the defendant with the substance of any such oral report and conclusion____\u201d Nothing in these sections (or any other sections) of the Rule requires the State to categorize its proposed witnesses as expert or non-expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Captain Zwick was listed as a witness on the Criminal Information. In June, 1981, appellant requested the information allowed under Rule 4-263(b)(l) and (4), to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201c2. Disclose the name and address of each person whom the State intends to call as a witness at a hearing or trial to prove its case in chief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-11\">\u201c8. Produce and permit the Defendant to inspect and copy all written reports or statements made in connection with the Defendant\u2019s case by each expert consulted by the State____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">In response to those requests, the State disclosed the witnesses it intended at that time to call, which included Fire Investigator John Ruley, but not Captain Zwick. It also informed appellant that, upon reasonable notice, he or his counsel could \u201cinspect and copy all written reports or statements made in connection with this case by each expert consulted by the State.\u201d Captain Zwick had indeed made a written Fire Incident Report. Whether appellant or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>attorney actually saw the report before trial is not clear. On November 30, 1981\u2014nearly three months before trial, the State supplemented its answer to appellant\u2019s discovery request and informed him of its intention to call Captain Zwick as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">It is clear, then, that the State fully complied with the Rule and with appellant\u2019s actual request. It was obliged to do no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">(2) <em>Appellant\u2019s Financial Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Appellant complains here of two inquiries by the State into his financial circumstances, inquiries that he contends are proscribed by <em>Vitek v. State, </em>295 Md. 35, 453 A.2d 514 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The first inquiry came during the examination of Irene Taylor, the resident manager of the apartment complex where appellant had lived and where the fire occurred. Ms. Taylor had brought with her the business records of the landlord pertaining to appellant\u2019s tenancy, which she said were kept in the ordinary course of business. The initial part of the examination revealed that appellant\u2019s lease expired on the day of the fire and that he had not sought to renew it. The file also contained appellant\u2019s payment record, and over objection Ms. Taylor was permitted to testify that \u201cat times he was lenient; he was late with his payments.\u201d The State also introduced, over objection, exhibits showing that on five occasions\u2014in June, August, and December of 1980 and in February and March of 1981\u2014the landlord had sought repossession of the apartment because one month\u2019s rent was late.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The second inquiry involved essentially a single question to appellant on cross-examination. Without objection, appellant admitted that he had owned a business known as Dundalk Supply and that it had gone \u201cout of business\u201d in 1979 or 1980. The objection came when the prosecutor asked why it went out of business, the answer being \u201c[i]t was not making money.\u201d Appellant denied that the business went bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>In <em>Vitek, </em>the defendant was charged with robbery. At issue was whether it was proper for the State, through cross-examination, to show that he had just been released from jail on the day of the robbery, that he had no job, ahd that he had little or no money. The Court held that such evidence \u201cwas irrelevant to the main issue of guilt or innocence and could not be used to infer motive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>40, 453 A.2d 514. In reaching that conclusion, the Court quoted from a Michigan case and thus adopted the notion that it would not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201c \u2018assume that wealth exerts a greater attraction on the poor than on the rich.\u2019 To do so would \u2018effectively establish a two-tiered standard of justice and demolish <em>pro tanto </em>the presumption of innocence.\u2019 Our system of justice and its constitutional guarantees are simply too fragile to permit this type of unfounded character assassination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\"><em>Id., </em>41, 453 A.2d 514. <em>See also United States v. Mullings, </em>364 F.2d 173 (2d Cir.1966), also cited by the Court [295 Md.], at 45-46, 453 A.2d 514; for the same proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Having adopted that view\u2014that as a general rule it is inappropriate to use the defendant\u2019s poverty to establish a criminal motive\u2014the Court hastened to point out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u201cThis is not to say that evidence of an accused\u2019s financial situation is never admissible. However, we agree with the appellant that in order for such evidence to be admissible, there must be something more than a \u2018general suspicion\u2019 that because a person is poor, he is going to commit a crime. We hold that while normally it is not allowable to show impecuniousness of an accused, such evidence would be admissible under special circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-9\"><em>Vitek, supra, </em>295 Md. at 41, 453 A.2d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The Court did not undertake to define what \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d would have to exist in order to make evidence of impecuniousness or financial distress admissible. We must keep in mind, of course, the evidence at issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Vitek\u2014that the defendant had recently been released from jail and was unemployed. The Court\u2019s concluding sentence and actual holding made specific reference to that: \u201cthe inference of motive because Vitek was unemployed and had just recently been released from jail is \u2018too speculative\u2019 and \u2018too remote\u2019____\u201d <em>Id,., </em>46, 453 A.2d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The Court\u2019s view in this regard follows that of Dean Wigmore, who noted that the practical result of using a defendant\u2019s lack of money to show motive \u201cwould be to put a poor person under so much unfair suspicion and at such a relative disadvantage that for reasons of fairness this argument has seldom been countenanced <em>as evidence of the graver crimes, particularly those of violence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 2 <em>Wigmore On Evidence </em>\u00a7 392(2)(a) (1979). Wig-more goes on to state, however, with considerable case law support, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">\u201cin cases of merely peculative crime (such as larceny or embezzlement) and in civil cases where the issue is whether the defendant <em>borrowed money </em>or not, the fact that he was in need of it at the time is decidedly relevant to show a probable desire to obtain it and therefore a probable borrowing or purloining; and there is here not the same objection from the standpoint of possible unfair prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-8\"><em>Id., </em>\u00a7 392(2)(a) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">It is not clear that the <em>Vitek </em>Court intended to make so broad a distinction, although it is interesting to note that two of the three cases relied on by the Court <em>(People v. Andrews, </em>88 Mich.App. 115, 276 N.W.2d 867 (1979), and <em>State v. Stewart, </em>162 N.J.Super. 96, 392 A.2d 234 (App.Div.1978)) involved violent crimes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether or not a distinction can be drawn between \u201cpeculative\u201d or \u201cnon-peculative\u201d crimes, in general, the law seems clear and uniform that, where the charge is arson, and especially where it is arson with intent to defraud an insurance company, evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the defendant\u2019s impecunious condition or need for money is admissible to show motive. <em>See Com. v. Niziolek, </em>380 Mass. 513, 404 N.E.2d 643 (1980); <em>Com. v. Jacobson, </em>19 Mass.App.Ct. 666, 477 N.E.2d 158 (1985); <em>State v. Murdock, </em>160 Mont. 95, 500 P.2d 387 (1972); <em>People v. Calvaresi, </em>198 Colo. 321, 600 P.2d 57 (1979); <em>People v. Ray, </em>640 P.2d 262 (Colo.Ct.App.1981); <em>People v. Martin, </em>59 Ill.App.3d 785, 17 Ill.Dec. 172, 376 N.E.2d 65 (1978); <em>State v. Whisler, </em>231 Iowa 1216, 3 N.W.2d 525 (1942); <em>State v. Caliendo, </em>136 Me. 169, 4 A.2d 837 (1939); <em>State v. Lytle, </em>214 Minn. 171, 7 N.W.2d 305 (1943). The reason often expressed for this rule is that motive in these cases, where the defendant\u2019s own property is damaged or destroyed, is an important element for the State to prove, that direct proof of motive is nearly impossible, and that some latitude must be allowed in order to prove it circumstantially. We think that qualifies as a \u201cspecial circumstance,\u201d and that the evidence adduced was not prohibited by <em>Vitek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">(3) <em>The Telephone Calls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Appellant\u2019s third complaint concerns the testimony of Joseph Costy, a claims adjustor for St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Mr. Costy stated that his company had issued a policy insuring the contents of appellant\u2019s apartment, that appellant had reported a loss to the company\u2019s agent, Eric Anderson and Son, and that the agent had forwarded a loss notice to him. It was when he was asked about a telephone call from appellant on March 3,1981, that appellant objected \u201cunless he has personal knowledge of the accused\u2019s voice and can testify to prior experience that he knew it was the Defendant.\u201d The objection was overruled, and Mr. Costy proceeded to describe the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The next day, he said, appellant called back. Again over objection, Costy said that appellant had been in touch with the company\u2019s outside adjustor and that the adjustor had authorized a $1,500 advance. Costy contacted the adjustor, and, as a result of that conversation (which he did not describe), he decided not to make the advance. Appellant then came to Mr. Costy\u2019s office, apparently in the belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>that the advance had been approved, and Costy told him then that no advance would be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Appellant denied ever having a telephone conversation with Mr. Costy and complains here, as he did below, that Costy should not have been permitted to testify about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Appellant correctly posits that \u201cin order to render testimony of a telephone conversation admissible, some preliminary testimony, either direct or circumstantial, must be presented to establish the identity of the other person to the conversation.\u201d <em>Basoff v. State, </em>208 Md. 643, 649, 119 A.2d 917 (1956). <em>See also Archer v. State, </em>145 Md. 128, 149, 125 A. 744 (1924); <em>White v. State, </em>204 Md. 442, 446-47, 104 A.2d 810 (1954). As the <em>White </em>Court pointed out, the reason for the rule is that \u201cif a party could be held responsible for statements made by a person who has not been identified, the door would be open for fraud and imposition.\u201d 204 Md. at 446-47, 104 A.2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">This Court has previously addressed the question of the admissibility of telephone conversations in <em>Ford v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 654, 276 A.2d 423 (1971), and <em>Mutyambizi v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 55, 363 A.2d 511 (1976), <em>cert. denied </em>279 Md. 684, -85 (1977). In both cases, we relied on authority stated in 7 <em>Wigmore On Evidence </em>\u00a7 2155. Wigmore makes clear that this issue is fundamentally one of authentication. Such authentication can be found either from evidence that the witness was familiar with and recognized the voice of the alleged caller, or, in the absence of such recognition, \u201csundry circumstances (including other admissions and the like) may suffice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 2155(1) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Among the \u201csundry circumstances\u201d sufficient to render the telephone conversation admissible are (1) where the call is in response to a message left for the caller, where the caller responded in a timely fashion and asked by name for the person who had left the message, <em>People v. Lynes, </em>49 N.Y.2d 286, 425 N.Y.S.2d 295, 298, 401 N.E.2d 405, 408 (1980), (2) where the conversation revealed that the caller had knowledge of facts that only he would be likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>know, <em>Earnhart v. State, </em>582 S.W.2d 444, 448-49 (Tex.Crim.App.1979), and (3) where the caller showed a familiarity with details that the person in question would be likely to know and was reached at the telephone number and address shown for the person in the telephone directory, <em>Holzhauer v. Sheeny, </em>127 Ky. 28, 104 S.W. 1034 (1907). <em>See also State v. Hamilton, </em>185 Mont. 522, 605 P.2d 1121, <em>cert. denied </em>447 U.S. 924, 100 S.Ct. 3017, 65 L.Ed.2d 1117 (1980); <em>International Harvester Co. of America v. Caldwell, </em>198 N.C. 751, 153 S.E. 325 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In the instant case, it is true that, at the time of the conversations, Mr. Costy did not know appellant and could not, therefore, attest to his identity. But a course of action was agreed upon between Costy and the caller, and appellant later appeared personally in Costy\u2019s office for the purpose of concluding that course of action. Costy identified appellant in court; he had an opportunity to hear his voice at the face-to-face meeting, and thus to match the voice with his visual observation. By the time of his testimony in court, it was clear that he knew who his caller was on both occasions. Appellant\u2019s identity was indeed established.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">(4) <em>Documents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Finally, appellant complains that a number of documents admitted into evidence constituted hearsay and should not have been admitted. He refers specifically to copies of letters sent to him by the landlord, the landlord\u2019s record of his rent payments, and documents prepared by or for the adjustor employed by the insurer. We are not convinced that these documents even constituted hearsay evidence, given the authenticating testimony and the purpose for which they were offered; but, in any event, there was an ample showing that they were made and kept in the ordinary course of their author\u2019s business and were thus admissible as business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-13\">. It appears that appellant eloped while on bail, leaving with his brother what purports to be a suicide note. The hiatus between conviction and sentencing is not an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-10\"><em>. </em>The third <em>(United States v. Mailings, supra, </em>364 F.2d 173), involved a breaking onto the victim\u2019s property and an attempted theft of goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
