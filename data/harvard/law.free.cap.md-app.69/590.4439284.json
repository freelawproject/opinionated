The ordinance is alleged to violate the First Amendment\u2019s mandate that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press----\u201d Inasmuch as that amendment has been made applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is now before us. <em>Edward v. South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 83 S.Ct. 680, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963); <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. 50, 52, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2443, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The Commissioners of the Town of Perryville enacted an amendment to the town\u2019s zoning ordinance to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5T\"><em>\u201cAdult Bookstore/Adult Entertainment Center </em>shall be restricted to C-2 zone only, provided that no such use may be permitted within 1,800 feet of the boundary of the property upon which sets any church, school, hospital, or other similar institution for human care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Those two enterprises are permitted in C-2 zones if the applicant satisfies the town\u2019s Board of Appeals with respect to thirteen hereinafter listed criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">5297 Pulaski Highway, Inc., operates Treasure Lingerie and Gift Shop, a retail store selling women\u2019s lingerie and associated items. The shop, we are informed, is divided into two sections. In the forward part lingerie is displayed and sold. The back portion contains an assortment of \u201cadult\u201d books and magazines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Kay Smith <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in July 1984 made application on behalf of 5297 corporation for a zoning occupancy permit to operate a \u201clingerie shop.\u201d That application was filed approximately four months after the adoption of the ordinance involved in this appeal. No mention of an \u201cadult bookstore\u201d appears anywhere in the application for the \u201clingerie shop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The Town of Perryville filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Cecil County in which the town sought an injunction against the selling at 5297 Pulaski Highway of anything \u201cother than woman\u2019s [sic] lingerie and associated woman\u2019s [sic] clothing.\u201d Among the defenses asserted by 5297 were that \u201c[ordinance 84-1 of the Town of Perryville is on its face ... [violative] of ... the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The chancellor thought and held otherwise. The trial court further determined that the books and magazines were obscene. As a result of the circuit court\u2019s findings and holdings, the 5297 corporation was \u201cenjoined from selling any items which are the subject of this suit other than women\u2019s lingerie ... unless or until ... a conditional use permit [is obtained]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In this Court 5297 asserts that the trial court erred in not holding the Perryville ordinance unconstitutional and in finding that the books and magazines were obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\n<em>Facial Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The circuit court held that Perryville Ordinance 84-1 was constitutional inasmuch as the Commissioners of the Town of Perryville articulated a reasoned and significant basis for the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We have not been directed to, nor have we found, any Maryland appellate decision addressing a challenge to a zoning ordinance on the ground that it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court and other federal court decisions provide us, however, with a plethora of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The most recent Supreme Court decision interpreting First Amendment mandates with respect to zoning ordinances is <em>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986). <em>Renton </em>was concerned with theatre owners who intended to exhibit adult films in violation of an ordinance which proscribed the location of adult motion picture theatres within 1,000 feet of any residential zone, single- or multiple-family dwelling, church, park, or school. Playtime Theatres, the owner of two adult motion picture establishments, sought an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance. Additionally, Playtime prayed that the Federal District Court declare the ordinance violative of the theatre\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court upheld the ordinance as a valid governmental response to the serious problems created by adult theatres. In so holding, the Court relied substantially on its earlier decision in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Justice (now Chief Justice) Rehnquist, writing for the majority, stated in <em>Renton </em>that because the ordinance did not altogether ban adult theatres it was a valid \u201ctime, place and manner regulation,\u201d rather than a restriction on the content of speech. Speaking through Justice Rehnquist, the Court said, \u201c[Cjontent-neutral time, place and manner regulations are acceptable so long as they are designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>serve a substantial government interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.\u201d 106 S.Ct. 925 at 928. The Renton City Council\u2019s predominate concerns, the Court opined, were the secondary effects of adult theatres on the surrounding community, rather than the content of the films. The Court declared the ordinance a valid content-neutral time, place and manner regulation of protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Similarly in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>the Court turned back a challenge to an ordinance that prohibited placing an adult movie theatre within 1,000 feet of any other two regulated uses including adult entertainment centers, liquor stores, and hotels. Speaking through Justice Stevens, the Court held that Detroit\u2019s efforts to avoid a concentration of adult-oriented theatres in a specified area, so as to prevent urban blight and crime, was a legitimate state interest. The ordinance in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>like that in <em>Renton, </em>did not completely eliminate dissemination of sexually explicit materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The concern of the Perryville Town Commissioners, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>is in the secondary effects that unregulated adult bookstores would have on the community, not the suppressing of speech embodied in the inventory of adult bookstores.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The ordinance here under attack declares that it seeks to protect and \u201cpromote the public health, safety, welfare, morals, order, comfort, convenience, appearance, prosperity or general welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The record contains minutes from community meetings during which the townspeople voiced their concern with problems that unregulated bookstores would create relative to safety, adequacy of public facilities, traffic, and the diminution of property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We think the record supports Perryville\u2019s assertion that Ordinance 84-1 was designed to serve a substantial government interest. \u201c[A town\u2019s] interest in attempting to preserve the quality of urban life is one that must be accorded</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>high respect.\u201d <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. at 71, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The majority of the Court in <em>City of Renton, supra, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaX\">\u201cThe First Amendment does not require a city, <em>before enacting such an ordinance </em>[as that of Perryville] to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities, so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfB\">106 S.Ct. 925 at 931 (emphasis added). The <em>Renton </em>Court concluded that the city had not used \u201cthe power to zone as a pretext for suppressing expression\u201d and that, instead, the city had sought to make some areas available for adult theatres and their patrons, while at the same time preserving the quality of life in the community at large by preventing those theatres from locating in other areas. <em>Id. </em>at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The record does not reflect that Perryville enacted Ordinance 84-1 as a pretext to suppression of protected expression. Rather in the interest of preserving the general welfare of the community, the town established a procedure whereby adult bookstores are permitted as conditional uses in certain areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Cities are free to regulate adult theatres and bookstores by either dispersing them or concentrating them in a particular area. <em>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>106 S.Ct. 925 at 931. The town \u201cmust be allowed a reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems.\u201d 106 S.Ct. 925, citing <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 71, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The record before us in the instant case indicates clearly that Perryville Ordinance 84-1 was enacted \u201cin response to the ... growth in the number of ... establishments\u201d selling adult books and magazines. The ordinance does not, as we have said, ban adult book stores. It confines their operation to certain proscribed zones and, to avoid a proliferation of those establishments with a resulting possible deleteri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ous effect on the area, mandates they be a conditional use, i.e., one for which permission to operate may only be conferred if specified criteria are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Perryville Ordinance No. 84-1 is facially predicated upon a fundamental governmental interest in protecting the general welfare of the community. Adult bookstores are regulated, not proscribed. The ordinance was not directed toward the suppression of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\n<em>Overbreadth and Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The Perryville Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 7A, \u201cConditional Uses,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cNo conditional use shall be authorized unless the Board finds in each specific case that the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use from the evidence produced at the public hearing meets the standards set forth in this section. The applicant for a conditional use shall have the burden of proof, which shall include the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion on all questions of fact which are to be determined by the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">As a further guide to the Board\u2019s decision upon the facts of each case, they shall give consideration to the follow ing, where appropriate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">1. The nature of the proposed site, including its size and shape and the proposed size, shape, and arrangement of structures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">2. Traffic conditions including the resulting traffic patterns</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">3. The nature of the surrounding area and the extent to which the proposed use might impair its present and future development</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-13\">4. The proximity of dwellings, churches, schools, public structures, and other places of public gatherings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\">5. The probable effect of the proposed use upon the peaceful enjoyment of people in their homes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>6.

The preservation of cultural and historic landmarks and trees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">9. The probable effect of noise, vibration, smoke and particulate matter, toxic matter, odorous matter, fire and explosion hazards, or glare upon the uses of surrounding properties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">10. The purpose and intent of this Ordinance as set forth in its other sections</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">11. The most appropriate use of land and structure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">12. The conservation of property values</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">13. The contribution, if any, such proposed use, building or addition would make toward the deterioration of areas and neighborhoods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">The trial court, relying in part on <em>15192 Thirteen Mile Road v. City of Warren, </em>593 F.Supp. 147 (1984),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> held that the Perryville ordinance did not confer unbridled discretion upon the Board of Zoning Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\"><em>15192 Thirteen Mile Road v. City of Warren </em>was a case somewhat similar to that before us. There, a federal district court upheld a City of Warren zoning ordinance as generally constitutional but struck a section of the ordinance which required that adult bookstores apply for a conditional use permit. The application procedures, the district court said, left an improper degree of discretion in the local officials. The court reasoned that the lack of time limits in which the City Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning Appeals had to make a decision, together with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>indefinite general standards guiding the Commission and the Board, made the ordinance too broad. The lack of definitions raised the possibility that local officials could effectively prohibit any adult entertainment facility by simply holding the case <em>sub curia </em>indefinitely. In short, the Commission or Board of Appeals could thwart the process by not deciding the matter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">\u201cFor there to be an effective permit requirement, a municipality must provide narrowly drawn, objective, reasonable, and definite standards to guide the administering officials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">593 F.Supp. at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The Perryville ordinance does provide the definite objective guidelines which the zoning officials must apply when determining whether to grant the conditional use.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The ordinance requires that the Board of Appeals \u201cshall decide the appeal within fifteen (15) days from the time of hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the ordinance articulates thirteen criteria as guidelines for the board. Section 10(2) of the Perryville zoning ordinance establishes further guidelines with respect to procedural protections such as notice and a right to be heard on the issue of conditional use. We think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the guidelines in the Perryville ordinance are sufficient in number and definitiveness to overcome the district court\u2019s concern in <em>15192 Thirteen Mile Road</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In \u00a7 19B of the Perryville zoning ordinance, \u201cAdult Bookstore/Adult Entertainment Center\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201cAn establishment, the principal use of which is to offer for sale or viewing books, magazines, printed material, films, tapes, peep shows and live acts which depict, describe or relate to \u2018Specified Sexual Activities\u2019 or \u201cSpecified Anatomical Areas\u201d (as defined below) or an establishment with a segment or section devoted to the sale or display of such material.\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">According to the ordinance \u201cSpecified Sexual Activities\u201d are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201c(1) Human Genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">(2) Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse or sodomy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">(3) Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breast.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">\u201cSpecified Anatomical Areas\u201d mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">\u201c(1) Less than completely and opaquely covered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">(a) human genitals, pubic region,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">(b) buttock, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">(c) female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-14\">(2) Human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely and opaquely covered.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">The definitions employed by Perryville in \u00a7 19B narrowly define \u201cAdult Bookstore/Adult Entertainment Center\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>language that is equivalent to that held sufficiently precise in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>supra; <em>Hart Book Store, Inc. v. Edmisten, </em>612 F.2d 821 (4th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. 3028, 65 L.Ed.2d 1124, (1980); and <em>15192 Thirteen Mile Rd. v. City of Warren, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">It is, as Judge Harvey made clear in <em>15192 Thirteen Mile Rd. v. City of Warren, </em>593 F.Supp. at 155, \u201clogically possible\u201d for an ordinance to be precise in its language yet still be overly broad in its span.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201cA challenge on the basis of overbreadth raises two questions: whether the language of the statute reaches too broadly and proscribes protected conduct, and whether too much discretion is vested in the officials who administer the statute. <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The trial judge in the matter <em>sub judice </em>ruled, and we agree, that Ordinance 84-1 \u201cmeets the criteria requiring ... narrowly drawn, objective, reasonable, and definite standard^] ... [guiding] the administering officials.\u201d Those guidelines are sufficiently clear and precise to be considered definite standards to guide the zoning officials. We hold, therefore, that Perryville Ordinance 84-1 is not violative of the appellant\u2019s First Amendment freedoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Maryland case law provides further safeguards relative to conditional use provisions such as those in the Perryville ordinance. The Court of Appeals in <em>Shultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 22-23, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201cWe now hold that the appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location ... would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with ... a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>To deny an applicant a special exception, the zoning authority must find that the location would suffer unique problems \u201cabove and beyond those\u201d normally associated with the particular use irrespective of whether it is situated within the prescribed zone. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\n<em>The Lingerie Store Occupancy Permit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Appellant argues that her permit for a \u201clingerie shop/retail sales\u201d includes permission to sell adult books. The gist of her argument is that the permit does not distinguish between the sale of apparel and the sale of nonadult books. Each of those categories are permit sales in a C-2 area. Adult books, appellant avers, cannot be singled out and treated differently than other retail inventory. Patently, appellant\u2019s position is incorrect, else <em>Renton, Young, Hart, </em>and <em>15192 Thirteen Mile Road </em>would have been decided differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The Court in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., supra, </em>held that zoning regulations may identify certain types of establishments for special treatment or additional restrictions provided the regulations serve a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>See also Hart Bookstores, Inc., supra. </em>There is no merit in appellant\u2019s argument. A permit to sell one nonregulated commodity does not include the right to sell a validly regulated product.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\n<em>Obscenity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">New principles of law are more firmly established than that obscenity is not protected speech under the First Amendment. <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957); <em>Monfred v. State, </em>226 Md. 312, 173 A.2d 173 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 953, 82 S.Ct. 395, 7 L.Ed.2d 386 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Before printed materials may be judicially determined \u201cobscene,\u201d the court must apply the test enunciated in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). That test requires the following considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201c1. Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">2. Whether the work depicts in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct as specifically defined by state law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">3. Whether the work taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">That the <em>Miller </em>test is binding on Maryland courts is beyond serious question. <em>B &amp; A Co. v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 367, 330 A.2d 701 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In deciding whether materials are obscene, a court must not rule based upon its personal view of the materials. Rather the materials must be viewed as objectively as possible. <em>Village of Books v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>263 Md. 76, 282 A.2d 126 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d element of the Miller test simply means that a \u201ccommunity cannot, where liberty of speech or press are in issue, condemn that which it generally tolerates.\u201d <em>Sanza v. Maryland State Censors, </em>245 Md. 319, 226 A.2d 317 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">At the trial of the matter now before us, the appellant, 5297 Pulaski Highway, produced evidence that magazines of substantially the same type as those the court found \u201csleazy,\u201d \u201ctypically \u2018black market\u2019 \u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d were sold in stores within the ordinance proscribed bounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Additionally, there was evidence that other stores within close proximity to Perryville were displaying and offering for sale similar type magazines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The trial court in the instant case declared that it was in effect applying a \u201cshortcut\u201d we mentioned in <em>Woodruff v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 202, 273, A.2d 436 (1971).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The difficulty with that declaration is two-fold: first, it is not clear since <em>Miller </em>was decided by the Supreme Court whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cevidentiary shortcut\u201d is still viable<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; second, even if it is, the statement that the magazines and books in the instant case are \u201csleazy,\u201d \u201chard core pornography,\u201d and \u201cunder the counter\u201d simply does not withstand scrutiny when considered in the light of what has been determined to be \u201csleazy\u201d and \u201chard core.\u201d For example in <em>Levin v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 139, 228 A.2d 487 (1967), there were photographs of erect penises but no text or captions relative to the photographs. <em>Donnenberg v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 591, 232 A.2d 264 (1967), was concerned with \u201cbondage.\u201d The publication depicted naked women who were gagged, bound, and placed in twisted and tortuous poses. <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 602, 256 A.2d 716 (1969), evolved from a silent stag movie of a man and woman engaged in various acts of conventional and unconventional intercourse. All three of these cases, <em>Levin, Donnenberg </em>and <em>Lancaster, </em>were found by the court to \u201cscream for all to hear that they were obscene.\u201d The books and magazines in the instant case, while unquestionably offensive to some, do not \u201cscream for all to hear that they are obscene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The <em>Woodruff </em>case presents a possible \u201cevidentiary shortcut,\u201d but it does not sanction a finding of obscenity by the mere mouthing of magic words such as \u201csleazy,\u201d \u201chard core,\u201d \u201cunder the counter,\u201d \u201cblack market\u201d and the like. Something more positive is required. We think that if trial judges use the \u201cevidentiary shortcut\u201d of <em>Woodruff, </em>they should state with some particularity the reasons why they have found the magazines or books to be obscene. That was not done in the matter <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">This Court is constitutionally mandated to make an independent reflective judgment as to whether the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>judge correctly decided the question of obscenity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Levin v. State, supra, </em>1 Md.App. at 143-44, 228 A.2d 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Having made that review, we hold that the magazines and books determined by the trial judge to be within the \u201csleazy, hard core, black market, under the counter type\u201d do not fit that mold. Indeed, when we apply the <em>Miller </em>test with its community standards factor, we are led to the inescapable conclusion that when judged by community standards the printed matter offered for sale at 5297 Pulaski was not obscene, and the trial judge\u2019s holding to the contrary was error. Notwithstanding that error, we need not reverse the judgment of the trial court since that portion of the judge\u2019s finding is not embraced within the injunction. The order of the circuit court merely enjoined 5297 Pulaski Highway, Inc., from selling the adult magazines and books until \u201ca conditional use permit [is] obtained from the Perryville zoning authority.\u201d Because we are of the view that the Perryville zoning ordinance is facially constitutional, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-13\">.
