Ehrhardt, and his passenger, Judith Penn. Ms. Penn filed a tort action against Ehrhardt for personal injuries sustained from the accident. In response to this action against its insured, appellant, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (Progressive), filed the instant action for declaratory judgment. In the declaratory judgment action, appellant requested that the court declare that Progressive had no duty to defend or indemnify Ehrhardt due to lack of insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Ms. Penn\u2019s insurance carrier, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), entered the litigation and aligned itself with Ehrhardt, contending that Progressive should pay for the injuries to its insured, Ms. Penn. In the event the court determined that Ehrhardt was uninsured at the time of the accident, Ms. Penn filed a cross-claim for damages against State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Progressive and State Farm filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of Progressive\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify Ehrhardt. The court, however, denied summary judgment because there existed a dispute as to a material fact relating to whether Ms. Penn\u2019s mother had notified Progressive\u2019s Baltimore Claims Office of the accident on May 26, 1983. The case went to trial before Judge Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>F. Fischer in the Circuit Court for Howard County. In a memorandum, Judge Fischer concluded that Ehrhardt was covered by Progressive at the time of the accident. Accordingly, the court ordered that Progressive must defend Ehrhardt against claims brought on behalf of Ms. Penn arising out of the accident and indemnify him according to the terms of his insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Progressive appeals this outcome by raising three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">I. The evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Progressive had knowledge of the accident at the time it backdated the policy to May 19, 1983;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">II. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that its agent had authority to backdate the policy was erroneous; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">III. Progressive\u2019s actions did not amount to a waiver of its right not to extend coverage for the period during which the loss occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Robert Ehrhardt was the named insured in a motorcycle liability insurance policy which he purchased from Progressive. The policy covered the period from May 19, 1982 to May 19, 1983 and was renewable at Ehrhardt\u2019s option. According to the terms of the policy, the tendering of an insurance premium for $70.40 on or before May 19, 1983 would renew the policy for another year. If Ehrhardt failed to tender payment by that expiration date, however, policy coverage would cease at 12:01 a.m. on May 19, 1983. If Ehrhardt tendered payment after the expiration date, the policy was still renewable but the effective date of the renewal would have been the postmark date of the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Ehrhardt failed to pay his premium by the expiration date and, consequently, his policy lapsed automatically on May 19, 1983. Six days later, Ehrhardt was involved in a motorcycle accident in which he and Judith Penn suffered injuries. At the hospital that evening, Ehrhardt asked his father to pay his overdue premium. On the next morning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Albert Ehrhardt carried out his son\u2019s request and paid to Progressive\u2019s soliciting agent, V.W. Brown, $70.40 for the renewal of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">On two occasions, Progressive was put on notice of the accident. First, Ehrhardt notified Progressive on May 31, 1983. In his report, however, he fraudulently claimed May 26, 1983 as the date of the accident, instead of May 25, 1983. Second, testimony indicates that Judith Penn\u2019s mother contacted Progressive by telephone on May 26, 1983. According to her testimony, which was corroborated by her husband, Mrs. Penn informed Progressive\u2019s Baltimore Claims Office that its insured had been in a motorcycle accident on May 25, 1983 in which her daughter suffered injuries. Although she was unable to supply Progressive with Ehrhardt\u2019s policy number, she did report that her daughter sustained serious injuries and was in the shock-trauma treatment unit at Maryland University Hospital. During trial, Progressive vigorously disputed this fact by introducing evidence indicating that its employees had no record or recollection of Mrs. Penn\u2019s telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Upon receiving Ehrhardt\u2019s renewal premium from his father on May 26, 1983, V.W. Brown Agency immediately forwarded it by mail to Progressive\u2019s Richmond office. Progressive initially processed it with an effective date of May 26, 1983, the date on which the envelope in which it was enclosed was postmarked. On June 2, 1983, Progressive\u2019s lead underwriter reviewed Ehrhardt\u2019s policy and backdated its renewal from May 26 to May 19, 1983. As a result, Robert Ehrhardt received in the mail from Progressive a renewal policy effective from May 19, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In a nonjury trial, the court found that Mrs. Penn\u2019s telephone call placed Progressive on notice of the May 25th accident prior to the issuance of the policy renewal. Although Progressive would not ordinarily have been obligated to cover Ehrhardt\u2019s accident, the court concluded that it waived its right to void the policy when, with notice of the accident, it issued Ehrhardt\u2019s renewal effective on May 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>1983 and charged a premium based on that renewal date. Accordingly, the court declared that Progressive was obligated to defend and indemnify Ehrhardt in the underlying personal injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The sole issue before this Court is whether Progressive waived its right not to cover Ehrhardt\u2019s losses sustained during the defaulting period. Before plaintiffs may invoke waiver as the ground for recovery, three prerequisites must be established: knowledge, authority and intent. Progressive must have had knowledge of all material facts; its agent must have acted with its authority; and the actions of its agent must have amounted to an intentional relinquishment of a known right. Progressive contends that appellees have failed to satisfy the requirements of these prerequisites. We will address these issues in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Knowledge of Insured\u2019s Loss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Penn had placed Progressive on notice that Ehrhardt had been involved in an accident on May 25,1983. In support of this position, appellant points to the fact that none of its employees that normally receive claims had any recollection of Mrs. Penn\u2019s call. This was corroborated by Progressive\u2019s claims registry, which revealed that no claim was received from Mrs. Penn on that day. Moreover, appellant suggests Mrs. Penn\u2019s testimony is inherently incredible since it is entirely inconsistent with the procedures by which Progressive trains its employees to handle claims. As a matter of routine, its claims office assistants ask the caller a battery of questions that are enumerated on the loss report form. Mrs. Penn\u2019s testimony indicates that she was not subject to such a cross-examination. In light of this evidence adduced at trial, appellant contends the court\u2019s determination that it had notice was clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Pursuant to Maryland Rule 1086, this Court must adopt a deferential posture when reviewing the trial court\u2019s factual findings. \u201cDue regard\u201d must be given to the courts opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses; we may not set aside an evidentiary conclusion unless the trial court was clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086; <em>Gosman v. Gosman, </em>19 Md.App. 66, 78, 309 A.2d 34 (1973); <em>Carling Brewing Company v. Henry Belzner, </em>15 Md.App. 406, 411-13, 291 A.2d 175 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">In the instant case, appellees presented substantial evidence from which the trial court could have concluded that Mrs. Penn notified Progressive of the May 25th accident on May 26,1983. Because of this substantial evidence, we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Progressive had knowledge of Ehrhardt\u2019s accident and the date of that accident when it backdated his insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\n<em>Agent\u2019s Authority to Bind the Principal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Authorized agents may subject the principal, in this case Progressive, to personal liability and create rights in its favor. This ability to bind the principal, however, is limited to the extent which the agent is authorized to act. <em>Colonial Building &amp; Loan Company v. Boden, </em>169 Md. 493, 182 A. 665 (1936); <em>Hardy v. Chesapeake Bank, </em>51 Md. 563 (1879); <em>see generally </em>3 Am.Jur.2d <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 271 (1986) (discussing principal\u2019s liability for agent\u2019s unauthorized acts); W. SEAVEY HANDBOOK OF LAW OF AGENCY \u00a7 3 (1964) (discussing the relationship between the principal and agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellees contend that one of Progressive\u2019s agents, its chief underwriter, waived its right not to cover Ehrhardt\u2019s losses sustained during the defaulting period when the underwriter backdated the policy to May 19, 1983. Applying the tenets of agency law discussed above, appellees\u2019 contention hinges on whether Progressive authorized its agent to backdate the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>An agent\u2019s authority to act must come from the principal. It is well established that the authority conferred upon the agent by the principal can take two forms: actual authority or apparent authority. According to American Jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">[a]ctual authority is that which is actually granted, and it may be express or implied. Apparent, or, as it is also called, ostensible authority, on the other hand, is that authority which, though not actually granted, the principal knowingly permits the agent to exercise or which himself holds out as possessing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">3 Am.Jur.2d <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 71, at 575 (1986) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In addressing the issue of authority, the trial court concluded that Progressive\u2019s lead underwriter had no actual authority to backdate Ehrhardt\u2019s policy. The facts of the case support the court\u2019s conclusion. Progressive authorized its underwriters to backdate policies only upon approval of the office supervisor after the insured has provided a written declaration of no loss. Moreover, Progressive limited this practice of backdating to situations where the renewal payment was received within five days of the policy expiration. In the case at bar, there was no approval by the office supervisor, no written declaration of no loss, and Progressive received the renewal payment seven days after the expiration of Ehrhardt\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">While finding no actual authority, the court nevertheless concluded that Progressive\u2019s agent had apparent authority to backdate the policy. In support of its conclusion, the court gave no explanation. After careful review of the record, we find the court\u2019s conclusion somewhat problematical.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Reserve Insurance Company v. Duckett, </em>240 Md. 591, 214 A.2d 754 (1965) succinctly summarized the doctrine of apparent authority as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">One who knowingly permits another to act for him as though authorized, inducing third persons to rely to their disadvantage on the seeming authority, is estopped from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>later asserting the lack of authority of his apparent agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Duckett, </em>240 Md. at 600-01, 214 A.2d 754 (citing <em>Hobdey v. Wilkinson, </em>201 Md. 517-26, 94 A.2d 625 (1953)). <em>Accord Ramsburg v. Sykes, </em>221 Md. 438, 442-43, 158 A.2d 106 (1960); <em>White v. Friel, </em>210 Md. 274, 284, 123 A.2d 303 (1956); <em>Penowa Coal Sales Company v. Gibbs and Company, </em>199 Md. 114, 119, 85 A.2d 464 (1952). <em>See generally </em>3 Am.Jur.2d <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 80, at 587 (1986) (setting forth prerequisites for establishing apparent authority). Under this doctrine, the crucial factor is reasonable reliance by a third party on the principal\u2019s conduct. Specifically, the principal becomes responsible for the agent\u2019s actions when the principal\u2019s conduct, either affirmative acts or the failure to take corrective steps, has clothed an agent with apparent authority and thereby induces a third party to rely to his detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Analysis of Progressive\u2019s relationship to the relevant third parties, presumably Ehrhardt and Judith Penn, does not reveal a clear-cut case of reasonable reliance. Since the decision by Progressive\u2019s underwriter to backdate Ehrhardt\u2019s policy occurred after the accident, neither party can claim reliance on that act when they rode the motorcycle. Progressive, however, obstensibly approved its underwriter\u2019s decision to extend coverage for the prior loss. This approval continued for over six months, until December, 1983, when Progressive cancelled Ehrhardt\u2019s policy and returned all premium payments to Ehrhardt. Although it is certainly possible that during this sixth month period either party could have relied to their detriment on Progressive\u2019s decision, appellees failed to allege such reliance in their brief, while the factual record appears inconclusive on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">This case, however, need not turn on the issue of whether Progressive\u2019s underwriter acted with apparent authority. Even if the underwriter acted completely without authority, Progressive can nevertheless become liable if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ratifies the agent\u2019s conduct. <em>Smith v. Merritt Savings and Loan, Inc., </em>266 Md. 526, 536-40, 295 A.2d 474 (1972); <em>Webb v. Duvall, </em>177 Md. 592, 596-98, 11 A.2d 446 (1940). <em>See </em>3 Am.Jur.2d <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 71 at 575 (1986); Restatement (Second) of Agency, \u00a7 82 (1958). Ratification requires an intention to ratify, <em>Linden Homes Inc. v. Larkin, </em>231 Md. 566, 570, 191 A.2d 441 (1963), and knowledge of all material facts. <em>Smith, </em>266 Md. at 539, 295 A.2d 474; 3 Am.Jur.2d <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 189 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Intention to ratify may be inferred by words, conduct or silence on the part of the principal that reasonably indicates its desire to affirm the unauthorized act. <em>Linden Homes, </em>231 Md. at 570, 191 A.2d 441; <em>Bruffey Contracting Company v. Burroughs Corporation, </em>522 F.Supp. 769, 774 (D.Md.1981), <em>aff'd, </em>681 F.2d 812 (4th Cir.1982). <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 93 (1958); 3 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 182, at 683-84 (1986). Circumstances that suggest an intent to ratify include: receipt and retention of the benefits of the unauthorized transaction, <em>Smith, </em>266 Md. at 537, 295 A.2d 474; <em>Linden Homes, </em>231 Md. at 570, 191 A.2d 441, Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 98 (1958) and a failure to make a timely disaffirmance of the unauthorized acts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Applying these factors to the case at hand, the telltale signs of ratification are apparent. There is no doubt that Progressive received a benefit when it backdated Ehrhardt\u2019s policy from May 26 to May 19, 1983. As Judge Fischer correctly noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">[t]he practice of backdating policies results in financial gain to the insurer by creating a shorter period of coverage. While the amounts in any individual case are minor, if practiced on a larger scale, the financial gain can be significant. The practice, however, does have it perils as evidenced by the factual situation in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Moreover, it is undisputed that Progressive retained this benefit and did not attempt to disaffirm the allegedly unauthorized act of its lead underwriter for over six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>As to the second requirement, we hold that Progressive acted with full knowledge of all material facts. The trial court explicitly found, and we affirmed in the previous section, that Progressive was on notice that a loss to its insured occurred during the defaulting period. Because of that knowledge, Progressive is in no position to deny the legal implications of its retention of the benefits of the transaction. Accordingly, we hold that Progressive\u2019s actions retroactively conferred authority on its agent, subjecting it to whatever liability that backdating the policy entails.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>Waiver of Insurer\u2019s Right to Cover Loss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ai0\">Waiver is defined as the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right. <em>Rubinstein v. Jefferson National Life Insurance Company, </em>268 Md. 388, 392-93, 302 A.2d 49 (1973); <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521, 531, 200 A.2d 166 (1964); J.A. APPLEMAN &amp; J. APPLEMAN, 16B INSURANCE LAW AND PRACTICE \u00a7 9081, at 489 (1981) [hereinafter cited as INSURANCE LAW]. In order for waiver to exist, the \u201cacts relied upon must be inconsistent with an intention to insist upon enforcing\u201d the party\u2019s contractual right. <em>Rubinstein, </em>268 Md. at 392-93, 302 A.2d 49; <em>Food Fair, </em>234 Md. at 531, 200 A.2d 166. The last issue for this Court to decide is whether the actions taken by Progressive\u2019s employees amounted to an intentional relinquishment of its right not to cover Ehrhardt\u2019s accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The facts of this case indicate that Progressive acted inconsistent with its contractual rights detailed in Ehrhardt\u2019s policy. Ehrhardt\u2019s policy lapsed when he failed to pay the premium by May 19, 1983. Pursuant to the terms of the policy, Ehrhardt had the right to reinstate the old policy within six months of the expiration date, but the effective date of the reinstatement would have been the date that Ehrhardt tendered the payment, May 26, 1983, one day after the accident. At this point in time, Progressive clearly had the right to avoid coverage of the loss, which occurred during the defaulting period. <em>See Rubinstein, </em>268 Md. at 392, 302 A.2d 49 (stating that \u201cif an insurance policy contains a provision for its forfeiture for nonpayment of premiums, the insurance company may avoid the policy on the insured\u2019s failure to pay a premium\u201d). Progressive\u2019s underwriter, however, acted inconsistent with this contractual right and backdated the policy to the expiration date, May 19, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Progressive nevertheless contends this act, although inconsistent with its contractual right, lacked the intentionality required under the doctrine of waiver. As we pointed out in the previous two sections, Progressive may not negate its intent by alleging lack of knowledge or authority on the part of its agent. Appellant\u2019s sole ground for negating intent thus becomes mistake: that Progressive\u2019s underwriter did not deliberately intend to waive its contractual right. The facts of the case, however, do not support this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The intention to waive a known right may result from an express agreement or may be inferred from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>facts and circumstances surrounding the case. <em>Rubinstein, </em>268 Md. at 392-93, 302 A.2d 49; <em>Food Fair, </em>234 Md. at 531, 200 A.2d 166; <em>Gould v. Transamerican Associates, </em>224 Md. 285, 294, 167 A.2d 905 (1961). In addressing this issue, Appleman\u2019s treatise on insurance law explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">Such waiver may be established by express agreement, conduct, course of dealing, or ratification____ The substance of the doctrine of waiver is that if the insurer, with knowledge of facts which would bar an existing primary liability, recognizes such primary liability by treating a policy as in force, it will not thereafter be allowed to plead such facts to avoid its primary liability. <em>A forfeiture is waived where the insurer with knowledge thereof recognizes the continued validity of the policy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aof\">INSURANCE LAW, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9084, at 522 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We hold that upon the facts in this case, Progressive waived its forfeiture right and recognized the validity of the policy. Progressive\u2019s employees negotiated and deposited the check for payment of the insurance policy. Its chief underwriter reviewed and then backdated the policy. A statement was sent out by Progressive to Ehrhardt to indicate its intent to cover him for the defaulting period. Finally, Progressive recognized the validity of the insurance policy for over six months, collecting additional premium payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In reaching our decision, we distinguish <em>North American Accident Insurance Company v. Plummer, </em>167 Md. 670, 176 A. 466 (1935), cited on behalf of appellant. In that case, the Court of Appeals recognized the legal principle \u201cthat where the authority of the agent does not extend to making a new contract of insurance, he cannot waive a forfeiture and revive a contract that has expired.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>167 Md. at 683, 176 A. 466 (quoting <em>Busby v. North American Life Insurance Company, </em>40 Md. 572, 584 (1874)). Applying this principle, the Court held that an agent, whose function is limited to soliciting insurance and collecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>premiums, lacks the authority to accept a new insurance policy for the insured on behalf of its principal. 167 Md. at 682, 176 A. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The circumstances surrounding the Ehrhardt\u2019s policy renewal differ from those in <em>Plummer. </em>First, the agent in <em>Plummer </em>was not a general employee of the principal, but served the limited function of soliciting insurance and collecting premiums. <em>Id. </em>at 673, 176 A. 466. In contrast, those agents who processed and reissued Ehrhardt\u2019s policy\u2014including the underwriter who backdated the policy\u2014 were general employees of Progressive. Second, the Court in <em>Plummer </em>ruled that the insurer\u2019s agent had exceeded its authority when it accepted the insured\u2019s renewal payment and that there was \u201cno evidence of knowledge or ratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681,176 A. 466. Those circumstances are markedly distinguishable from the facts in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The trial court determined explicitly that Progressive\u2019s agents acted with sufficient knowledge and authority to bind the principal and, we have already noted that Progressive\u2019s actions subsequent to the accident constitute ratification. And third, the terms of the policies differed in at least one significant detail. The policy in <em>Plummer </em>required a complete termination of the policy if the insured failed to tender the renewal payment before the policy expired. Once the policy terminated, reinstatement required the formation of a new insurance contract. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 176 A. 466. In Ehrhardt\u2019s policy, the insured had six months to reinstate the policy before his contractual rights expired completely. Accordingly, a contract was still in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Although Maryland courts have not had the opportunity to address the precise issue, courts of other jurisdictions have held that an insurer\u2019s acceptance and retention of a past due premium, with knowledge that a loss was sustained during the defaulting period, renders the insurer liable for the loss. <em>E.g., State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Bockhorst, </em>453 F.2d 533 (10th Cir.1972) (holding that insurer waived its right to refuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>coverage during defaulting period when it accepted premium over month later); <em>Central National Insurance Group of Omaha v. Grimmett, </em>340 So.2d 767 (Ala.1976) (holding that insurer provided coverage even though insured paid premium two days after the policy expiration and one day after the accident); <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Anderson, </em>294 Ala. 451, 318 So.2d 687 (1975) (holding that insured covered even though tendered renewal premium twenty-three days after policy expiration and one day after the accident); <em>Alabama Farm Bureau Mutual Casualty Insurance Company v.

Progressive argues that Ehrhardt\u2019s lack of good faith bars him, and those subrogated to his rights, from asserting the doctrine of waiver. While this Court is disturbed by Ehrhardt\u2019s material misrepresentations to Progressive\u2019s claims department, his acts are legally irrelevant. It is well settled that in both Maryland and other jurisdictions that waiver of a forfeiture is unilateral in nature so that the insurer\u2019s act or conduct is dispositive and that the insured\u2019s act has no probative value or legal effect on the court\u2019s determination of the waiver issue. INSURANCE LAW, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9084, at 521. <em>Accord Gould v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Transamerican Associates, </em>224 Md. 285, 295, 167 A.2d 905 (1961) (quoting <em>Benson v. Borden, </em>174 Md. 202, 219-20, 198 A. 419 (1938)); <em>Buchanan v. Switzerland General Insurance Company, </em>76 Wash.2d 100, 455 P.2d 344 (1969); <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v.

Since the main focus of the waiver issue concerns the actions of Progressive and not Ehrhardt, we find Ehrhardt\u2019s conduct not pertinent to our inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
