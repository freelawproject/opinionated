BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">This appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Allegany County requires us to determine whether a trial judge must award attorney fees and other litigation expenses to the prevailing party in an action brought pursuant to the Maryland \u201cSunshine Law\u201d, Maryland State Government Code Ann. \u00a7 10-501 <em>et seq. </em>Because we find that, by its terms, Maryland State Government Code Ann. \u00a7 10-510(e)(5)(i)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> makes such awards discretionary with the trial judge and, that in this case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to make the award sought, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Appellants are the parents of students in grades nine through twelve at the Old Town School, a public school, located in Old Town, Maryland, under the supervision of the Allegany County Board of Education, one of the appellees. The Old Town school was flooded on November 5, 1985, necessitating its being closed and its students being reas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>signed to other schools in Allegany County. On November 8, 1985, a meeting was held at a school in Cresaptown, Maryland for the purpose of discussing with these Old Town students the alternative reassignment options available to them. This meeting, of which \u201creasonable advance notice was given\u201d through radio spots and in the newspaper, <em>see </em>\u00a7 10-506, was attended by the students and a few parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">During the open meeting, Dr. H. William Mitchell, the Allegany County School Superintendent, one of the appellees, informed those assembled that the final decision on the reassignment of students would be made at a closed meeting of the Board, to be held at 3:30 p.m. on that day. No prior notice of this meeting had been given to the public. Although three parents did attend the afternoon meeting when the Board overruled Dr. Mitchell\u2019s ruling that the meeting was to be closed, appellants alleged that one parent was actually prevented from attending. At the afternoon meeting, a final decision was reached as to the reassignment of the Old Town students. That decision was then released to the news media. The plan was subsequently ratified at a regularly scheduled public meeting, on November 12, 1985,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of which appropriate notice had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Appellants filed a Complaint and Petition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against the Board of Education, Dr. Mitchell and Glenn Hanna, the Supervisor of pupil personnel. Appellants alleged that the afternoon meeting of November 8, 1985, was \u201cheld without reasonable advance notice\u201d and, therefore, violated the \u201cSunshine Law\u201d. They sought a declaration that holding the meeting to finalize the Board\u2019s reassignment plan violated \u00a7 10-505<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>quently, invalidated the Board\u2019s actions in that regard. Additionally, appellants asked for an injunction against implementation of the plan, and an award of \u201cthe cost of this action, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Following a hearing, the trial judge found that the Board violated the Sunshine Act. Consequently, he ordered that the Board conduct an open meeting for the purpose of adopting a pupil reassignment plan for Old Town students. He did not, however, void the plan then in effect, which was to remain operative until a new plan was adopted. Concerning appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, the trial judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ain\">The Act provides that the Court as part of its judgment may assess against any party reasonable counsel fees that the party who prevails in the action incurs. The Court finds that while the Board failed to comply with the Sunshine Act its actions were not taken in bad faith nor with an intention to deceive the public. Rather, the Board acted to deal with an emergency situation in an expedited fashion and thereby overlooked statutory requirements. Therefore, the Court declines to award counsel fees in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Feeling aggrieved by that ruling, appellants have appealed to this Court, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">1. The trial court erred when it did not award to the prevailing plaintiff [sic] on the merits, the appellant [sic], counsel fees and other litigation expenses pursuant to Md.State Government Code Ann. Section 10-501 et seq. and section 10-510(e)(5)(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">2. The trial court erred when it considered the presence or absence of bad faith or the presence or absence of an intent to deceive the public as a measure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>awarding reasonable counsel fees and other litigation expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">3. Even assuming that bad faith and intent to deceive the public were standards to be applied by the Court regarding appellee\u2019s behavior, in deciding whether appellants would be awarded counsel fees and other litigation expenses, the court erred in finding that appellees did not act in bad faith or with an intent to deceive the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">Section 10-510(e)(5)(i) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">(5) as part of its judgment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">(i) assess against any party reasonable counsel fees and other litigation expenses that the party who prevails in the action incurred ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Relying on federal case law, particularly <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983) and law review articles discussing the award of attorney\u2019s fees in environmental litigation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">To deny reasonable counsel fees and other litigation expenses [pursuant to \u00a7 510(e)(5)(i) ] would clearly violate the purposes of the Sunshine Act. The prospect of citizens having to pay attorney fees under the sunshine law provisions even when they do prevail certainly creates a chilling effect on their ability to utilize this section of the law to enforce sunshine laws. Consequently it is clear the trial court abused its discretion and erred as to the law, when it denied Appellants their attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArP\">Thus, appellants would appear to contend that whenever a plaintiff prevails in an action brought pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Sunshine law, it is an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to deny that prevailing party reasonable attorney fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In effect, therefore, they argue that \u00a7 10-510(e)(5)(i) is mandatory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We do not agree. The issue with which we are confronted is one of statutory construction. In <em>Montgomery County v. McDonald, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention. <em>City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283 [477 A.2d 1174] (1984). This is to be done, where possible, by considering the language and terms of the enactment and giving to them their ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>Where the language used is clear and free from doubt or obscurity, there is no occasion to go further, <em>id., </em>and no power to evade the plain meaning of the enactment by a forced or unreasonable construction <em>Celanese Corporation v. Comptroller, </em>60 Md.App. 392, 397 [483 A.2d 359] (1984), or one \u201cinconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319 [498 A.2d 1195] (1985). Furthermore, an enactment must be construed in context, <em>Comptroller v. Mandel Re-election Comm., </em>280 Md. 575 [374 A.2d 1130] (1977), and so that no part is \u201crendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Baltimore Building and Constr. Trades Council v. Barnes, </em>290 Md. 9, 15 [427 A.2d 979] (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">68 Md.App. 307, 317, 511 A.2d 560 (1986); <em>See Ford Motor Land Devel. Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>68 Md.App. 342, 346, 511 A.2d 578 (1986). Moreover, although use of the term, \u201cmay\u201d does not necessarily require construction of a statute as permissive, <em>Hitchins v. City of Cumberland, </em>215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Md. 315, 323, 138 A.2d 359 (1958), \u201c[t]he word bears its ordinary significance of permission unless the context of the purpose of the statute shows that it is meant to be imperative____\u201d <em>Fleishman v. Kremer, </em>179 Md. 536, 541, 20 A.2d 169 (1941). <em>See also Charles Co. Empl. Loc. Un. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>48 Md.App. 339, 344-47, 427 A.2d 1025 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Applying the foregoing principles leads to a clear result: the legislature intended that trial judges determine, in their discretion, whether the circumstances warrant the award of attorney\u2019s fees or other expenses of litigation. Neither the words used, nor the context of the purpose of the statute warrants a contrary conclusion. Thus, no matter how desirable, or laudatory, the mandatory award of counsel fees might be in furthering the purpose of the Sunshine law, we simply cannot, through the guise of statutory construction, change the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Ruckelshaus </em>does not require a different result. Unlike the case <em>sub judice, </em>the issue there was whether it was appropriate to award counsel fees to non-prevailing parties, not whether the failure to award such fees to parties who did prevail was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">We do not find the denial of attorney fees and other expenses to be an abuse of discretion. Where the trial judge has discretion to award attorneys fees, his or her exercise of that discretion will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. <em>See Dent v. Simmons, </em>61 Md.App. 122, 127, 485 A.2d 270 (1985). Moreover, the exercise of that discretion is \u201cpresumed to be correct until the attacking party has overcome such presumption by clear and convincing proof of an abuse.\u201d <em>Langrall, Muir &amp; Noppinger v. Gladding, </em>282 Md. 397, 401, 384 A.2d 737 (1978). <em>See I.W. Berman Prop. v. Porter Bros., </em>276 Md. 1, 19-20, 344 A.2d 65 (1975). No such clear and convincing proof has been presented here. Accordingly, neither the trial judge\u2019s finding that the Board did not act in bad faith or to deceive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>public, nor his reliance on such finding to support his refusal to award attorneys fees is clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We do not take lightly appellants\u2019 approach to the issue of attorney fee awards pursuant to \u00a7 10-510(e)(5)(i). We recognize, however, as we must, that the federal cases relied upon by appellants involve an act and issues, unlike that presented here. These cases involved litigation brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-1986 and attorneys fee awards sought pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. <em>See, e.g. Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (relationship between success in the Civil Rights litigation and the amount of the fee award); <em>Coen v. Harrison County School Board, </em>638 F.2d 24, 27 (5th Cir.1981) (definition of \u201cprevailing party\u201d as used in \u00a7 1988); <em>Bagby v. Beal, </em>606 F.2d 411, 414 (3rd Cir.1979) (same, and the appropriateness of the fee award in that case). We further are aware that the legislative history of \u00a7 1988, which, like \u00a7 10-510(e)(5)(i), uses discretionary language,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at least in part, accounts for the interpretation placed upon the act by the Courts which have considered it. <em>See, e.g., Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 429, 103 S.Ct. at 1937. We have been provided with no comparable legislative history for \u00a7 10-510(e)(5)(i). There is, moreover, a significant difference between the rights, the abridgement of which the Civil Rights Act of 1871<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is designed to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>and those which are sought to be protected by the Sunshine Law. Thus, there is a rational basis for interpreting the fee award provisions differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
