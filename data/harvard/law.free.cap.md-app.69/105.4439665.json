The appellants make a single contention in this appeal. They posit: The trial judge erred in considering the testimony and report of Dr. Renate Kniffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We will place the issue in perspective by reciting the factual background which led up to this litigation and the course the case followed in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Since 1972 the B. family unit has received public assistance. Also, the family was provided protective services by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services until 1983 when their care was transferred to the appellee, DSS of Baltimore County. Both appellants suffer from mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>illnesses which have required their hospitalization on repeated occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Ample evidence was presented below that the appellants had failed to provide their children with proper care and attention since at least June, 1983, despite the efforts of the staff of the appellee, DSS, to improve the appellants\u2019 parenting skills. What finally convinced DSS to remove the children from the appellants\u2019 home, however, was not the continuing neglect of the children\u2019s physical and emotional needs. Rather, that action was prompted by evidence that the appellant father had been taking baths with his daughters, then aged 10 and 8 years, with the approval of the appellant mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">On December 6, 1984 the children were placed in emergency shelter care by DSS pursuant to \u00a7 3-815(b) and Rule 912a.l. On the following day DSS filed a petition seeking continued shelter care for the children in accordance with \u00a7 3-815(c) and Rule 912b. At the same time DSS filed a petition under \u00a7 3-812 and Rule 903 asking that the court declare the children CI\u00d1A. As required by \u00a7 3-815(b) and Rule 912a.3., a hearing on the petition for continued shelter care was scheduled for the same day before the court\u2019s juvenile master. The appellants appeared at that hearing and requested a postponement so that they might obtain counsel. A postponement was granted until December 10, 1984. The appellants appeared on that day without counsel. Being indigent, they had sought legal services from the Legal Aid Bureau, but they were advised that the Bureau would be providing counsel for their children in the pending proceeding. The appellants were directed to the Office of the Public Defender of Maryland for representation. When the appellants sought representation there, however, they were incorrectly advised that the Public Defender was not able to assist them.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">At the hearing on December 10, the juvenile master authorized continued shelter care for the children. She also ordered the appellants to appear for an evaluation by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>court\u2019s forensic psychiatrist, Renate M. Kniffin, M.D., on January 11, 1985. Dr. Kniffin filed her report with the court on February 21, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On January 14, 1985, the juvenile master conducted an adjudicatory hearing on the CINA petition pursuant to \u00a7 3-819 and Rule 914. The master recommended that the children be found to be CINA and that, in disposition of that finding pursuant to \u00a7 3-820 and Rule 915, the court commit the children to DSS for foster home placement. The appellants appeared at that hearing unrepresented by counsel. Their request for a further postponement in order to obtain counsel was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On January 22, 1985 the Public Defender\u2019s Office discovered its earlier erroneous refusal to represent the appellants in this case and filed exceptions on behalf of the appellants to the master\u2019s recommendations that the children be adjudicated CINA and placed in foster care. These exceptions were sustained by the court on March 12, 1985, and the case was remanded for a new hearing before the juvenile master because the indigent appellants had been denied representation by the Office of the Public Defender at the adjudicatory and disposition hearings before the master as required by Rule 906.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>After a hearing on April 22, 1985, the juvenile master again recommended that the children be adjudicated CINA and that they be placed in foster care by DSS. Exceptions were filed to these recommendations by the appellants, who elected a de novo hearing before the court on the issues of the adjudication of their children as CINA and the dispositional placement of the children in foster care. Hearings on the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings were conducted before the court on June 25, 1985 and August 20, 1985. It was at the later hearing that DSS offered the testimony of Dr. Kniffin, Over the objections of the appellants that testimony was admitted subject to being stricken should the court decide upon submission of memoranda from counsel for the parties that the testimony should have been excluded. On February 4, 1986, the court, after considering the written and oral arguments of the parties, ruled that Dr. Kniffin\u2019s testimony was admissible. Based on that testimony and the other evidence offered in the two days of hearings before it, the court overruled the exceptions to the master\u2019s recommended CINA adjudication of the children. Immediately thereafter, the court held a de novo hearing on the exceptions to the recommendation of the master as to the disposition of the case. In that phase of the proceeding the written report of Dr. Kniffin, which had been filed on February 21, 1985, was considered by the court when it overruled the exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendation in disposition of the case that the children be placed in foster care by DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The appellants\u2019 argument that Dr. Kniffen\u2019s testimony was inadmissible at the de novo hearing on their exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendation that the children be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>adjudicated CINA is based on the fact that the appellants were not represented by counsel on December 10, 1984 when the master ordered them to submit to a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Kniffin. The appellants assert that since \u00a7 3-821 mandates that \u201c[a] party is entitled to the assistance of counsel at every stage of any proceeding under this subtitle,\u201d the results of the psychiatric evaluation of them at the time when they were unrepresented should not have been admitted in the adjudicatory hearing of the petition alleging that their children were CINA. We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">To carry out the expressed purposes of the Juvenile Causes Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the General Assembly has recognized the importance to the judges and masters who are clothed with juvenile jurisdiction of appropriate professional advice concerning children brought before the court. Thus, \u00a7 3-818 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(a) After a petition or a citation has been filed, the court may direct the Juvenile Services Administration or another qualified agency to make a study concerning the child, his family, his environment, and other matters relevant to the disposition of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>(b) As part of the study, the child or any parent, guardian, or custodian may be examined at a suitable place by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other professionally qualified person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">(c) The <em>report </em>of the study is admissible as evidence at a waiver hearing and at a disposition hearing, but not at an adjudicatory hearing. However, the attorney for each party has the right to inspect the report prior to its presentation to the court, to challenge or impeach its findings and to present appropriate evidence with respect to it. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Our role in ascertaining the legislative intent in construing this statute was defined in <em>Jones v. State, </em>304 Md. 216, 220, 498 A.2d 622 (1985), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">We primarily determine the intent of the legislature by considering the language and terms of the enactment in their natural and ordinary signification. <em>[City of Baltimore v.] Hackley, </em>300 Md. [277] at 283, 477 A.2d [1174] at 1177 [ (1984) ]. Where there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of the statute, the Court will not go beyond the verbiage of the enactment. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In unambiguous terms, a study may be summarily ordered pursuant to \u00a7 3-818 at any time after a petition is filed in the court alleging that a child is in a status which gives rise to juvenile jurisdiction under \u00a7 3-801 through \u00a7 3-835. There is no requirement that the court conduct a hearing prior to ordering a study. None was conducted in the instant case. Since there was no requirement that the court conduct a hearing on the propriety of ordering the psychiatric evaluation of the appellants, as parties to the CINA petition, their entitlement to appointed counsel under \u00a7 3-821 and Rule 906b.2. was not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Finally, we observe that the court properly admitted the <em>testimony </em>of Dr. Kniffin at the de novo adjudicatory hearing and Dr. Kniffin\u2019s <em>report </em>at the de novo disposition hearing. We recently pointed out that \u00a7 3-818(c) and Rule 905c. created a hearsay exception for admission of evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ative reports at disposition hearings in CINA cases. <em>In re Colin R., </em>63 Md.App. 684, 691, 493 A.2d 1083 (1985). Moreover, nothing in \u00a7 3-818 which bars the use of the <em>report </em>at an adjudicatory hearing, because of its nature as hearsay, requires that the testimony of the evaluator be excluded on the issue of CINA adjudication. <em>Cf </em>\u00a7 3-811(b) which prohibits the use of such testimony, except on the issue of competence of the child to participate in the proceedings, in an adjudicatory hearing on a petition alleging juvenile delinquency. Rule 905c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was adopted by the Court of Appeals on November 5, 1976, effective January 1, 1977, expressly authorizes the admission of such testimony. The Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Court of Appeals in its Fifty-Sixth Report which recommended the adoption of Rule 905 explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">The amendments proposed to this Rule substantially rewrite the Rule. Authority to order an examination is found in Sec. 3-818, which provides that the Report of the examination is admissible at a waiver or disposition hearing, but not at an adjudicatory hearing. The proposed amendment is consistent with that Code provision. However, it permits testimony concerning the examination to be admitted at any hearing in a non-delinquency case, and in a delinquency case or one arising under \u00a7 3-831, at a</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>waiver or disposition hearing, and, on the issue of competence and responsibility, at an adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AtQP\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\">. <em>Child in need of </em>asistance.\u2014\"Child in need of assistance\u201d is a child who requires the assistance of the court because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">(1) He is mentally handicapped or is not receiving ordinary and proper care and attention, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">(2) His parents, guardian, or custodian are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and his problems provided, however, a child shall not be deemed to be in need of assistance for the sole reason he is being furnished nonmedical remedial care and treatment recognized by State law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">Md.Code (1974, 1984 Repl.VoL), \u00a7 3-801(e) of the Cts. &amp; Jud.
