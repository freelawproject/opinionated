Edgerly, </em>40 Md.App. 230, 388 A.2d 934 (1978). That issue is: \u201cwhether a husband may convey his interest in real property, owned by the husband and his wife as tenants by the entireties, to his wife ... so as to shield the husband from his judgment creditors.\u201d 40 Md.App. at 232, 388 A.2d 934 (footnote omitted). Our answer remains the same; yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">That is so because the creditor of one spouse \u201chas no lien against the property held as entireties and no standing to complain of a conveyance which prevents the property from falling into his grasp.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 388 A.2d 934 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Appellant argues that <em>Watterson </em>is not controlling in this case because Chief Judge Gilbert, in the <em>Watterson </em>opinion, did not consider the effect of Commercial Law Article \u00a7\u00a7 15-201 et seq., the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">We note that the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act \u201chas been in force in Maryland since 1920\u201d, <em>Westminster Savings Bank v. Sauble, </em>183 Md. 628, 632, 39 A.2d 862 (1944). Therefore, we cannot assume that it was simply overlooked by Chief Judge Gilbert in the <em>Watterson </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">The short answer to appellant\u2019s contention is that the same rationale would apply to an action brought pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ant to the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Specifically, Commercial Law Article \u00a7 15-209 permits a creditor to have a conveyance set aside \u201c[i]f a conveyance or obligation is fraudulent as to a creditor....\u201d As we observed earlier, a creditor of either a husband or a wife cannot attach the debtor\u2019s interest in entireties property. Therefore, a conveyance of that property, which was already beyond the creditor\u2019s reach, would not be fraudulent as to the creditor and could not be set aside in an action under the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Compare, Pearce v. Micka, </em>62 Md.App. 265, 277, 489 A.2d 48 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-12\">. <em>See, State of Maryland v. One 1984 Toyota Truck, </em>69 Md.App. 235, 517 A.2d 103 (1986), for an elaboration on the properties of, and the methods for terminating, an estate of tenancy by the entireties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-13\">. Appellant alludes to the fact that appellee is making substantial monthly payments to his wife, while claiming he owns no assets. We cannot address that issue in this appeal as it was neither raised nor argued below. Rule 1085. We therefore express no opinion as to appellant\u2019s rights with respect to any other alleged transfers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"APo\">. <em>Pearce </em>is the reverse of the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Pearce </em>we held that the utilization of individually owned funds by an insolvent to reduce the mortgage debt on entireties property was a fraudulent conveyance with respect to the insolvent\u2019s creditors, because funds which were previously available to those creditors were put beyond their reach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
