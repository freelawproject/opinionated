That the evidence shows that Adam Becker had charge of the defendant\u2019s' business in this locality, taking and receiving applications for policies, receiving, countersigning and delivering the policies, receiving premiums, taking proofs of loss and making payment of the same; and such being the-undisputed facts, Becker\u2019s knowledge, if he had it, that Spieler had and. claimed no interest in the policy, and that the same was properly payable to Roth\u2019s estate, is knowledge of the company defendant, and makes it liable to the Roth estate, unless the execution of the assignment and receipt upon the policy enabled Becker to fraudulently obtain and keep the money from the company, his retention of which is the origin of this suit, and such was not the effect of the assignment and receipt, as it is clearly shown by Dart\u2019s testimony, that part of Becker\u2019s duty as such agent was to receive the money and \u201c pay it to the party entitled to receive it \u201d in case of loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-9\">Answer: I cannot assent to this point.in all its propositions as stated, and decline therefore to instruct as therein, requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-10\">2. That the uncontradicted evidence shows that Becker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>knew all of the facts respecting the policy and its assignment, and the claims of Roth\u2019s estate, from the time of the death of Roth; and if, under the evidence, the jury finds that Roth\u2019s estate was entitled to be paid the money due upon the policy, and that neither Becker nor the defendant ever paid either Spieler or said estate, then the defendant is liable in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\">Answer: Affirmed.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">8. That if the jury find from the testimony that the company or George Dart, its state agent, received notice given on behalf of plaintiff before the payment of the money to Becker that the plaintiff questioned the validity of any claim by Spieler to the policy, and disregarded it, then the defendant is to be held as paying the money to Becker , at its own risk, and cannot set up that it was misled by .the assignment on the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">Answer: Affirmed, with this qualification: That the notice given was of such a nature as reasonably to put the company on inquiry or to require the company to withhold .payment of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-7\">4. If the jury find that Roth did sign the assignment on the policy, but never delivered the same, nor received any consideration therefor, and that Spieler acknowledged that he never had .possession of, or any actual interest in, the policy, then the loss was payable to the Roth estate, and is so still.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-8\">Answer: Affirmed.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-9\">5. That if the jury find that Becker could have received and retained the money as well if the assignment had not been made and the claim of loss had been made out by the plaintiff, then if the -assignment was never consummated by delivery or by the receipt of any consideration, and Becker never paid the money on the policy, then the assignment is not to be regarded, so far as Roth and his \u25a0 estate is concerned, as wrongfully aiding Becker to commit the wrong of procuring and appropriating the loss; and if such is the case, the company is fully charged with all knowledge then had by Becker of the loss being payable to Roth\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-10\">Answer: Affirmed.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-11\">6. The defendant is, under the evidence, chargeable with all the notice and knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s claim which was received by Becker, and their payment to Becker must be considered as made under such notice and knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Answer: Affirmed..4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">Defendant\u2019s,counsel present the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\">1. That under the pleadings and evidence the verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">Answer: Refused.5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">2. That if the jury should find that Adam Becker was a party to the alleged fraud, Iris complicity in and knowledge thereof would not affect the company defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">Answer: Refused.6</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">3. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the assignment on the back of the policy was signed by John Roth in blank, and the policy in that condition was left in the hands of Adam Becker, Roth thereby constituted Becker Iris agent to fill up the assignment; and if Becker did subsequently fill in the name of John Spieler as assignee, and upon this assignment, thus regular on its face, the company acted, believing it to be a valid assignment, both John Roth and the plaintiff are estopped to deny the validity of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-11\">Answer: Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-12\">4. If the jury find from the evidence that John Spieler left in the hands of Adam Becker the policy having the assignment filled up and the receipt filled up and signed by Spieler, for the purpose of enabling Becker to receive the money as his agent, he, Spieler, constituted Becker his agent, to receive the insurance money from the company, and payment to Becker in connection with the surrender by him of the receipted policy discharged the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-13\">Answer: Affirmed, with this caution: that you must be well assured from the evidence that Becker received the money from the company as Spieler\u2019s agent or upon his order, and not from the company as its agent to adjust a liability of the company.7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-14\">5. That if the jury should believe from the evidence that George Segrist wrote and mailed the letter testified to by Charles Kirsch, and that the same was received by the company, said letter was not enough to affect the defendant company with the notice of the alleged fraud, nor was it sufficient to put the company upon inquiry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-15\">Answer: Refused: I leave to you to find from the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>whether or not the notice was of snch a nature as reasonably to put the company on inquiry, or require it to withhold payment of the money.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">6. That there is no sufficient evidence in this case to impeach the assignment by John Roth of the policy in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">Answer: Affirmed; that is if I understand the import of the word impeach. There is no sufficient evidence for the court to say as matter of law that the assignment is unworthy of credit, and to be excluded from the consideration of the jury.9</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">7. That under the policy, assignment and death proofs, the defendant company was justified in settling the loss with John Spieler, the assignee, or with his representative, Adam Becker, and if the jury find the insurance money was paid to Adam Becker as his agent, the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">Answer: Affirmed, with the qualification as stated in answer to defendant\u2019s fourth point.10</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-9\">8. That, as it appears from the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence that John Roth left the policy in suit, with his signature to the assignment indorsed thereon, in the hands of Adam Becker, and thereby gave him the power to perpetrate, the alleged fraud, his personal representative, the plaintiff, is estopped from setting up the alleged fraud against the company in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-10\">Answer: Refused. I cannot say that the deposit of the policy with its assignment, with the agent of the company, before payment made, will relieve the company from liability to pay the creditor when the money intended for the creditor has been appropriated by the agent of the company to his own use and not applied to the company indebtedness. The fact, however, that the company has acted on such state of facts is matter to be taken into consideration with other circumstances and facts, as indicative of the true character of the transaction and the relation of the parties to one another.11</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-11\">9. If the jury find from the evidence that the defendant company, through their general agent, George Dart, on September 5, 1871, in good faith, relying on the assignment of the policy in suit made by John Roth, the assured, to John Spieler, on February 24, 1871, and on the proofs of loss furnished the company by said Spieler, and on his surrender of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>said policy, -with his receipt of satisfaction in full indorsed thereon and signed by him, paid the amount due on said policy to said John Spieler, through Adam Becker, who then and there produced and surrendered to said general agent, Dart, the said policy so assigned and satisfied, then the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant. Nor, if the jury find as above stated, will the alleged statements made by Becker or Spieler, after such payment, avail to deprive the defendants of their right in such case to have the verdict of the jury in their favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">Answer: Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">[The court, after referring to the nature of the case, the conditions of the policy, and the assignment and receipt indorsed thereon, proceeded:]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-7\">Upon this state of facts, if nothing else appeared, your verdict, necessarily, would be for the defendant company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-8\">The plaintiff does not controvert the genuineness of the signature of John Roth to the assignment, nor that-of . John Spieler to the receipt. The grounds upon which plaintiff relies to recover in this action is that she is the administratrix of John Roth, deceased, by letters of administration issued to her on October 4,1871, and as such is entitled to demand, and receive any personal property belonging to the estate of John Roth, deceased; that the amount due upon the policy in suit has never been paid to either the administratrix or to John Spieler, to whom the policy had been assigned; that the money to pay the policy was committed to the hands of Adam Becker, the agent here of the company, and was by him appropriated to his own use, and that the company is not relieved of liability by such act; that the assignment, though genuine, was not intended to make the money the property of Spieler, but for other purposes than that of. ownership, and that, although assigned, it was, notwithstanding, the money of John Roth; that the receipt for the three thousand dollars is a genuine paper, but that it is simply prima facie evidence of payment and the subject of proof that the money was not paid, although the receipt was delivered. It is further contended by the plaintiff that before the payment made, as alleged, to Spieler, the defendants had notice not to pay the money to him, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>was claimed by tbe administratrix of John Roth, deceased. I have attempted to state the character of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and the ground upon which she relies to secure a verdict. I do not mean to intimate any conclusion of fact therefrom. You will, when you retire to the jury room, be called upon to find under the obligations of your oath the facts for yourselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">The. defendant company has set up the plea of payment, and it is not denied that it has paid out, to some person, on account of this policy the sum of \u00a72,847.36, being the total sum due thereon. The company claims that the money was paid to Spieler, the assignee of the policy, and before any knowledge of the claim of plaintiff was brought to its notice; and further claims that if any money was retained by Becker, the agent of the company at this point, it was so retained by the authority of the assignee, and not from any fault or act of the company or misappropriation by its agent......</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">The counsel have presented points to the court for your instruction, which, perhaps, will cover the law of the case. I may, however, in addition to the points submitted, say that I take it to be the law that there can be no recovery in this action if you find as a faet that the money due upon this policy was paid to John Spieler, the assignee, before notice of a claim thereto by the administratrix of John Roth, or, if paid after notice, the plaintiff has failed in this action to substantiate her right to the money in dispute. [I take it, also, to be the law that if the company placed in the hands of Adam Becker, the local agent for this county, the money to settle this policy and Becker appropriated the fund to his own use, without authority to so appropriate from Spieler, the company will not be discharged from liability.]18</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-7\">If an agent receives money from his principal to pay to another, and without authority of the party entitled to receive the money, retains it for his own use, the loss would fall upon the principal and not upon the p\u00e1rty for whom the money was intended. The only way for the principal in such case to avoid liability would be to show clearly and satisfactorily that the agent retained the money for his own use, by and with the authority and consent of the party entitled to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>money, and that authority is to be determined by the facts and circumstances surrounding each case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">Reference has been made in the trial of this case to the question of fraud as existing in the transaction. The rule of law is that fraud must be proven and cannot be presumed. You will, therefore, not presume in this case that fraud exists in the absence of proof to that effect. If fraud is once established it affects the rights of all involved in the fraud; and I may say, in addition that, as I understand it, the transactions of the parties have not been assailed on the ground of fraud. The controversy has apparently resolved itself more into the question of the rights of the parties to the fund assigned, rather than an attack upon the validity of the assignment, except in so far as the evidence may show that the assignment is void from want of delivery and like allegations, \u00e1nd the further contention that the company has never made a lawful payment in satisfaction of the policy to either John Spieler or the estate of John Roth. In fact, it seems to me that the' assignment cannot be safely attacked by the plaintiff as a fraudulent act, because in that event John Roth would be connected with Becker in the perpetration of a fraud that would defeat the right of the plaintiff to a policy committed in fraud to Becker for purposes'of collection of money'improperly from the defendant company......</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">\u2022The amount due upon the policy, if not paid, is twenty-eight hundred and forty-seven dollars and thirty-six cents, with interest from September 5, 1871, less any payments on account; and I only recall, and when I say anything about the testimony I am not giving it to you as contrary to your own recollection of it; you must take your own recollection for everything of fact; I say I only recall two items as mentioned in the evidence, three or four hundred dollars, admitted by Spieler in his own testimony, and a receipt from him for twelve hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">Take the case, gentlemen, and do what in your judgment' is right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">The verdict of the jury was $5,512.40. On the hearing of a motion for a new trial it was ordered, that unless the defendant company tendered the plaintiff within twenty days the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sum of #2,605.26, a new trial would be refused; that if such tender were made and refused by the plaintiff, a new trial would be granted.

Upon the evidence and the affirmance of. defendant\u2019s ninth point, the case should have ended with a verdict for the defendant. But in admitting, evidence of the statements made by Becker and by Spieler after payment by the company, and by affirming the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer, the court erred precisely as in the previous trial reversed in 87 Pa. 418. The assignment and receipt being in evidence, and their authenticity unquestioned, it was error to admit testimony of statements and declarations made by Becker after payment and surrender of the policy. The controversy was not as to matters that led to the making of the contract, in which Becker\u2019s knowledge might well be the knowledge of the company, but to matters between the assured and Becker personally. The instructions made the company liable to Roth\u2019s administratrix even if it ha.d paid the policy to Becker on the faith of the assignment to Spieler and of Spieler\u2019s order to Becker, provided Becker never paid over the money to Spieler. The fraud of Becker and Spieler would not affect the company if the company paid in ignorance of the fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-12\">2. The defendant\u2019s fifth prayer that if the jury should find that Segrist wrote and mailed the letter testified to by Kirsch and that it was received by the company, it was not enough to affect the company with notice of the alleged fraud, .was affirmed on the former trial, but refused on this. How could such letter, not signed by anybody having any apparent connection with the business, and giving no reason why payment should not be made, be notice of anything to the company ? The error was a vital one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-13\"><em>Mr. M. A. </em>Woodward, for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>1. From the evidence, there is no possibility of question that Becker was, legally, the general agent of the defendant company at Pittsburgh. Persons assured in companies of a distant state, and largely from among an humble class, cannot reasonably be expected to deal in any respect with the corporation except through its resident agent. When Becker received the money to pay the loss he was still the company\u2019s agent. And, having the money in his hands, his principal was bound by his acts, declarations and admissions, as part of the res gestae: 1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 118; Story Agency, \u00a7 451; Insurance Co. v. Woodruff, 2 Dutch. 541; Telegraph Co. v. Dryburg, 35 Pa. 302; Erie City I. Works v. Barber, 106 Pa. 138; McDonald v. Todd, 1 Gr. 17. Becker\u2019s knowledge of the fraud was the knowledge of the company; therefore, by no jugglery of Becker with Spieler, nor orders from him, nor payment to him, nor fraud by him upon the plaintiff, or his company, can the plaintiff\u2019s rights he affected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\">2. But it is asserted that Roth, by his assignment, enabled Becker to deceive the company. The court below could not say that the signing of the assignment, without any consideration and never delivered or accepted, nor known of, till after his death, but kept in the agent\u2019s possession and control, so put it in the agent\u2019s power as to enable him to defraud the company that the plaintiff\u2019s rights were thereby forfeited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">3. The testimony as to the Segrist letter was not to be disregarded. The plaintiff, suspecting a fraud, did all an ignorant woman could be expected to do. After sixteen years, the contents of the letter could not be accurately remembered, but it is a fair presumption that it embodied the substance of Mrs. Roth\u2019s claims and that it was received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-8\">4. Spieler\u2019s testimony was most relevant. He did not know of the assignment to him till after Roth\u2019s death. The assignment was without consideration and there was no delivery. He signed papers generally at Becker\u2019s request, including ordinary and judgment notes, upon which he received and owed nothing. The assignment and receipt upon the policy were valueless against the plaintiff.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Azp\">Mr. Justice Sterrett :</author>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">If proper attention had been given to the opinion of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>court, delivered by the present Chief Justice, when the case was here before: 87 Pa. 409, the learned judge of the Common Pleas would not have fallen into some of the errors now complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In support of her claim, plaintiff gave in evidence the policy of insurance in suit, reserving \u201c the right to explain and contradict the indorsements thereon, and to show that they are not binding-upon \u201d her\u00a1 The-indorsements, thus put in evidence with the policy, are: (1) An assignment, by John Roth, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, of all his \u201c right, title, and interest in and to the within policy, No. 58,714,\u201d to John Spieler, \u201cfor his sole use and benefit.\u201d The assignment is declared to be \u201cfor a valuable consideration, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged,\u201d and provides : \u201c In case of the death of said assignee before the policy becomes due, then, and. in that case, it shall be payable to the heirs or assigns of John Spieler-; \u201d (2) The receipt of John Spieler, September 5, 1871, to the company, plaintiff in error, for \u201cthree thousand dollars in full of all.claims on the within policy.\u201d These indorsements, the genuineness of which was not questioned, in connection with the policy, coming as they did from the possession of the company, and given in evidence by plaintiff herself, were proof of payment upon which the company had a right to rely until the contrary was shown. In other words, the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence, at that stage of the case, presented a clear prima facie defence to her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">It was clearly shown on the trial that after the death of assured, and due proof thereof by his assignee, John Spieler, the company sent its draft on New York to the order of George Dart, its general agent in this state, residing in the city-of Williamsport, for the purpose of paying the risk; and, upon surrender of the policy, with the assignment and receipt above mentioned, indorsed thereon, the money was paid by Dart, and the policy forwarded by him to the company. In view of these and other facts, clearly established by uncontradicted evidence, the court was requested in defendant\u2019s third and ninth points to instruct the jury as follows : \u201c 3. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the assignment on back of the policy was signed by John Roth in blank, and the policy in that condition was left in the hands of Adam Becker, Roth thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>constituting Becker his agent to fill up the assignment; and if Becker did subsequently fill in the name of John Spieler as assignee, and upon this assignment, thus regular on its face, the company acted, believing it to be a valid assignment, both Roth and the plaintiff are estopped to deny the validity of the assignment.\u201d \u201c 9. If the jury find from the evidence that the defendant company, through their general agent, George Dart, on September 5,1871, in good faith, relying on the assignment of the policy in suit, made by John Roth, the assured, to John Spieler, and on the proofs of death furnished by said Spieler, and on his surrender of the policy, with his receipt of satisfaction in full indorsed thereon and signed by him, paid the amount due on said policy to said John Spieler, through Adam Becker, who then and there produced and surrendered to said general agent, Dart, the said policy so assigned and satisfied, then the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant. Nor, if the jury find, as above stated, will the alleged statement, made by Becker or Spieler, after such,.payment, avail to deprive defendants of their right in such case, to have the verdict of the jury in their favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Both of these propositions were rightly affirmed without any qualification, and would have been conclusive of the case if it had not been for the admission of incompetent evidence and erroneous instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In defendant\u2019s fourth point the court was requested to charge : \u201c If the jury find from the evidence that John Spieler left in the hands of Adam Becker the policy having the assignment filled up, and the receipt filled up and signed by Spieler, for the purpose of enabling Becker to receive the money as his agent, he, Spieler, constituted Becker his agent to receive the insurance money from the company; and payment to Becker, in connection with the surrender by him of the receipted policy, discharged the company.\u201d The seventh point was of Similar import, and the answer of the learned judge to each was': \u201cAffirmed with this caution: that you must be well assured from the evidence that Becker received the money from the company as Spieler\u2019s agent and upon his order, and not from the company as its agent, to adjust a liability of the company.\u201d In thus qualifying the answer and permitting the jury to pass upon a question of fact not war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ranted by tbe evidence, the court erred. The seventh and tenth specifications are sustained; and inasmuch as the eighteenth specification contains substantially the same error,, it is also sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">There was also error in affirming the points recited in the first four specifications and in refusing defendant\u2019s second point. The effect of this was to permit the jury to visit upon the company all the consequences of Becker\u2019s knowledge respecting the policy and assignment thereof, as well as his alleged fraudulent conduct in connection therewith, without regard to whether such knowledge was acquired or acts done by him as sub-agent of the company, acting within the scope of his duties as such agent, or wholly outside thereof. The declarations and conduct of Becker, as affecting the liability of the company, were considered in the opinion, above referred to, and it is unnecessary to repeat what was then said on that subject. The admission of testimony bearing thereon and submission of same to the jury, without evidence tending to connect the company therewith in any manner, were erroneous; and the several specifications relating thereto are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The eighth and ninth specifications are also sustained. The evidence, relating to the former, if it prove anything, tends to show that Segrist wrote as a stranger and not as one having any authority in the premises ; and, even if it were sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the alleged letter was received by the company, the communication was not. of such a character as to put the company on inquiry. It neither contained any statement of fact nor disclosed any reason why the money should not be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">As already observed, the assignment and receipt, indorsed on the policy given in evidence by plaintiff below, the genuineness of which is not questioned, were evidence of payment in full by the company to the proper party. The burden was on plaintiff to rebut the prima facie defence thus presented, by proving not only that the assignment was fraudulently procured from the assured, and therefore his personal representative was entitled to demand the insurance money, but also that the company, before paying the money on the faith of the assignment, had notice of that fact. It may be conceded the jury would have been warranted in finding the alleged fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>but we fail to discover any evidence to justify a finding that the company had any notice or knowledge of such facts as should have put it on inquiry. In fact, there is no competent evidence to warrant the submission of that question to the jury. The court should, therefore,have ended the controversy by affirming the defendant\u2019s first point: \u201c That under the pleadings and evidence the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
