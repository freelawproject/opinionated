R. Morrell was plaintiff and M. Oppenheimer, owner, and John Burkett, contractor, were defendants, the parties on February 11, 1887, filed an agreement in the form of a case stated, showing the facts following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\">John Burkett, a bricklayer, contracted with M. Oppenheimer, one of the defendants above named, to furnish the bricks and brick work in and about the erection of a certain building owned by the said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">G. R. Morrell, the plaintiff above named, with knowledge of the contract between the said Burkett and Oppenheimer, furnished, during the progress of the work, to the said Burkett, and upon the credit of said building, certain lumber of the value of $81.78, for the purpose (for which purpose it was so used)- of erecting scaffolding, to be used in laying the bricks in the erection and construction of the building aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">If the court be of the opinion that the said G. R. Morrell is entitled to a lien against the said building for the material so as aforesaid furnished and used, then judgment to be entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, in the sum of $81.78, with interest thereon from June 13, 1886; but if not, then judgment to be entered for the defendants; the costs to follow the judgment, and each party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-10\">On hearing, the court, Ewing, P.

L. 696, declares that every building within its operation \u201c shall be subject to a lien for the payment of all debts contracted for work done or materials furnished for or about the erection or construction of the same.\u201d The right to the lien must be -found in the statute. For lumber furnished specifically for scaffolding, with knowledge at the time that it would never be incorporated into the building, the owner is not entitled to the security of a lien: Phillips Mech.

L., \u00a7 72. If the materials were never used for any purpose, nevertheless, if furnished for the construction of and on the credit of the building, they would be protected by the lien: Church v. Allison, 10 Pa. 416; Hazard Powder Co. v. Byrnes, 12 Abb. Pr. 469; Dixon v. LaFarge, Smith, C. P., 722. The scaffolding was necessary for the erection and construction of the house, which could not have been built without it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Amf\">Me. Justice Steeeett :</author>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The case stated represents that Burkett, one of the defendants below, contracted with his co-defendant, Oppenheimer, to furnish and lay the brick in and about the erection of a building owned by the latter. During the progress of the work, and with knowledge of said contract, Morrell, plaintiff below, furnished to Burkett, on the credit of the building, lumber for the purpose of erecting scaffolding to be used in laying the brick, and the same was so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The single question suggested by the admitted - facts is whether Morrell thereby acquired a lien on the building. We think he did not, for the reason that the lumber was neither used nor intended to be used in the construction of the building, and is therefore not within either the letter or spirit of the statute. The mechanics\u2019 lien law is a species of class-legislation, giving to material men and others a special remedy, the scope of which should not be unnecessarily enlarged by a too liberal construction of the act. When lumber or other material, suitable in kind and quality for a particular building, is furnished to the contractor, on its credit, the material man is not hound to see that it is actually used in the structure. He is entitled to his lien whether the material is so used or not, because the contractor, in providing suitable materials for the building, is quasi agent of the owner; but when, as in this ease, he knows the material is to be used merely for the purpose of erecting temporary scaffolding to facilitate the work of the contractor, and it is in fact so used, he has no right to a lien, notwithstanding he may have furnished it on the credit of the building. Such a claim is no more within the purview of the statute than would be one for pickhandles furnished to facilitate the work of excavating the foundation for the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Judgment reversed, and now judgment is entered on the case stated in favor of defendants below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
