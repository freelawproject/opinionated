No order of arrest was issued, and therefore, if plaintiff had recovered, he would not have been entitled to an execution against the person of defendant upon account of the chattels (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3026); and he was not entitled to an order of arrest under either subdivision 1 or 2 of section 2895, and therefore not entitled to an execution against the person (section 3026), upon account of damages for the wrongful taking and detention of the chattels, because of the exception stated in the section last cited: \u201cBut this subdivision does not apply to a claim for damages in an \u2022action to recover a chattel.\u201d Besides, unless the execution can issue upon both demands it can issue upon neither.
