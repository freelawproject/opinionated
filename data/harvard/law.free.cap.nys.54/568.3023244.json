We think that the general charge made by him is not sufficient, without such details, to enable plaintiff, upon the trial, to deny in every instance such alleged misconduct, if possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">The order, in our judgment, was a proper and reasonable one, and must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
