An extract from the case on appeal from the judgment presenting the questions raised on this appeal is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">Second cross interrogatory: \u201cWhen did you \u00e1ssign the claim alleged_ in. the complaint to the plaintiff?\u201d To the second cross interrogatory: \u201cI think it was in December, but I am not sure.\u201d Third cross interrogatory: \u201cWhat was the consideration of the said assignment? Was any actual valuable consideration given for said claim by the plaintiff?\u201d Objected to as immaterial, the assignment being in writing. Objection sustained. Defendant\u2019s Attorney: \u201cX offer this for the purpose of showing that Mr. Itoessle is an interested witness, and the jury are to take that into consideration in determining the-credibility that should be given to his testimony that was allowed to-day.\u201d Objection sustained. Exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The only question urged by the appellant is that his statement as to why he put the third cross interrogatory should be embodied in the case. The trial judge, in denying appellant\u2019s motion to resettle the-case by inserting the foregoing statement, made the following memorandum :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\u201cThe proposed case does not correctly state the fact. The language used was, T offered it,\u2019 not \u2018I offer this.\u2019 The language as used was mere argument on the part of counsel, and not an offer of proof ruled on by the court;, hence has no place in the case on appeal.\u201d Motion to resettle case denied, without costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The appellant, at folio 15 of the \u201ccase,\u201d disclaims any intention to-impeach the validity of the assignment; and, as there is nothing in the case before us to show that the witness testified to anything: other than making and executing the assignment (which was admitted' without objection, and conceded to be valid between the parties before the trial), we cannot see how his interests, if any, could affect the-case. If the record showed that he had testified to some material fact that was in issue on the trial, there would be some force in the position of counsel, as in the case of Elliott v. Luengene, 20 Misc. Rep. 18, 44 N. Y. Supp. 775. The court, in his memorandum denying the motion, states that the words sought to be put in the case were spoken by counsel by way of argument or explanation only, and not an offer to prove, and were not ruled upon. It follows that the order appealed, from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">FITZSIMORS, O. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
