This interference with the receiver in his possession of the property was a contempt, .and, after a careful examination of the proofs submitted to the court below, we are satisfied that the order was fully justified, the punishment imposed richly merited, and that the order, so far as it affects this appellant, Weinberg, should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">A careful examination of the record upon the appeal of Mr. Elias \u2022does not disclose to our satisfaction such an interference with the rights of the receiver as to amount to a contempt, and justify the order adjudging him guilty thereof. It follows that so much of the order appealed from as affects M. Angelo Elias should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">CONLAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
