The accident occurred between 3 and 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Plaintiff claimed to have looked up and down the street prior to crossing, but did not observe the approaching vehicle. Some witnesses testified that they saw the carriage 250 feet away before striking plaintiff. The evidence as to the rate of speed of the carriage' was conflicting. The driver testified that plaintiff was crossing the street in a hesitating manner, and not observing his approach, and that she ran into the side of the forward wheel while he turned his horses towards the side of the street so as to avoid her. <em>Held, </em>that she was guilty of contributory negligence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b611-8\">Appeal from special term, Saratoga county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-9\">Action by Agnes Fuller against Aaron M.

The accident happened near the intersection of Central avenue and Quail street, in the city of Albany. Central avenue runs east and west, and is intersected by Quail street, running north and south. The defendant\u2019s horse and carriage, in charge of a driver in his employ, who was accompanied by defendant\u2019s sister, was driving from the east towards the west. The plaintiff was on the south side of Central avenue, just west of Quail street. She started to cross to the north side of Central avenue. She says that before she attempted to cross the street she stood on the curb, and looked both ways, and saw nothing in the street but an electric car, over two blocks away; that, after she got across one of the tracks of the surface railroad running through Central avenue, she again looked both ways, and saw nothing; that she looked straight across where she was going; and says, \u201cAid when I got a few steps over the last track, something buzzed by me as quick as lightning, and struck me in my right hip, and knocked me down.\u201d The time was between 3 and 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of March 15, 1897. It was clear, and there appears to have been nothing in the street to obstruct her view. Some of the witnesses testified that they saw the horse and carriage at a distance of over 250 feet away before it struck the plaintiff, and it seems almost incredible that, if the plaintiff was exercising her faculties, she should not have seen the horse and carriage until it struck her. Some evidence was given tending to show that the horse was going at extraordinary speed, one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testifying that he was going at the rate of a mile in three minutes. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>testimony upon the part of the occupants of the carriage was that it was going at a slow rate. This seems to be corroborated by the fact that the horse was stopped almost immediately by a man stepping from the sidewalk, and catching hold of its head. The witnesses upon, the part of the plaintiff, who saw the accident, were on the north side of Central avenue, the horse and buggy being between them and the plaintiff. They testified that she was struck with the forward wheel, knocked down, and run over by the hind wheel of the buggy; that she was not struck by the horse, but came in contact with the tire of the wheel, or the side of the wheel. One of them says: \u201cI could not express how that was done. She was not behind the horse. I don\u2019t know that she could be struck by the tire of the wheel. She came in contact with the side of the wheel.\u201d Another witness, after stating that she was struck by the .forward wheel, in answer to a question of the court as to what part of the wheel struck the woman, said, \u201cWell, I should judge the hub of the wagon struck the woman on the side of the hip,\u201d which answer was repeated upon his cross-examination. Another witness who testified to seeing the accident said: \u201cI saw the tire come upright against her clothes, strike her plain. I could see between the horse and wagon. There was a little space. I could see very plainly from where I stood. The front forward wheel struck her, and I thought the tire hit her as well as the wheel.\u201d And, again: \u201cI think the front of the wheel touched her dress. I couldn\u2019t swear that it struck her bad, but I know it run against her dress. It went on until the hub reached her, and then she keeled over.\u201d Upon the part of the defendant, a witness who stood on the south side of Central avenue, with nothing between himself and the plaintiff and the horse and buggy, testified that he saw the plaintiff going across the street. \u201cThe lady got pretty near across, when she walked right in the horse; that is, right into the wagon, pretty near. Her dress caught, I guess, by the front wheel, a little; and the man tried to stop the horse. He seen, by the looks of it, he must have seen the lady, and the lady must have walked blindly right ahead.\u201d Again: \u201cI watched the woman going across Central avenue, But could not tell whether she looked toward the horse. She walked straight across, and the horse had passed her before she struck the wagon. She walked across Central avenue from the south side to the north, and right against the wagon there, as far as I noticed. After she struck the wagon, the horse didn\u2019t go at all. I think the man tried to stop before he met this woman. He did not entirely stop the lorse before the woman struck the wagon, but nearly did so.\u201d The driver of the horse states that he saw the plaintiff, and that she was grossing the street irregularly. \u201cShe started then kind of across Central avenue, then bore down, and I saw she was going to run into the horse. Her head was turned at the same time up Central avenue, and she wasn\u2019t looking at me, and I saw she was going to run into the horse, and I stopped still, and I saw then, when I stopped, she was going to run, I thought, right in front of the forward wheel, and I turned the horse so the horse\u2019s front feet were up on the sidewalk, and she run right into the side of the forward wheel.\u201d The defendant\u2019s sister, who was an occupant of the wagon, says in regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>to </em>the plaintiff: \u201cI saw her coming, and the driver did, and he stopped the horse. Her course was uncertain, and when we saw she was coming directly towards us, he turned the horse a little, to prevent her from running into the horse, and she ran into the wheel. He turned the horse toward the curb.\u201d And again she stated: <em>\u201cI </em>reached out my hand to keep her from coming against the wheel, but couldn\u2019t reach quite far enough to push her from the wheel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">My conclusion, after reading over all the testimony, is that the plaintiff blindly ran into the side of the wagon. Her manner of crossing the street is summed up in the statement of one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses: \u201cThe old lady was coming right across the street at the time she was struck. She wasn\u2019t observing nobody when she was struck. She was minding her own business, going right across that way.\u201d It seems to me impossible that, if she had been using her eyes and ears, as a person should do in crossing a city street, she should not have seen this horse and wagon approaching; and that, if she had been so using her senses, she would know of its approach before it struck her, as she insists, or before she ran into it, as the evidence seems to indicate. I am therefore of the opinion that, so far from showing the absence of contributory negligence, the evidence shows its presence, and that, therefore, the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
