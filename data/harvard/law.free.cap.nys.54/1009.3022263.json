As the written complaint in the case discloses, the action is strictly one for the foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien. \u00a1No claim is made in the complaint against the defendant Maison, who was the owner, based upon any promise on his part to pay the amount claimed by the plaintiff, although evidence was admitted by the justice tending to show that such a promise had been made. The plaintiff must therefore rely for his recovery solely upon the agreement that was made between himself and Cornelisse, who was the principal contractor, and he cannot recover more than was due from the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>to such contractor at the time that the lien was filed. As far as the evidence in the case disclosed anything upon the subject, it would seem, to be plain that at that time there was not over $30 so due. The-justice, however, has awarded judgment in favor of the plaintiff for twice that sum. This was error which is fatal to the judgment, making a new trial necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
