M. Parsons and William H. O\u2019Dwyer; and when the money is raised I am to be consulted about the adjusting and arranging the papers connected with the mortgage, etc. This 16th day of December, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-5\">\u201cElizabeth G. Horn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">At the time above mentioned the defendant was the owner and holder of the mortgage referred to, and the contemplated loan was to be made for the accommodation of said Parsons, her son-in-law, who had arranged to go into business with O\u2019Dwyer, the person alluded to in the paper. Such arrangement, however, fell through, in consequence of the defendant\u2019s refusal to borrow the money, for the reasons, as stated in Parsons\u2019 letter to the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-7\">\u201cThat the loan was not for her benefit; that misrepresentations had been made to her as to the use of the money, thereby making the security offered her for the same worthless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s version as to the delivery to him by Parsons of the instrument above set forth was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-9\">\u201cAfter getting the loan from Mr. Jackson, I reported to Mr. Parsons that I had the loan placed, but I wanted some security, and I wanted to see the person that was to advance it; and he said it was not necessary, because he was doing all of Mrs. Horn\u2019s legal business, and he was her legal representative, and whatever he said went.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">In Jones, Ev. \u00a7 359, the rule is stated to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-11\">\u201cThat it is an indispensable requisite to the admission of the declarations of an agent as part of the res gestee that such agency or authority be first proved. Such agency cannot be proved by the declarations themselves, no matter how publicly made; nor by such declarations accompanied by acts purporting to be in behalf of the principal, unless they are brought to his knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">In the present case the agency of Parsons is solely relied upon to \u25a0establish a promise, if any, on the part of the defendant to pay plaintiff the sum in suit; and the only testimony offered with respect thereto was in the form of th\u00e9se alleged declarations, the making of which is denied. There was no proof that the defendant was ever informed that these declarations had been made, and knowledge thereof cannot in any way be fairly imputed to her, in view of the uncontradicted evidence that the parties litigant never met until the trial, that the contemplated loan was to be made solely for the benefit of Parsons, and \u2022that the writing in question expressly provides for the payment by the latter and by O\u2019Dwyer of all expenses connected therewith, not exceeding the sum stated. Viewed in this aspect, the agency of Parsons was not established, and his alleged declarations, therefore, were not binding upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">The only conclusion to be drawn is that the judgment is not supported by the evidence, and, consequently, it must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All \u2022concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
