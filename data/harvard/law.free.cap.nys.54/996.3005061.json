The postal card written to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor by the-' teller of the bank wherein deposit of this check was made, to the-effect that the drawers had closed their account the day before the-check was dated, and the teller\u2019s memorandum attached to such check, that it was returned by the drawee for the same reason, admitted in, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>\u2022evidence against the appellants\u2019 objections and exceptions, were not competent evidence of the matters therein stated.

Such proof could only be made by the oral testimony of living witnesses, or by other recognized modes of establishing facts, and the evidence so received was hearsay and wholly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">There being a total failure of proof in respect to material allegations of the complaint, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
