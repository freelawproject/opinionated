The complaint set forth the items of such claim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-12\">Furnished room two weeks, at $3.00............................... $ 6 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-13\">Paid Doctor Campbell, one visit................................... 5 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s services (two full days) getting doctor, medicines, 3 calls</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-15\">on defendant, &amp;c., &amp;c........................................... 25 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-16\">Paid for preparing room as requested, whitewashing, papering, &amp;c... 20 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-17\">Paid for medicines as per prescriptions............................

The answer of the defendant was a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-26\">The plaintiff during the period in question was engaged in letting furnished rooms, and the deceased, who occupied one of such rooms, was suffering from consumption. The testimony introduced in plaintiff\u2019s behalf tended to show that on June 7, 1892, one Campbell, a physician, advised the removal of the deceased to an hospital or home,\u2014 a suggestion which the defendant would not adopt,\u2014and a conversation ensued, which is detailed by the witnesses as follows: The plaintiff testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-27\">\u201cDr. Campbell suggested that the sick man have better rooms, and be nursed; he wanted to move him from the house. Francis Seagrist said: \u2018Leave him here. I will pay for it. I am responsible.\u2019 He said: T will pay for all expenses.\u2019 On account of that, we did not move him, but left him at the house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>-s * \u00bb He said the same expressly in the presence of the doctor, my wife, and his uncle,\u2014that he would be responsible for the amount which it cost. * * He said: \u2018Let me make the old man as comfortable as possible. I am responsible.\u2019 We expected his death every hour.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">According to Mrs. Knauer, the wife of the plaintiff, the defendant expressed the desire that his uncle be made as comfortable as possible, and that she should \u201cgive him all he needed; that he would pay all the bills, and be responsible.\u201d Dr. Campbell\u2019s testimony is to the effect that he advised the removal of the defendant\u2019s uncle to a hospital or home, and the defendant said, \u201cNo; he could be taken care of there, and he would be responsible.\u201d The defendant, who testified in his own behalf, pronounced the testimony of these witnesses regarding such alleged promise as false; and he further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">\u201cI asked Dr. Campbell who gave him orders to go there. He said, \u2018Mr. Knauer.\u2019 I said, \u2018How much are you out, up to the present time? I did not order you, and I have no business to pay anything.\u2019 He said, \u2018$10.\u2019 I said that \u2018I don\u2019t want, on my account, or anybody else, to pay any more money.\u2019 I paid him $10.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">In respect to the payment of the sum just mentioned the defendant is corroborated by Dr. Campbell, who testified \u201cthat Mrs. Knauer paid for the first visit he made there, and when Mr. Seagrist paid him $10 he paid that back.\u201d The repayment of said sum was not denied by the plaintiff, and therefore it was clearly an error to include this amount, or any part thereof, in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Conceding that the alleged conversation of June 7, 1892, can be construed as an agreement on the part of the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for the services which he might thereafter render to the deceased, and reimburse him for any moneys he might expend for the trained nurse, medicines, stimulants, and food, still the judgment, with respect to the items included therein, is not supported by any competent evidence. The only proof offered in relation thereto is to be found in plaintiff\u2019s testimony, as follows: \u201cQ. Look at the complaint, and say if that contains a statement of what is due you from the defendant. Eead the items.\u201d The paper was then handed to the witness, w\u2019ho, after reading the items set forth in the complaint, was further interrogated: \u201cQ. Amounting in all to how much? A. To $281.75.\u201d Here certainly there was no proof that any services whatever were rendered by the plaintiff, or that he expended any of the sums so read off by him, except the item of $135 for nurse hire; but as the record fails to disclose any evidence of the rendition of the services, and whether the sum so paid was the agreed price or reasonable value thereof, the proof in this regard was likewise insufficient; and it follows that the justice erred in allowing this item, as well as all the other items for such alleged services and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">The scraping of the walls of the room which the deceased had occupied, and their repainting, and the destruction of the carpet and bedding, unquestionably, were wise sanitary precautions; but, in the absence of more satisfactory testimony, we cannot say that it could be reasonably inferred from the conversation above noted that the defendant agreed to pay for such repairs, and for the property so de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>stroyed. At all events, as neither the nature nor value of the same was shown, the items should have been disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">As the record does not contain any competent evidence in support of the judgment, it follows that a new trial must be ordered. The case seems to have been tried by the plaintiff upon the assumption that the rendition of the services, and the reasonable value thereof, and the expenditure of moneys for the benefit of the deceased, and the reasonableness of the items therefor, were not disputed by the defendant, although formally put in issue by the pleadings; but the return fails to show that such was the understanding of the parties when the cause was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
