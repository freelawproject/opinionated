It has been repeatedly held in this court and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>court of common pleas with respect to such appeals as this that the appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of the trial justice, except under conditions which are not disclosed by the record here. Morgan v. Enright, 22 Misc. Rep. 737, 49 N. Y. Supp. 1106; Conroy v. Allen, 23 Misc. Rep. 125, 50 N. Y. Supp. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The rule laid down in that regard has special application here, inasmuch as the credibility of the witnesses was the determinative factor in ascertaining the facts of the case. It is peculiarly the function of the trial justice to pass upon this question, and, for the reasons stated in the authorities, it is seldom practicable for the appellate court to review his decision upon it. Conroy v. Allen, supra; Felbel v. Kahn, 29 App. Div. 270, 51 N. Y. Supp. 435. The facts having been found in favor of the plaintiff, they were sufficient, as matter of law, to support a judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
