The reason for the slackening of the speed of the car at the time is entirely accounted for by another cause than anticipation of passengers; it may have been on account of the crossing of another railroad. We think that, before the defendant\u2019s servants can be charged with negligence, they should have been either fairly apprised that the plaintiff desired to board the car, or that the situation was such that passengers might be naturally expected to get upon the car \u2022at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; \u25a0costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
