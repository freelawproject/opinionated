Judgment for possession and for costs against all the defendants was entered, and the judgment roll filed, February 18, 1895. Execution for the costs was levied on the right, title, and interest of defendants in the premises in controversy in the ejectment suits, which were sold thereunder to plaintiff, and subsequently conveyed to him by the sheriff. From an order, dated March 14, 1898, on a motion for a new trial, on behalf of defendant Joseph P. Keenan, an infant, by defendant Eleanor Keenan, his mother and next friend, argued and submitted on February 14, 1898, vacating said judgment of February 18, 1895, and granting to said infant defendant a new trial on payment by him to plaintiff of the costs awarded in said action, \u201cwithin thirty days from the date of the entry of this order,\u201d and also from two orders, dated, respectively, April 20, 1898 (amended May 2, 1898), and April 25, 1898, extending the time for the payment of said costs, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AgG\">Order for new trial modified and affirmed, and orders extending time reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b305-14\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

That was within the three years. The order, however, should simply have followed the statute. It must accordingly be modified by striking therefrom the words \u201cwithin thirty days from the date of the entry of this order,\u201d and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs of the appeal from such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">The order of April 20, 1898, as amended by the order of May 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>1898, and the order of April 25, 1898, are reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal (one bill), and the defendants\u2019 motion to extend the time for the payment of the costs referred to in the order of March 14, 1898, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
