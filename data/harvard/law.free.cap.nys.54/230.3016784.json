The plaintiffs used the greater part of the inside of the building for their busine'ss as dealers in wood and willow ware. At the rear of the building on one street was a platform or stoop, even with the ground floor, part of which was rented by the plaintiffs to one Sehomaker, a dealer in garden truck, for the purpose of displaying and selling his goods. He occupied the platform from 2 o\u2019clock in the morning until about 10 o\u2019clock in the forenoon; and at the earlier hour, it being necessary to have a light, for some days prior to the fire, he had used a gasoline lamp for that purpose, the lamp being placed upon a nail driven into the outside wall of the building. By the terms of the policy the company insured the plaintiffs on their \u201cstock of wood and willow ware * * * contained in the brick building,\u201d and the policy contained a privilege and a prohibition as follows: \u201cPrivilege to use electric lights in the above-mentioned premises,\u201d and a prohibition that there should not \u201cbe kept, used, or allowed on the above-described premises,\u201d among other things, \u201cgasoline.\u201d The fire having occurred, this action was brought to recover the amount of the loss, and the defense was that the policy became void because the plaintiffs had allowed gasoline to be used for lighting purposes, the explosion of which had caused the fire and loss. \"Upon the close of the evidence a motion was made to dismiss the complaint, which was granted, and an exception taken thereto, and from the judgment thereafter entered this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b249-7\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The serious question arises as to the construction of the terms of the policy, the plaintiffs contending that the sole subject of the insurance was the \u201cstock of wood and willow ware,\u201d etc., which was within the building, and not the building itself; and that the placing of a gasoline lamp upon the exterior wall of the building within which the stock was contained was not within the prohibitory clause of the policy; while the respondent is equally strenuous in claiming that the use of a gasoline lamp in the manner described, causing the \u00f1re as it subsequently did, was prohibited by the policy. It will therefore be seen that the question presented as to the true construction of the terms of the policy is narrowed down to a determination of what was meant by the statement that the insurance covered \u201cthe stock of wood and willow ware,\u201d etc., \u201ccontained in the brick building.\u201d If this was the only one of the terms of the policy to be construed, there would be force in the contention that, as the premises were not insured by the defendant, but only the goods within the building, the purpose of the policy was merely to cover and deal with the stock within the building. The force, however, of this construction is destroyed when we consider the two clauses of the policy already quoted in reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>to lighting; the first granting a privilege of using electric lights, and the other forbidding gasoline for lighting purposes. There is no doubt that in both these clauses reference is made, not only to the interior, but to the entire building so far as used and controlled by the plaintiffs; and it is apparent that the use of- the word \u201cpremises\u201d in the privilege clause is equivalent to the word \u201cbuilding\u201d in the prohibitory clause. In the latter clause the policy provides: \u201cBut if illuminating gas or vapor be generated in the described building (or adjacent thereto) for use therein, or if (any usage or custom of trade or manufacture to the contrary notwithstanding) there be kept, used, or allowed on the above-described premises,\u201d among others enumerated, \u201cgasoline,\u201d the policy shall be void. The plaintiffs, thus having control of the premises, which included the building, were placed under the obligation of seeing that no gasoline was used in violation of the terms of the policy. Yet they leased the platform at the rear of the building to a man who, for some time prior to the fire, used a gasoline lamp, resulting in the very consequence which the underwriter had stipulated against. The fact that the plaintiffs claim not to have known that the gasoline lamp was used is no defense, their ignorance being no excuse for failing to keep the obligation they assumed of seeing to it that no gasoline was used on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We think that the disposition made by the trial judge was right, and the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
