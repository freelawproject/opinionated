It was entirely competent for the parties to enter into an arrangement for separate loans upon different articles, and such a transaction is not open to attack on the ground of usury, unless it is made to appear that it was merely colorable and a device to evade the statute. This, I think, the plaintiff has failed to show. Where a transaction may be open to two constructions, the court will prefer the one which imports an innocent purpose, rather than that which bespeaks a guilty one. Upon the whole evidence, as it seems to me, the most favorable view that could be taken for the plaintiff is that the proofs are evenly balanced; but even then there must be judgment against him, because of a lack of preponderance in his favor. Had the two loans been simultaneously made, each on all of the articles pawned, a different case would have been presented. It follows that there must be a judgment for the defendant, dismissing the complaint.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1058-14\">Argued before BARRETT, EUMSEY, McLAUGHLIN, and INGRAHAM, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1058-15\">A.
