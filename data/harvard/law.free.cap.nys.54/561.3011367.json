It is admitted that the roof leaked, and on February 6, 1896, the plaintiffs notified the defendant of that fact. It then became the duty of the defendant to make all necessary repairs, so as to avoid damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property by bad weather. The defendant\u2019s contention is that such repairs were done, and the roof made secure and sound. The plaintiffs\u2019 testimony is that the roof could not have received proper and necessary attention, because the roofer who was sent to make the repairs spent only a few minutes upon the roof, and that he only used paint skins to fill up the holes. Having heard this testimony, it was. the duty of the jury to determine who told the truth. If they determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 witness testified truthfully, then the defendant certainly failed in performing the duty, cast upon it by the lease, to do all necessary repairs to the roof after receiving notice of its defective condition; and any damage resulting to the plaintiff because of such condition would leave the defendant liable to the plaintiffs therefor. Evidently the jury did believe the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses and disbelieved those produced by the defendant, which, of course, they had a right to do. They must also have believed that leaks in the roof, and not the breaks in the skylight door, let in the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Under these circumstances the jury were justified in giving a verdict for the plaintiff. The evidence sustains the verdict, and it is not excessive. It must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
