The relator applied to the respondents for such appointment, and, in connection with .his application, submitted his affidavit, stating in detail his qualifications, and the fact that he wqs an honorably discharged Union soldier of the late Oivil War. The board of trustees did not appoint the relator, but did appoint the respondent James W. Fitzpatrick. This appeal is from an order awarding an alternative writ of mandamus. The affidavits on the part of the respondents allege that they are advised that chapter 821 of the Laws of 1896 does not apply to an appointment of a member of the board of health; that Wendell W. Wheeler, an honorably discharged Union soldier, also applied for the appointment; that the relator had previously held the said office, and had not properly performed its duties, and was incompetent; and that the board of trustees had appointed Fitzpatrick because they deemed him better qualified to perform its duties.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1101-11\">Argued before PARKER, P.

The public health law (chapter 25, Gen. Laws 1893) provides for the creation of local boards of health, and prescribes their powers and duties. In villages the members of the board of health, not less than three nor .more than seven, must be appointed by the board of trustees of the village. Sections 20, 21, art. 2, of the act. Such boards of health are independent departments, clothed with large powers. It is obvious that the department will not, in fact, exist until it is constituted by the appointment of the requisite members of the board of health. Being thus constituted, then appointments can be made in the department, and not until then. The statute gives preference in appointment in the department to honorably discharged Union soldiers, not a preference in the appointment of the heads of the department. People v. Morton, 148 N. Y. 162, 42 N. E. 538; People v. Mayor, etc., of City of Yonkers (Sup.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 455; People v. Goetting (Sup.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 742. The direction of a department of the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>is one thing, the execution of the directions given by it is another; and the statute cited relates to the latter function. _ '\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">_ The order should be reversed, with $10 costs, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur, except PUTNAM, J., not acting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
