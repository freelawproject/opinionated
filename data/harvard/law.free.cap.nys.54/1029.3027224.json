The defendant is an \u25a0attorney at law, and the action was for a conversion of money collected by defendant for plaintiff in another action. This action was \u25a0commenced on April 14, 1898, and tried on May 18th. Subsequent to the transaction in which defendant collected the money in question, and before the commencement of this action, plaintiff became insolvent, and this money, so collected by defendant for plaintiff, was discovered in supplementary proceedings. The court thereupon appointed a receiver of the property of the plaintiff herein, and restrainedo the said plaintiff, and all persons except the receiver, from interfering with said money. The order appointing the receiver was filed and recorded on February 15,1898, and the receiver duly qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>At the opening of the trial herein, the defendant\u2019s attorney stated to the court that the defendant had been served with an order appointing a receiver for the moneys claimed in the action, and that the order enjoined both plaintiff and defendant from any interference with or transfer of the money, and said attorney added, \u201cI submit this certified copy of the order to the court.\u201d He then moved that, for that reason, the case be dismissed. The court denied the motion, and directed the trial to proceed, saying, \u201cIf judgment is rendered against you [defendant], you can turn the money over to the receiver.\u201d We think this ruling was error. The order appointing a receiver, though annexed to the return, does not seem to have been marked in evidence. It was, however, treated by the court as properly in evidence, its effect was commented upon by the learned justice, and we must regard it as a part of the record that we are reviewing. It therefore clearly appears that the plaintiff was not the real party in interest, and was without power to prosecute the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
