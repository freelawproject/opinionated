Leggett and others against one Henry Tiesing. The property in question belonged to the latter until the 22d day of January, 1898, on which, day, according to the plaintiff, it was transferred, together with other chattels, to one William H. Johnson, who shortly thereafter sold and delivered the same to plaintiff for a valuable consideration. The defendant insists that such transfers were fraudulent and void as against the creditors, but there was sufficient evidence from which the trial justice could infer that the chattels were sold for a valuable consideration to the plaintiff, who immediately took them into his actual possession, and so continued to hold them until they were seized by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">As the question of fraudulent intent in all cases arising under chapter . 7, pt. 2, tit. 3, \u00a7 4, Bev. St., \u201cshall be deemed a question of fact, and not of law,\u201d the trial justice\u2019s finding with respect thereto, as well as upon the bona fides of the transaction, should not be disturbed; he being in a better position to determine the weight to be given the evidence from observing the witnesses while on the stand and the manner in which they gave their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">Again, the defendant insists that error is predicable upon the admission of testimony touching the ownership of the chattels in dispute, elicited in response to the following questions put to the witness Tie-sing: \u201cWho owned the horse and wagon, if you know?\u201d and \u201cWho \u25a0 owned them?\u201d These were objected to on the ground that they called for a conclusion, and, the objection being overruled under exception, the witness answered that the plaintiff was the owner of them. A question of similar purport was put to a witness in De Wolf v. Williams, 69 N. Y. 621, and the court held \u201cthat the title to the property was ordinarily a simple fact, to which a witness having the requisite knowledge could testify directly.\u201d The principle thus enunciated was applied in the case of Laserowitsch v. Reiman, 6 N. Y. St. Rep. 246, 247, wherein Larremore, O. J., speaking for the court, held that the objection raised to the question, \u201cTo whom does that ring belong?\u201d constituted no ground of error. As the witness possessed the requisite knowledge upon the subject, the questions and answers were therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">Another exception urged by appellant relates to the ruling of the justice in admitting testimony of the amount paid by the plaintiff for the chattels in suit, but, as the reasonable value of each of the same at the time of the alleged conversion was subsequently fully established by the opinions of experts called as witnesses, the error, if any, was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>The question put to the defendant on cross-examination, whether he had handed over any part of the moneys realized on the sale of the chattels in question, was, in my opinion, proper, in view of his testimony that the same were sold at public auction for $54,\u2014a sum, as seen, considerably in excess of the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Ho questions, other than those above considered, have been presented for our review, and, being satisfied from a careful consideration of the evidence that the decision of the trial justice was in all respects correct, we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
