A wife charges her husband\u2019s uncle with alienating her husband\u2019s affection and breaking up her home. There is no impropriety alleged other than a continued depreciation of the plaintiff as a wife. Such a complaint must be- made out by proof, presumably, of many instances, and probably on many occasions,\u2014here a little and there a little. The general allegation is made: \u201cYou depreciated me to my husband, and destroyed my happiness.\" Such, a- general charge can be easily met. Motion denied, with $10 costs to abide- the event.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1092-15\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
