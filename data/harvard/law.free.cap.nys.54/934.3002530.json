The action was brought to recover upon five promissory notes, each for the sum of $400, dated February 23, 1897, made by the defendant to his own order, indorsed by him in blank, and delivered to the Preservaline Manufacturing Company, and by one Maximilian Calm, the secretary and treasurer of that company, delivered, without indorsement, to the plaintiff. The defendant, besides setting up other defenses, to which it is unnecessary to refer, pleads in hi's answer that the plaintiff is not the lawful owner and holder of the notes, that he has no interest therein, and that the Preservaline Company is the owner and holder of -them. Upon the cross-examination of tiie said Calm, a witness for the plaintiff, testimony was elicited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>to the effect that the notes became due on June 15, 1897; that on that day, at 11 o\u2019clock in the morning, he personally presented them, and payment was refused; and that thereafter, at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day, he transferred the notes, by delivery without indorsement, to the plaintiff. Then Mr. Calm testified in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-5\">\u201cMr. Barkley [the plaintiff] is a friend of mine. He is employed by me. He is an acquaintance. He gave me nothing for the notes. I gave them to him in order to bring a short-cause suit, or for collection, by cthe advice of our lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">It will be noticed that there was no indorsement of the notes over to the plaintiff, nor any proof of authority from their owner, the Preservaline Company, for their delivery to the plaintiff, other than would be presumed to be vested in Mr. Calm, the company\u2019s secretary and treasurer. We think that the learned justice erred in not dismissing the complaint, because it appeared, as above outlined, from the plaintiff\u2019s case, that he was not either the real party in interest, or the trustee of an express trust (section 449 of the Code); nor is it beyond possibility that the judgment herein would fail to hold the defendant safe from a suit upon these notes by the Preservaline Company, which might, for all the proofs herein show to the contrary, successfully claim that the delivery of its notes to the plaintiff was made without its authority. To enable an agent to maintain an action in his own name, there must be something more than the mere powers of a naked agent. Bell v. Tilden, 16 Hun, 346; Iselin v. Rowlands, 30 Hun, 488; Hays v. Hathorn, 74 N. Y. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">The judgment and ordered appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">SCHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
