It will be borne in mind that these would be affirmative defenses, and the burden of proving them, therefore, on the defendant. The theory on which the evidence was received and submitted to the jury evidently was that the defendant had partly paid the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to the extent of $240. This appears from the judge\u2019s charge: \u201cIf you conclude that they had money which should be to the credit of the account, $240, then your verdict should be in their [plaintiffs\u2019] favor for the sum of five hundred and sixty dollars.\u201d There is no evidence in the case which pretends to support this theory. There is no evidence whatever that the defendant ever paid to the plaintiffs the sum of .$240, or any other sum, on account of the claim in suit. There is no evidence that this $240, which plaintiffs admit they had at some time or other in their hands, belonging to the defendant, had ever been appropriated by the plaintiffs in part payment of their claim.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>or that the defendant had ever authorized or directed that it be so appropriated. On the contrary, the evidence is that the plaintiffs had $240 in their hands belonging to the defendant. The evidence that this $240 \u201cbelonged\u201d to the defendant is inconsistent with the contention that it had been paid to the plaintiffs in part payment of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">FITZSniONS, C. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
