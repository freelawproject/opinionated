Applying provisions of the statute which pertained when Kossman <em>lodged </em>his claim, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), acting through the Commissioner, and, later, the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board (MVDB) determined that Kossman did not qualify for relief. Kossman sought judicial review in accordance with the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), arguing that his claim was governed by former Code \u00a7 46.2-1523, the statute in effect upon the <em>accrual </em>of his cause of action. The trial court, however, affirmed the agency decision, and Kossman appeals. Finding no error, we affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">\n<em>I. FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The substantive facts are uncontroverted. In January 1993, Kossman loaned $75,000 to Edward J. Souldourian, a licensed motor vehicle salesperson, to finance the purchase of motor vehicles for resale. When Souldourian defaulted in the terms of repayment, Kossman obtained judgment on October 17, 1994, for Souldourian\u2019s \u201cfraudulent\u201d conduct. Kossman thereafter pursued recovery for his loss from the Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund, Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1527.1 to -1527.8, through a letter claim dated December 5,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1522 to -1527 were the predecessor statutes to Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1527.1 to -1527.8. Former Code \u00a7 46.2-1523 provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag2\">any person ... awarded a <em>final judgment </em>in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth for any loss or damage by reason of any fraud practiced on him or fraudulent representation made to him by a licensed or registered motor vehicle dealer or one of a dealer\u2019s salespersons acting for the dealer or within the scope of his employment, or for any loss or damage by reason of the violation by a dealer or salesperson of any of the provisions of this chapter in connection with the purchase of a motor vehicle on or after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>January 1, 1989, ... may file a verified <em>claim </em>with the Commissioner, requesting payment from the Fund of the amount unpaid on the <em>judgment. </em>The <em>claim </em>shall be filed with the Commissioner no sooner than thirty days and no later than twelve months after <em>the judgment </em>becomes final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avr\">(Emphasis added.) The General Assembly repealed Code \u00a7 46.2-1523, enacting Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3, <em>see </em>1994 Va. Acts, ch. 478, effective <em>April 8, 1994, </em>which directed that \u201cthe Commissioner ... only consider for payment, claims submitted by retail purchasers of motor vehicles, and for purchases of motor vehicles by licensed or registered motor vehicle dealers who contribute to the Fund.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Acting on Kossman\u2019s claim of December 5, 1994, the Commissioner applied Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 and denied Kossman relief. In correspondence dated March 14, 1996, Kossman requested reconsideration, contending that his claim was controlled by the former statute, in effect \u201cat the time the fraud was committed,\u201d which did not contain the exclusionary language of Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3. In response, the MVDB <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> noted the distinctions between the current and former statutes and applied Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 to determine that Kossman was not a qualified claimant, a decision affirmed by the trial court on Kossman\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. Kossman again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>appeals, arguing that his claim is governed by the statute in effect when his cause of action against Souldourian first arose, former Code \u00a7 46.2-1523, and that application of Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 deprives him of a \u201csubstantive property right\u201d without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">\n<em>II. RECOVERY FROM THE FUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">On appeal of agency action governed by the VAPA, the reviewing court must defer to the agency resolution of factual issues, \u201cascertaining [only] whether there was substantial evidence in the ... record upon which the agency as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. \u201cIn contrast, judicial review of a \u2018legal issue\u2019 requires \u2018little deference,\u2019 unless it ... \u2018falls within an agency\u2019s area of particular expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. State Water Control Bd., </em>15 Va.App. 271, 278, 422 S.E.2d 608, 612 (1992) (quoting <em>Johnston-Willis Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 243-46, 369 S.E.2d 1, 8 (1988)). This principle \u201crecognizes the \u2018special competence\u2019 of the judiciary to decide issues of \u2018common law,\u2019 \u2018constitutional law\u2019 or \u2018statutory interpretation,\u2019 distinct from \u2018findings of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va.App. at 243-46, 369 S.E.2d at 8). The party complaining of agency action must \u201cdemonstrate an error of law\u201d subject to judicial review. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\u201cWhen the wording of a statute is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning is- to be accepted without resort to rules of interpretation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy v. May Bros., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 118, 396 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1990). The legislature, in enacting both Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1523 and 46.2-1527.3, established the \u201cFund,\u201d designating it a \u201cspecial fund\u201d \u201cto pay claims\u201d arising from \u201cunpaid judgments, as provided for in \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 [former 46.2-1523],\u201d and \u201cfor no other purpose.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1522, -1527.1. A claim cognizable under either statute was predicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>ed upon \u201ca final judgment [awarded] in a court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d and could not be filed \u201csooner than thirty days ... after the judgment becomes final.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1523, -1527.3. Thus, Kossman\u2019s statutory claim against the Fund was not extant until judgment against Souldourian on October 17, 1994, a time clearly governed by Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3, effective April 8,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Kossman\u2019s contention that application of Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 to bar his claim deprived him of a \u201cvested right\u201d in violation of due process is without merit. \u201c[D]eprivation of a liberty or property interest\u201d must be proven to implicate due process. <em>Jackson v. W., </em>14 Va.App. 391, 406, 419 S.E.2d 385, 393 (1992). The repeal of Code \u00a7 46.2-1523 did not impair Kossman\u2019s cause of action against <em>Souldourian </em>for fraud, and the dependent statutory claim against <em>the Fund </em>did not arise until after the effective date of Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3. Thus, no proprietary interest of Kossman to claim against the Fund was compromised by either the legislative or administrative acts in issue. <em>See, e.g., Roller v. Basic Constr. Co., </em>238 Va. 321, 328-30, 384 S.E.2d 323, 326-27 (1989) (rights of parties not fixed under Workers\u2019 Compensation Act until occurrence of \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d and thus prior amendment did not affect substantive or vested right).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Accordingly, Kossman\u2019s claim was properly denied pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3, and we affirm the order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-5\">. Kossman concedes that he would not qualify for relief pursuant to the amended statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\">. Effective January 1, 1996, the legislature vested the MVDB with responsibility to administer Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1527.1 to -1527.8. <em>See </em>1995 Va. Acts, chs. 767, 816.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. Appellees contend that Kossman\u2019s failure to properly perfect an appeal of the original ruling of the Commissioner in accordance with Rule 2A:2 precluded judicial review of the administrative decision, notwithstanding his subsequent request for reconsideration and the attendant ruling of the MVDB.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Rule 2A:2 provides for appeal of the \"final order in the case decision\u201d to the appropriate circuit court. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4 defines \u201ccase decision\u201d as \"any agency proceeding or determination that ... a named party ... is not ... in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining ... [a] right or benefit.\u201d Under the instant circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the MVDB decision of March 22, 1996, was the \u201cfinal order in the case decision,\u201d which Kossman timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
