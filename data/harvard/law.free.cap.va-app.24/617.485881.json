Nunery\u2019s (Nunery) unemployment benefits by the retroactive lump sum payment of social security disability benefits she received. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">The facts are uncontested. During the period of October 4, 1992, through March 19,1994, Nunery received unemployment benefits in the amount of $208 per week. On June 10, 1993, Nunery applied for social security disability benefits (social security benefits). Her claim was initially denied, but on January 11, 1995, an administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration found that she was entitled to social security benefits for the period of May 1, 1992, through February 22, 1994, and for supplemental security income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>benefits from May 1, 1992 through April 30, 1994. She subsequently received the social security benefits in one lump sum payment of $15,756.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">On June 27, 1995, a deputy of the VEC declared Nunery ineligible for unemployment benefits for the time period of October 4, 1992 through April 10, 1993 and November 28, 1993 through March 19, 1994. The deputy further found Nunery liable for repayment of the unemployment benefits she received.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">On appeal, the VEC appeals examiner conducted an evidentiary hearing, affirmed the deputy\u2019s determination that Nunery\u2019s unemployment benefits were subject to a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of her social security benefits, and found that she had been ineligible to receive unemployment benefits for the overlapping time periods pursuant to Code \u00a7 60.2-604. The VEC\u2019s special examiner affirmed the appeals examiner\u2019s decision on October 27,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Nunery appealed the agency decision to the circuit court (trial court) pursuant to Code \u00a7 60.2-625. The trial court in a letter opinion and final order dated July 12, 1996 reversed the VEC\u2019s decision. The trial court found that pursuant to Code \u00a7 60.2-604, the reduction or offset of unemployment benefits should occur only when the applicant for unemployment benefits \u201cis receiving\u201d <em>concurrent </em>payments for the period during which the unemployment compensation is paid. The court concluded that because Nunery received her social security benefits retroactively in a <em>lump sum </em>after her unemployment benefits were paid in full, she was not \u201creceiving\u201d pension or retirement benefits at the time that she received unemployment benefits. Thus, the trial court determined that Nunery was entitled to retain all funds and was not liable for any reduction or set-off amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">VEC argues that the trial court erred when it ruled on the timing of the receipt of the benefits covered by Code \u00a7 60.2-604, an issue that was not preserved for appeal or certified as a question of law in Nunery\u2019s petition for judicial review. The record reflects that Nunery raised only the issue of \u201cwhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>social security disability benefits are \u2018governmental or other pension ... based on the previous work of the individual\u2019 \u201d in her petition for appeal. We assume without deciding that Nunery properly preserved this issue; however, we reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of the offset previously determined by the VEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">THE OFFSET</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The VEC contends that the trial court erred in failing to reduce or offset Nunery\u2019s unemployment benefits in the amount of social security payments she received retroactively. VEC argues that the trial court misinterpreted state and federal law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">To receive federal benefits, a state\u2019s unemployment program must be in substantial compliance with the provisions of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 <em>et seq. See Watkins v. Cantrell, </em>736 F.2d 933, 937 (4th Cir.1984). 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">The Secretary of Labor shall approve any State law submitted to him, within 30 days of such submission, which he finds provides that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV6\">(15) the amount of compensation payable to an individual for any week which begins after March 31, 1980, and which begins in a period with respect to which such individual is receiving a governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, <em>or any other similar periodic payment </em>which is based on the previous work of such individual <em>shall be reduced </em>(but not below zero) by an amount equal to the amount of such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or <em>other payment, which is reasonably attributable to such week </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(15) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Virginia, in compliance with the federal legislation, used language similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(15) in the Virginia Unemployment Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 60.2-100 <em>et. seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Code \u00a7 60.2-604 tracks the federal mandate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">The weekly benefit amount payable to an individual for any week which begins in a period for which such individual is receiving a governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, <em>or any other similar periodic payment </em>under a plan maintained or contributed to by a base period or chargeable employer <em>based on the previous work </em>of such individual ... <em>shall be reduced, </em>but not below zero, by an amount equal to the amount of such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or <em>other payment, which is reasonably attributable to such week.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Code \u00a7 60.2-604 (emphasis added). Additionally, Code \u00a7 60.2-633(A) provides, in part, that \u201c[a]ny person who has received <em>any sum </em>as benefits under this title to which he was not entitled shall be liable to repay such sum to the Commission.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language clearly follows the federal directive. Accordingly, the dispositive issue in this case is whether the language \u201cis receiving\u201d in Code \u00a7 60.2-604 is limited to the contemporaneous payment of benefits or whether it also includes a later lump sum payment that is \u201creasonably attributable\u201d to the period in which unemployment benefits were received.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that courts must look first to the language of the statute. If a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Loudoun County Dep\u2019t of Social Services v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 84, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993). The broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>language of the statute encompasses the payments at issue in the instant case. Here, Nunery was receiving weekly unemployment insurance benefits. During this time period, she became eligible to receive social security disability benefits. These benefits fall under the statutory definition of \u201cany other similar periodic payment\u201d and therefore, unemployment benefits will be subject to a reduction or offset in \u201can amount equal to the amount of such ... other payment.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 60.2-604 and 60.2-633(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Moreover, contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding that the offset requirement applies only to payments being received simultaneously, we find no reason to hold that the timing of the receipt of these benefits takes the payments beyond the ambit of Code \u00a7 60.2-604. Indeed, the General Assembly provided that the mandatory offset encompasses \u201can amount equal to the amount of such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, <em>or other </em>payment, <em>which is reasonably attributable to such week.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 60.2-604 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>In this case, Nunery received the actual payment for social security benefits several months after her unemployment benefits terminated. Although she initially requested the social security benefits on June 10, 1993, she was not found eligible by the Social Security Administration for these benefits until January 11, 1995. Nevertheless, Nunery incurred the eligibility to receive the social security benefits during the time she was receiving the unemployment benefits and in fact they cover the same time period. Thus, her eligibility to receive both benefits coincided and the lump sum award for social security benefits was \u201creasonably attributable\u201d to weeks during which she received unemployment benefits. Accordingly, the offset provision of Code \u00a7 60.2-604 applies to the overlap of the time periods during which Nunery received employment benefits and during which she was eligible to receive social security payments. <em>See also City of Independence v. Ventura, </em>113 Ohio App.3d 661, 681 N.E.2d 1352 (Ohio Ct.App.1996) (holding that offset applied where claimant received disability benefits retroactively and in a lump sum covering the same period for which he received unemployment benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Additionally, the Congressional purpose in enacting 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(15) was to \u201celiminate] duplicative benefits and preserv[e] the fiscal integrity of the unemployment compensation in a rational manner.\u201d <em>McKay v. Horn, </em>529 F.Supp. 847, 863 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The disqualification of alternative forms of wage-replacement income reflects a reasonable legislative determination that those with outside income have a lesser need for governmental assistance during a period of unemployment and can best bear the brunt of government economies.... The amendment is aimed directly at eliminating the payment of benefits which can be described as \u201cwindfall\u201d benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><em>Id. </em>The practical effect of the federal statute is to create, on a uniform basis throughout the United States, a dollar-for-dollar reduction of unemployment insurance benefits by income received from the designated \u201cwage replacement\u201d sources. <em>See id., </em>529 F.Supp. 847. Restricting the application of the offset requirement as suggested by the trial court defeats the Congressional rationale and the General Assembly\u2019s adherence to the federal directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Rather, the social security benefits at issue are encompassed by Code \u00a7 60.2-604 because they are in the nature of retirement pay or pension payments and are based on the individual\u2019s previous employment. <em>See Watkins, </em>736 F.2d at 937 (quoting Pub.L. 94-566, 90 Stat. 2667 (1976)) (emphasis added) (\u201cCongress enacted \u00a7 3304(a)(15) in 1976 to require ... all states to offset an individual\u2019s employment insurance compensation by the amount of any ... payment, including social security ... benefits, <em>based on the individual\u2019s previous employment.\u201d). </em>\u201cIn 1977, the Virginia legislature enacted the Virginia pension offset provision ... to bring Virginia\u2019s unemployment compensation program into conformity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u00a7 3304(a)(15).... The Virginia pension offset provision ... became effective September 30, 1979. Since that time, VEC has offset from unemployment insurance compensation all pension and retirement benefits attributable to previous work, with limited exceptions.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Sikka v. Caterair International Corporation, </em>Com. Dec. 47602-C (March 22, 1995) (finding that both disability and old age payments are based on contributions made to the social security trust fund by both employers and employees, and that the disability program is \u201cessentially a retirement program based on disability as opposed to age\u201d because the \u201cbenefits which are paid to such individual are paid <em>based on the prior work of such individual </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added). We agree. For purposes of Code \u00a7 60.2-604, enacted in conformance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304, there is no meaningful distinction between social security <em>retirement </em>benefits and social security <em>disability </em>benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Further, the VEC has consistently interpreted Code \u00a7 60.2-604 as requiring a reduction in unemployment benefits when a claimant receives, or is eligible to receive, <em>retroactive </em>social security payments. <em>See, e.g., Blake v. Howmet Corp., </em>Com. Dec. 31402-C (June 8, 1989) (reduction applies because (1) \u201cIt is not unusual for there to be a delay in the receipt of Social Security benefits, private pension benefits, or workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d and (2) award was \u201creasonably attributable to such week\u201d although not received contemporaneously); <em>accord Blake v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n and Homet Turbine Components Corp., </em>Cir. Ct. of the City of Hampton (November 21, 1989) (affirming the VEC\u2019s decision that unemployment benefits are payable only after all compensation stemming from prior work is taken into consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">It is well settled that where the construction of a statute has been uniform for many years in administrative practice, and has been acquiesced in by the General Assembly, such construction is entitled to great weight with the courts. <em>Dan River Mills, Inc. v. Unemployment Compensation Com\u2019n., </em>195 Va. 997, 81 S.E.2d 620 (1954). Thus, the lump sum social security disability benefits at issue in this case are \u201cother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>payments\u201d based on Nunery\u2019s previous employment and are \u201creasonably attributable\u201d to an overlapping time period, which requires a reduction in unemployment benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 60.2-604. This holding follows both the federal and state statutory mandates. It denies a windfall to Nunery due solely to a delay in the actual receipt of the requested benefits. Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\">.
