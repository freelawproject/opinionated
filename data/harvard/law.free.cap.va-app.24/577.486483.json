The trial court received a juror\u2019s question in writing, read the question in open court in the presence of counsel, the jury, and the witnesses, and then permitted counsel to ask additional questions in order to clarify the uncertainty in the evidence described by the juror\u2019s question. The trial judge did not inform counsel of the content or nature of the question before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>reading it. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by the procedure it adopted for receiving and handling the juror\u2019s question. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Wesley Shamel Williams appeals his convictions for first degree murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. At trial the sole factual dispute was whether the defendant or another man shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">During cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s first witness, a juror indicated to the judge that he wanted to have the witness\u2019 testimony clarified as to the positions of the defendant, the victim, and another man when the victim was shot. The judge directed the juror to submit the question in writing. After the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney completed her cross-examination, the judge asked the juror whether his question had been answered. The juror replied that he was still confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">At a side bar conference, during which the judge did not inform counsel of the content of the juror\u2019s question, defense counsel objected, stating, \u201cI think this is dangerous for the jury to start beginning with lots of questions.\u201d The judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">I am going to be limiting, to allow the jury to tell the Court that they are confused about something. I\u2019m not going to let jurors question witnesses, but I am going to let them tell me if they want a question answered. It\u2019s going to be limited. Your objection is noted for the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The judge then read the question aloud in open court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">This written question was a statement from one of the jurors, which I will read to you. When the Commonwealth was questioning Otis about the positions of and directions that ... [they] were facing, the directions in which each were facing was unclear. I would like to have these facts clarified if I- might. Thank you. Does that prompt any further questions for you Ms. Cardwell [the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The trial judge did not direct the question to the witness. Rather, he permitted the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney to further cross-examine the witness about the positions of the people during the shooting. After the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s questioning, the-judge stated, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have this process go on like that. I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead.\u201d Defense counsel then conducted redirect examination of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\u201c[T]he conduct of a trial is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 667, 676, 283 S.E.2d 905, 910 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 983, 102 S.Ct. 1491, 71 L.Ed.2d 693 (1982); <em>Cunningham v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 358, 365, 344 S.E.2d 389, 393 (1986). Juror questioning of witnesses is an issue of first impression in Virginia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue of interactive juries or questioning by jurors has been considered in many jurisdictions. The majority of courts that have considered the issue have held that the trial court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, permit juror questioning, but the court should take precautions to avoid the potential for abuse or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The federal circuit courts have uniformly held that the propriety of juror questioning is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bush, </em>47 F.3d 511 (2d Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Cassiere, 4 </em>F.3d 1006 (1st Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Lewin, </em>900 F.2d 145 (8th Cir.1990); <em>DeBenedetto v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>754 F.2d 512, 515 (4th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Callahan, </em>588 F.2d 1078 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 444 </em>U.S. 826, 100 S.Ct. 49, 62 L.Ed.2d 33 (1979). However, while recognizing the trial court\u2019s discretion, many federal courts discourage the practice due to the potential for prejudice or abuse. Some courts express concern that jurors, by taking an active role in the adversarial process, will become inquisitors, thereby compromising their neutrality. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>F.3d 442, 448 (2d Cir.1996); <em>Bush, </em>47 F.3d at 515 (\u201cIt is difficult for jurors to be both active participants in the adversarial process, embroiled in the questioning of witnesses, and detached observers, passing on the credibility of witnesses and the plausibility of the facts presented.\u201d). Also, juror neutrality will often appear to be compromised because the questions posed are often in the form of commentary on the evidence. <em>See Bush, </em>47 F.3d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Jurors, who are unfamiliar with the rules of evidence, are more likely to ask objectionable or prejudicial questions, <em>see DeBenedetto, </em>754 F.2d at 516, which places counsel in the difficult position of possibly alienating the jury by objecting or suffering the prejudice by remaining silent. <em>See Bush, </em>47 F.3d at 515. Other courts have expressed concern that juror questioning may encourage premature jury deliberation and that the impact of one juror\u2019s questions may unduly impact another juror\u2019s independent thought process. <em>DeBenedetto, </em>754 F.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">A majority of state appellate courts also hold that juror questioning lies within the trial judge\u2019s sound discretion. <em>See </em>3 John H. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 784a (Chadbourn rev. 1970); 98 C.J.S. <em>Witnesses </em>\u00a7 351 (1957 &amp; Supp.1996). <em>But see Morrison v. State, </em>845 S.W.2d 882 (Tex.Crim.App.1992) (holding that juror questioning is improper in a criminal case); <em>State v. Zima, </em>237 Neb. 952, 468 N.W.2d 377 (1991) (same). Several jurisdictions encourage juror questioning in order for jurors, as the fact finders, to obtain a fair understanding of the facts. <em>See Stamp v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Ky. 133, 253 S.W. 242 (1923). \u201c[A] juror may, and often does, ask a very pertinent and helpful question in furtherance of the investigation.\u201d <em>State v. Howard, </em>320 N.C. 718, 360 S.E.2d 790, 794 (1987) (citation omitted). \u201cBecause the jury is the finder of fact, it should be permitted to ask questions which may assist in reaching its ultimate decision in the case.\u201d <em>State v. Hays, </em>256 Kan. 48, 883 P.2d 1093, 1099 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In Virginia, an accused has the fundamental right to trial by a fair and impartial jury. <em>See Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>226 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Va. 591, 592-93, 311 S.E.2d 409, 409 (1984). The function of a jury is to assure a fair and equitable resolution of all factual issues. <em>Colgrove v. Battin, </em>413 U.S. 149, 157, 93 S.Ct. 2448, 2452, 37 L.Ed.2d 522 (1973). The jury serves as the final arbiter of the facts, \u201ccharged with weighing the evidence, judging the credibility of the witnesses, and reaching a verdict\u201d in the case. <em>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614, 625, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 2085, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991); <em>see also DeBenedetto, 754 </em>F.2d at 516 (\u201cOur judicial system is founded upon the presence of a body constituted as a neutral factfinder to discern the truth from the positions presented by the adverse parties.\u201d). A jury\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See id.; Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We hold that the trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, may permit jurors to submit written questions to be asked of a witness. The trial court\u2019s discretion will not be reversed on appeal absent some prejudice caused by the questioning or the procedure adopted for receiving and submitting the questions. We do not discourage trial judges from exercising their discretion to permit juror questioning, provided they adopt procedures that assure control over the process and avoid the pitfalls that have potential for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In this case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion. Although the record is unclear whether the trial judge consulted with counsel before disclosing the content of the question in open court, a practice which we deem to be desirable, <em>see Bush, 47 </em>F.3d at 516, it was apparent that the juror\u2019s question merely sought clarification from the witness about the location of people at the murder scene. <em>See State v. Barrett, </em>278 S.C. 414, 297 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1045, 103 S.Ct. 1445, 75 L.Ed.2d 800 (1983) (\u201c[A] juror has no more right to ask an immaterial, incompetent or irrelevant question than has counsel.\u201d). The judge did not err by permitting counsel to ask questions in order to clarify those facts relevant to the juror\u2019s question. <em>See Bush, 47 </em>F.3d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The trial judge took the precaution of requiring the juror to submit the question in writing. <em>See Howard, </em>360 S.E.2d at 795 (requiring juror questions to be in writing and given to the judge); <em>Bush, </em>47 F.3d at 516 (recommending that the judge ask the question). The process did not interrupt the examination of the witness. <em>See Hays, </em>883 P.2d at 1102 (expressing concern about juror questions interrupting the order of evidence presentation by counsel). Also, the judge held a side bar conference, which gave counsel the opportunity to object to the question or procedure outside the jury\u2019s presence without alienating them. <em>See Barrett, </em>297 S.E.2d at 796 (\u201cThe trial judge should meticulously endeavor to make it unnecessary for offended counsel to interpose an objection to a juror\u2019s question in his presence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s statement, \u201c[wje\u2019re not going to have this process go on like that,\u201d constituted a refusal to allow other jurors to ask questions and restricted defense counsel\u2019s redirect. From our reading of the record, we do not interpret the judge\u2019s comment to be a ruling that prohibited further questions from the jury or from defense counsel. Moreover, if defense counsel considered the statement to be an erroneous ruling on the right of counsel or jurors to ask questions, she failed to object at trial and cannot be heard to complain on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In summary, we hold that whether to allow juror questions is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Trial courts which permit juror questions should adopt procedural safeguards to avoid prejudice to the parties. In this case, the trial court did not err in allowing a juror question. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. In <em>Federal Dep. Ins. Corp. v. Mapp's Ex'r, </em>184 Va. 970, 983, 37 S.E.2d 23, 28-29 (1946), the Virginia Supreme Court refused to rule on a plaintiffs assignment of error to a juror's questioning of a witness because the trial court's ruling on the issue was not adverse to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
