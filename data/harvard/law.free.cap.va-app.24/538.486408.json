Appellant was sentenced to three years imprisonment. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in preventing him from eliciting testimony at the sentencing phase of his trial concerning the impact of his incarceration upon his family and his employment. He further contends the trial court erred in limiting the scope of his closing argument at the sentencing phase. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Appellant was adjudicated an habitual offender in 1990 and convicted in both 1992 and 1993 of driving after having been so adjudicated. In January 1995, Virginia State Trooper Bob Davis saw appellant standing alone and fueling a pickup truck. Davis recognized appellant as an habitual offender he had arrested previously for driving the same vehicle. Davis drove toward appellant\u2019s home, pulled off the road, and waited. Appellant drove by Davis with Kim Roach in the passenger seat; Davis stopped appellant and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">During the guilt phase of his trial, appellant testified that he was employed as a painter. He further testified that he lived with Kim Roach and their two children, ages eleven and four. The jury found appellant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">Prior to the sentencing phase, appellant\u2019s counsel stated his intent to introduce mitigating evidence concerning appellant\u2019s employment and family responsibilities. Specifically, counsel stated his intent to elicit testimony from Kim Roach concerning the income that appellant brought to the family and the effect his incarceration would have on the family. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>court refused to allow such testimony on the ground that it was not relevant to punishment. During the sentencing phase, the court precluded appellant\u2019s counsel from eliciting testimony from appellant\u2019s employer on the same ground. The employer would have testified that appellant earned nine dollars per hour, did excellent work, and that the employer needed to keep him in his employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In his argument at sentencing, appellant\u2019s counsel urged consideration of the fact that, instead of hiding in the bushes waiting to catch appellant, \u201c[i]t would have been just as easy\u201d for Davis to have approached appellant and warned him not to drive. The court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to the argument on the ground that it was not relevant to punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, detailing the sentencing proceeding in bifurcated felony jury trials, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">In cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony, a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury.... After the Commonwealth has introduced ... evidence of prior convictions, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">We must determine whether the evidence appellant sought to introduce falls within the scope of \u201crelevant ... evidence related to punishment\u201d for consideration by the jury under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. We review the trial court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See Coppola v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 253, 257 S.E.2d 797, 804 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103, 100 S.Ct. 1069, 62 L.Ed.2d 788 (1980) (\u201cdiscretion is vested in the trial court to determine, subject to the rules of evidence governing admissibility, the evidence which may be adduced in mitigation of the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Although this is an issue of first impression, we base our decision on well accepted principles found in two sources. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>First, pursuant to the principles of statutory construction, we analogize the sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 to the statutory provisions applicable to the sentencing phase of bifurcated capital murder trials. <em>See Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 522-23, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996); <em>Bunn v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 593, 598, 466 S.E.2d 744, 746 (1996). Second, we look to the \u201cdeclared purposes of punishment for criminal conduct,\u201d including \u201c \u2018deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 594 (quoting <em>United States v. Morris, </em>837 F.Supp. 726, 729 (E.D.Va.1993)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In reference to the statutory provisions applicable to the sentencing phase of bifurcated capital murder trials, we note that under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4, \u201c[t]he jury has the duty to consider all the evidence relevant to sentencing, both favorable and unfavorable\u201d before making its determination. <em>E.g., Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 275-76, 257 S.E.2d 808, 819 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972, 100 S.Ct. 1666, 64 L.Ed.2d 249 (1980). Evidence considered relevant to jury sentencing and in mitigation of punishment in capital murder sentencing is specifically addressed in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Although the list of mitigating factors is not exclusive, the enumerated factors share a common denominator: they all address either the defendant\u2019s history or background or the circumstances surrounding the crime. <em>See Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 253, 257 S.E.2d at 804 (\u201cThe kind of evidence therein contemplated bears upon the record of the defendant and the atrociousness of his crime.\u201d). Accordingly, under the statutory scheme, mitigating evidence is that which shows \u201cextenuating circumstances tending to explain, but not excuse, [the] commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Correll v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 468, 352 S.E.2d 352, 360, <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931, 107 S.Ct. 3219, 96 L.Ed.2d 705 (1987) (quoting <em>Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 253, 257 S.E.2d at 797). <em>See also Burket v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 616, 450 S.E.2d 124, 135 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1053, 115 S.Ct. 1433, 131 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995); <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 136, 142, 431 S.E.2d 48, 52, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 928, 114 S.Ct. 336, 126 L.Ed.2d 281 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Guided by these principles, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in the present case. Appellant sought to elicit testimony from his girlfriend and employer concerning the financial impact his incarceration would have on his family and employer. Unlike the fact that appellant resided with his family and that he was employed, evidence of which was admitted during the guilt phase of his trial, the testimony in question did not relate to appellant\u2019s history or background or to the circumstances surrounding the crime. That testimony was, therefore, not relevant evidence related to punishment for consideration by the jury under Virginia law. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4; <em>Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 253-54, 257 S.E.2d at 804 (Effect of incarceration upon relatives not mitigating circumstance \u201canalogous to any of the evidence specifically approved in the statute.\u201d). In short, the proffered evidence concerning the impact of appellant\u2019s incar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ceration upon his family and employer did not tend to explain the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Furthermore, in the context of the jury\u2019s role in sentencing, we find no support for the admission of the evidence in question under the declared purposes of punishment for criminal conduct. Those purposes relate to (1) the defendant (specific deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation); (2) the victim (retribution); or (3) the public at large (general deterrence). We find that, given the facts of this case, none of these purposes would be served by the evidence appellant sought to elicit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Determining the appropriateness of a closing argument is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 622, 624, 472 S.E.2d 285, 287 (1996). We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit appellant\u2019s counsel to argue to the jury that, instead of waiting for appellant to drive the vehicle, it would have been \u201cjust as easy\u201d for Trooper Davis to have warned appellant not to drive. Based on the principles discussed in the preceding section, we find such argument is not relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence are accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">. \"Recognized \u2018[t]heories of punishment' include prevention, restraint, rehabilitation, deterrence, education, and retribution.\u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 524 n. 3, 465 S.E.2d at 594 n. 3 (quoting Wayne R.

Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">In cases of trial by jury, evidence may be presented as to any matter which the court deems relevant to sentence, except that reports under the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-299, or under any rule of court, shall not be admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">Evidence which may be admissible, subject to the rules of evidence governing admissibility, may include the circumstances surrounding the offense, the history and background of the defendant, and any other facts in mitigation of the offense.

We emphasize the distinction between the role of the court and the role of the jury with respect to sentencing, see, <em>e.g., Duncan v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 342, 343 S.E.2d 392 (1986), and conclude that distinction was not eviscerated by the recent amendments to the statutory scheme concerning sentencing proceedings. Here, we address the relationship between appellant\u2019s proffered evidence and the declared purposes of punishment in the context of the jury\u2019s sentencing role; <em>i.e., </em>to determine an appropriate term of punishment within the statutorily prescribed range of incarceration. We do not disagree with the principles espoused by the dissent in the context of the court\u2019s sentencing role, the context in which the cases cited by the dissent arose. <em>See, e.g., Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 602-03, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2963-64, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (addressing sentencing <em>judge\u2019s </em>possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b589-6\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Because I believe the trial judge erred in excluding from the jury\u2019s consideration mitigating evidence relevant to sentencing, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">During the jury trial, Trooper Bob Davis testified for the Commonwealth that he passed a service station and saw Shifflett pumping gas into Norma Roach\u2019s truck. Trooper Davis recognized Shifflett as an habitual offender whom he had arrested a year earlier. Trooper Davis waited at a place that he knew Shifflett would have to pass to get home. When Shifflett drove by, Trooper Davis signalled for Shifflett to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">In Shifflett\u2019s defense, a friend and co-worker testified that he drove Shifflett to work on the date of the offense and was to drive Shifflett home that evening. However, when the friend learned in the middle of the day that he had to work late, he told Shifflett to find another ride home.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Shifflett testified that he contacted Norma Kim Roach, the woman with whom he lives and who is the mother of his children, and asked her to come for him. However, Roach said that she did not feel well. Shifflett told Roach that if she was not at his place of employment at the end of his work shift he would attempt to find a ride with someone or walk if necessary. He worked in Charlottesville but lived in Earlysville.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">When Shifflett left work, Roach was waiting in her truck and told Shifflett that she still was not feeling well. While driving home, Roach became dizzy and began to lean forward. Shifflett testified that he grabbed the steering wheel and told Roach to stop. After Roach drove into a restaurant\u2019s parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>lot, Shifflett obtained food and a drink for her. Shifflett testified that after Roach told him that she still did not feel better, he drove the truck because their children, ages eleven and four, were alone at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Shifflett testified that he stopped on the way home to buy gas for the truck. While Shifflett was pumping the gas, Roach went inside the store to pay for the gas. When Shifflett drove away from the store, the trooper signalled for Shifflett to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">After the jury found Shifflett guilty of driving after having been declared an habitual offender, Shifflett\u2019s counsel informed the trial judge that he intended to offer mitigating testimony about Shifflett\u2019s employment, family responsibilities, and his motive for committing the offense. The trial judge ruled that testimony from Roach about Shifflett\u2019s family responsibilities was inadmissible. Over Shifflett\u2019s objection, the trial judge ruled that evidence at the penalty phase would be limited to the \u201crange of punishment established by [the] legislature, injury to the victim, use of [a] weapon, extent of [the] offender\u2019s participation, the offense, [the] offender\u2019s motive in committing the offense, prior record and rehabilitative efforts, drug and alcohol use, age, health and education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">During the penalty phase, Roach was permitted to testify that she was not feeling well when Shifflett called and told her that he needed a ride home. She went for him because he had no means of getting home, except by walking. She testified that as they were leaving Charlottesville, she became dizzy from vertigo. She further testified that she has had episodes of vertigo for twelve years, that she has had three ear surgeries, and that she continues to receive treatment. When she did not feel better after eating, she asked Shifflett to drive because she was concerned about their children being at home alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Roach\u2019s doctor testified that Roach suffers from vertigo. He testified that her \u201cvertigo ... is a ... dizzy condition ... that\u2019s transient, that comes and goes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>When Shifflett\u2019s counsel sought to question Shifflett\u2019s employer about Shifflett\u2019s employment, the trial judge sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection based on the prior ruling limiting the evidence. However, after the jury rendered its verdict on the sentence, the trial judge discharged the jury and heard the testimony of Shifflett\u2019s employer, William Amos Breeden, before he imposed the jury\u2019s sentence. Breeden testified that Shifflett did an \u201cexcellent job\u201d as his employee and that Shifflett was paid nine dollars per hour. Breeden also testified as follows about efforts Shifflett made to get to work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">Well, for a couple months or three months, I was going to pick [Shifflett] up at his house and taking him home and his dad also paints, so, I hired his dad a month ago and he brings him to my house and we leave from my house every morning at 5:30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Breeden testified that Shifflett displayed no \u201cindication of any alcohol abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The rule is long standing in Virginia that \u201c[w]ithin the limits prescribed by law, the terms of confinement in the state correctional facility or in jail and the amount of fine, if any, of a person convicted of a criminal offense, shall be ascertained by the jury, or by the court in cases tried without a jury.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295. Recently, the legislature established a procedure bifurcating the trial and punishment proceedings. In pertinent part, the statute states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">In cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony, a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury. ... After the Commonwealth has introduced ... evidence of prior convictions, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. This statute vests in juries wide discretion in recommending a sentence within the statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The general principle is well established that in the exercise of its sentencing function, \u201c[a] jury must be allowed to consider ... all relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 271, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2956, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976). \u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, </em>302 U.S. 51, 55, 58 S.Ct. 59, 61, 82 L.Ed. 43 (1937).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMD\">[WJhere sentencing discretion is granted, it generally has been agreed that the sentencing [jury\u2019s] \u201cpossession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics\u201d is \u201c[h]ighly <em>relevant </em>\u2014 if <em>not </em>essential\u2014 [to the] selection of an appropriate sentence.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 602-03, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2964, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (quoting <em>Williams v. People of State of New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1083, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949)). Because the circumstances of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender vary in each case, \u201cthe concept of individualized sentencing in criminal cases generally, although not constitutionally required, has long been accepted in this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 98 S.Ct. at 2963.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The majority characterizes the evidence that the trial judge excluded from the jury as testimony \u201cconcerning the financial impact [Shifflett\u2019s] incarceration would have on his family and employer\u201d and concludes that the evidence \u201cdid not relate to [Shifflett\u2019s] history or background.\u201d I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The employer\u2019s testimony regarding Shifflett\u2019s success at work and his efforts to maintain a commuting schedule that obviated his need to drive reflect on Shifflett\u2019s \u201ccharacter and propensities.\u201d <em>Ashe, </em>302 U.S. at 55, 58 S.Ct. at 61. Moreover, relevant sentencing factors traditionally have included an accused\u2019s habits, lifestyle, family, and occupation. <em>See State v. Lemley, </em>552 N.W.2d 409, 412 (S.D.1996); <em>State v. Morris, </em>750 S.W.2d 746, 750 (Tenn.Crim.App.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Although the trial judge did not admit this mitigating testimony for the jury to consider, the trial judge obviously was aware that testimony concerning Shifflett\u2019s employment may have had a bearing on the punishment decision. The trial judge considered the testimony of Shifflett\u2019s employer before he imposed the jury\u2019s sentence. However, the principle is well established that judges \u201cdo not weigh the evidence\u201d of mitigation for the sentencing jury. <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 117, 102 S.Ct. 869, 878, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). The testimony of Shifflett\u2019s employer was relevant, admissible, and erroneously excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>See Jurek, </em>428 U.S. at 271, 96 S.Ct. at 2956 (stating that sentencing <em>juries </em>must be provided with \u201call relevant evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In addition, the testimony of Roach was not offered merely to prove the family\u2019s apparent need for his income. Her testimony would have proved that Shifflett was a responsible father who worked earnestly to provide for his children. Certainly, evidence that a defendant has contributed positively to his family situation is a relevant circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Shifflett\u2019s evidence reflected upon his habits, character, and family circumstances and was therefore relevant to determining an appropriate punishment. I would therefore hold that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>Accord, State v. Lee, </em>600 So.2d 796, 799 (La.Ct.App.1992) (stating that when sentencing a defendant, \u201c[i]mportant elements to be considered are the convict\u2019s personal history (age, family ties, marital status, health, employment record), prior criminal record or absence thereof, [the] seriousness of the particular offense, and the likelihood of recidivism or rehabilitation\u201d); <em>People v.
