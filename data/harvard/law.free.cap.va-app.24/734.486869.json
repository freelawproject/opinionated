Flinchum asserts that the trial court erred in finding that he was operating his vehicle on a \u201chighway\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 46.2-100. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">On November 1, 1995, Officer Dalton Reid of the Christian-burg Police Department observed a vehicle \u201cdoing doughnuts\u201d in the parking lot of a sporting goods store at 9:00 p.m. He then observed the vehicle drive from the sporting goods parking lot into an adjacent parking lot in front of a car repair business. Reid testified that he did not see the vehicle drive on Route 11, which runs in front of both businesses. Subsequently, Flinchum was determined to be the operator of the vehicle and was arrested for driving a vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">At trial, Flinchum testified that he had not driven on Route 11 and that he had only driven in the parking lots of the sporting goods store and the repair business. A \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign was posted on the auto shop\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Code \u00a7 46.2-100 defines \u201chighway\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-13\">The entire width between the boundary lines of every way or place open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel in the Commonwealth, including the streets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>and alleys, and, for law enforcement purposes, the entire width between the boundary lines of all private roads or private streets which have been specifically designated \u201chighways\u201d by an ordinance adopted by the governing body of the county, city, or town in which such private roads or streets are located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\u201c[T]he test for determining whether a way is a \u2018highway\u2019 depends upon the degree to which the way is open to public use for vehicular traffic.\u201d <em>Furman v. Call, </em>234 Va. 437, 439, 362 S.E.2d 709, 710 (1987) (citing <em>Kay Management v. Creason, </em>220 Va. 820, 831-32, 263 S.E.2d 394, 401 (1980)). In <em>Kay Management, </em>the Court held that \u201cevidence of accessibility to the public for free and unrestricted use gave rise to a prima facie presumption\u201d that the streets in an apartment complex, which were privately owned and maintained, were \u201chighways\u201d for law enforcement purposes. 220 Va. at 832, 263 S.E.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The Court reached the same conclusion in <em>Furman </em>where it considered whether the parking area of a condominium office complex was encompassed within the legal definition of highway. 234 Va. at 439, 362 S.E.2d at 710. The <em>Furman </em>Court found that even though the lot was posted with signs stating \u201cPrivate Property\u201d and \u201cNo Soliciting,\u201d the lot was a highway within the meaning of the statutory definition because public access was unrestricted. <em>Id. </em>at 441, 362 S.E.2d at 711. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he roads around and in the complex ... have never been closed to the public; the complex is open for vehicular traffic 24 hours a day, seven days a week. No guard or barricade system prevents the public from driving at will through the complex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 362 S.E.2d at 710. The Court further noted that \u201c[t]he only signs read: \u2018Private Property, No Soliciting.\u2019 Clearly the purpose of the signs is to prohibit soliciting not the entry of motor vehicles operated by members of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 362 S.E.2d at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">However, in <em>Prillaman v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 401, 100 S.E.2d 4 (1957), the Supreme Court held that a gas station lot was not a highway within the meaning of the statutory definition. In <em>Prillaman, </em>the defendant drove his car from the rear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>to the front of a service station lot. The Court found that the lot was not open to the public; instead it determined that \u201cthe premises ... were open to the public upon [the owner\u2019s] invitation. The invitation was for private business purposes and for his benefit. He had the absolute right at any time to terminate or limit this invitation. He could close his doors and bar the public or any person from vehicular travel on all or any part of his premises at will. He had complete control over their use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 100 S.E.2d at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Unlike <em>Prillaman, </em>the <em>Furman </em>and <em>Kay Management </em>decisions were not based solely on the statutory definition of highway. Instead, these decisions employed a broader consideration of public access and use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, while broadening the scope of review, <em>Furman </em>and <em>Kay Management </em>did not reverse <em>Prillaman, </em>and in fact <em>Furman </em>observed that <em>Prillaman </em>\u201cdiscussed public maintenance and common enjoyment in evaluating whether a way is a \u2018highway.\u2019 \u201d <em>Furman, </em>234 Va. at 440, 362 S.E.2d at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Here, the facts are similar to those of <em>Prillaman. </em>In accord with Prillaman\u2019s consideration of the public access and use factors that controlled in <em>Furman </em>and <em>Kay Management, </em>we hold that the lots traversed by Flinchum were not \u201chighways\u201d within the statutory meaning of that term. The sporting goods\u2019 and repair business\u2019 parking lots were not open to the public at all times, but instead \u201cwere open to the public upon ... invitation.\u201d <em>Prillaman, </em>199 Va. at 407, 100 S.E.2d at 8. This intent was demonstrated by the posted \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign, which clearly served to \u201cprohibit ... the entry of motor vehicles operated by members of the public.\u201d <em>Furman, </em>234 Va. at 441, 362 S.E.2d at 711. Further, either of the businesses \u201ccould close [their] doors and bar the public or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>any person from vehicular travel on all or any part of [their] premises at will.\u201d <em>Prillaman, </em>199 Va. at 408, 100 S.E.2d at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Therefore, we hold that the parking lots upon which Flinch-um traversed were improperly classified as \u201chighways\u201d under Code \u00a7 46.2-100, and accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">. The <em>Furman </em>Court observed that \u2018\u2018[a]lthough the <em>Prillaman </em>Court discussed public maintenance and common enjoyment in evaluating whether a way is a 'highway,' that language is dicta. The case was decided solely on the basis of the statutory definition of 'highway,' which requires only that the way be \u2018open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.\u2019\u201d 234 Va. at 440, 362 S.E.2d at 711.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
