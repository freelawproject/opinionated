On appeal, defendant complains that the trial court improperly permitted the Commonwealth to impeach him through \u201cNotice[s] of Alibi Defense,\u201d signed only by his counsel and filed pursuant to Rule 3A:ll(c)(2). Finding no error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Prior to trial, defendant, by counsel, filed a \u201cNotice of Alibi Defense\u201d with the court which represented that defendant intended to \u201coffer evidence\u201d that he was at the residence of his sister in Falls Church at the time of the alleged offenses. Subsequently, defendant, again by counsel, lodged an \u201cAmended Notice of Alibi Defense,\u201d advising that he would assert an alibi that he \u201cwas in touch ... with his sister ... from a public telephone in ... Falls Church,\u201d that she \u201cpicked him up ... from that location\u201d and drove him to Washington, D. C., where he \u201ctook a train ... to New York.\u201d Neither notice was signed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">During trial, defendant testified that he was in New York the \u201cwhole day\u201d of the crimes. When the prosecutor attempted to impeach defendant using the prior alibi notices, defense counsel objected, arguing that each set forth only \u201crepresentation of counsel \u2014 what counsel believe[d].\u201d The trial court overruled the objection and instructed the jury, \u201cThere\u2019s a requirement in Virginia law ... that a defendant in a criminal case who elects to put on an alibi has to give notice of what it\u2019s going to be. That written notice is a part of this file. The Commonwealth can rely upon it in cross exam.\u201d During the ensuing cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that the notices placed him in Falls Church at the time of the offenses and offered no explanation for the inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Following trial, defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing that use of the alibi notices \u201cin essence ... could make [him] a witness in the case,\u201d thereby implicating the attorney-client privilege. However, the trial judge concluded that it was \u201can authorized statement by an agent and an attorney,\u201d \u201cclearly usable as a prior inconsistent statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 779, 433 S.E.2d 489 (1993), we reasoned that statements of defense counsel set forth in a written suppression motion and spoken during an attendant hearing were properly attributable to Hall, although he neither signed the motion nor testified at the hearing. We noted that Hall had \u201csat silently during the suppression hearing,\u201d and that the statements of his counsel were made \u201cwith [his] actual or constructive knowledge and ... express or tacit consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 783, 433 S.E.2d at 492 (quoting <em>Coppola v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 251, 257 S.E.2d 797, 802-03 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103, 100 S.Ct. 1069, 62 L.Ed.2d 788 (1980)); <em>see id. </em>at 783-84, 433 S.E.2d at 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Defendant\u2019s effort to distinguish <em>Hall </em>from the instant case ignores the lesson of <em>Asbury v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 101, 175 S.E.2d 239 (1970). In <em>Asbury, </em>the accused acknowledged on cross-examination that he had previously provided information to an attorney incidental to the preparation of a pleading in an unrelated civil proceeding, but denied reading the pleading or otherwise vouching for its contents. <em>See id. </em>at 106-07, 175 S.E.2d at 242-43. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that Asbury could be impeached in a later criminal prosecution by prior inconsistent statements found in the civil filing. <em>See id.; see also Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 658, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988) (\u201cIn responding to discovery, the client has a duty to be candid and forthcoming with the lawyer, and when the lawyer responds, he or she speaks for the client.\u201d); <em>Browder v. Southern Ry. Co., </em>107 Va. 10, 12-13, 57 S.E. 572, 573 (1907) (\u201c[Abandoned or superseded pleadings ... may be introduced in cross-examination to impeach the plaintiff,\u201d even if he did not read or execute them, \u201cin the absence of evidence that the pleading was unauthorized.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Here, the alibi notices were specifically related to the pending criminal prosecution and filed in that cause by defendant\u2019s counsel pursuant to Rule 3A:ll(c), which, <em>inter alia, </em>permits the court to require that the accused disclose an intention to offer alibi evidence, including \u201cthe place at which he claims to have been at the time of the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>alleged offense,\u201d whenever discovery is ordered from the Commonwealth. Permitting a defendant to later disavow such declarations with impunity would at once visit an injustice upon the Commonwealth and countenance a subversion of the Rules governing discovery in criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">On review, we are guided by the principle that \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). Defendant in this instance was responsible for the content of his alibi notices, testified differently, and had the opportunity to explain on either cross or redirect examination the inconsistencies in his several statements. Under such circumstances, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Commonwealth to use the notices for purposes of impeachment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-16\">. Because this record does not disclose a violation of the attorney-client privilege, we decline to address this issue and attendant implications of Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
