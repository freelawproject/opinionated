On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We disagree and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">On the night in question, appellant\u2019s wife appeared at the Louisa County Sheriffs Office, her face bleeding from an injury she attributed to appellant. Two deputies, Hicks and Gholson, and a state trooper, Stanley, responded to appellant\u2019s residence to investigate. A few days earlier, appellant\u2019s teenage stepson had been reported missing. When the officers responded to appellant\u2019s home, they believed that appellant\u2019s stepson remained missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Upon the officers\u2019 arrival, appellant invited them into his house. Appellant\u2019s two children, ages three and four, were asleep in the living room. Appellant and the officers did not discuss whether those children were the only other occupants of the house. The four men proceeded through the living room to the kitchen where, almost immediately thereafter, appellant was arrested. Hicks transported appellant to the sheriffs office; Gholson and Stanley remained to look after the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The sheriffs office contacted a social services representative, Solomon, who arrived at appellant\u2019s house within thirty to forty minutes. Meanwhile, Gholson and Stanley remained in the kitchen, periodically checking on the children asleep in the adjacent living room. After Solomon left appellant\u2019s home with the children, Gholson and Stanley looked through the remainder of the house, including the second floor, which they reached by opening a door located in a third room and ascending a flight of stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Before entering appellant\u2019s house, Gholson and Stanley had noticed a light shining through a second floor window. Both officers believed that appellant had been on the first floor when they arrived, because he answered the door soon after they knocked. Neither officer heard any noise coming from the second floor, but Stanley stated he noticed a foul smell coming from somewhere. Gholson testified that they went upstairs \u201c[t]o secure the residence, make sure there was nobody else there.\u201d Stanley likewise testified that he and Gholson \u201cjust wanted to check and make sure there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>nobody else, no kids or anything.\u201d Both Gholson and Stanley testified that they were specifically looking for appellant\u2019s missing stepson. Both also testified they had not thought to check the rest of the house until they were preparing to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Once upstairs, the officers observed in plain view some of the evidence used to support appellant\u2019s convictions. At that time, the officers did not open any cabinets or containers; instead, they returned to the sheriffs office to obtain a search warrant. Back at the station, Gholson and Hicks were in the process of preparing an affidavit in support of a search warrant based on Gholson\u2019s observations when they were informed that appellant had consented to a further search of his house. Based on appellant\u2019s consent, Hicks returned to the house to oversee the search and seizure of additional evidence used to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The trial court found that \u201cthe intrusion of the officers in the 2nd floor of the [appellant\u2019s] residence was justified as the officers were carrying out their duties as community caretakers.\u201d Accordingly, it denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The threshold and dispositive issue in this case is whether the officers faced circumstances sufficient to justify their entry into and search of the second floor of appellant\u2019s home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant does not dispute that if the entry was lawful, the evidence to support his convictions was properly seized and admitted into evidence. The Commonwealth concedes that if the entry was unlawful, all the seized evidence was tainted and inadmissible to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">\u201cThe ultimate standard set forth in the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.\u201d <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 439, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 2527, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973). Unreasonable searches and seizures are prohibited, but not those which are \u201creasonable in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Verez v.

Warrantless entries and warrantless searches are presumed to be unreasonable, and the Commonwealth bears the burden to prove their justification. <em>E.g., id.; Commonwealth v. Ealy, </em>12 Va.App. 744, 751, 407 S.E.2d 681, 686 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In the present case, the trial court found the officers\u2019 entry of the second floor of appellant\u2019s home justified under the community caretaker doctrine. <em>See Commonwealth v. Waters, </em>20 Va.App. 285, 456 S.E.2d 527 (1995); <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 773, 447 S.E.2d 243 (1994) (en banc), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>250 Va. 243, 462 S.E.2d 109 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pointing to the officers\u2019 knowledge of appellant\u2019s missing stepchild, the light shining through the second floor window, the unusual smell permeating the house, appellant\u2019s apparent beating of his wife, and the fact that the officers were the last to leave appellant\u2019s home, the Commonwealth argues that we should uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling.

LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 6.6 at 389-90 (1996). The lawfulness of police action undertaken pursuant to such roles is sometimes evaluated in terms of the \u201ccommunity caretaking function,\u201d first discussed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973). <em>Cady </em>involved the warrantless search of an automobile.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First in <em>Barrett </em>and later in <em>Waters, </em>this Court relied on <em>Cady </em>and adopted the community caretaker doctrine to justify warrantless, investigative \u201cseizures\u201d of people for purposes of aiding a citizen reasonably believed to be in distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Under the facts of this case, we affirm the trial court\u2019s application of the community caretaker doctrine to justify the warrantless entry into and investigative search of the second floor of appellant\u2019s home. In so doing, we note that in the context of a warrantless entry and search, little, if any, distinction exists in Virginia law between the circumstances governing the application of the community caretaker doctrine and those governing the application of the \u201cemergency\u201d excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tion to the warrant requirement. <em>Compare Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 288-91, 456 S.E.2d at 529-30, <em>and Barrett, </em>18 Va.App. at 776-79, 447 S.E.2d at 245-46, <em>with Reynolds v.

We have defined the community caretaker function of the police to be that duty which \u201cextends beyond the detection and prevention of crime, to embrace also an obligation to maintain order and to render needed assistance.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>18 Va.App. at 777, 447 S.E.2d at 245. The community caretaker doctrine, like the emergency exception to the warrant requirement, is grounded in consideration of the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6dK\">police [officers] owe \u201cduties to the public, such as rendering aid to individuals in danger of physical harm, reducing the commission of crimes through patrol and other preventive measures, and providing services on an emergency basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApT\"><em>Barrett, </em>18 Va.App. at 778, 447 S.E.2d at 246 (quoting <em>Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 436, 388 S.E.2d at 663 (citation omitted)). <em>See also Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 289, 456 S.E.2d at 529; <em>Shannon, </em>18 Va.App. at 34, 441 S.E.2d at 227. \u201c[T]he duty of the police embraces the function of maintaining public order and providing necessary assistance to persons in need or distress.\u201d <em>Barrett, 18 </em>Va.App. at 778, 447 S.E.2d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Applying the community caretaker doctrine, we find that the officers\u2019 entry into the second floor of appellant\u2019s home was lawful.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">The appropriateness of applying the community caretaker doctrine to a given factual scenario is determined by whether: (1) the officer\u2019s initial contact or investigation is reasonable; (2) the intrusion is limited; and (3) the officer is not investigating criminal conduct under the pretext of exercising his community caretaker function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-7\"><em>Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 290, 456 S.E.2d at 530.

Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 437, 388 S.E.2d at 663-64 (applying objective reasonableness test to emergency exception to warrant requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Determination of whether the officers had reasonable suspicion to exercise their community caretaker function involves a mixed question of law and fact. The trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact will be upheld absent clear and manifest error. <em>See Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 437, 388 S.E.2d at 664. We review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of those facts to the legal standard of \u201creasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). That standard is determined from the perspective of the objectively reasonable police officer, and we give deference to the inferences the police officer draws from the historical facts with which he or she is faced. <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 S.Ct. at 1663; <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 139, 144, 384 S.E.2d 125, 128 (1989) (\u201c[W]hen a court reviews whether an officer had reasonable suspicion ... it must view the totality of the circumstances and view those facts objectively through the eyes of a reasonable police officer with the knowledge, training, and experience of the investigating officer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">In the present case, we find that the officers had a reasonable basis to justify the exercise of their community caretaker function, which led them to enter the second floor of appellant\u2019s home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the officers responded to appellant\u2019s house, they had reason to believe that appellant recently had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>beaten his wife and that appellant\u2019s stepson was missing. Upon their arrival, the officers noticed a light shining through a second floor window and determined that appellant was not on the second floor of the house when they arrived. One of the officers noticed a foul odor coming from somewhere in the house. Although neither officer heard any noise coming from the second floor, that alone would not preclude the presence of someone on that floor, and neither officer could be certain whether anyone else was in the house. The officers were assigned the duty to assure the safety and welfare of appellant\u2019s two younger children asleep in the living room of the house, and they were the last to leave the premises. Before leaving, the officers investigated the remaining rooms of the house to make certain that appellant\u2019s missing stepson was not there and to avoid leaving anyone else behind or the house unsecured. Because the officers were guided by their concern for the child they believed to be missing, their investigation was limited to those places where they could reasonably expect to find a person; they did not open any cabinets or containers. And, the record is devoid of evidence that the officers\u2019 entry of the second floor was a pretext for the investigation of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Lawfully present on the second floor, the- officers discovered certain items in plain view, the incriminating nature of which was immediately apparent to them. Accordingly, the plain view rule was met, and the items were subject to seizure and admissible in evidence. <em>See Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 439, 388 S.E.2d at 665; <em>Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 291, 456 S.E.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">. We note there is no dispute that the officers\u2019 initial entry into appellant\u2019s home was lawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\">. In reversing <em>Barrett, </em>the Supreme Court held that the evidence did not support a \"reasonable suspicion\u201d that Barrett was in need of police assistance. The Supreme Court did not rule on this Court\u2019s adoption of the community caretaker doctrine. 250 Va. at 247-48, 462 S.E.2d at 112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\">. The Commonwealth\u2019s contention that appellant\u2019s appeal is barred on procedural grounds for failure to brief or argue the community caretaker doctrine fails to consider that appellant argues the police had no basis to enter the second floor of his home and, specifically, that searching for the missing child was not a sufficient basis for the entry. Appellant clearly argues the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision, and we find no reason to bar his appeal on procedural grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">. The <em>Cady </em>Court discussed well-established privacy distinctions between automobiles and residences in affirming the reasonableness of the search in that case. 413 U.S. at 439-42, 93 S.Ct. at 2527-29. Such distinctions, however, have not precluded courts from evaluating warrantless entry and search of premises under the community caretaker function, <em>see </em>LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 390 n. 3, and while we recognize the distinction between the search of an automobile and the search of a home, we find that certain factors relevant to the <em>Cady </em>analysis provide guidance here. First, the <em>Cady </em>Court noted that the \u201cpolice had exercised a form of custody or control over the [disabled automobile]\u201d as a result of their investigating an automobile accident and the disabled driver\u2019s inability to make arrangements to have the automobile towed and stored. 413 U.S. at 442-43, 93 S.Ct. at 2528-29. Second, the Court noted that the police had the car towed to a private garage where, to protect the public, the trunk was searched in accordance with police procedure to assure the removal of a revolver the police believed to be there. <em>Id. </em>at 443, 93 S.Ct. at 2529. Finally, the Court noted that in conducting the \u201csearch,\u201d the police were not motivated by a desire to find incriminating evidence of possible criminal behavior. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\">. Appellant argues, and the Commonwealth agrees, that the officers' action in this case is not justifiable as a search incident to appellant\u2019s arrest. Our decision should not be construed as an extension of that doctrine. <em>See Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990) (beyond spaces immediately adjoining place of arrest, officers may make a \"protective sweep\u201d of the premises upon reasonable suspicion that the area swept harbors an individual posing a threat to the officers).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b707-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"APm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Because I believe that the warrantless entry by the police into the second floor of Wood\u2019s residence was not justified by any \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d function, I would reverse the decision of the trial judge denying the motion to suppress.

IV. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment protects the individual\u2019s privacy in a variety of settings. In none is the zone of privacy more clearly defined than when bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an individual\u2019s home.... \u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 589, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1381-82, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). Well settled is the \u201c \u2018basic principle of Fourth Amendment law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that searches ... inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 100 S.Ct. at 1380 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Noting that the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 439-42, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 2527-29, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), \u201cdiscussed well-established privacy distinctions between automobiles and residences in affirming the reasonableness of the [automobile] search in that case,\u201d the majority nevertheless ignores these distinctions. In <em>Cady, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">Because of the extensive regulation of motor vehicles and traffic, and also because of the frequency with which a vehicle can become disabled or involved in an accident on public highways, the extent of police-citizen contact involving automobiles will be substantially greater than police-citizen contact in a home or office. Some such contacts will occur because the officer may believe the operator has violated a criminal statute, but many more will not be of that nature. Local police officers, unlike federal officers, frequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">... The constitutional difference between searches of and seizures from houses and similar structures and from vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>cles stems both from the ambulatory character of the latter and from the fact that extensive, and often noncriminal contact with automobiles will bring local officials in \u201cplain view\u201d of evidence, fruits, or instrumentalities of a crime, or contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 441-42, 93 S.Ct. at 2528.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis on the distinction between vehicle searches and searches of an individual\u2019s home strongly implies that the community caretaking function used to uphold the vehicle search in <em>Cady </em>would not justify an intrusion into an individual\u2019s home. This inference was verified when the Court later stated, in <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 367, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3096, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976), the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">This Court has traditionally drawn a distinction between automobiles and homes or offices in relation to the Fourth Amendment. Although automobiles are \u201ceffects\u201d and thus within the reach of the Fourth Amendment, <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 439 [93 S.Ct. 2523, 2527, 37 L.Ed.2d 706] (1973), warrantless examinations of automobiles have been upheld in circumstances in which a search of a home or office would not. <em>Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U.S. 583, 589 [94 S.Ct. 2464, 2468-2469, 41 L.Ed.2d 325] (1974); <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>at 439-440 [93 S.Ct. at 2527-2528]; <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 48 [90 S.Ct. 1975, 1979-1980, 26 L.Ed.2d 419] (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">By citing <em>Cady </em>as an example of a search that would not have been upheld if it had involved an intrusion into an individual\u2019s home, I believe the Court made clear that the community caretaker doctrine cannot be used to justify a warrantless intrusion into a home. Accordingly, I would hold that the trial judge erred in holding that the warrantless entry into the second floor of Wood\u2019s residence was justified by the community caretaker doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the community caretaking doctrine may under appropriate circumstances justify warrantless searches of residences, I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that the search of the second floor of Wood\u2019s home was a valid exercise of that function. In <em>Cady, </em>the Supreme Court described \u201ccommunity caretaking functions\u201d as being \u201ctotally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>See Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 441, 93 S.Ct. at 2528. The evidence in this case proves that the search was not \u201ctotally divorced from\u201d a criminal investigation-.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The undisputed evidence proved that, on the night of the search, Wood\u2019s wife went to the police station and reported that Wood had assaulted her. The police promptly went to Wood\u2019s residence to investigate the alleged assault. When the police arrived, they entered Wood\u2019s house to discuss the assault, arrested Wood, and took Wood to the police station. Two officers remained at the house to wait for a social worker to take custody of Wood\u2019s children. After the social worker left with the children, the officers searched the second floor attic.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Because the search was a direct result of Wood\u2019s arrest, the search was not \u201ctotally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officers entered the residence to conduct a criminal investigation and were still so employed when they began the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>The majority suggests that the police officers went upstairs to search for a missing teenager. Although the officers testified that they knew Wood\u2019s wife\u2019s teenage son had been reported missing and that they were searching for the missing juvenile, the evidence belies that assertion. Officer Gholson testified that the Wood family had reported missing a juvenile <em>\u201cthat lived at [Wood\u2019s] residence.\u201d </em>Nevertheless, the officers stated that they were searching <em>Wood\u2019s </em>residence for the missing juvenile. The explanation that they were searching for a missing child at that child\u2019s own residence is dubious at best. The evidence also proved that after the officers arrested Wood and removed him from the residence at approximately midnight, the two officers who remained behind called a social worker. Two children were sleeping in the living room. While the two officers waited in the residence for the social worker to arrive, they did not look for the teenager. Only after the social worker left with the other children did they begin their search. The delay in conducting the search casts additional doubt on the officers\u2019 assertion that they were merely looking for the juvenile. Moreover, even if they were searching the house to find a teenager who had been reported missing by the parents who resided in the house, the officers obviously were conducting a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">I disagree with the suggestion that the police officers were permitted to enter rooms of the house to avoid leaving anyone behind or to assure that the house was secure. The officers stated that the search was instigated, in part, by the fact that they saw a light on upstairs. The police were not privileged to explore other rooms in the residence merely because they saw a light on in a residence at night. They did not inquire of Wood or his wife about whether other people were in the residence and did not call aloud while in the residence to ascertain whether anyone else was present. They heard no noise to suggest another person was there. Moreover, if they truly were concerned about securing the residence, they would not have left the door to the residence unlocked, as they did, when they left the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Because the evidence indicates that the search for the child was \u201ca pretext concealing an investigatory police motive,\u201d <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 376, 96 S.Ct. at 3100, I would hold that the search was not a valid exercise of the community caretaking function.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in using the community caretaking function to admit the evidence and I would further hold that the evidence should have been suppressed. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">. I believe that the Supreme Court has also circumscribed searches under the community caretaker doctrine by requiring the search to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>based upon a police department\u2019s \"standard procedure\u201d designed to protect the public and the police from danger. <em>Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 443, 93 S.Ct. at 2529; <em>accord Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 369, 374-75, 96 S.Ct. at 3097, 3099-3100. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Virginia has noted that <em>Cady </em>and <em>Opperman </em>\"involved the admissibility of incriminating evidence discovered during a standard police procedure of inventorying property that had properly been taken into custody.\u201d <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 243, 247, 462 S.E.2d 109, 111 (1995). None of those factors exists in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b712-5\">UPON A PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC BEFORE THE FULL COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">On May 12, 1997 came Calvin Arthur Wood, by court-appointed counsel, and filed a petition praying that the Court set aside the judgment rendered herein on May 6, 1997, and grant a rehearing en banc thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">On consideration whereof, the petition for rehearing en banc is granted, the mandate entered herein on May 6, 1997 is stayed pending the decision of the Court en banc, and the appeal is reinstated on the docket of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The parties shall file briefs in compliance with Rule 5A:35.
