On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in finding that the juvenile and domestic relations district court (juvenile court) had no jurisdiction to hear his petitions because he had been certified previously to stand trial as an adult. He contends that because he was not convicted on the earlier charge, Code \u00a7 16.1-271 did not divest the juvenile court of its responsibility to conduct a transfer hearing. For the reasons that follow, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s judgment, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">In 1994, appellant was charged with an unrelated robbery. At that time, he was certified by the juvenile court to stand trial as an adult pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1, and the matter was transferred to the circuit court. At trial, appellant was acquitted of this 1994 robbery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>On the evening of March 28, 1995, an altercation occurred between appellant and Alphonso Wilkerson (Wilkerson). While at the home of a mutual friend, appellant approached Wilkerson and attempted to sell him drugs. When Wilkerson refused, appellant demanded Wilkerson\u2019s money and assaulted him. A fight ensued. During their struggle, appellant and Wilkerson ended up in the kitchen, in front of the refrigerator. Appellant shot Wilkerson in the leg at close range. The bullet passed through Wilkerson\u2019s leg and through the refrigerator door. When Wilkerson fell to the floor, appellant stood over him and demanded his money at gunpoint. Wilkerson handed appellant all of his money. At the time of this incident, appellant was sixteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">As a result of this event, appellant was charged on July 10, 1995, with robbery, malicious wounding, breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny while armed with a deadly weapon, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. These charges were brought initially by petition in the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">On July 26, 1995, a transfer hearing was held in the juvenile court. At that time, the juvenile court found that it had no jurisdiction over appellant, because he had been previously certified as an adult and transferred to the circuit court in 1994, on the unrelated robbery charge. Appellant appealed the juvenile court\u2019s finding of no jurisdiction to the circuit court, arguing that the juvenile court\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 16.1-271 wrongly divested appellant of a transfer hearing. Appellant argued, in the alternative, that the first two paragraphs of Code \u00a7 16.1-271 are at odds with each other and should be strictly construed against the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">On August 22, 1995, the circuit court found that appellant was not entitled to a transfer hearing and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">[T]he first paragraph of the statute says unequivocally that the trial or treatment of a juvenile as an adult shall preclude the [jjuvenile [cjourt from taking jurisdiction, and that statute was amended in 1994 to leave out the word, not, so I have to conclude that the [(legislature meant exactly what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>said. Then the question is, is whether that paragraph is inconsistent with the second paragraph which it seems to be on the first reading, and the second paragraph, of course, provides that a juvenile who is tried and convicted in a[c]ircuit [cjourt as an adult, then shall be considered and treated as an adult thereafter for all purposes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">\u2022i* ^ \u2022I* \u2022!&gt; &gt;\u00a1&gt; \u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">... I[ ] conclude [ ] that the first paragraph was intentionally done. It has got to be read as consistently] as possible. It is consistent with the second paragraph in that the first paragraph precludes the [jjuvenile [cjourt from taking jurisdiction. Then the second paragraph when read in that light would ... be that after a juvenile has been convicted, has been transferred and convicted in the [cjircuit [cjourt, then any other proceedings which were then pending, regardless of whether they were antecedent or subsequent would then be transferred to the [cjircuit [cjourt, and if you\u2019re going under the first paragraph then if the defendant had been transferred, then the [cjourt loses jurisdiction of any subsequent offenses, but it does not lose jurisdiction of any other offenses that might have been occurring at the same time. So, my ruling will be is that the [cjourt, the [jjuvenile [cjourt did lose jurisdiction. It did not have jurisdiction to conduct a transfer hearing or a probable cause hearing, the probable cause hearing being part of the transfer hearing, and as a result now the [cjourt had no jurisdiction to do anything in this case whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Following the court\u2019s ruling, new warrants were issued in the general district court, which certified the charges to the grand jury. The grand jury indicted appellant on all four charges. At the bench trial in the circuit court on November 8, 1995, the court struck the breaking and entering charge, convicted appellant of robbery, malicious wounding, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and sentenced him to serve twenty-three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>II. JURISDICTION UNDER CODE \u00a7 16.1-271</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in its interpretation of Code \u00a7 16.1-271 and therefore improperly denied appellant a transfer hearing. Appellant argues that under Code \u00a7 16.1-271, before the juvenile court loses jurisdiction over a juvenile in a criminal proceeding, the juvenile must have been tried <em>and convicted </em>by the circuit court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-271 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">The <em>trial or treatment </em>of a juvenile as an adult pursuant to the provisions of this chapter <em>shall preclude </em>the juvenile court from taking jurisdiction of such juvenile for subsequent offenses committed by that juvenile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">Any juvenile who is <em>tried and convicted </em>in a circuit court as an adult under the provisions of this article shall be considered and treated as an adult in any criminal proceeding resulting from any alleged future criminal acts and any disposed of by the juvenile court at the time of the criminal conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">All procedures and dispositions applicable to adults charged with such a criminal offense shall apply in such cases, including, but not limited to, arrest; probable cause determination by a magistrate or grand jury; the use of a warrant, summons, or capias instead of a petition to initiate the case; adult bail; preliminary hearing and right to counsel provisions; trial in a court having jurisdiction over adults; and trial and sentencing as an adult. <em>The provisions of this article regarding a transfer hearing shall not be applicable to such juveniles.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">(Emphasis added.) Prior to July 1, 1994, the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 16.1-271 provided that \u201c[t]he trial or treatment of a juvenile as an adult ... shall <em>not </em>preclude the [juvenile] court from taking jurisdiction of such juvenile for subsequent offenses committed by that juvenile.\u201d (Emphasis added.) </p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>We will \u201cconstrue a statute to promote the end for which it was enacted, if such an interpretation can reasonably be made from the language used. Generally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994) (citations omitted). \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.... \u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Additionally, we apply the following principle of statutory construction when an amendment to a statute is clear and unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201c \u2018While in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity. Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\"><em>Weinberg v. Given, </em>252 Va. 221, 225-26, 476 S.E.2d 502, 504 (1996) (quoting Barr <em>v. Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)) (citations omitted). A presumption normally arises that the legislature intends a substantive change in the law when it adds a new provision to an existing statute by an amendatory act. <em>See, e.g., Werres v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 744, 746, 454 S.E.2d 36, 37 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Finally, we assume that the legislature\u2019s amendments to the law are purposeful and not unnecessary. <em>See Cape Henry Towers, Inc. v. National Gypsum Co., </em>229 Va. 596, 600-01, 331 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1985). We presume that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>legislature acted with full knowledge of the law as it affected the subject matter. <em>Id. </em>It is our task to adopt a construction that gives import to the legislative purpose and the words used.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The intent and effect of the legislature\u2019s deletion of the word \u201cnot\u201d in the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 16.1-271 by the 1994 amendment could not be clearer. The language indicates, without question, that the legislature intended this amendment to divest the juvenile court of jurisdiction over a juvenile once the juvenile has been previously <em>tried or treated </em>as an adult under this chapter. Further, the language is mandatory: The juvenile court <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>be precluded from exercising jurisdiction of any \u201csuch juvenile for <em>subsequent offenses </em>committed by that juvenile.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-271 (emphasis added). These provisions are not ambiguous, and must be given their plain, obvious, and rational meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Additionally, the three paragraphs of Code \u00a7 16.1-271 are not necessarily inconsistent. The first paragraph specifically applies to \u201csubsequent offenses.\u201d The second paragraph concerns the effect of a juvenile\u2019s conviction in circuit court as an adult with respect to any charges pending in the juvenile court at the time of conviction, regardless of whether the pending charge was prior to or subsequent to the charge upon which the juvenile was transferred, tried, and convicted as an adult. Finally, the third paragraph was not substantially changed by the 1994 amendment, and addresses the particular procedures that apply to a juvenile charged as an adult under this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">To adopt a different construction would render the statute strained, ambiguous, illogical, and in contravention of the legislature\u2019s clear intent when it deleted the word \u201cnot\u201d from the first paragraph. Prior to 1994, the treatment of a juvenile as an adult specifically did not prohibit the juvenile court from exercising jurisdiction on subsequent charges. However, the 1994 amendment intentionally altered that procedure and now precludes the juvenile court from exercising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>jurisdiction over a juvenile once the juvenile has been <em>tried or treated </em>as an adult on an earlier charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
