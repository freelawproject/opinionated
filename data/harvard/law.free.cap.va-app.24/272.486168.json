Allen, Jr.\u2019s request for a determination of nonreviewability under the certif\u00edcate of public need (COPN) statute, Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1 <em>et </em>seg.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and holding that statute to be unconstitutionally vague. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">On January 28, 1994, Dr. Allen, d/b/a Physicians Surgical Alliance, notified the commissioner that he intended to establish an \u201coutpatient surgical hospital\u201d in Sterling, Virginia. He requested a determination by the commissioner that the COPN statute did not apply to \u201coutpatient surgical hospitals\u201d and that COPN review and approval of his project was unnecessary. He contended that the COPN statute defined a universe of \u201cmedical care facilities,\u201d and strictly limited to that universe the facilities requiring COPN review. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1. He contended that although licensure law recognizes an \u201coutpatient surgical hospital\u201d as a type of medical care facility, Code \u00a7 32.1-123 <em>et seq., </em>\u201coutpatient surgical hospitals\u201d are not included specifically in the list of medical facilities requiring COPN review under Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1. He contended that, therefore, the COPN statute did not apply to his proposed facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">By letter dated February 16, 1994, the Department of Health (Department) rejected Dr. Allen\u2019s argument. The Department concluded that Dr. Allen\u2019s proposed medical care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>facility was a specialized center developed for the provision of outpatient or ambulatory surgery. It recommended that COPN review and approval of his facility be required for certification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ******9In issuing its recommendation, the Department stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">This categorization of a type of medical care facility in the COPN law is neither subtle nor ambiguous. A plain reading of this term does not allow for any reasonable suggestion that facilities such as those developed by Dr. Allen would not fall within its ambit simply because they are specialized centers for outpatient or ambulatory surgery that require licensure in Virginia as outpatient surgical hospitals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">As you know, the authors of Virginia\u2019s COPN law did not establish the list of medical care facilities subject to COPN review as a subset of the medical care facilities subject to licensure in Virginia. There are categories of \u201cmedical care facility\u201d subject to COPN review which are not licensed by the Department of Health or any other state agency as medical care facilities. Likewise, the Department requires licensure of certain types of facilities and services that are not regulated under the COPN law. Therefore the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>you have been able to detect some congruence in the nomenclature used to describe medical care facilities subject to COPN review and medical care facilities subject to licensure in Virginia is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Upon Dr. Allen\u2019s request for reconsideration of the Department\u2019s recommendation, the commission conducted an informal fact-finding conference. Dr. Allen argued that the phrase \u201c[sjpecialized centers or clinics or that portion of a physician\u2019s office developed for the provision of outpatient or ambulatory surgery,\u201d as applied to him, was Unconstitutionally vague. On November 17, 1994, the commissioner rejected Dr. Allen\u2019s argument and held that he was required to undergo COPN review to obtain approval of his proposed outpatient surgical hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Pursuant to the provisions of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:15 to 9-6.14:21, Dr. Allen appealed the commissioner\u2019s case decision to the trial court, which, after hearing argument on August 31, 1995, issued a letter opinion reversing the commissioner\u2019s decision and ruling that the COPN statute and regulations were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the commissioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">On August 8, 1996, we made a preliminary determination that the transcript of the August 31, 1995 hearing had not been filed timely. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:8. We ordered the commissioner to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed. We directed that the parties\u2019 briefs contain argument concerning: (1) whether the transcript of the August 31, 1995 hearing was properly made a part of the record on appeal; and (2) if not, whether that transcript is indispensable to a determination of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">We conclude that the transcript was not properly made a part of the record on appeal. However, we further find that the transcript is not indispensable to a determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>issues. <em>See Turner v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 96, 99, 341 S.E.2d 400, 401-02 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u201cUnder the VAPA, the circuit court\u2019s role in an appeal from an agency decision is equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court. In this sense, the General Assembly has provided that a circuit court acts as an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>School Board v. Nicely, </em>12 Va.App. 1051, 1062, 408 S.E.2d 545, 551 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The July 7, 1994 informal fact-finding conference and the Department\u2019s accumulation of the agency record performed a trial court\u2019s traditional fact-finding function. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:16, 9-6.14:17. The agency record was filed timely in the trial court. The August 31,1995 hearing before the trial court was an appellate proceeding. The trial court\u2019s function was limited to considering the parties\u2019 legal arguments based upon the agency record. While our consideration of the issues might have been aided by a review of the August 31, 1995 transcript, the written record, encompassing the parties\u2019 prehearing briefs, the trial court\u2019s letter opinion, and the agency record, along with transcripts of the Department\u2019s informal fact-finding conference and argument before the trial court to reconsider its decision, provides a sufficient record for our consideration of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In his petition for appeal to the trial court, Dr. Allen asserted that the commissioner\u2019s decision was illegal because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">[I]t is based upon a portion of the Certificate of Public Need statute which itself is unconstitutionally vague under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. Specifically, the determination of the Acting Commissioner that Petitioner\u2019s project required prior Certificate of Public Need approval was based on his conclusion that the outpatient surgical hospital Petitioner proposed to establish comprised a \u201cspecialized center or clinic\u201d, which term or terms are undefined in statute or regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In argument before the trial court, Dr. Allen contended that an amendment to the definition of \u201cmedical care facility\u201d limited COPN review to entities that are licensed or required to be licensed. He argued that the COPN regulations were inconsistent with this statutory amendment, and that, therefore, the COPN statute and regulations were unconstitutionally vague. The commissioner argues that this contention was not embraced within Dr. Allen\u2019s petition for review in the trial court and that the trial court erred in considering it. For purposes of this appeal, we give Dr. Allen\u2019s petition a broad reading and, for purposes of decision, we accept without deciding that his petition was broad enough to encompass the questioned argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The trial court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The second issue considered is the relationship of the COPN statutory definition of \u201cmedical care facility\u201d, [ ] and the State Medical Facilities Plan (SMFP). Petitioner says that the new statutory language made licensure a prerequisite to the necessity for COPN review....</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The Court finds that the SMFP, read in conjunction with COPN statute, ignores significant statutory changes. The Court must follow the statute when such a conflict exists. The statutory language changed from \u201cwhether or not [licensed or] required to be licensed\u201d to \u201cwhether licensed or required to be licensed.\u201d The effect of the revision is a substantive one that must be reflected in the regulations. The effect is that the question \u201cWhat facility needs licensure?\u201d, is difficult to clearly answer. This equivocal result means the statute and regulations are fatally vague, facially and in application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>If we accept the trial court\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1, that statute provides a two-step predicate for the requirement of COPN review: (1) the proposed facility must require licensure, and (2) the proposed facility must fall within one of the classifications set forth in Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1. Dr. Allen has never disputed that his proposed facility requires licensure. Therefore, \u201cwhat facility needs licensure\u201d is not an issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The commissioner determined that Dr. Allen\u2019s proposed facility would be a specialized center or clinic developed for the provision of out-patient or ambulatory surgery, thus bringing it within the scope of Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1 \u201cmedical care facility (9).\u201d While this determination may leave room for argument, it does not pose an issue of classification that is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this case is remanded for review on the question whether the record developed before the commission supports the commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\">. Following the circuit court\u2019s ruling, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1, modifying.the definition of a \u201cmedical care facility,\u201d and the provisions regarding the application of review to said facilities. 1996 Va. Acts ch. 1050. For purposes of this opinion, we refer to the statute as it was written in 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\">.
