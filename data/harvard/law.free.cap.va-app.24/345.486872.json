On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in: (1) admitting the hearsay statement of a codefendant and (2) refusing to sever his trial from that of the other defendants. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">On July 24, 1994, Sergeant Kenneth Hutton (Hutton) of the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (MWAA) was on pickpocket detail at National Airport. At 7:10 p.m., he saw and \u201crecognized\u201d appellant, who was walking toward the United Airlines section of the airport with a green garment bag over his shoulder. Hutton followed appellant, lost sight of him, but then found him in the American Airlines baggage claim area. As Hutton watched, appellant approached several people waiting to claim their baggage, standing inches behind each person for a few minutes and then moving on to another person. Appellant never claimed any baggage. He then went to the cab stand outside the Northwest Airlines baggage claim area, where he approached several people in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">When appellant left the cab stand, he entered the front passenger seat of a green Mercury automobile driven by codefendant, Joyce Chambers (Chambers), and put the green garment bag in the backseat. A few minutes later, Chambers drove toward the U.S. Air terminal. Sergeant Alan Pelleranan (Pelleranan), a MWAA officer, saw the car arrive with appellant, Chambers, Alice Coffey (Coffey), and Linda Williams (Williams). Appellant, Chambers, and Williams went into the terminal. When Hutton arrived at the terminal, he saw appellant and Chambers exit the terminal and walk to the shuttle bus stop. Appellant again approached people from behind while Chambers stood about fifteen feet away, looking around. Appellant and Chambers returned to the Mercury, parked nearby. The police then arrested appellant, Chambers, Coffey, and Williams, and transported them to the police station. After being advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, Chambers told Hutton that she and the others had come to the airport \u201cto steal ... to pick pockets.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Appellant, Coffey, and Chambers were indicted for grand larceny, credit card theft, and conspiracy to commit a felony. Before trial, appellant moved to sever his trial from that of the other two defendants, arguing that (1) the Commonwealth had not established good cause for a joint trial and (2) a joint trial would prejudice him. Appellant specifically alleged that Chambers\u2019 statement about coming to the airport to \u201csteal\u201d and to \u201cpick pockets\u201d was inadmissible against him and its admission at a joint trial would constitute prejudice. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney stated that he would \u201cnot be able to use some of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence if I try [the defendants] together,\u201d and told the court, \u201cI think it is unlikely that I\u2019m going to use [the statement], I certainly will not use it unless I can find some legitimate case law to back it up.\u201d The court denied the motion to sever, because \u201c[t]he Commonwealth has stated that they are not going to use [the statement] at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">At trial, appellant renewed his motion to sever. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney represented that \u201cit appears that if the statement is properly redacted, it can be used.\u201d The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">[T]he statement is admissible if it\u2019s redacted to, [\u201c]I came to steal,[\u201d] where it\u2019s clear there[ ] [are] no references to the other individuals that are on trial.... The Court will ... instruct the jury at the time that that statement or that confession should be received as evidence of guilt only to the person who uttered the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Later, appellant renewed his objection to Chambers\u2019 statement and requested a cautionary instruction, arguing that the statement was inadmissible against him because it was a statement made by a co-conspirator after the termination of the conspiracy and would not be admissible against him in a separate trial. At trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney argued that, even in a joint trial, the statement was admissible against appellant under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth, but allowed the statement only in the redacted form. The court refused to give a cautionary instruction, because \u201c[t]he Commonwealth has demonstrated the basis for the application of the exception to the hearsay rule of declaration against interest. It think it\u2019s proper and it will be admitted [without instruction].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On March 23, 1995, appellant was convicted of grand larceny, three counts of credit card theft, and conspiracy to commit a felony. The trial court sentenced appellant to five consecutive twelve-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">II. ADMISSION OF CODEFENDANT\u2019S CONFESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Appellant asserts that his right to confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution was violated. He argues that the trial court erred in admitting Chambers\u2019 statement because, as the statement of a co-conspirator made after the termination of the conspiracy, it was inadmissible hearsay. Additionally, appellant contends that, under <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), and <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), the admission of codefendant Chambers\u2019 statement in a joint trial without proper redaction and cautionary instruction violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">A. Right to Confrontation</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>against him.\u201d The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment right of an accused in a criminal case to confront the witnesses against him includes the right of cross-examination. <em>See Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 813, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3145, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990); <em>Richardson, </em>481 U.S. at 206, 107 S.Ct. at 1706-07; <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 79, 91 S.Ct. 210, 214-15, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970); <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The United States Supreme Court recently held that \u201c[w]here a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant is <em>not directly admissible </em>against the defendant, the Confrontation Clause bars its admission at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed not to consider it against the defendant, and even if the defendant\u2019s own confession is admitted against him.\u201d <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 193, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 1719, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987) (emphasis added) (citation omitted); <em>see also Thompson v. State of South Carolina, </em>672 F.Supp. 896, 902 (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the converse of this standard, where the confession is <em>directly admissible </em>against the defendant, it may be admissible in the joint trial of the codefendants. <em>See Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 814, 110 S.Ct. at 3146 (\u201c \u2018[T]he [Confrontation] Clause permits, where necessary, the admission of certain hearsay statements against a defendant despite the defendant\u2019s inability to confront the declarant at trial.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Evans, </em>400 U.S. at 89, 91 S.Ct. at 219-20 (holding that the right of confrontation is not absolute and that a statement sufficiently clothed with indicia of reliability is properly placed before a jury though there is no confrontation with the declarant). Thus, the statement of a non-testifying codefendant \u201cdirectly admissible\u201d against another codefendant under an exception to the hearsay rule may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>admitted in a joint trial without violating the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">B. Declaration Against Penal Interest</p>\n<p id=\"AEL\">We accept for purposes of this opinion appellant\u2019s contention that Chambers\u2019 statement would be excluded as the statement of a co-conspirator made after the termination of the conspiracy. <em>See Scaggs v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 1, 4-5, 359 S.E.2d 830, 831-32 (1987) (\u201c[A] co-conspirator\u2019s statements made in the defendant\u2019s absence after the termination of the conspiracy are inadmissible in evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial because such statements are hearsay.\u201d). However, Chambers\u2019 statement is independently admissible against appellant as a declaration against penal interest made by an unavailable witness. \u201c \u00a3[I]t is settled in Virginia that ... a declaration against penal interest is recognized as an exception to. the hearsay rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, 359 S.E.2d at 832 (citation omitted). <em>See Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 455 S.E.2d 219, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 233, 133 L.Ed.2d 162 (1995); <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 5, 8, 441 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1994); <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 145, 147, 326 S.E.2d 693, 694 (1985). <em>See also Raia v. Commonwealth, 23 </em>Va.App. 546, 552, 478 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1996) (\u201cAdmissibility into evidence of the statement against interests of an unavailable witness is a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule in Virginia.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In <em>Chandler, </em>the defendant and accomplices robbed a local convenience store. During the robbery, defendant shot and killed the store clerk. At trial, the court admitted a police officer\u2019s testimony regarding statements made by a codefendant during the officer\u2019s investigation of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 455 S.E.2d at 224. Defendant objected to the admission of this statement, arguing that \u201cportions of [codefendant\u2019s] statement were not self-inculpatory but rather incriminated [defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the admissibility of the statement, based on the statement\u2019s reliability, and held that the statement clearly implicated codefendant as an accomplice and that \u201cthe inherent reliability of her statement is established by her expressed belief that she could be charged as an accessory to the crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 455 S.E.2d at 224. The Court also decided that the reliability of the codefendant\u2019s statement was \u201cbuttressed\u201d by other evidence presented at trial and concluded that the codefendant\u2019s \u201centire statement is admissible as a declaration against penal interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 455 S.E.2d at 225. Thus, as the Court established in <em>Chandler, </em>a co-conspirator\u2019s statement made after the termination of the conspiracy may be admissible under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In Virginia, for a declaration against penal interest to be admissible, it must meet the following requirements: (1) the declarant must be \u201cunavailable to testify at trial,\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>18 Va.App. at 8, 441 S.E.2d at 49; (2) the statement must be against the declarant\u2019s interest at the time it was made; <em>see Boney v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 638, 643, 432 S.E.2d 7, 10 (1993); and (3) the declarant must be aware at the time the statement is made that it is against his or her interest to make it. <em>Id. See also Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 550, 478 S.E.2d at 330 (1996).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While it is settled in Virginia that a declaration against penal interest is recognized as an exception to the hearsay rule, \u201c \u2018such a declaration made out of court by ... [an] unavailable witness is admissible <em>only </em>upon a showing that the declaration is <em>reliable.\u2019 \u201d Morris, </em>229 Va. at 147, 326 S.E.2d at 694 (quoting <em>Ellison v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 404, 408-09, 247 S.E.2d 685, 688 (1978)) (emphasis added). Thus, by requiring the statement to be sufficiently reliable, the exception as recognized in Virginia comports with the standard articulated in <em>York.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In determining whether a statement is against a declarant\u2019s penal interest, \u201cthe inherent reliability of [the] statement is established by [the declarant\u2019s] expressed belief that she could be charged as an accessory to the crimes.\u201d <em>Chandler, </em>249 Va. at 279, 455 S.E.2d at 224. It is generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>recognized that such \u201c[declarations against interest are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule because it is felt that a person will not usually make statements damaging to his own interests unless such statements are true.\u201d 2 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-12 (4th ed. 1996). Where the evidence shows the declarant\u2019s \u201cknowledge of and complicity in the criminal act and expose[s] [declarant] to liability as an accessory to the crimes,\u201d the statement will be admissible as a declaration against penal interest. <em>Chandler, </em>249 Va. at 279, 455 S.E.2d at 225. Notably, the Virginia Supreme Court has made \u201c\u2018no attempt ... to delineate the quality or quantity of evidence necessary to establish reliability; the question must be left to the sound discretion of the trial court, to be determined upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\u2019\u201d <em>Morris, </em>229 Va. at 147, 326 S.E.2d at 694 (citation omitted). However, the Court emphasized that \u201c \u2018in any case, once it has been established that a third-party confession has been made, the crucial issue is whether the <em>content </em>of the confession is trustworthy. And determination of this issue turns upon whether ... the case is one where \u201cthere is anything substantial other than the bare confession to connect the declarant with the crime.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). <em>Accord Scaggs, </em>5 Va.App. at 5, 359 S.E.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In the instant case, the Commonwealth was not required to call Chambers as a witness to establish her unavailability because, as a codefendant in the joint trial, Chambers could not be compelled to testify. <em>See </em>Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8 (no defendant shall \u201cbe compelled in any criminal proceeding to give evidence against himself\u2019). <em>See also Harrell, </em>788 F.2d at 1526 (holding that codefendant declarants were unavailable for purposes of the declaration against penal interest exception because \u201cthey were on trial and thus were privileged against testifying\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Codefendant Chambers made the statement after being arrested for credit card theft. The other evidence in the case clearly established the context of her statement and corroborated its trustworthiness and its reliability, even though reliability was not raised as an issue. Thus, in a separate trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Chambers\u2019 confession that she and the other defendants went to the airport \u201cto steal ... to pick pockets\u201d would meet the requirements of <em>Chandler, </em>and would be admissible against appellant as a declaration against Chambers\u2019 penal interest. <em>See also Raia, </em>23 Va.App. 546, 478 S.E.2d 328 (1996) (applying Virginia\u2019s three-prong test and holding that an accomplice\u2019s statement against her penal interest was admissible in the separate trial of the defendant). It remains for us to determine whether the same statement would be admissible in a joint trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">C. Joint Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Appellant argues that, in the context of a joint trial under Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1, the admission of Chambers\u2019 statement effectively denied his Sixth Amendment right to confront Chambers, and the trial court should have excluded her confession. Appellant relies on the United States Supreme Court cases of <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), to support this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>Bruton </em>was a joint trial of two codefendants charged with armed postal robbery. The trial court admitted in evidence the confession of one codefendant implicating the other defendant. The trial court then gave a \u201cclear, concise and understandable instruction\u201d that the confession could only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>be used against the declarant codefendant, and should be disregarded with respect to the defendant. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. However, the United States Supreme Court reversed, holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">[B]ecause of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to [declarant\u2019s] incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt, admission of [declarant\u2019s] confession in this <em>joint trial </em>violated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">391 U.S. at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 1622 (emphasis added). The Court further stated that \u201climiting instructions [are not acceptable] as an adequate substitute for petitioner\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628. The Court \u201cemphasize[d] that the hearsay statement inculpating petitioner was <em>dearly inadmissible against him under the traditional rules of evidence, </em>the problem arising only because the statement was ... admissible against the [codefendant] declarant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. at 1624 n. 3 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court reversed the conviction on the ground that the admission, in a joint trial, of a statement admissible against the codefendant declarant but inadmissible against the other defendant violated the other defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Richardson, </em>the other case relied on by appellant, dealt with a similar issue. In <em>Richardson, </em>also a joint trial, the trial court admitted over defendant\u2019s objection a codefendant\u2019s confession that had been redacted to omit all references to defendant. Although the codefendant\u2019s statement did not directly implicate defendant, as did the statement in <em>Bruton, </em>other evidence properly admitted against defendant at trial connected him to the codefendant\u2019s confession. The Supreme Court determined that even when a codefendant\u2019s confession is redacted to delete any reference to the defendant, if other evidence properly admitted links the defendant to the confession, a Confrontation Clause violation remains. The Court specifically held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is <em>not </em>violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>with <em>a proper limiting instruction </em>when ... the confession <em>is redacted </em>to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 1709 (emphasis added). The Court distinguished <em>Bruton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">If limited to facially incriminating confessions, <em>Bruton </em>can be complied with by redaction.... If extended to confessions incriminating by connection, not only is that not possible, but it is not even possible to predict the admissibility of a confession in advance of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Id. at </em>208-09, 107 S.Ct. at 1708. Thus, in a joint trial where the codefendant\u2019s statement is redacted but other evidence links the defendant to the statement and <em>indirectly </em>implicates the defendant, <em>Richardson </em>requires both redaction and a limiting instruction to cure the prejudice to a defendant and render the statement admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Both <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Richardson </em>involved a joint trial in which a codefendant\u2019s confession implicated the other defendant, but was otherwise inadmissible against him. Neither <em>Bruton </em>nor <em>Richardson </em>addressed a case in which a codefendant\u2019s confession is directly admissible against the other defendant under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Thus, appellant\u2019s reliance on the rationale of these cases is misplaced. Unlike <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Richardson, </em>in the case at bar, Chambers\u2019 statement was independently and directly admissible against appellant under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, specifically, the declaration against penal interest exception. <em>See </em>Section II.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The <em>Bruton </em>Court declined to address the admissibility of such a statement under \u201cany recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>See Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 128 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. at 1624 n. 3. <em>Bruton </em>\u201csuggested that each jurisdiction can shape its own rules of evidence to admit some codefendant confessions as evidence against [another] defendant, under an exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d without violating the Confrontation Clause, \u201ceven where the defendant has no opportunity to cross-examine the confessing codefendant.\u201d James B. Haddad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>and Richard G. Agin, <em>A Potential Revolution in Bruton. Doctrine: Is Bruton Applicable Where Domestic Evidence Rules Prohibit Use of a Codefendant\u2019s Confession as Evidence Against a Defendant although the Confrontation Clause Would Allow Such Use?, </em>81 Crim.L. &amp; Criminology 235, 236 (1990) (citing <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 128 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. at 1624 n. 3). <em>See also Evans, </em>400 U.S. at 81, 91 S.Ct. at 216 (\u201c[I]t does not follow that because the federal courts have declined to extend the hearsay exception ... such an extension automatically violates the Confrontation Clause.\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[i]n jurisdictions that admit inculpatory declarations against penal interest, admission of the codefendant\u2019s \u2018constitutionally reliable\u2019 confession as evidence against a defendant will avoid <em>Bruton. ... </em>The <em>Bruton </em>limiting instruction problem disappears once such a statement is admitted against the defendant.\u201d Haddad, <em>supra, </em>at 251.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In <em>Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, </em>the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that, in a joint trial, admission of a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s statement against another defendant under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule does not violate the other defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. In addressing the <em>Bruton </em>issue, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE1\">In deciding the applicability of the <em>Bruton </em>rule to the present case, it is important to note that the rule does not purport to hold that a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is violated whenever hearsay evidence is admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>against him and he is not able to cross-examine the person to whom the hearsay statement is attributed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 303 N.E.2d 338, 345 (1973). The court further observed that \u201c[a] number of cases decided since the <em>Bruton </em>case have held that defendants\u2019 rights under the Confrontation Clause ... were not violated where hearsay evidence of a statement of a co-conspirator inculpating the defendant was admitted without opportunity by the defendant to cross-examine the co-conspirator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court explained the grounds for the admissibility of the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Y\">If the defendant had been tried alone, the same testimony would have been admissible against him under [a] hearsay rule exception.... In such a case the admissibility of the testimony would not depend on the availability of [the codefendant] for cross-examination by the defendant. Therefore the fact that the defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine [the codefendant] did not constitute a violation of his right under the Confrontation Clause.... For the same reason, there was no violation of the rule of the <em>Bruton </em>case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Id. </em>303 N.E.2d at 347.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The limited scope of the <em>Bruton </em>holding was further noted in <em>Cruz. </em>The <em>Cruz </em>Court held that \u201cwhere a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant is not <em>directly admissible </em>against the defendant, the Confrontation Clause bars its admission at their joint trial.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 194, 107 S.Ct. at 1719 (emphasis added). Additionally, the Seventh Circuit construed the <em>Bruton </em>decision as \u201cpredicated upon the <em>inadmissibility </em>of the statement against the defendant under the rules of evidence,\u201d thus reserving judgment on the admissibility of the hearsay statement under the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>applicable in the jurisdiction. <em>United States v. York, </em>933 F.2d 1343, 1362 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 916, 112 S.Ct. 321, 116 L.Ed.2d 262 (1991) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court held that \u201c[wjhere the [evidentiary] rules so permit, <em>Bruton </em>is inapplicable. Thus, under <em>Bruton </em>and subsequent cases, whether an inculpatory hearsay statement violates the [C]onfrontation [C]lause turns on the context of the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1362 n. 3.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit observed that \u201c[c]ases interpreting <em>Bruton </em>have found its holding inapplicable where the evidence alleged to violate <em>Bruton </em>principles was properly admissible against the complaining party.\u201d <em>United States v. Astling, </em>733 F.2d 1446, 1455 (11th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The rationale of these cases is persuasive. Neither the Virginia nor the United States Supreme Court has addressed the admissibility in a joint trial of a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s statement inculpating another defendant when a recognized exception to the hearsay rule rendered the codefendant\u2019s statement -admissible against the other defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>However, the Virginia rules of evidence permit a codefendant\u2019s statement against interest to be used against another defendant when the defendants are separately tried. We see no reason why the rule should be different in a joint trial and can find no objection in any United States Supreme Court case where the codefendant\u2019s confession is admissible against another defendant under an independent, \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting Chambers\u2019 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">III. MOTION TO SEVER</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever because the improper admission of Chambers\u2019 statement prejudiced him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">On motion of the Commonwealth, for good cause shown, the court, in its <em>discretion, </em>may order persons charged with participating in contemporaneous and related acts or occurrences or in a series of acts or occurrences constituting an offense or offenses to be tried jointly unless such joint trial would constitute prejudice to a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">(Emphasis added). We have held that \u201c[i]n determining whether a joint trial would prejudice a defendant, the trial court should require \u2018[t]he party moving for severance [to] establish that <em>actual prejudice </em>would result from a joint trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goodson v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 61, 71, 467 S.E.2d 848, 853 (1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Reavis, </em>48 F.3d 763, 767 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 2597, 132 L.Ed.2d 844 (1995)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>[Prejudice requiring severance ... results only when \u201cthere is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence .... The risk of prejudice will vary with the facts in each case,\u201d and \u201cthe determination of the risk of prejudice ... [is left] to the sound discretion of the [trial] court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aur\"><em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 406, 412, 470 S.E.2d 579, 582 (1996) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We hold that the record in this case shows that appellant, the party moving for severance, failed to establish that actual prejudice resulted from the joint trial. The trial court properly admitted Chambers\u2019 statement under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Goodson, </em>22 Va.App. at 71, 467 S.E.2d at 853. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">.

In some jurisdictions, the admissibility of this exception, for Sixth Amendment purposes, is unsettled. In <em>United States v.

The <em>Battiste </em>court concluded that this type of statement is \u201cpresumably unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1000-02. As support for this holding, the court referred to <em>Lee v.
