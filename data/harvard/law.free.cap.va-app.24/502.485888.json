The court concluded that father owed no obligation of support because the court had previously terminated his parental rights with respect to the child. We find the court\u2019s order terminating father\u2019s parental rights is void for want of jurisdiction and, therefore, reverse the court\u2019s order dismissing mother\u2019s petition for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Maury Curtis Church (father) and Tracy Ann Church (mother) were divorced by final decree entered October 10, 1989. Independent of the parties\u2019 admissions, the court found that the parties\u2019 child \u201cha[d] been abandoned by his father; [and] that it [wa]s in the best interest of the ... child to terminate [father\u2019s] residual parental rights.\u201d The court noted the parties had agreed that \u201cit [wa]s in the best interest of their ... child ... to terminate the residual parental rights of the father.\u201d Thus, as part of the final decree, the court terminated father\u2019s residual parental rights, acting pursuant to former Code \u00a7 16.1-279(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The decree also eliminated father\u2019s obligation to provide child support and noted that mother \u201cagreed to renounce any claim she may have for delinquent child support from [father].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In July 1995, mother filed a petition for child support. She acknowledged that the 1989 decree terminated father\u2019s obligation to support the child but argued that the child\u2019s best interests required a support order. Father filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the 1989 decree barred the relief wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>sought and that the time for seeking relief from that decree had expired. The court granted father\u2019s motion, finding that it had jurisdiction to terminate father\u2019s parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1 \u2014 241 (A)(5) and 16.1-244.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Mother failed to perfect a timely appeal from the October 1989 decree terminating father\u2019s residual parental rights. Therefore, to have that decree set aside, mother must establish that it is void. <em>Rook v. Rook, </em>233 Va. 92, 95, 353 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1987). A judgment entered by a court that does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter is void. <em>Id. </em>Although the parties agreed to the termination of father\u2019s parental rights, together with his support obligation, jurisdiction cannot be established by the parties\u2019 consent. <em>Lucas v. Biller, </em>204 Va. 309, 313, 130 S.E.2d 582, 585 (1963).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">A court possesses only such jurisdictional powers as are directly, or indirectly, expressly or by implication, conferred on it by the constitution or legislation of the sovereignty on behalf of which it functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">20 Am.Jur.2d <em>Courts </em>\u00a7 58 (1995); <em>see also Thacker v. Hubard, </em>122 Va. 379, 94 S.E. 929 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Jurisdiction to terminate parental rights can be found neither in the common law nor in a court\u2019s inherent authority to proceed under its general equity powers. <em>Willis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>v. Gamez, </em>20 Va.App. 75, 81-82, 455 S.E.2d 274, 277-78 (1995) (\u201c \u2018there was [no] legal authority under the common law ... for a total relinquishment of parental rights and obligations or any inherent authority in any court to terminate them\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Carroll County Dept. of Social Servs. v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 577 A.2d 14, 25 (1990)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, jurisdiction of the circuit courts to terminate parental rights must be found, if at all, within the statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 81-83, 455 S.E.2d at 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Under Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme, the circumstances providing authority for the termination of parental rights, and the attendant obligation of support, are limited. While Title 16.1 of the Virginia Code provides for the termination of parental rights, the reliance on it by the husband and the trial court is misplaced. Title 16.1, denominated, \u201cCourts Not of Record,\u201d is manifestly limited to addressing only the power of the J &amp; DR courts; Code \u00a7 16.1-241, entitled, \u201cJurisdiction,\u201d cannot be relied upon to confer original jurisdiction on the circuit courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The legislature\u2019s reference in Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 241(A)(5) to concurrent jurisdiction, upon which the circuit court relied in granting father\u2019s motion to dismiss, does not constitute a grant of jurisdiction to the chancery courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It simply affirms that, where jurisdiction is granted to the circuit courts, the jurisdiction of the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court is not exclusive. <em>See Poole v. Poole, </em>210 Va. 442, 444, 171 S.E.2d 685, 686-87 (1970). Jurisdiction that does not exist, <em>a fortiori, </em>cannot be concurrent with another court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In Virginia, the jurisdictional powers of the circuit courts are conferred by Code \u00a7 17-123. That section grants to the circuit courts \u201coriginal and general jurisdiction of all cases in chancery and civil cases at law\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction of all other matters ... made cognizable therein by law.\u201d The circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction in matters relating to minor children is further \u201cmade cognizable\u201d in three titles: Title 20, Title 63.1 and Title 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We note, preliminarily, that Chapter 11 of Title 63.1, which confers chancery jurisdiction to circuit courts in adoption proceedings, necessarily implicates the termination of parental rights. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-233 (\u201cThe birth parents ... shall, by ... final order of adoption, be divested of all legal rights and obligations in respect to the child____\u201d); <em>Doe v. Doe, </em>222 Va. 736, 746, 284 S.E.2d 799, 805 (1981); <em>Cage v. Harrisonburg Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>13 Va.App. 246, 249, 410 S.E.2d 405, 406 (1991). In the present case, however, the circuit court clearly did not proceed under the adoption statute. We also note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Chapter 2 of Title 31, which grants chancery jurisdiction to the circuit courts over guardianship, likewise does not confer jurisdiction to terminate parental rights; in any event, the court in the present case did not proceed under that section. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 31-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Thus, of the three titles, only Title 20 could arguably be invoked here, as the trial court was proceeding in chancery on the matter of divorce, specifically adjudicating child custody and support. Chapter 6 of Title 20 confers chancery jurisdiction to the circuit courts over divorce, and over the custody, visitation and support of children, upon the court\u2019s exercise of its jurisdiction over divorce. Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-96, 20-107.2. However, under this title, there is no express grant of jurisdiction to the circuit court to terminate parental rights, and none can arise by implication. It is well established in Virginia that \u201cjurisdiction in divorce suits is purely statutory, and it cannot be acquired by the courts inferentially or through indirection.\u201d <em>Stroop v. Stroop, </em>10 Va.App. 611, 616, 394 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1990); <em>see also Cutshaw v. Cutshaw, </em>220 Va. 638, 641, 261 S.E.2d 52, 54 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Moreover, in addition to the jurisdictional infirmity in the case, the court\u2019s termination of parental rights was based, in part, on the parties\u2019 agreement to terminate father\u2019s obligation to pay child support. Indeed, the court refused to set the termination aside on the ground that mother had agreed to it. Such an agreement is void as against public policy and unenforceable as a matter of law under the principles of <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 298-99, 449 S.E.2d 55, 56-57 (1994), which we find applicable here. <em>Cf. Orlandi v. Orlandi, </em>23 Va.App. 21, 27 n. 3, 473 S.E.2d 716, 719 n. 3 (1996). A decree based on such an agreement must likewise be deemed void.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In sum, the court in this case lacked jurisdiction to terminate father\u2019s parental rights. Thus, the court\u2019s decree, terminating father\u2019s parental rights and concomitantly relieving him of his duty to support, is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse the court\u2019s decision granting father\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. Former Code \u00a7 16.1-279(A) in effect at the time of the final decree is, for all purposes material to this appeal, identical to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">If a child is found to be ... abandoned by his parent ... the juvenile court or the circuit court may make ...

At common law, the parent-child relationship was defined, in part, in terms of the legal duty of the parent to support his or her infant child. <em>See, e.g., McClaugherty v. McClaugherty, </em>180 Va. 51, 65, 21 S.E.2d 761, 767 (1942); <em>Carroll County Dept. of Social Servs. v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 577 A.2d 14, 23 (1990) (\"Parenthood is both a biological and a legal status.\u201d). The common law knew no mechanism by which a parent\u2019s duty to support his or her child could be terminated. <em>See Edelmann, </em>577 A.2d at 25 (\u201c[T]he duty arising from the relation of parent and child ... is a duty of which the parent can in no circumstances divest himself.\u201d). Likewise, the termination or transfer of the common law duty to support could not be achieved through contract. <em>See Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>170 Va. 458, 477, 197 S.E. 426, 434 (1938); <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 299, 449 S.E.2d 55, 57 (1994). Because the chancery courts\u2019 inherent powers to protect the rights of minors were derived from the common law, those powers do not encompass the authority to terminate parental rights. <em>Willis, </em>20 Va.App. at 82, 455 S.E.2d at 277-78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">. A review of the title\u2019s specific provisions shows that Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 241(A)(5) confers jurisdiction on the J &amp; DR courts over all cases involving, <em>inter alia, </em>\"[t]he custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child ...
