Wileman, Jr., appeals his convictions of grand larceny by false pretenses in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-178 and 18.2-95 and of making and uttering a bad check in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-181. Wileman contends: (1) the trial court erred in admitting opinion testimony that the signature on a check allegedly made and passed by Wileman and the signature on a bank signature card were the same; (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for making and uttering a bad check; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">We hold (1) that the trial court properly admitted opinion testimony concerning the legitimacy of Wileman\u2019s signature, by a bank officer with more than twenty-four years of experience whose duties involved verification of customer signatures; (2) that the testimony of a bank teller, who knew Wileman by sight, that Wileman presented the check, coupled with testimony that the signature on the bad check was Wileman\u2019s, was sufficient to sustain Wileman\u2019s conviction for making and uttering a bad check; and (3) that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Wileman\u2019s conviction for grand larceny by false pretenses. For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\n<em>Bad Check</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">On May 9, 1994, check # 1020, drawn on the United Jersey Bank for $8,975, was deposited into the South Boston Bank account of Wileman\u2019s business, J.L. Motors. The check was received by Michelle Howerton, a teller at South Boston. Howerton testified that she was positive that the check was deposited by Wileman. South Boston\u2019s banking procedures require that tellers ask for identification for any deposit by any customer they do not recognize and that when doing so, that they indicate on the check that identification was requested and received. Howerton stated that although she did not recall the exact transaction in which Wileman presented check # 1020, she was certain it was Wileman, because if she had not recognized the presenter of the check, even where the check was being deposited into the depositor\u2019s account, she would have requested identification and so indicated on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Wileman\u2019s account was given immediate credit for the sum of check # 1020 when the check was originally deposited. Check # 1020 was returned to South Boston marked, \u201cAcct. Not Found.\u201d Subsequently, Wileman wrote other checks on the South Boston account for which there were insufficient funds as a result of the nonpayment of check # 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">At trial, Lonnie Powell, Vice-President of South Boston Bank and the chief executive officer for local branches, testified that he had been a banker for twenty-four years and that his duties included identifying and authenticating signatures of bank customers. Wileman\u2019s South Boston signature card was introduced without objection and Powell compared the signature card with Wileman\u2019s signature on two of Wileman\u2019s other checks and the signature appearing on check # 1020. Powell concluded that the signatures were the same on the three instruments and the signature card. Counsel for Wileman objected to Powell\u2019s testimony, arguing that Powell was not a handwriting expert and that his opinion invaded the province of the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\n<em>Opinion Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In Virginia, a lay witness may only offer an opinion as to the authenticity of an alleged writing of a particular person where the witness has seen and is familiar with that person\u2019s writing. <em>Adams v. Ristine, </em>138 Va. 273, 287, 122 S.E. 126, 130 (1924). In essence, \u201cthe lay witness who has previously seen the genuine writing of the person alleged to have written the questioned document is \u2018comparing\u2019 the questioned document with his recollection of the genuine handwriting.\u201d 1 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 15-11 (4th ed.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">A lay witness who is not familiar with a particular person\u2019s handwriting cannot be provided a sample of that person\u2019s writing for purposes of familiarizing himself or herself with it, before comparing an alleged sample to a genuine sample. Such a side-by-side comparison of genuine samples and alleged samples, by a party unfamiliar with the alleged writer\u2019s handwriting, is the sole province of the expert witness. <em>Hanriot v. Sherwood, </em>7 Hans. (82 Va.) 1, 10 (1884). Where a witness is neither an expert nor familiar with the writings of the person whose writings are in question, it is error for the trial court to allow the witness to offer an opinion on such a comparison, as the jury is as qualified as the witness to make the comparison. <em>Adams, </em>138 Va. at 287, 122 S.E. at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Whether a particular witness is qualified to testify as an expert is \u201clargely a matter in the discretion of the trial court, and its rulings allowing a witness to testify will not be disturbed unless it clearly appears that he was not qualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 122 S.E. at 130. Here, a comparison of Wileman\u2019s signatures was made by Powell, a Vice-President at South Boston with twenty-four years of banking experience. Powell testified that he was regularly called upon to identify and authenticate his customers\u2019 signatures. Powell\u2019s work experience was sufficient to qualify him as an expert witness. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Updike v. Texas Co., </em>147 Va. 208, 212, 136 S.E. 591, 593 (1927); <em>Adams, </em>138 Va. at 288-89, 122 S.E. at 130.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">In <em>Adams, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court held that, bank officials and clerks of court of long experience in examining and comparing signatures and writings may, in the discretion of the trial court, give their opinion as to whether or not the body of the will, the signature thereto and the names of one attesting witness were written in the same ink as the name of the other attesting witness, and as to which of the two was the later writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">138 Va. at 288, 122 S.E. at 130 (citing <em>Savage v. Bowen, </em>103 Va. 540, 49 S.E. 668 (1905)). Accordingly, the Court ruled that the trial court did not err in permitting a banker with twenty years of experience, who testified that his duties required him to \u201cexamine signatures as a daily incident of his business, to testify as an expert.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In <em>Updike, </em>the Court held it was error, under its ruling in <em>Adams, </em>not to permit a witness with thirty years of banking experience, whose duties required him to \u201cscrutinize handwritings\u201d and who was then vice-president and cashier of the Lynchburg National Bank, to compare genuine and alleged signatures of the defendant and to offer an opinion on the validity of the questioned signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Powell\u2019s qualifications were equal to or surpassed the bankers\u2019 qualifications who were deemed qualified in the <em>Updike </em>and <em>Adams </em>cases to give an opinion on the validity of a person\u2019s signature. Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in overruling Wileman\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection that Powell was not qualified as an expert witness on the validity of a signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Further, we find that the record contained sufficient circumstantial evidence to sustain a finding that the signature card of Wileman\u2019s J.L. Motors business account was a genuine sample of Wileman\u2019s signature. While no document may be introduced into evidence without proper authentication, <em>Proctor v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 937, 938, 419 S.E.2d 867, 868 (1992), circumstantial evidence may establish authenticity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number><em>Walters v. Littleton, </em>223 Va. 446, 451, 290 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1982). The signature card, which was produced from a place of proper custody, was admitted without objection. Testimony established that the card produced was the signature card on file for Wileman\u2019s business account, J.L. Motors. It was undisputed that Wileman was one of two partners trading as J.L. Motors. Further, the card was introduced with bank statements for the J.L. Motors account, with checks and deposit slips corresponding to the deposits and withdrawals recorded in the statements. Evidence was also introduced that Wileman issued a number of checks on the J.L. Motors account and that he regularly made deposits and withdrawals from the account. The evidence proved that South Boston\u2019s bank records reflected no assertion by Wileman that any of the checks drawn on his account were forged or were otherwise unauthorized. A number of the checks drawn on the account bear notations in the memo section that reference expenses for auto parts, insurance, and other such expenses that may reasonably be inferred to relate to the operation of an automobile business.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Accordingly, we find the evidence sufficient to prove that the signature card was an authentic sample of Wileman\u2019s signature. Thus we affirm the trial court\u2019s admission of the card as a genuine sample of Wileman\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Bad Check Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Relying on the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Doyle v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 677, 187 S.E.2d 201 (1972); <em>Kayh v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 424, 247 S.E.2d 696 (1978); and <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 349, 315 S.E.2d 239 (1984), Wileman asserts that Howerton\u2019s identification of Wile-man as the presenter of check # 1020 was insufficient to prove that Wileman was the presenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In <em>Doyle, </em>the defendant was accused of having issued three bad checks in a department store where he made separate purchases from three different sales associates on the same day. None of the sales associates knew the purchaser and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>three requested identification from the purchaser, who presented a driver\u2019s license. After ascertaining that the individual depicted on the driver\u2019s license was the presenter, all three sales associates made notations on the respective checks indicating that identification had been requested and received. At trial, none of the sales associates could recall the specific transaction in which they had received the check, but all three testified that they would not have accepted the check if the person presenting the check had not been the person depicted on the photo identification. <em>Doyle, </em>212 Va. at 678, 187 S.E.2d at 202. The Court rejected this evidence as insufficient to establish the identity of the individual who issued the bad checks. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The Court reached the same conclusion on substantially the same facts in <em>Kayh, </em>where a Sears\u2019 sales associate testified that before he accepted a purchaser\u2019s check he requested identification. He then ascertained that the presenter and person depicted on the identification were the same and copied the driver\u2019s license number onto the check. Like the sales associates in <em>Doyle, </em>the sales associate testified that he could not remember the specific transaction in which the check had been presented to him, but he presumed it to have been the defendant because he would not have taken the check without having verified that the person pictured on the I.D. was the presenter. Citing their holding in <em>Doyle, </em>the <em>Kayh </em>Court rejected this evidence as insufficient to establish the defendant as the presenter. 219 Va. at 427, 247 S.E.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Subsequent to the <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Kayh </em>decisions, Code \u00a7 19.2-270.3 was enacted, providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">In any prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-181 or Code \u00a7 18.2-182 for the presentation of a bad check, draft or order, the following shall be admissible in any proceeding, hearing or trial of the case and may be deemed competent evidence with respect to the identity of the person who delivered the check, draft or order in question to the payee, cashing party or its representative:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">1. The unpaid or dishonored check, draft or order, bearing a notation thereon of the full name, residence address, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>home telephone number, and either the driver\u2019s license, social security or credit account identification number of the person who delivered such check, draft or order to the payee, the cashing party or its representative, and bearing the initials of the representative of the payee or cashing party to whom the check, draft or order was delivered, as evidence that such information was transcribed on such check, draft or order at the time of such delivery....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4U\">In <em>Edwards, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court rejected the argument that Code \u00a7 19.2-270.3 established a rebuttable presumption that a given check was presented \u201cby the person whose name, address, telephone number, and social security or other identifying number are noted thereon,\u201d and reiterated that <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Kayh </em>remained dispositive. 227 Va. at 352-53, 315 S.E.2d at 240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Doyle, Kayh, </em>and <em>Edwards </em>presented scenarios in which the presenter of the bad check could have stolen both the checks and the identification or could have falsified the identification documents. By either means, the presenter could have successfully concealed his true identity and implicated an innocent party as the passer of the bad checks. Recognizing this, the Virginia Supreme Court found the evidence in all three cases insufficient to establish the identity of the presenter because doing so would require basing an inference upon an inference. Quoting <em>Doyle, </em>the <em>Kayh </em>Court explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOl\">\u201cTo hold this evidence sufficient to establish the identity of the defendant as the person who presented the checks would require us to base an inference upon an inference. It would first require us to infer that the identification documents and photographs, which are not in evidence, were genuine and authentic. It would then require us to infer and assume that the defendant was the person who presented the checks since this person presented identification of the defendant. This we cannot do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><em>Kayh, </em>219 Va. at 427, 247 S.E.2d at 698 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The case before us is distinguishable because no such double inference is required. Unlike <em>Doyle, Kayh, </em>and <em>Ed</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>wards, </em>where the sales persons relied upon identification documents to establish the presenter\u2019s identity, here, the person accepting the check knew the presenter. Consequently, there is no possibility that the presenter\u2019s identity was concealed or falsified. Howerton testified that she knew Wileman by sight and that based on her personal recognition of him, she would accept his deposits without requiring identification. Accordingly, because the proscribed double inference is not at issue, we hold Howerton\u2019s testimony was admissible to prove that Wileman was the presenter of check # 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Howerton\u2019s testimony, coupled with Powell\u2019s opinion that the signatures on check # 1020 and on the signature card were the same, is sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Wileman was the person who presented the fraudulent check to South Boston. Accordingly, we affirm Wileman\u2019s conviction of making and uttering a bad check.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>Grand Larceny</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">On February 9, 1994, Wileman and his business partner purchased nine cars, including a 1988 Pontiac LeMans, at an auction conducted by Capital Auto. Capital Auto gave Wile-man seven of the nine vehicle titles and indicated that the other two titles would be forwarded to Wileman when they were received. Wileman paid Capital Auto with a check for $9,780, drawn on Central \u2019Fidelity Bank. Wileman\u2019s check was returned from Central Fidelity to Capital Auto marked \u201cpayment stopped.\u201d Capital Auto attempted to contact Wileman but was unable to locate him. Consequently, Capital Auto did not forward the two remaining titles to Wileman.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On February 12, 1994, Byron and Angela Moore bought the 1988 Pontiac LeMans from Wileman at J.L. Motors. They paid Wileman $600 down and financed the remainder through J.L. Motors. Wileman gave the Moores a receipt and thirty-day tags, explaining that he had just purchased the car and that \u201cthe title was being sent to him along with other vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>des.\u201d When the title failed to arrive within thirty days, Wileman sent the Moores an additional set of thirty-day tags, explaining that \u201che was having problems getting the title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">When the Moores learned that Wileman had failed to pay Capital Auto for the LeMans, they relinquished the vehide to the Department of Motor Vehides. The Moores contacted Wileman and he made an appointment to meet with them and refund their money. However, when the Moores arrived for their meeting, they found a note from Wileman explaining he could not meet them because his grandmother was sick. Wileman never repaid the Moores.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">To sustain a conviction of larceny by false pretenses, the Commonwealth must prove: (a) that the accused intended to defraud; (b) that a fraud actually occurred; (c) that the accused used false pretenses to perpetrate the fraud; and (d) that the false pretenses induced the owner to part with his property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\"><em>Wynne v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 459, 460, 445 S.E.2d 160, 161 (1994) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted). Here, the evidence proved that Wileman sold a 1988 Pontiac LeMans to the Moores three days after he purchased the car with a check on which payment was stopped. It is uncontroverted that in so doing, Wileman did not have title to the LeMans and that he concealed from the Moores the fact that he had not paid for the LeMans and consequently that he was not entitled to sell the vehicle. As a result of Wileman\u2019s representation that the title was being forwarded to him, the Moores made a $600 down payment to Wileman. Wileman implicitly represented that he owned the LeMans and that he was lawfully entitled to the certificate of title. The evidence proves that Wileman continued this deception by issuing a second set of thirty-day tags to the Moores and by explaining to them that he was having trouble getting title for their vehicle. Finally, the record indicates that once his fraud was discovered, Wileman promised to refund the Moores\u2019 money but ultimately failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The evidence that Wileman sold the Moores a car he had not paid for and for which he did not have legal title is sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding that Wileman had the requisite intent to defraud. Likewise, the evidence that the Moores gave Wileman $600 for a car, ownership of which he could not legally transfer, is sufficient proof that fraud actually occurred. The evidence that Wileman issued a receipt to the Moores for the car and that he dec\u00e9ived them regarding the status of the car\u2019s title adequately supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Wileman\u2019s larceny was accomplished by false pretenses and that such pretenses were the means by which the Moores were induced to part with their $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Wileman\u2019s conviction for grand larceny by false pretenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
