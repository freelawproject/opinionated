Wells Fargo argues that (1) the trial judge erred in affirming the commission\u2019s finding that Claude H. Collier\u2019s conduct did not constitute misconduct for purposes of Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2); (2) Wells Fargo did not condone Collier\u2019s conduct; (3) the commission erred in denying Wells Fargo\u2019s request to present additional evidence; and (4) the trial judge erred in refusing to remand the case to the commission for a hearing to determine whether the commission\u2019s decision was procured by extrinsic fraud. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Wells Fargo sells and installs fire alarms and security systems. Claude H. Collier began his employment as a sales representative in Wells Fargo\u2019s Richmond office on September 9, 1991. Collier was discharged on April 22, 1994, for failure to follow company policy, and he filed a claim for unemployment compensation. The commission\u2019s deputy granted Collier compensation. Wells Fargo appealed from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The evidence at the appeals examiner\u2019s hearing proved that in 1992 Collier conducted extensive negotiations to obtain Allied Signal as a Wells Fargo customer. Allied Signal had been serviced by one of Wells Fargo\u2019s competitors for twenty-five years. When Collier learned that Allied Signal no longer wanted to use the services of the competitor, he began negotiating a transaction valued at $500,000. Because Collier was a relatively new employee, his \u201cbranch manager ... was fully aware of every transaction that [he] was going through in negotiating\u201d with Allied Signal. Collier testified that \u201cAllied [Signal] was in the process of revamping [its] entire system\u201d and would switch to Wells Fargo only \u201cat a certain price.\u201d Collier also testified that after he showed his branch manager the documents about the cost of the job and informed him about the amount Allied Signal was willing to pay, his branch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>manager said, \u201cWell, when we do a takeover from another company, [it] can\u2019t go in as a direct sale. It has to go in as a leased system because of the investment.\u201d Collier further testified that a contract was not prepared because his branch manager stated, \u2018We will not enter into a contract at this time because we don\u2019t know how this thing is [going to] wind-up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Collier testified that because of the structure of the transaction his branch manager had to obtain the approval of the district sales manager, Bill Winter. Collier also testified that he and the branch manager informed Winter of the transaction, sent him information by facsimile, and generally kept him informed. Collier testified that Winter approved the transaction. Collier further testified that after the transaction was approved, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">I was called in to say, \u201cOkay. This is how the job\u2019s gonna go.\u201d [The branch manager] said, \u201cWe will go with that figure.\u201d And that figure was $325,000.00 for the installation, which is money up front to Wells Fargo, and $40,000.00 to be paid to us annually. A purchase order was written from Allied Signal to Wells Fargo explaining exactly that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArZ\">Collier testified that the branch manager, the applications engineer, and the accounting coordinator, the individual who calculated Collier\u2019s commissions, also approved the transaction. Collier stated that three of his supervisors had to give their approval before he was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Wells Fargo\u2019s representative at the hearing was Thomas N. Griffin, Jr., the current general manager for Wells Fargo\u2019s Washington D.C. office and a former general manager of the Richmond office. Although Griffin had little personal knowledge of Collier\u2019s case, he testified that \u201con a job this large, it would be very unusual for folks at much higher places not to know about it\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s fair to say ... the job could not have been approved without ... folks above [Collier] knowing about it.\u201d He also testified \u201cthat normally when we takeover something [from a competitor], we take over with a lease ... [because] you try to go in with as an attractive ... composition as you can, in order to make the fellow feel it is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>attractive alternative to what he already has.\u201d He further testified that \u201cthe general manager must approve sales commissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">After Wells Fargo\u2019s auditors raised questions regarding the transaction, a meeting was held among Collier, other employees at the Richmond branch, lawyers, and corporate officials. Collier testified that he and another employee were \u201cinstructed not to say anything\u201d at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Wells Fargo contended that Collier improperly treated the transaction, which should have been a lease-purchase arrangement, as a lease. Wells Fargo argued that, as a consequence, Collier was overpaid $11,570 in commissions and $5,021 in bonuses because under its commission policy sales representatives receive a greater commission for a lease than a sale. Wells Fargo also asserted that Collier failed to follow company policy because he used purchase orders that were submitted by Allied Signal and failed to execute Wells Fargo\u2019s approved, written contract in making the transaction with Allied Signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Based upon evidence at the hearing, the appeals examiner found that Collier \u201cdid not misrepresent any facts to [Wells Fargo]\u201d and that the \u201c[misrepresentations were made by [Collier\u2019s] superiors.\u201d The appeals examiner affirmed the decision of the deputy that Collier was qualified to receive unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Wells Fargo appealed that decision and requested that the commission take additional evidence. The commission denied Wells Fargo\u2019s request to take additional evidence. In ruling on the merits of the appeal, the commission found that Collier\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in the [Allied Signal] transaction was monitored by [Collier\u2019s] superiors, including his supervisor, the accounting coordinator, and the branch manager [and that the] transaction was also coordinated by the branch manager.\u201d The commission further found that Collier \u201cbelieved that approvals for certain aspects of the transaction had been obtained from the district sales manager.\u201d The commission also noted that Wells Fargo \u201cpresented no evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>policies which [Collier] is alleged to have violated.\u201d Although the commission stated that Collier demonstrated poor judgment by remaining silent as instructed at the meeting with Wells Fargo\u2019s lawyers, the commission found that \u201cthis alone is not sufficient to establish that [Collier] breached his duty of loyalty or honesty to the company.\u201d In view of the involvement of Collier\u2019s supervisors, the commission concluded that Wells Fargo \u201cdid not present sufficient evidence to establish that [Collier] was guilty of misconduct connected with work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Wells Fargo appealed to the circuit court. After the trial judge affirmed the commission\u2019s findings, Wells Fargo filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Wells Fargo first argues that the commission erred in finding that Wells Fargo failed to prove Collier engaged in misconduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u201cInitially, we note that in any judicial proceedings \u2018the findings of the commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be confined to questions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Israel v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Va.App. 169, 172, 372 S.E.2d 207, 209 (1988) (citations omitted). In accord with our usual standard of review, we \u201cconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding by the Commission.\u201d <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n v. Peninsula Emergency Physicians, Inc., </em>4 Va.App. 621, 626, 359 S.E.2d 552, 554 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Furthermore, the following principle is well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">[A]n employee is guilty of \u201cmisconduct connected with his work\u201d when he <em>deliberately </em>violates a company rule reasonably designed to protect the legitimate business interests of his employer, or when his acts or omissions are of such a nature or so recurrent as to manifest a <em>willful </em>disregard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>those interests and the duties and obligations he owes his employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><em>Branch v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>219 Va. 609, 611, 249 S.E.2d 180, 182 (1978). \u201cWhether an employee\u2019s behavior constitutes misconduct, however, is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by this court on appeal.\u201d <em>Israel, </em>7 Va. App. at 172, 372 S.E.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Wells Fargo argues that Collier violated its policies by structuring the Allied Signal transaction as a lease and by failing to use an approved Wells Fargo contract in the transaction. We agree with the commission\u2019s finding that Wells Fargo \u201cpresented no evidence of the policies that [Collier] is alleged to have violated.\u201d Moreover, the evidence proved that when Collier began negotiations with Allied Signal, he reported to his branch manager. Collier described the details of the negotiations to the branch manager and thereafter followed the instructions given to him by the branch manager. The evidence further proved that the details of the transaction were reported to the district sales manager, who also approved the transaction. Thus, even if Collier violated company policy, the evidence proved that Collier\u2019s conduct was at all times authorized and directed by his superiors. Because Collier was following the instructions of his immediate supervisor, Collier\u2019s deviation from the rule was authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Although misconduct may be established by proving \u201can act or omission showing willful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest,\u201d <em>Branch, </em>219 Va. at 611, 249 S.E.2d at 182, we cannot ignore the factual circumstances and say as a matter of law that an employee\u2019s conduct is not excused when the employee follows a supervisor\u2019s orders to deviate from a rule. The commission found and the evidence proved that the transaction, which involved the transfer of potentially profitable business from a competitor, was approved by Collier\u2019s immediate supervisor and also Wells Fargo\u2019s district manager. Collier\u2019s supervisors\u2019 approval could only have suggested to Collier that he was advancing Wells Fargo\u2019s interests. Therefore, we cannot say that the record necessarily proved that Collier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>engaged in misconduct. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence supports the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Wells Fargo next asserts that Collier failed to prove that Wells Fargo condoned Collier\u2019s conduct. Because Wells Fargo failed to prove that Collier engaged in misconduct, the burden never shifted to Collier to introduce evidence in mitigation. <em>See Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n v. Gantt, </em>7 Va.App. 631, 635, 376 S.E.2d 808, 811, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>9 Va.App. 225, 385 S.E.2d 247 (1989). Therefore, we need not consider the issue of condonation, because the commission properly declined to rule on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Wells Fargo also argues that the commission erred in refusing to reopen the record for additional evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The commission\u2019s regulations state as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The commission, in its discretion, may direct the taking of additional evidence after giving written notice of such hearing to the parties, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">1. It is shown that the additional evidence is material and not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral, could not have been presented at the prior hearing through the exercise of due diligence, and is likely to produce a different result at a new hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">2. The record of proceedings before the appeals examiner is insufficient to enable the commission to make proper, accurate, or complete findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">16 VAC 5-80-30(B) (formerly VR 300-01-08 \u00a7 3(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">After the hearing, Wells Fargo sought to introduce before the commission (1) \u201cdocuments pertaining to an unsuccessful wage claim which ... [Collier] perfected with the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry,\u201d and (2) \u201cdocuments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>supporting the contention of Wells Fargo that [Collier] was discharged for cause.\u201d Wells Fargo stated that it failed to introduce the evidence at the hearing because (1) the \u201cbifurcation of duties [within Wells Fargo\u2019s management structure] ... prevented all interested corporate officials at Wells Fargo ... from having any direct knowledge of all ongoing employment matters concerning [Collier];\u201d (2) at the time the hearing was scheduled, the Wells Fargo official who coordinated the hearing with the commission was unaware that Wells Fargo\u2019s key witnesses would be unavailable; and (3) the Wells Fargo employee who appeared at the hearing had, at best, secondhand knowledge of the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Finding that \u201cthe additional documents and other evidence could have been presented at the Appeals Examiner\u2019s hearing through the exercise of due diligence,\u201d the commission denied the motion to reopen the record. The commission also found that the record was adequate \u201cto enable the Commission to make proper, accurate and complete findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Because the evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings, we hold that the commission did not abuse its discretion in refusing to accept additional evidence. <em>See Old Dominion Elec. Coop. v. Virginia Elec. and Power Co., </em>237 Va. 385, 394-98, 377 S.E.2d 422, 427-29 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Wells Fargo further contends that the trial judge erred in refusing to remand the case to the commission for a hearing on Wells Fargo\u2019s claim of extrinsic fraud. Because the proffer was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of extrinsic fraud, we hold that the trial judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Extrinsic fraud is \u201cconduct which prevents a fair submission of the controversy to the court.\u201d <em>Jones v. Willard, </em>224 Va. 602, 607, 299 S.E.2d 504, 508 (1983). Wells Fargo argues that Collier committed extrinsic fraud by concealing corporate records, acting in concert with his supervisor in a plan to deceive corporate officials, and submitting documents to Allied Signal. The trial judge found that \u201cwhether these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>matters involve extrinsic fraud is of no moment [because] [t]hey were covered extensively in the hearings which afforded Wells Fargo an opportunity to present its position on them.\u201d The trial judge concluded that a remand was unnecessary because \u2018Wells Fargo ha[d] not made out a prima facie case of extrinsic fraud as contemplated by Va.Code \u00a7 60.2-625 and <em>Jones v. Willard, </em>224 Va. 602, 299 S.E.2d 504 (1983).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The documents that Wells Fargo alleges Collier concealed were found in Collier\u2019s desk, at Well\u2019s Fargo\u2019s Richmond office, after August 25, 1994. However, Collier had been discharged four months earlier, in April 1994. Wells Fargo clearly had access to the documents after Collier\u2019s termination in April. Thus, we cannot say that Collier engaged in conduct that prevented a fair resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">For these reasons, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
