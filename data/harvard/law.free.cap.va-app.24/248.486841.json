We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">On August 7, 1995, Ms. Cummings was arrested for driving while intoxicated \u201c2nd or subsequent offense,\u201d in violation of Fairfax County Code \u00a7 82-1-6. Pursuant to the administrative license suspension (ALS) provisions, Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2, her driver\u2019s license was suspended for seven days. She challenged the seven-day suspension in Fairfax General District Court and on August 11, 1995, the district court rescinded the suspension and wrote \u201cNo PC held\u201d on the warrant. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">On November 3, 1995, Ms. Cummings appeared for trial on both charges in the Fairfax General District Court. The Commonwealth moved to amend the warrant to allege a violation of the state code and to allege that the DWI charge was for a third or subsequent offense within five years. Counsel for Ms. Cummings stated that he had no objection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the amendments, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll stipulate to the prior convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Ms. Cummings then moved <em>in limine </em>that the arresting officer be prohibited from testifying about the arrest because the probable cause issue had been decided at the ALS hearing. The district court granted this motion. Before the case proceeded further, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney moved to <em>nolle prosequi </em>both charges. The district court granted this motion over Ms. Cummings\u2019 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On November 29, 1995, Ms. Cummings was indicted for driving while intoxicated, a third offense within five years. She was convicted on this indictment in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">I. DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Ms. Cummings contends that jeopardy attached when she stipulated in general district court to her two prior DWI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u201c Tn a trial before a court without a jury the danger of conviction or jeopardy of an accused begins when the trial has reached the stage where the Commonwealth begins to introduce its testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greenwalt v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 498, 500-01, 297 S.E.2d 709, 710 (1982) (quoting <em>Rosser v. Commonwealth, </em>159 Va. 1028, 1036, 167 S.E. 257, 259 (1933)). \u201c \u2018It is generally recognized that a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>if entered before jeopardy attached, does not bar further prosecution for the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 269, 281, 373 S.E.2d 328, 333 (1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">When the district court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s pretrial motion to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the charges, no witness had been sworn and the Commonwealth had introduced no evidence. The pretrial discussion between the district court judge and counsel was in the nature of an opening statement. <em>See Fields v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 300, 307, 343 S.E.2d 379, 382-83 (1986). Because the opening statement represents merely counsel\u2019s expectation as to the evidence to be presented and is not testimony, it is not evidence. <em>See Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 196, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987). Similarly, resolution of preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>matters prior to trial, before witnesses are sworn or testimony-taken, does not place the defendant in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 1, 406 S.E.2d 15 (1991), the defendant argued that the trial court\u2019s pretrial dismissal of an attempted capital murder charge, due to his earlier conviction for a lesser included offense, barred his subsequent prosecution for attempted murder. The Supreme Court noted that \u201cjeopardy attaches only after a jury is empaneled and sworn in a jury trial or the first witness is sworn in a bench trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 406 S.E.2d at 18. The Supreme Court ruled that because the dismissal occurred before the swearing of any -witness or the empaneling of jurors, it \u201c[could not] form the basis of a double jeopardy bar to the prosecution for attempted murder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In this case, the district court\u2019s pretrial granting of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the charges occurred before the Commonwealth presented any evidence, before any witness was sworn, and therefore, before jeopardy attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Ms. Cummings\u2019 mere offer to stipulate the prior convictions was not the equivalent of the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of testimony. The record manifests neither that the offer was accepted nor that the prior convictions were proffered as evidence. <em>See Low v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 48, 50, 396 S.E.2d 383, 384 (1990); <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 110, 112, 383 S.E.2d 767, 768-69 (1989) (noting that the Commonwealth is not required to accept a defendant\u2019s stipulation and is entitled to prove the indictment). Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that the double jeopardy prohibition did not bar the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">II. COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Ms. Cummings next contends that the Commonwealth was collaterally estopped from prosecuting her for DWI following the district court\u2019s finding at the ALS hearing that no probable cause supported Cummings\u2019 arrest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Our decision is controlled by <em>Jones v. City of Lynchburg, </em>23 Va.App. 167, 474 S.E.2d 863 (1996). Jones was arrested for DWI and his driver\u2019s license was suspended administratively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>for seven days. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2. In an ALS hearing, the district court found that the police lacked probable cause to arrest Jones and rescinded the license suspension. Affirming Jones\u2019 DWI conviction, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">Because the license suspension hearing was a civil proceeding, \u201c[a]ppIication of the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not constitutionally mandated\u201d [and] ... \u201c[b]ecause the \u2018issues of ultimate fact\u2019 in an administrative hearing held pursuant to [Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2] are different from those in a prosecution for the offense of driving while intoxicated, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar ... [a] subsequent prosecution for driving while intoxicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><em>Jones, </em>23 Va.App. at 171-72, 474 S.E.2d at 865 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
