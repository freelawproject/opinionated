Herrera\u2019s opening brief on appeal, challenging the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on criminal negligence, was received by the Clerk of this Court in November 1995. In October 1995, in an unrelated case, a panel of this Court held portions of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 unconstitutionally vague. <em>See Commonwealth v. Carter, </em>21 Va.App. 150, 462 S.E.2d 582 (1995). Herrera failed to challenge the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 40.1-103, both before the trial court and in his appellate brief; he also failed to argue on appeal that we should apply the holding in <em>Carter </em>to his case. Applying well established principles concerning the retroactive application of new rules for criminal prosecutions to cases pending on direct review, we find that' our decision in <em>Carter </em>deprived Herrera\u2019s trial court of jurisdiction to convict him under Code \u00a7 40.1-103. Because our decision in <em>Carter </em>implicates the jurisdiction of the trial court, we find it well within our province to address the issue <em>sua sponte. </em>For the reasons that follow, we reverse Herrera\u2019s conviction on jurisdictional grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">I. RELEVANT FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Herrera\u2019s indictment alleged that \u201cwhile having custody of [C.H.], a child then under the age of eighteen years, , [Herrera] did willfully or negligently cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that his life, health, or morals may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>endangered[, in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103]....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury convicted Herrera as charged, having found, as the trial court instructed, that he \u201cwillfully or negligently caused or permitted such child to be placed in a situation that its health or morals may be endangered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Subsequent to Herrera\u2019s conviction, while his case was pending on direct review, a panel of this Court held that the provision of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 declaring it a Class 6 felony \u201cfor any person ... having custody of any child ... to ... willfully or negligently ... cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that its life, health or morals may be endangered\u201d was unconstitutionally vague. <em>Commonwealth v. Carter, </em>21 Va.App. 150, 155, 462 S.E.2d 582, 585 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">II. JURISDICTIONAL BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u201cA court lacks jurisdiction to enter a criminal judgment if the judgment is predicated upon an unconstitutional or otherwise invalid statute or ordinance.\u201d <em>Fraser v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 775, 777, 433 S.E.2d 37, 38 (1993). <em>See also Ex parte Siebold, </em>100 U.S. 371, 376-77, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1879) (\u201cAn unconstitutional law is void and is not law. An offense created by it is not a crime. A conviction under it is not merely erroneous, but is illegal and void, and cannot be a legal cause of imprisonment.\u201d); <em>United States v. Baucum, 80 F.3d </em>539, 540-41 (D.C.Cir.1996) (\u201c[0]nee a statute has been declared unconstitutional, the ... courts thereafter have no jurisdiction over alleged violations (since there is no valid \u2018law ... \u2019 to enforce).... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Following <em>Carter, </em>the courts of Virginia clearly lack jurisdiction to convict an accused under the provisions of Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u00a7 40.1-103 that <em>Carter </em>held to be unconstitutional. The Commonwealth does not dispute this point. The question we face here is whether that jurisdictional bar also extends to a conviction obtained prior to the date of the <em>Carter </em>decision but one which is still pending on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201c[A] new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 948, 952, 408 S.E.2d 540, 542 (1991) (quoting <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 716, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987)); <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 359, 368, 382 S.E.2d 270, 275 (1989); <em>Taitano v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 342, 345 n. 1, 358 S.E.2d 590, 591 n. 1 (1987). The concept that judicial decisions are to be applied retroactively \u201cstems from the Blackstonian view, that judges do not make law; they find law. Judicial declaration of law is merely a statement of what the law has always been.\u201d <em>Cash v. Califano, </em>621 F.2d 626, 628 (4th Cir.1980). Principles of equity applicable to the treatment of defendants similarly situated compel the application of a new rule of law to cases still pending on direct review. <em>See Griffith, </em>479 U.S. at 323, 107 S.Ct. at 713 (\u201c[T]he integrity of judicial review requires that we apply that rule to all similar cases pending on direct review.\u201d). \u201c[T]he problem with not applying new rules to cases pending on direct review is \u2018the <em>actual inequity </em>that results when the Court chooses which of many similarly situated defendants should be the chance beneficiary\u2019 of a new rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 556 n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 2591 n. 16, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In light of these principles, we find that the rule of <em>Carter, </em>undoubtedly a \u201cnew rule\u201d for prosecutions under Code \u00a7 40.1-103, should be applied retroactively to Herrera\u2019s case. The provision of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 which this Court held unconstitutionally void for vagueness in <em>Carter </em>is precisely the provision on which Herrera was indicted, the jury was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>structed, and Herrera was ultimately convicted. By virtue of the retroactive application of <em>Carter, </em>we hold that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict Herrera.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">III. PROCEDURAL BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The Commonwealth contends that even if the principles governing the retroactive application of new rules for criminal prosecution require that <em>Carter </em>be applied retroactively to a case still pending on direct review, the rule of <em>Carter </em>should not be applied retroactively to Herrera\u2019s case because Herrera failed to preserve the issue. Indeed, Herrera failed to challenge the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 40.1-103, both before the trial court and in his appellate brief; he also failed to argue on appeal that we should apply the holding in <em>Carter </em>to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">It is well accepted that a question of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised <em>sua sponte </em>at any time. <em>E.g., Garrett v. Majied, </em>252 Va. 46, 48, 471 S.E.2d 479, 480 (1996). Likewise, it is well established that the contemporaneous objection rule may not be invoked to bar consideration of an appeal which attacks the jurisdiction of the circuit court. <em>E.g., Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement, </em>19 Va.App. 184, 191, 450 S.E.2d 172, 177 (1994). Because the dispositive issue here is one of jurisdiction, we hold that its determination is not procedurally defaulted by Herrera\u2019s failure to raise it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Our decision to apply the jurisdictional implications of <em>Carter </em>to Herrera\u2019s case is limited both by the procedural posture of Herrera\u2019s case and by well established principles concerning retroactive application of new rules for criminal prosecutions. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s concern regarding the potential effect of our decision on concluded cases, the retroactive application of <em>Carter </em>to a case pending on direct review does not disturb well-settled principles of finality. Rather, our decision effectuates the balance between finality and fairness that the principles of retroactivity seek to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">While the provisions of the statute under which Herrera was convicted were presumptively valid at the time of his trial, they are conclusively unconstitutional now and were so before he filed his appellate brief. We find that the principles applicable to the jurisdiction of the trial court and the retroactive application of new rules for criminal prosecutions as well as the imperative demands of fairness and equity demand that Herrera\u2019s conviction be reversed and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">. Accordingly, we decline to address Herrera\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on criminal negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\">. Code \u00a7 40.1-103 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">It shall be unlawful for any person ... having the custody of any child willfully or negligently to cause or permit the life of such child to be endangered or the health of such child to be injured, or willfully or negligently to cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that its life [or] health ... may be endangered.... Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, we do not hold that a defendant may raise a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute for the first time on appeal, on the theory that doing so implicates a question of subject matter jurisdiction. Nor does our decision require reviewing courts to determine the constitutionality of a statute <em>sua sponte </em>in all cases where the issue is not raised. The circumstances giving rise to such concerns in <em>Baucum, </em>upon which the Commonwealth relies, are not present here. Herrera does not ask us to rule on the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 for the first time on appeal, nor do we rule on the constitutional issue <em>sua sponte. </em>Here, unlike in <em>Baucum, </em>the constitutional issue has been resolved. <em>Carter </em>held the provisions of Code \u00a7 40.1-103, under which Herrera was convicted, unconstitutional. The issue addressed and resolved here is purely jurisdictional, and our decision is consistent with well established principles regarding the authority of the court to address matters of subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
