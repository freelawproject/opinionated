Walter medical benefits, United Airlines contends that the commission erred (1) in determining that Ms. Walter\u2019s photosensitivity was a compensable disease, and (2) in finding that Ms. Walter had proved by clear and convincing evidence that her photosensitivity resulted from her employment by United Airlines. We do not address United Airlines\u2019 second contention because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>The Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, 251 </em>Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795 (1996), compels our holding that gradually incurred photosensitivity is a noncompensable cumulative trauma or injury. <em>See Allied Fibers v. Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. 101, 474 S.E.2d 829 (1996). Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s award and dismiss Ms. Walter\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Ms. Walter has worked as a reservation agent for United Airlines for approximately six years. On August 25, 1995, she moved to a new work station, which was equipped with bright fluorescent lighting. At that time, her eyes began to burn. Within a week, she noticed darkening of a mole on her arm, developed speckles and coloration on her arms, and experienced joint pains and visual difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In awarding Ms. Walter medical benefits, the commission relied upon the medical opinions of Dr. Nancy V. Bruckner and Dr. Alan N. Moshell, both of whom diagnosed Ms. Walter as suffering from photosensitivity, defined as an \u201cabnormal reactivity of the skin to sunlight.\u201d <em>The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>551 (1987). Based upon Dr. Moshell\u2019s March 27, 1996 deposition, the commission held that Ms. Walter\u2019s condition was a disease, and that it resulted from long-term exposure to high intensity fluorescent lighting at her workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In <em>Jemmott, </em>the Supreme Court rejected a definition of disease that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">\u201c \u2018is so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin [and] would make unnecessary and meaningless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the [injury-by-accident and occupational disease] categories specifically set forth in the Act.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><em>Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 801-02 (citations omitted). The Court held that whether a claimant suffers from a compensable disease remains a mixed question of law and fact, and \u201cjust because a doctor opines that a particular impairment is a disease does not necessarily make it so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 801. In dismissing the commission\u2019s award of benefits, the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Y\">job-related impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, however labeled or however defined, are, as a matter of law, not compensable under the present provisions of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802. The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">[T]he opinion represents a clear refusal \u201cto broaden the scope of the Act to include job-related impairments arising from repetitive motion <em>or cumulative trauma ... </em>[and] we [have] held that <em>gradually incurred traumatic injuries </em>or <em>cumulative trauma conditions </em>were not compensable under the existing injury by accident-occupational disease dichotomy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802 (quoting <em>Merillat Indus., Inc. v. Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 433, 436 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1993)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In <em>Rhodes, </em>we considered an award for hearing impairment caused by exposure to noise at work. In concluding that a hearing loss from cumulative noise exposure is not a disease under the Act, we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">The Supreme Court\u2019s holding [under <em>Jemmott </em>] is clear and unequivocal, and leaves no doubt that in Virginia cumulative trauma conditions, regardless of whether they are caused by repetitive motion, are not compensable under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\"><em>Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. at 104, 474 S.E.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Following <em>Jemmott </em>and <em>Rhodes, </em>we conclude that Ms. Walter\u2019s photosensitivity, resulting from cumulative exposure to radiation by fluorescent lights, is a gradually incurred injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>and not an industrial disease within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Thus, Ms. Walter\u2019s photosensitivity is not compensable. Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s award of benefits and dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
