Tolley (claimant). Appellant contends (1) that the commission erred when it ruled that a claimant need only prove that he or she suffers from a psychiatric condition in order to qualify for permanent total disability benefits under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18).; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to prove that claimant suffered an injury to the brain; and (3) that the deputy commissioner abused his discretion when he refused to allow appellant to submit a post-hearing report from its expert. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Claimant, a former concrete plant worker, suffered a trauma-related psychological injury on August 31, 1982 when an unannounced explosion of 100 pounds of dynamite startled him while he was unloading concrete in a mine shaft. As a result of this accident, claimant has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and depression. The commission awarded temporary total disability benefits that expired after 500 weeks in March, 1992. On February 8, 1995, claimant filed an application for permanent total disability benefits, alleging that his accident in 1982 had caused an irreversible injury to his brain that rendered him permanently unemployable.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">A hearing was held before a deputy commissioner on July 7, 1995. At the hearing, claimant and his wife testified in detail regarding how claimant\u2019s injury has adversely impacted the non-vocational quality of his life and severely limited his ability to engage in many usual cognitive processes, such as working, socializing, driving, and engaging in an equal and intimate marital relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The medical evidence introduced at the hearing consisted of (1) claimant\u2019s medical records dating from 1972, (2) a report by claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Michael Hoffman, dated January 23,1995, and (3) a report by appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. C. Robert Showalter, dated June 30, 1995. The medical records indicated that after his accident, claimant has consistently been diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and, with some variation, either anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or depression. In his report, Dr. Hoffman reviewed his observations and treatment of claimant since 1987 and opined that claimant suffered from an incurable psychological disease that has resulted in his permanent unemployability. Dr. Showalter\u2019s report stated that after examining claimant once, he concluded that claimant suffered no organic brain deterioration and no irreversible brain injury and that claimant possesses the ability to carry out some level of minimally stressful, gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Following the hearing, the deputy commissioner held open the record so that appellant could take a previously scheduled deposition of Dr. Hoffman that had been thwarted when Dr. Hoffman was detained by local floods. The record was also held open to provide Dr. Hoffman the opportunity to respond to Dr. Showalter\u2019s report, which was not received by claimant until two days before the hearing. After the hearing, appellant declined to depose Dr. Hoffman and requested either that the record be closed or that Dr. Showalter be permitted to respond to any subsequent report accepted by the deputy commissioner from Dr. Hoffman. Claimant objected and requested the deputy commissioner to allow Dr. Hoffman to file a report in response to Dr. Showalter\u2019s and to then close the record. The deputy commissioner ruled that he would close the record after accepting a subsequent report from Dr. Hoffman but not from Dr. Showalter. Appellant objected to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">A second report by Dr. Hoffman was filed on September 6. In this report, Dr. Hoffman responded to the conclusions of Dr. Showalter. He stated that claimant had been consistently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>his accident and that this psychological disease has manifestations that make it an irreversible brain injury. Dr. Hoffman described the physical injury to claimant\u2019s brain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201c[Claimant] suffered a traumatic experience that directly resulted in a neurochemical imbalance in his central nervous system. These are changes that occur at a cellular level and are entirely beyond the patient\u2019s control. It is shown throughout the medical literature that post-traumatic responses often manifest themselves in neurochemical changes in the brain. Recent evidence from the National Institute of Mental Health shows specific structural changes within the neurons that is permanent and irreversible. Damage is done to neurosynaptic receptors and serotinergic neurotransmitters which frequently are extremely difficult to treat.... I reluctantly believe this is exactly what happened in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">On September 29, the deputy commissioner awarded permanent total disability benefits to claimant. He stated that claimant\u2019s case was governed by former Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) and found that claimant was permanently unemployable and that his injury had taken away some of his \u201cbroad range of \u2018usual\u2019 cognitive processes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Appellant appealed the decision of the deputy commissioner and the commission affirmed. The commission held that under the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d set forth in both former Code \u00a7 65.2-101 and <em>Burlington Mills Corp. v. Hagood, </em>177 Va. 204, 13 S.E.2d 291 (1941), an \u201cinjury to the brain\u201d includes \u201ca brain injury that manifests itself through a psychiatric condition.\u201d Relying on Dr. Hoffman\u2019s reports, the commission found that claimant had proved that he suffered from both a brain injury that manifested itself through a psychiatric condition and an actual physical injury to the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">TOTAL PERMANENT BENEFITS UNDER FORMER CODE \u00a7 65.1-56(18)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Appellant contends that the commission erred when it concluded that a claimant need only prove that he suffers from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>psychiatric condition in order to qualify for permanent total disability benefits under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) and when it found that claimant had suffered a physical injury to his brain. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Under the former version of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act), Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) provided an exception to the general rule that benefits for compensable injuries had definite time limits. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-54. Under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18), benefits continued \u201cfor the lifetime of the injured employee without limit as to total amount,\u201d if the employee suffered <em>inter alia </em>from \u201can injury to the brain resulting in incurable imbecility or insanity.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1\u2014 54, 65.1-56(18). In <em>Barnett v. D.L. Bromwell, Inc., </em>6 Va.App. 30, 36, 366 S.E.2d 271, 274 (1988), we held that a claimant establishes \u201cincurable imbecility\u201d by showing that his or her irreversible brain injury has both rendered claimant permanently unemployable and eliminated his or her ability to engage in a range of usual cognitive processes in non-vocational life.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Appellant does not contend that claimant failed to prove that he suffered from \u201cincurable imbecility\u201d as contemplated by former Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) and as further defined in <em>Barnett. </em>Instead, appellant asserts that claimant failed to satisfy former Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18)\u2019s requirement that he suffer an \u201cinjury to the brain.\u201d Appellant argues that the phrase \u201cinjury to the brain\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed to exclude conditions that are purely psychological in nature. However, we need not reach the issue of whether a claimant suffering from a purely psychological injury is entitled to total permanent disability benefits under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) because the medical evidence in this case proved that claimant suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d that resulted in \u201cstructural changes\u201d to the brain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cUnder familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, [claimant] in this instance.\u201d <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). \u201cIt lies within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>commission\u2019s authority to determine the facts and the weight of the evidence, and its findings in that regard, when supported by credible evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Rose v. Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990). \u201cA question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em>2 Va.App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak\"><em>Thomas v. Nordstrom, Pentagon City, </em>22 Va.App. 626, 631-32, 472 S.E.2d 288, 290 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove that claimant suffered an injury to his brain. First, the evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant suffered an \u201cinjury.\u201d Post-traumatic stress disorder is a compensable injury if caused by either a physical injury or an obvious sudden shock or fright arising in the course of employment. <em>See Hercules v. Gunther, </em>13 Va.App. 357, 362, 412 S.E.2d 185, 188 (1991); <em>Chesterfield County v. Dunn, </em>9 Va. App. 475, 477, 389 S.E.2d 180, 182 (1990). Claimant\u2019s medical records indicate that in the thirteen years following his accident, physicians have consistently diagnosed him as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his exposure to the unexpected dynamite blast.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In addition, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s injury was \u201cto his brain.\u201d Dr. Hoffman\u2019s first report demonstrates the necessary link between claimant\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder and his brain. In it, Dr. Hoffman reported that the symptoms of claimant\u2019s psychological problems included the impairment of the ability of claimant\u2019s brain to function, including the reduced ability of elamiant\u2019s brain to remember, concentrate, and maintain emotional stability. He concluded that claimant \u201chas suffered a severe brain injury.\u201d Dr. Hoffman\u2019s second report provided a more exact explanation of actual physical changes to claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ant\u2019s brain caused by post-traumatic stress disorder. Specifically, Dr. Hoffman stated that post-traumatic stress disorder results in irreversible structural changes within the neurons in the brain that include damage to neurosynaptic receptors and serotinergic neurotransmitters. He opined that such damage had occurred to claimant\u2019s brain and that this injury impaired claimant\u2019s cognitive abilities. Although Dr. Showalter opined that claimant\u2019s psychological injury did not injure his brain, \u201c[questions raised by conflicting medical opinions must be decided by the commission.\u201d <em>Penley v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>8 Va.App. 310, 318, 381 S.E.2d 231, 236 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">REFUSAL TO RECEIVE POST-HEARING EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Appellant contends that the deputy commissioner abused his discretion when he refused to allow Dr. Showalter to submit a report in response to Dr. Hoffman\u2019s post-hearing report. We disagree. While proceedings before the commission must comply with the requirements of due process, deputy commissioners generally have broad discretion to adapt the conduct of hearings to the circumstances of the case. <em>See Kum Ja Kim v. Sportswear, </em>10 Va.App. 460, 470, 393 S.E.2d 418, 424 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We hold that the deputy commissioner did not abuse his discretion by permitting Dr. Hoffman to file a report after appellant canceled his deposition. The record indicates that local floods prevented Dr. Hoffman from being deposed prior to the hearing. In addition, Dr. Hoffman was unable to respond to Dr. Showalter\u2019s report in time for the hearing because claimant did not receive the report until two days before the hearing was held. The deputy commissioner left the record open in order to accommodate appellant\u2019s deposition of Dr. Hoffman and to \u201cdoubly act as an opportunity for Dr. Hoffman to comment [on Dr. Showalter\u2019s report].\u201d When appellant canceled its deposition of Dr. Hoffman, it also eliminated the previously designated forum for Dr. Hoffman to comment on Dr. Showalter\u2019s report. The deputy commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>er was within his discretion to realize the remaining purpose for which the record was held open by permitting Dr. Hoffman to comment on Dr. Showalter\u2019s report in the alternative form of a report of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We also hold that the deputy commissioner did not abuse his discretion when he refused to receive a rebuttal report from Dr. Showalter after accepting Dr. Hoffman\u2019s post-hearing report. The record indicates that the deputy commissioner did not grant permission to appellant to file a subsequent report by Dr. Showalter. We find no abuse of discretion in the deputy commissioner\u2019s refusal to accept post-hearing evidence that was beyond the scope of evidence for which the record was held open.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Moreover, even if the deputy commissioner had abused his discretion by refusing to admit a post-hearing report from Dr. Showalter into the record, we could not review whether any prejudice occurred to appellant because appellant did not proffer the content of Dr. Showalter\u2019s report. When a deputy commissioner refuses to admit evidence for which the record was arguably held open, \u201cthe party must proffer or avouch the evidence for the record in order to preserve the ruling for appeal; otherwise, the appellate court has no basis to decide whether [the party was prejudiced by the deputy commissioner\u2019s error].\u201d <em>Smith v. Hylton, </em>14 Va.App. 354, 357-58, 416 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1992) (stating that party must proffer evidence in order to preserve for appeal an adverse ruling on the admissibility of evidence). Although appellant sent a letter to the deputy commissioner on August 29 objecting to the refusal of a subsequent report from Dr. Showalter, the record indicates that appellant never proffered the content of Dr. Showalter\u2019s response to Dr. Hoffman\u2019s report after it was filed on September 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In light of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
