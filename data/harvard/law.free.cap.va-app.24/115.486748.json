Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>So. viewed, the evidence showed that Robert A. Winstead resided in Fairfax County until December 4, 1993. In 1989, appellant was Winstead\u2019s \u201cfinancial adviser, telling [him] which stocks were available, and what stocks were a good buy.\u201d Winstead testified that he and appellant \u201cwere good friends,\u201d and that Winstead \u201ceven had [appellant] over to speak to [Winstead\u2019s] Men\u2019s Brotherhood at [Winstead\u2019s] church.\u201d Appellant \u201cwould call [Winstead at his home], by phone\u201d and recommend stocks to buy. Winstead would agree to purchase shares over the phone. Appellant sent Winstead invoices requiring payment within seven days of placing an order. Pursuant to appellant\u2019s instructions, Winstead \"wrote out and mailed personal checks to appellant\u2019s residence in Gaithersburg, Maryland. From May 1990 until November 1990, per appellant\u2019s instructions, Winstead wrote ten checks made payable to First Montauk Securities. Winstead mailed the checks to appellant. Winstead never received \u201cownership certificates\u201d for the stocks purchased, so he telephoned appellant and asked about them. Appellant told Winstead that the stocks were \u201cin a street name.\u201d Although he was concerned about the absence of ownership certificates, Winstead continued to buy stocks from appellant; however, Winstead continued to ask about the certificates, and appellant continued to explain that \u201cit was in a street name.\u201d It was not until June 1993 that appellant informed the Winsteads that he had misappropriated their money in order to support a cocaine addiction and discussed repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In a letter dated February 18,1994, appellant told Winstead that \u201c[w]hen we first did business together when I was with Dean Witter I was not guilty of fraud, deceit and greed. I was your normal stockbroker and family man. However, several years later is when my life started going downhill because of my addiction to cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Elta Winstead, Robert\u2019s wife, testified that she also purchased stock from appellant between May 1990 and November 1990 for which she wrote four personal checks. Like her husband, she mailed personal checks to appellant believing that he would purchase stock with the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>During an interview with Detective Purvis Dawson, appellant confessed his wrongdoing and confirmed Winstead\u2019s account of events. In a handwritten statement provided to Dawson, appellant admitted that he advised Winstead \u201cto purchase more Perpetual stock\u201d in order to \u201cconvert the funds to [his] own use to purchase more coke.\u201d According to appellant, \u201c[a]s [he] became more involved with the drug [he] found [him]self lying more and stealing more to feed [his] habit. [He] would continue to make interest payments to Mr. Winstead to give him the impression that [the] investments were doing well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On appeal, appellant argues that he gained lawful possession of the Winsteads\u2019 money, and did not convert or form the intent to convert the funds until later, when he was in Maryland. Appellant contends that no elements of the offense were committed in Virginia, and that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute the case, thereby rendering his judgment of conviction void.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">If any person wrongfully and fraudulently use, dispose of, conceal or embezzle any money, bill, note, check, order, draft, bond, ... or any other personal property, tangible or intangible, which he shall have received for another or for his employer, principal, or bailor, or by virtue of his office, trust, or employment, or which shall have been entrusted or delivered to him by another ... he shall be guilty of embezzlement.

Daily, </em>221 U.S. 280, 285, 31 S.Ct. 558, 560, 55 L.Ed. 735 (1911). The concept enunciated by Justice Holmes in <em>Strassheim, </em>i.e., that a state may punish someone for acts done outside its borders where the acts were intended to produce and actually produced detrimental effects within the state, has been termed the \u201cResult Theory.\u201d <em>See State v. Miller, </em>157 Ariz. 129, 132, 755 P.2d 434, 437 (App.1988) (discussing four theories to determine whether Arizona had jurisdiction; one theory, based on international law, was termed the \u201cResult Theory\u201d);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Herbert B. Chermside, Jr., Annotation, <em>Where is Embezzlement Committed for Purposes of Territorial Jurisdiction or Venue, </em>80 A.L.R.3d 514 at \u00a7 7 (1977) (explaining that, in a proper case, territorial jurisdiction may be exercised by state in which accused was only constructively present at time of offense if the accused \u201cput into operation an agency or force which does harm in another jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Virginia adopted the \u201cResult Theory\u201d in <em>Travelers Health Ass\u2019n v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 877, 51 S.E.2d 263 (1949), <em>aff'd, </em>339 U.S. 643, 70 S.Ct. 927, 94 L.Ed. 1154 (1950). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>Travelers, </em>the defendant company (Travelers) offered and sold \u201cmembership contracts\u201d that were deemed securities. The contracts/securities were offered solely through mail solicitations; however, Travelers failed to apply for the requisite securities permit. To obtain a permit, a prospective seller had to execute a document agreeing that service could be effected on it through the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Travelers argued that because it conducted no business in Virginia and \u201ctransacted [its] entire business outside the state through the mails,\u201d Virginia had no jurisdiction to prosecute the company for securities violations in Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 884, 51 S.E.2d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Supreme Court phrased the issue as whether \u201cthe Commonwealth possesses] the jurisdiction and power to deal with the commission of crimes of this nature within its borders and punish same, although the transactions are principally carried on from without the State through the United States mail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891, 51 S.E.2d at 268. The Court established the following general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cA question often arises as to the jurisdiction of a crime where the accused, while in one state, sets in motion a force which operates in another state, as where a shot is fired at a person across a state line or an injurious substance is sent to a person in another state with the intent to injure him. In such cases the view has generally been taken that actual presence in a state is not necessary to make a person amenable to its laws for a crime committed there; for if a crime is the immediate result of his act, he may be made to answer for it in its courts, although actually absent from the state at the time he does the act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In finding Travelers amenable to prosecution in Virginia, the Court explained: \u201c \u2018It has long been a commonplace of criminal liability that a person may be charged in the place where the evil results, though he is beyond the jurisdiction when he starts the train of events of which that evil is the fruit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892, 51 S.E.2d at 269 (quoting <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>Steinberg, </em>62 F.2d 77, 78 (2d Cir.1932), <em>cert. denied, </em>289 U.S. 729, 53 S.Ct. 526, 77 L.Ed. 1478 (1933) (citing, <em>inter alia, Strassheim, </em>221 U.S. at 284, 285, 31 S.Ct. at 560, 560)). The Court added that there are \u201c[additional authorities to the effect that a person may be guilty of crime by reason of the use of the mails, and that the crime is deemed to be committed in the State where the mail is received and the prohibited results occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892, 51 S.E.2d at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In <em>Gregory v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 89, 360 S.E.2d 858 (1987), the defendant was convicted of fraudulent removal and conversion of a tractor and trailer in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-115 (fraudulent conversion). Gregory, a resident of Botetourt County, Virginia, had earlier pledged the tractor and trailer to a Botetourt County bank as security for a loan. <em>Gregory, 5 </em>Va.App. at 90, 360 S.E.2d at 859. Pursuant to the loan, Gregory agreed that he would not sell the rig without the bank\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 360 S.E.2d at 859. Gregory later admitted that he sold the tractor in Louisiana without the bank\u2019s consent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Gregory contended that the Virginia circuit court lacked jurisdiction because the alleged criminal acts did not occur in Virginia. He also asserted that his criminal intent was not formed until after he removed the vehicle from Virginia. The trial court agreed that Gregory did not form the \u201cintent to convert the secured property [until] after he removed it from Virginia,\u201d yet it found Gregory guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 92, 360 S.E.2d at 860. We affirmed the conviction and held that \u201cnothing in the language of [Code \u00a7 18.2-115] requires proof that the fraudulent intent to dispose or the actual disposal of the secured property occurred within the boundaries of Virginia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 360 S.E.2d at 860. Applying the result theory, we concluded that \u201c[w]here harm is caused in Virginia by criminal acts partially committed within this Commonwealth, such acts can be prosecuted here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 360 S.E.2d at 861 (quoting from <em>Travelers, </em>188 Va. at 892, 51 S.E.2d at 269, that \u201c \u2018a person may be charged in the place where the evil results, though he is beyond the jurisdiction when he starts the train of events\u2019 \u201d). <em>See also Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, </em>23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Va.App. 430, 440-41, 477 S.E.2d 759, 764 (1996) (finding that Virginia court had jurisdiction to prosecute out-of-state parent for parental abduction where Virginia parent delivered child to defendant out-of-state and defendant failed to return child to Virginia).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Here, the facts showed that while appellant was in Maryland, he used the telephone and the mails in a continuing scheme to solicit funds from the Winsteads for the sole purpose of diverting their funds to his own use. Appellant purposely lied about the absence of stock certificates and made sham interest payments in order to continue his embezzlement scheme and inflict further harm on the Winsteads in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The record established that appellant, while located in Maryland, set in motion a scheme intended to produce and which did produce immediate detrimental effects in Virginia, namely, the fraudulent taking of money from Virginia residents and its attendant conversion to his own use. Appellant used the mails and telephone system to produce the intended detrimental effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Moreno v. Baskerville, </em>249 Va. 16, 452 S.E.2d 653 (1995), is misplaced. In that case, Moreno sold drugs to a man named Moore in Arizona, who transported the drugs to Virginia. Unbeknownst to Moreno, Moore sold them to two men in Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 17-18, 452 S.E.2d at 654. The Supreme Court held that Virginia courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case and reversed the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Applying a proximate cause analysis, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he act of distribution by Moore to [Virginia buyers] intervened. The situation here is entirely unlike a case in which a shot fired across a state line \u2018immediately\u2019 results in harm, thus enabling the forum state to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over the assailant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20, 452 S.E.2d at 655. Despite its finding that Moreno\u2019s acts did not cause the immediate result in Virginia, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule of law in Virginia</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>that actual physical presence in a state is not necessary to make an individual amenable to its criminal laws if the crime is the \u201cimmediate result\u201d of the accused\u2019s act; [and] under such circumstances, the accused may be tried in the state\u2019s courts even though actually absent at the time the act was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 19, 452 S.E.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Here, appellant\u2019s acts caused the immediate and intended result or harm, and no intervening acts broke the causal chain he set in motion. Therefore, <em>Moreno </em>is distinguishable from and inapplicable to the facts of this case. Because appellant set in motion a criminal scheme, the immediate result of which caused the intended harm in this state, Virginia had jurisdiction to try the case. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s conviction is valid and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. The other theories included \u201cFailure to Perform a Duty,\" \u201cAccomplice Theory,\u201d and \"Conspiracy Theory.\u201d 157 Ariz. at 134-35, 755 P.2d at 439-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
