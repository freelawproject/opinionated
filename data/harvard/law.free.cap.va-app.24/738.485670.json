She contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of her apartment. She argues that the magistrate lacked a substantial basis for finding probable cause to issue the search warrant for her apartment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">On January 6, 1995, Detective Stuart Graham Powell of the Chesterfield County police participated in the arrest of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>unidentified person (informant). Following his <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arrest, informant told Detective Powell that he had witnessed the storage and sale of marijuana in appellant\u2019s apartment within the past seventy-two hours. Detective Powell had never met informant prior to January 6, and informant had never participated in any \u201ccontrolled buys\u201d with the police. Detective Powell did not inquire whether or not informant was a registered voter or a person who regularly attended church. In addition, Detective Powell did not recall if he performed a check of informant\u2019s criminal record or know if informant was involved in any plea bargaining that was contingent upon his cooperation in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">After speaking with informant, Detective Powell wrote an affidavit that stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\"><em>Jp. The material facts constituting probable cause that the search should be made are: </em>On this date, 1-6-95, a citizen appeared before the magistrate of the Twelth [sic] Judicial District Court and stated the following facts under the penalty.of purgery [sic]. This citizen stated that within the past 72 hours he/she observed a quantity of marijuana being stored and being offered for sale at [an apartment on Markview Lane].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\"><em>6. I was advised of the facts set forth in this affidavit, in whole or in part, by an informer. This informer\u2019s credibility or the reliability of the information may be determined from the following facts: </em>The citizen mentioned in section 4 of this document made these statements while under oath and after being advised of the penalty of purgery [sic] by your affiant. Your affiant has been a police officer for over six years and is currently employed in the vice and narcotics unit of the Chesterfield County Police Department. Your affiant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>has made several drug arrests and is familiar with the drug culture in and around Chesterfield County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Detective Powell then brought informant before a magistrate, and informant both swore that all of the information contained in the affidavit was true and testified under oath that \u201cwithin the last 72 hours [he observed] a quantity of marijuana being prepared and offered for sale at [the apartment on Markview Lane].\u201d The magistrate then questioned informant about his familiarity with drugs. In response, informant testified that he had used drugs on a weekly basis for several years and that he was familiar with the drug culture in Chesterfield County. Following this testimony, the magistrate made the following addition to the section of the affidavit addressing the credibility and reliability of informant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGs\">This citizen is a self-admitted drug user and is familiar with the drug culture in and around Chesterfield County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The magistrate issued a search warrant for the apartment. When Detective Powell entered the apartment, he found appellant. After appellant was given her <em>Miranda </em>warnings, she stated that she had marijuana inside her dresser drawers in her bedroom. Another detective recovered 12.74 ounces of marijuana from appellant\u2019s dresser. Appellant also stated that she had been selling marijuana in order to raise money to pay for Christmas presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Appellant was charged with possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of the apartment. Appellant then entered a conditional guilty plea that was subject to her appeal regarding the denial of her motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">On appeal, appellant does not contend that the facts contained in the affidavit, if credible, failed to provide a substantial basis for the magistrate to find probable cause to issue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>search warrant for the apartment on Markview Lane. Instead, appellant challenges the basis for the magistrate\u2019s reliance upon the information provided by informant. Specifically, appellant argues that the affidavit provided by Detective Powell failed to objectively establish informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge and that the magistrate improperly supplemented the information provided in the affidavit by examining informant under oath regarding his reliability and basis of knowledge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">A.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">The existence of probable cause is determined by examining the \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances.\u201d \u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, commonsense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d The duty of the reviewing court is \u201csimply to ensure that the magistrate had a \u2018substantial basis for ... concluding]\u2019 that probable cause existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-7\"><em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 64, 68-69, 408 S.E.2d 602, 604-05 (1991), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>14 Va.App. 82, 414 S.E.2d 619 (1992) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">When the factual basis for probable cause is provided by an informer, the veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge of the informer are \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230, 103 S.Ct. at 2328. However, the credibility and basis of knowledge of an informer are not independent \u201celements\u201d that must be \u201cproved\u201d in order for a magistrate to find probable cause. Instead, these considerations are merely factors in the overall \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329. \u201c[A] deficiency in [either credibility or basis of knowledge] may be compensated for, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to the other, or by some other indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The reliability of an informer\u2019s tip may be established in different ways depending on the nature of the informer and the manner in which the information provided by the informer reaches the magistrate. If the informer is a disinterested citizen who is either the victim or eyewitness of a crime, the magistrate is permitted to infer that reasonable information obtained from the citizen is reliable. <em>See Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 294, 299-300, 237 S.E.2d 150, 154 (1977). On the other hand, the reliability of a \u201ccriminal\u201d informer, such as an \u201cunderworld figure\u201d or a \u201cprofessional informer,\u201d should be established by \u201cunderlying facts or circumstances buttressing the credibility of the informer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 237 S.E.2d at 153-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The proper method to establish the reliability of \u201ccriminal\u201d informers is determined in part by whether or not the informer appears in person before the magistrate and testifies under oath. When the \u201ccriminal\u201d informer\u2019s tip is in the form of hearsay recited in an affidavit, its reliability may be established by showing that (1) the informer has previously given reliable information; (2) the informer previously has worked with the police and has made controlled buys or worked in narcotic surveillance or other law enforcement efforts; (3) the informer provided detailed information that only a person who had actually observed the criminal activity would know; or (4) the informer has made a declaration against his penal interest. <em>See Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 179, 187-88 n. 2, 402 S.E.2d 914, 919-20 n. 2 (1991); <em>Corey v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 281, 288, 381 S.E.2d 19, 23 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">A different situation is presented when an informer appears in person before a magistrate and testifies under oath regarding his personal observations. Our Supreme Court has previously held that a magistrate determining probable cause may supplement the information contained in an affidavit with information received orally. <em>See McCary v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>228 Va. 219, 231, 321 S.E.2d 637, 643 (1984) (holding that \u201can insufficient affidavit may be supplemented or rehabilitated by information disclosed to the issuing magistrate upon application for the search warrant\u201d). Thus, an affidavit need not include extrinsic corroboration of a \u201ccriminal\u201d informer\u2019s veracity when such information is provided orally to the magistrate. This information may be conveyed orally by the police officer seeking the warrant or through the magistrate\u2019s direct examination of the informer while under oath.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">[W]hen an informant appears before a judge or magistrate and testifies under oath concerning personal observations, there is no comparable need for extrinsic corroboration of the informant\u2019s veracity: the presiding judge or magistrate is able to observe the informant\u2019s demeanor, is capable of questioning the informant, and is provided further assurance by the fact that the informant\u2019s testimony is under oath.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\"><em>Latham v. State, </em>790 P.2d 717, 720 (Alaska Ct.App.1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">As with any other similarly situated witness, the informant\u2019s willingness to submit to an oath, and his personal presence and the availability for questioning by the magistrate [provide] adequate procedural safeguards to assure a sound basis for assessing veracity and reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-8\"><em>McLaughlin v. State, </em>818 P.2d 683, 686 (Alaska Ct.App.1991). However, if the reliability of a \u201ccriminal\u201d informer is established orally, either by information presented by a police officer seeking a search warrant or by information elicited from the informer while testifying under oath before the magistrate, such information must be set forth in the record in order to permit a reviewing court to determine that the magistrate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause. <em>See Boyd, </em>12 Va.App. at 186, 402 S.E.2d at 918-19 (stating that \u201c[w]here the basis for concluding that probable cause exists rests upon information provided by an informer, one focus of the inquiry must be upon whether the magistrate could [reasonably and objectively] determine the informer\u2019s honesty, veracity, and basis of knowledge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Appellant relies on <em>Commonwealth v. Haberman, </em>257 Pa.Super. 127, 390 A.2d 279 (1978), for the proposition that an informer\u2019s credibility cannot be established for Fourth Amendment purposes by the informer\u2019s personal appearance before the issuing magistrate. However, we are unpersuaded by <em>Haberman </em>because its Fourth Amendment analysis is outdated. In <em>Haberman, </em>the Superior Court of Pennsylvania held that an informer\u2019s personal appearance before a magistrate in combination with his written acknowledgement that his information was given under penalty of perjury was not sufficient to establish the informer\u2019s reliability under the two-pronged <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. <em>Id. </em>at 131-33, 390 A.2d at 281-82. Under this test, officers seeking a search warrant were required to provide an independent basis for the issuing magistrate to conclude that an informer was (1) knowledgeable and (2) reliable in regard to the information he provided. <em>Id., </em>at 129-30, at 280; <em>see also Tamburino v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 821, 823-24, 241 S.E.2d 762, 764 (1978). The <em>Haberman </em>court reasoned that the magistrate\u2019s in-person assessment of the informer\u2019s credibility was not sufficiently independent to satisfy the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. <em>Haberman, </em>390 A.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">However, since <em>Haberman </em>was decided, the United States Supreme Court abandoned the rigid, two-pronged test for evaluating an informer\u2019s credibility in favor of the \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstanees\u201d approach. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332. For this reason, we do not believe that the <em>Haberman </em>court\u2019s reasoning and holding are cogent. Instead, <em>Gates </em>opens the door for police officers to establish the credibility of an informer in a variety of ways, including through the personal appearance of the informer under oath before the issuing magistrate. The credibility of an informer is now only a factor in a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 103 S.Ct. at 2328. The credibility of an informer is based upon both his basis of knowledge and his reliability, and \u201ca deficiency in one may be compensated for ... by a strong showing as to the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2317. Unlike in the days of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause, which includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>some consideration of an informer\u2019s credibility, is ascertained from the circumstances of the particular case. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332. Nothing in <em>Gates </em>precludes the police from establishing an informer\u2019s credibility through a magistrate\u2019s in-person examination and assessment of the informer while under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Turning to the facts of this case, we first hold that informant was not a \u201ccitizen\u201d informer whose reliability could be inferred by the magistrate. Although the record did not establish either that informant had a criminal record or that informant was a \u201cprofessional informer,\u201d the record did indicate that informant was under arrest when he provided the information regarding the apartment on Markview Lane to both Detective Powell and the magistrate. While the record does not expressly establish that informant expected any gain or concession in exchange for his information, we cannot say that informant, whose cooperation with the authorities began only after his arrest, was an ordinary citizen who \u201cact[ed] with an intent to aid the police in law enforcement because of his concern for society or for his own safety.\u201d <em>State v. Paszek, </em>50 Wis.2d 619, 630, 184 N.W.2d 836, 843 (1971). Thus, some indicia of informant\u2019s credibility was required before the magistrate could rely on the informant\u2019s information as a basis for finding probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We next hold that the information received by the magistrate regarding informant\u2019s reliability and basis of knowledge provided a substantial basis for the magistrate to rely on informant\u2019s observations when making his probable cause determination. Although the affidavit as it was written prior to informant\u2019s appearance before the magistrate failed to provide sufficient information for the magistrate to objectively evaluate informant\u2019s reliability, this defect was cured by the information elicited by the magistrate when informant testified under oath before him. First, the reliability of informant was enhanced by the fact that he testified under oath before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the magistrate that he saw marijuana for sale in the apartment on Markview Lane, thus subjecting himself to criminal liability if his testimony was fabricated. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233-34, 103 S.Ct. at 2330 (stating that giving information while under penalty of perjury can bolster the reliability of the informer). In addition, informant\u2019s reliability was further strengthened when the magistrate elicited a statement from informant that was against his penal interest. The magistrate asked informant about his experience with drugs, and informant testified that he had used drugs at least once a week for several years. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 2082, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971) (stating that \u201c[pjeople do not lightly admit crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions. Admissions of crime ... carry their own indicia of credibility____\u201d). Finally, the magistrate\u2019s examination of informant elicited that informant had a strong basis for his knowledge that marijuana was for sale in the apartment. In response to the magistrate\u2019s questions, informant testified that he was familiar with both drugs and the drug culture in Chesterfield County and that his knowledge of the sale of marijuana in the apartment on Markview Lane was based upon his personal observations within the past seventy-two hours. <em>See Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 416, 89 S.Ct. 584, 589, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332 (stating that an informer\u2019s declaration that he \u201cpersonally observed\u201d the information disclosed by him would sufficiently establish his basis of knowledge). Considering all of the information regarding informant\u2019s reliability and strong basis of knowledge that was elicited during informant\u2019s appearance before the magistrate, we conclude that any defect in the affidavit was cured and that the magistrate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause to issue a search warrant for the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Tamburino v. Commonwealth </em>is misplaced. 218 Va. 821, 241 S.E.2d 762 (1978). <em>Tamburino </em>was decided when the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test was still applicable to a magistrate\u2019s determination that an informer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>reliable. <em>See id. </em>at 823-24, 241 S.E.2d at 764. The only issue in <em>Tamburino </em>was whether the information contained in the police officer\u2019s affidavit satisfied the \u201creliability\u201d prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. <em>Id. </em>at 822, 241 S.E.2d at 763. The magistrate had concluded that the informer\u2019s hearsay statement that drugs were present in the defendant\u2019s apartment was reliable because the informer (1) was a \u201cconcerned citizen,\u201d (2) admitted that he was familiar with the local drug culture and was a user of drugs, and (3) performed a controlled buy for the police. <em>Id. </em>at 822-23, 241 S.E.2d at 763. Our Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">while the admission by the informant that he was associated with the drug culture, and was a user of marijuana, would not alone be sufficient to establish his credibility, it is a factor to be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 825, 241 S.E.2d at 765. The court went on to hold that these admissions in combination with the informer\u2019s controlled buy were sufficient to establish the informer\u2019s reliability under the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\"><em>Tamburino </em>does not control this case because the credibility of informant is not subject to the same rigid, two-pronged scrutiny that was applicable in <em>Tamburino. </em>Despite this difference, informant\u2019s credibility in this case was similarly buttressed. Like the informer in <em>Tamburino, </em>informant admitted that he used drugs and was familiar with the local drug culture. Although informant\u2019s credibility in this case was not strengthened by his performance of a controlled buy, it was additionally bolstered by his in-person testimony under oath before the magistrate and the fact that he had directly observed drugs offered for sale in the apartment on Markview Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\">. The gender of the informant is not disclosed in the record.

Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (citation omitted). Because in this case the magistrate lacked a \u201c \u2018substantial basis for ... concluding\u2019 that probable cause existed,\u201d <em>id., </em>I would hold that the warrant was invalid and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The following facts were presented to the magistrate: (1) the informant had seen \u201ca quantity of marijuana being stored and being offered for sale at ... [an] apartment\u201d on Markview Lane, and (2) the informant was a \u201cself-admitted drug user and [was] familiar with the drug culture in and around Chesterfield County.\u201d The majority concedes that these facts, alone, are insufficient to establish probable cause. The majority concludes, however, that the magistrate properly found probable cause because the magistrate\u2019s opportunity to view the informant, in person, \u201ccured\u201d the otherwise defective affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The majority bases its conclusion on three factors: (1) one of the statements made by the informant, not related to the information regarding Polston, constituted a statement against penal interest; (2) because the informant told the police that the informant was familiar with drugs and the drug culture in Chesterfield County, the informant had a \u201cstrong basis for his knowledge,\u201d and (3) the informant was under oath and, thus, was subject to criminal prosecution for perjury in the event that the informant lied. In the abstract, the factors identified by the majority are persuasive; in the context of this case, they carry negligible weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">When asked to determine whether a magistrate had sufficient information to determine that probable cause existed, \u201ca reviewing court must consider only the information presented to the magistrate who issued the warrant.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilhelm, </em>80 F.3d 116, 118 (4th Cir.1996). However, when the police fail to corroborate a tip from an unidentified informant, but instead seek to prove the informant\u2019s credibility by allowing the magistrate to view the informant in person, a review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ing court cannot ignore facts, which potentially destroy the informant\u2019s credibility, that were <em>not </em>presented to the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Numerous facts in the record were not presented to the magistrate. The magistrate was never informed that the informant was under arrest at the time he spoke to the magistrate. Indeed, the informant was misleadingly described in the officer\u2019s affidavit as a \u201ccitizen informant.\u201d At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the officer\u2019s testimony revealed that the informant \u201cwas a citizen, but he was under arrest at the time\u201d he was brought before the magistrate. The officer also testified that he had not checked to determine whether the informant previously had been convicted. The officer further testified that he did not know whether the informant received any reduction in the charges against him in exchange for the assistance he provided in Polston\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Without knowledge of the potential for bias created by the informant\u2019s status as an arrested criminal suspect, the magistrate was ill-equipped to judge the informant\u2019s credibility. The majority, and perhaps also the magistrate, rely heavily on the fact that the informant made a statement against penal interest by admitting his drug use. However, if the informant made his statements because he had entered into a plea agreement requiring such disclosure, the statement would hardly be <em>against </em>his interest. Had the magistrate known of the arrest, he could have pursued this issue to determine whether the informant may have been biased or unduly influenced by a plea agreement or other promise of leniency made by the police or Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. <em>Cf. </em>Christopher Slobogin, <em>Testifying: Police Perjury and What To Do About It, </em>67 U. Colo. L.Rev. 1037, 1050 (1996) (asserting that \u201cthe[ ] informant, or even someone else acting as an informant, [can be coached] to lie about the information necessary for probable cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The second factor relied upon by the majority, the informant\u2019s experience with drugs, lacks substance. The police officer\u2019s affidavit is merely a \u201cboiler plate\u201d recitation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>officer \u201cis familiar with the drug culture in and around Chesterfield County ... [and the informant] is familiar with the drug culture in and around Chesterfield County.\u201d The informant\u2019s statement of his familiarity with the drug market bore little relation to the inquiry whether the informant had an adequate basis for concluding that marijuana was being offered for sale at the apartment. The informant\u2019s statement was overly general and lacked any factual detail. The informant did not state precisely when he had seen the marijuana, who was in possession of the marijuana, the quantity of marijuana the informant had seen, the reason the informant was present, or where in the apartment the marijuana was located. Most importantly, the informant did not provide any explanation for the conclusion that it was being offered for sale at the apartment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">Reading this affidavit in a \u201cpractical, common-sense\u201d manner, the only claim of possible wrongdoing is the averment that, within three days prior to the affidavit date, the informant was on the suspect premises and, while there, he saw some quantity of marijuana \u201cexpressly for the purpose of unlawful distribution.\u201d [The detective] presents no underlying factual circumstances to support the informant\u2019s knowledge regarding distribution, nor the detective\u2019s own \u201cbelief\u2019 that these quantities of marijuana were present \u201cfor the purpose or with the intention of unlawful possession, sale or transportation,\u201d or even that the marijuana would be on the premises when the warrant was executed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\"><em>United States v. Weaver, </em>99 F.3d 1372, 1378 (6th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Reddrick, </em>90 F.3d 1276, 1280 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The final factor relied on by the majority, the fact that the informant made his statement under oath, is also of little weight. Due to the nature of the informant\u2019s statement, the possibility of criminal prosecution for perjury had little impact on the informer\u2019s credibility. The informant merely swore to the statement that \u201cwithin the past 72 hours he/she observed a quantity of marijuana being stored and being offered for sale at the apartment.\u201d The informant did not identify the occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>pant of the apartment or the person who was selling marijuana. Because this statement is vague, the Commonwealth would have great difficulty proving its falsity. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Slater, </em>242 Pa.Super. 255, 363 A.2d 1257, 1259 (1976) (\u201c[T]he course from an informant\u2019s false statement to his conviction is a long and tortuous one. Statistically, the chances of such a prosecution are almost nonexistent.\u201d); Slobogin, <em>swpra, </em>at 1045 (stating that affiants often commit perjury in the warrant process because they are \u201cseldom made to pay for their lying\u201d). Thus, a successful prosecution for perjury would be highly unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In view of the scant information attributed to the informant and the lack of detail, the informant was likely aware that the truth or falsity of the statement was not verifiable. Moreover, in a case in which an anonymous informer did not testify under oath, this Court nevertheless observed that \u201cif the informer had fabricated his report, he may have subjected himself to criminal liability.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 179, 191, 402 S.E.2d 914, 922 (1991). The fact that the informant made his accusation under oath exposed the informant to a risk faced by all other informants and, thus, provides no basis for giving greater credit to this informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Moreover, the police did not corroborate or have prior knowledge of the information that the officer received from the informant. \u201cAn informant\u2019s tip is rarely adequate on its own to support a finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>925 F.2d 695, 698 (4th Cir.1991). The burden of establishing probable cause is greater when the informant is unidentified. <em>See Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 329, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2415-16, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990). Mere corroboration by the police of static details reported by the informant will not suffice to cure the inadequacy of a tip from an unidentified informant. <em>Cf. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244-46, 103 S.Ct. at 2335-36 (holding that independent corroboration of predicted activity can support a finding of probable cause); Joe Metcalfe, <em>Anonymous Tips, Investigatory Stops and Inarticulate Hunches\u2014Al</em>abama <em>v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990), 26 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L.Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>219, 234 (1991) (\u201c[I]f corroborated facts serve to bolster a tip, then uncorroborated facts should likewise undermine confidence in the reliability of the information in the possession of the police.\u201d) (citing <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The majority relies upon <em>Latham v. State, </em>790 P.2d 717 (Alaska Ct.App.1990). However, the informant in that case was not an arrested criminal suspect. <em>See id. </em>at 719. The' informant was identified to the magistrate, testified before the magistrate about a robbery that the police previously knew had occurred, and provided the magistrate with \u201cnumerous details about the robbery that he would not have been aware of without having spoken with someone who was actually involved in the crime.\u201d <em>Id.; see also McLaughlin v. State, </em>818 P.2d 683, 685 (Alaska Ct.App.1991) (upholding a warrant based upon an informant\u2019s testimony about a controlled buy). Those facts and circumstances did not exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The record in this case does not prove that the informant was identified by name to the magistrate. The informant was an arrested criminal suspect. The informant gave no details of the alleged offense. The informant did not report an offense that was previously known by the police to have occurred. Moreover, the trial judge made no findings in this case that the magistrate received any information other than the bare recitals in the affidavit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The paucity of information and the absence of any corroboration of the underlying factual circumstances establish that the informant\u2019s reliability was not adequately substantiated in this case. <em>See Weaver, </em>99 F.3d at 1378-79. Indeed, as in <em>Weaver, </em>the informant in this case gave no information regarding \u201ca description of the marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>and how it was maintained, ... the location in the residence where .the marijuana ... was seen or kept, a description of [the seller], [or] ... information on the distribution operation .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1378 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Because the information provided by the informant was vague and lacking in detail, I would hold that the magistrate lacked a substantial basis to conclude that the informer\u2019s conclusion was accurate. <em>See Corey v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 281, 289, 381 S.E.2d 19, 23 (1989) (holding that a tip lacked adequate detail); <em>cf. Boyd, </em>12 Va.App. at 191, 402 S.E.2d at 922 (upholding a warrant based upon similar allegations, which were combined with additional details provided by the informant and corroborated by the police).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The holding in this case allows the police, under circumstances otherwise insufficient to support a police officer\u2019s warrant application, to take an unidentified, arrested criminal suspect before a magistrate, present the arrested suspect as a \u201ccitizen informant,\u201d and bathe the informant with credibility if the informant swears to vague, unverifiable facts. Such a procedure reduces the Fourth Amendment to a fiction and the magistrate to \u201ca rubber stamp for the police.\u201d <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109, 85 S.Ct. 741, 746, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">It makes all the difference in the world whether one recognizes the central fact about the Fourth Amendment, namely, that it was a safeguard against recurrence of abuses so deeply felt by the Colonies as to be one of the potent causes of the Revolution, or one thinks of it as merely a requirement for a piece of paper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-8\"><em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U.S. 56, 69, 70 S.Ct. 430, 436, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">. The record proved that after the officer talked to the informant and before the officer took the informant to the magistrate, <em>the officer typed </em>on the affidavit for search warrant the following recital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">On this date 1-6-95, a citizen appeared before the magistrate of the Twelth Judicial District Court and stated the following facts under oath and the penalty of purgery.
