She appeals, contending that (1) the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney improperly appeared before the grand jury; (2) the trial court erred in admitting an intercepted communication; and (8) the trial court erred in granting a jury instruction on the effects of suicide on insurance policies. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Pease\u2019s first assignment of error concerns the activities of Timothy McAfee, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, before the grand jury. In the fourth day of the trial, Mr. McAfee attempted to impeach a witness for the defense by asking her about her testimony at the grand jury. When asked how he knew about her previous testimony, Mr. McAfee responded that he had been present before the grand jury. He explained to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">I anticipated and spoke with the grand jury about the reason she was subpoenaed. They asked that I be present and ask the questions. Because I anticipated that [the witness] would in fact tell that story different today under oath than she did under oath [then] and asked that Special Agent Parker be permitted to be present when she testified. I spoke with the grand jury foreman about that and was permitted to have Mr. Parker present so that I wouldn\u2019t have to testify. Agent Parker could.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-201 provides that \u201cno attorney for the Commonwealth shall go before any grand jury except when duly sworn to testify as a witness, but he may advise the foreman of a regular grand jury or any member or members thereof in relation to the discharge of their duties.\u201d A Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney may advise the grand jury on a legal issue and the law in regard to the various indictments that they are considering, but he may not specifically refer to the indictment against the accused. <em>See Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>143 Va. 554, 560, 130 S.E. 416, 418 (1925); <em>see also Vihko v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 498, 505, 393 S.E.2d 413, 418 (1990). He is not permitted, \u201cby his presence or otherwise, to influence them in reaching a conclusion during their deliberations.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>143 Va. at 560, 130 S.E. at 418. We acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>edge, as the Commonwealth would urge, that \u201c[t]he mere presence of the attorney for the Commonwealth in the grand jury room does not invalidate an indictment found at the time, if ... it satisfactorily appears that the accused was not prejudiced thereby.\u201d Mr. McAfee\u2019s conduct in this case, however, goes beyond \u201cmere presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Mr. McAfee apparently initiated contact with the grand jury about this witness, who was the defendant\u2019s personal friend. He informed them that he thought she would not be truthful. He actually examined the witness for the grand jury. This behavior well surpasses that which the Code permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Dismissal of the indictment for a nonconstitutional error \u201cis appropriate only \u2018if it is established that the violation substantially influenced the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict,\u2019 or if there is \u2018grave doubt\u2019 that the decision to indict was free from the substantial influence of such violations.\u201d <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 250, 256, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 2374, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988) (quoting <em>United States v. Mechanik, </em>475 U.S. 66, 78, 106 S.Ct. 938, 945-46, 89 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)). Upon reviewing the record, we can come to no other conclusion but that Mr. McAfee substantially influenced the grand jury in reaching an indictment to the prejudice of the defendant. We therefore quash the indictment and remand to the trial court for such further action as the Commonwealth may deem advisable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Pease also argues that a telephone conversation between her and a friend was improperly admitted. In light of our decision to quash the indictment, we are not compelled to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Pease\u2019s third assignment of error will not be considered because the objection raised at trial differed from that raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Accordingly, the convictions are reversed, the indictment quashed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">. While a conviction by a petit jury may render harmless certain errors in the charging decision, <em>see Mechanik, </em>475 U.S. at 73, 106 S.Ct. at 943, the error in this case was significant enough to justify quashing the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
