Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 730, 473 S.E.2d 85 (1996). Upon motion of Joseph Franklin McBride, we granted a hearing <em>en banc. </em>Upon such rehearing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed. We adopt as the opinion of this Court <em>en banc </em>the following from the panel opinion. In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to grant a writ in <em>Byers v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 146, 474 S.E.2d 852 (1996), Judge Baker, who dissented from the panel opinion, concurs with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">Joseph Franklin McBride (appellant) was convicted of robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. On appeal, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the firearm conviction. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On October 11, 1994, Michael Doyle, manager of Doyle Bedding and Furniture in Norfolk, arrived at the store at 10:00 a.m. At around 11:00 a.m., Doyle saw a man standing across the street, holding what appeared to be a baby. A few minutes later, as Doyle was on the floor assembling a love seat, he saw the man walking down the sidewalk toward the store\u2019s front door. He then heard the bell on that door ring as the door opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Doyle felt the man sit down beside him on the love seat and \u201cpush\u201d something \u201cup against [his] back.\u201d Three times the assailant said, \u201cDon\u2019t turn around or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d At trial, Doyle testified that he never saw a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Doyle was instructed to lie on the floor. The robber asked if Doyle had a gun or if anyone else was in the store. He then tied Doyle\u2019s hands behind him with wire. At that time, a second person came into the store. Doyle could hear the second person \u201crifling through\u201d the front desk. The robber took cash, credit cards, and a wallet from Doyle. When the robber left the store, Doyle saw a blanket and plastic bottle which had not been there previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Detectives investigating the robbery discovered a plastic three liter soda bottle which had \u201cballed up\u201d newspapers in a plastic bag taped to its top. They also found a pink, blue and black blanket, and speaker wire. A finger and palm print belonging to appellant were discovered on the newspaper. The police executed a search warrant at appellant\u2019s apartment and discovered several credit cards belonging to Doyle in a man\u2019s shoe in a bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The issue presented on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant was guilty of use of a firearm in the commission of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). Moreover, \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109, 104 S.Ct. 1617, 80 L.Ed.2d 145 (1984). <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 598, 604-05, 347 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1986) (circumstantial evidence alone sufficient to sustain conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 441 S.E.2d 342 (1994), the Virginia Supreme Court held that to prove the offense of use of a firearm, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that the accused actually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>247 Va. at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344 (footnote omitted). The Court stated that possession of a firearm is an \u201cessential element\u201d of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 441 S.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Yarborough, in robbing his victim, said, \u201cThis is a stickup,\u201d and demanded all her money. The victim did not see a gun but testified that she thought there was a gun in Yarborough\u2019s pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 441 S.E.2d at 343. Shortly after the robbery, the police apprehended Yarborough and discovered an unopened beer can in his pocket but no weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 441 S.E.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Within four months of the release of the <em>Yarborough </em>opinion, the Supreme Court awarded an appeal in <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth </em>(Record No. 940606). In <em>Johnson, </em>the victim was awakened by the sound of the doorbell ringing and loud knocking on his door. When he went to his door, he saw it break open. A hand came through the opening, and the victim heard a man tell him that he had a gun. Johnson told the victim to get down on the floor or he would kill him. The victim testified that he never saw a gun and never felt one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The Commonwealth conceded at trial that the only evidence that Johnson had a gun was Johnson\u2019s statement that he did. The trial court found that Johnson had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court, Johnson argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that under <em>Yarborough, </em>the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. The Commonwealth distinguished <em>Yarborough, </em>noting that Johnson expressly claimed to have a gun and threatened to use it, whereas in <em>Yarborough, </em>no such claims were made. The Commonwealth argued that Johnson\u2019s conviction was based on his \u201cassertive conduct and representations that he possessed a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The Supreme Court, by unpublished order, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The affirmance in <em>Johnson </em>clearly stands for the proposition that circumstantial evidence, such as an assailant\u2019s statement that he possesses a firearm, can be sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused indeed possessed a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In <em>Elmore v.Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 424, 470 S.E.2d 588 (1996), we affirmed the conviction for use of a firearm in the commission of robbery where the victim, a bank teller, testified that Elmore gave her a note stating that he had a gun, then said he did not want to hurt anyone and pointed to his pocket. We noted that the evidence in <em>Elmore </em>consisted of \u201cmore than the victim\u2019s mere belief or perception that the defendant had a gun\u201d and concluded that the evidence was \u201csufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant actually possessed a firearm and used it in a threatening manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 470 S.E.2d at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Here, appellant actually \u201cpushed\u201d an object into the victim\u2019s back and told him he would \u201cshoot\u201d if the victim did not cooperate. While appellant did not explicitly state that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>a gun, the clear inference to be drawn from his threat to \u201cshoot,\u201d is that he did have a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The circumstantial evidence, considered as a whole and viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, excluded all reasonable hypotheses of innocence and is therefore sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court. Accordingly, the stay of this Court\u2019s July 23, 1996 mandate is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is ordered that the trial court allow counsel for the appellant an additional fee of $200 for services rendered the appellant on the rehearing portion of this appeal, in addition to counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses. This amount shall be added to the costs due the Commonwealth in the July 23,1996 mandate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">. The order is dated October 21, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b652-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Akq\">with whom COLEMAN, J., joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Relying upon an unpublished order from the Supreme Court, which summarily states that \u201c[ujpon consideration of the record, briefs and argument of counsel, the [Supreme] Court is of the opinion that there is no error in the judgment appealed from,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 940606 (Va. Oct. 21,1994), the majority today adopts a rule of law contrary to the published decision in <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 441 S.E.2d 342 (1994). I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">In <em>Yarborough, </em>the Supreme Court reversed this Court\u2019s decision upholding a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 for the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. <em>See </em>247 Va. at 219, 441 S.E.2d at 344. The Supreme Court held that \u201cto convict an accused of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Commonwealth <em>must prove that the accused actually had a firearm in his possession </em>and that he used or attempted to use the firearm ... while committing ... robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344 (emphasis added). The evidence in <em>Yarborough </em>proved the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">As Konchal approached the driveway of the condominium complex, Yarborough ran past her. Shortly thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Yarborough reappeared and ran directly toward her. As Yarborough approached Konchal, he said, \u201cThis is a stickup[;] give me all your money.\u201d Konchal said, \u201cWhat?\u201d and tried to walk past him. Yarborough, however, blocked Konchal and said, \u201cNo, this is a stickupf;] give me all your money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">According to Konchal, when Yarborough moved toward her, \u201c[b]oth [of Yarborough\u2019s] hands were in his pockets.\u201d She saw \u201csomething protruding ... from his right hand pocket of his jacket,\u201d and she \u201cthought [there] was a gun in his pocket.\u201d Konchal then opened her purse, reached in, and handed Yarborough three twenty dollar bills from her wallet. Yarborough, using his left hand, reached into Konchal\u2019s purse and took two one dollar bills. Yarborough then fled in the direction of a nearby subway (or Metro) station, and Konchal immediately reported the robbery to the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANV\"><em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 441 S.E.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">When the police arrested Yarborough \u201cno weapons were found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 441 S.E.2d at 343. Because the \u201cevidence that Yarborough \u2018may have had\u2019 a fire arm in his possession creates merely a suspicion of guilt,\u201d the Supreme Court ruled that \u201cthe evidence [did] not establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218-19, 441 S.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The evidence in McBride\u2019s case proved that the victim saw nothing resembling a firearm. When McBride sat behind the victim, the victim merely \u201cfelt something push up against his back.\u201d The victim testified that the police found a plastic bottle at that site. After McBride tied the victim\u2019s hands, McBride moved about the store, returned to the victim, and put his hand on the victim\u2019s back. Although the victim could see McBride clearly enough to opine that McBride \u201clook[ed] like he was panicked,\u201d the victim never saw a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The evidence in this case is less compelling than the facts proved in <em>Yarborough. </em>Keeping his right hand in his jacket pocket, Yarborough used his left hand to take money from the victim. The victim saw something protruding from Yarbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ough\u2019s right jacket pocket, and the victim thought the protruding object she saw was a gun. <em>See id. </em>at 217, 441 S.E.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The majority concludes that the actual presence of a gun is proved from \u201cthe clear inference to be drawn from [McBride\u2019s] threat to \u2018shoot.\u2019 \u201d The majority uses the same logic that was rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Yarborough. </em>In improperly affirming Yarborough\u2019s conviction, this Court held that \u201c[a]lthough no gun was found on appellant, he may have had a gun ... at the time of the offense ... [; thus,] it could be inferred that he had one.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 638, 642-43, 426 S.E.2d 131, 134 (1993), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>247 Va. 215, 441 S.E.2d 342 (1994). Indeed, the Supreme Court reversed that conviction even though the jury in <em>Yarborough </em>had inferred from the evidence that Yarborough had a gun protruding from his right pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The following language from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Yarborough </em>clearly undermines the standard the majority again invokes to uphold McBride\u2019s conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">[Our prior decisions] do not stand for the proposition that the Commonwealth need not prove that the defendant actually possessed a firearm. Indeed, they stand for the contrary proposition, and we reject the Attorney General\u2019s contention and the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, a penal statute, must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in favor of an accused. When so construed, we think that, to convict an accused of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Commonwealth must prove that the accused actually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies. In order to convict an accused of a crime, the evidence must establish the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. Conviction of a crime is not justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>fied if the evidence creates only a suspicion or probability of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">247 Va. at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The evidence in this case failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the presence of a firearm. The presence of a firearm could only be found by drawing inferences from the evidence. However, the evidence also supports a reasonable inference that McBride used a plastic bottle to consummate the robbery. The victim testified that before McBride entered the store, the victim saw him carrying an item wrapped in a blanket. The item was later identified as a plastic three liter bottle. The plastic bottle was recovered by the police at the place where McBride threatened the victim and tied the victim\u2019s hands. Therefore, the Commonwealth failed to exclude the hypothesis that when McBride approached the victim from behind and threatened to shoot, he was using the bottle, not a firearm, to frighten the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Finally, I believe the majority\u2019s use of the Supreme Court\u2019s unpublished disposition is fundamentally flawed. An unpublished order from the Supreme Court, though deciding the merits of the particular case in which the order was entered, has no precedential value for other cases and should not be read to change the rule of law announced in a prior published opinion. If the Supreme Court had intended to change the rule announced in <em>Yarborough, </em>it could have done so in a published opinion in <em>Johnson </em>or in any number of cases that have raised this same issue and have been summarily affirmed by unpublished order. In view of the myriad reasons the Supreme Court may have had for denying an appeal by unpublished order, I believe the majority errs in using an unpublished, summary order as a precedent for deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in convicting McBride of use of a firearm in the commission of the robbery.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>COLEMAN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Au4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Although I join Judge Benton in his dissent, I write separately in order to make clear my view of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Yarborough. </em>As I read that holding, the Supreme Court ruled that the circumstantial evidence tending to prove Yarborough had a firearm, which consisted of his saying \u201cthis is a stickup\u201d and an object protruding from his right-hand pocket that the victim thought was a gun, was not sufficient to overcome the direct evidence that the item was not a firearm. The direct evidence was that Yarborough was arrested within minutes after the robbery, he had no weapon on him, and none was found in the search of the surrounding area. Yarborough had a chilled, unopened can of beer in one of his pockets. The fact finder could not reasonably conclude from the circumstantial evidence that Yarborough had a firearm in his pocket in view of the direct evidence that he only had a can of beer in the pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Similarly, the circumstantial evidence that McBride used a firearm consisted of his telling the victim three times, \u201cdon\u2019t turn around or I\u2019ll shoot\u201d and the victim feeling something push against his back. The blanket and plastic bottle that were found at the scene from which McBride fled was direct evidence that the object McBride used was a bottle, not a firearm. Accordingly, where the direct evidence was to the contrary, the fact finder could not reasonably infer from the circumstantial evidence that McBride used a firearm to commit the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">This order shall be published and certified to the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
