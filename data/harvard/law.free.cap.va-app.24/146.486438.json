Acting on the subsequent petition of wife, the court amended the decree to reinstate the prior support order. Husband appeals, contending that the court was without jurisdiction to restore the earlier award. We disagree and affirm the amended decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">The relevant procedural history is uncontroverted. In a proceeding unrelated to the subject cause, the trial court, on August 18, 1994, awarded wife both child and spousal support incidental to husband\u2019s appeal of a like order from the juvenile and domestic relations district court (district court). Husband was required to pay wife spousal support \u201cof $50.00 per week commencing ... August 15, 1994, ... until further order of the Court,\u201d and \u201call future matters of support\u201d were referred to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>On June 7, 1995, husband commenced the instant suit, seeking divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>from wife pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-91(9) and praying, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat the Court decree that the [parties] be perpetually protected in their persons and property.\u201d Husband\u2019s bill of complaint did not specifically mention spousal support or reference the earlier, continuing award. Although the complaint, together with a notice of attendant depositions, was personally served upon wife, she neither responded nor appeared at the scheduled hearing. In accordance with husband\u2019s prayer, the trial court entered a decree of divorce on October 18, 1995, and further decreed that \u201cany and all prior orders with regard to spousal support are hereby revoked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">On November 7, 1995, wife moved the court to \u201cset aside\u201d that provision of the decree relating to spousal support. Following a contested hearing on the issue, the court ordered that the disputed \u201crevocation\u201d of spousal support be \u201cstricken from the final decree\u201d and awarded wife \u201call support arrearage that [had] accrued\u201d on the preexisting order. Husband appeals, arguing that the court was without jurisdiction to amend the decree to reinstate the prior award of spousal support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-o\">Code \u00a7 20-79(b) confers jurisdiction upon a trial court adjudicating a divorce to \u201cprovide in its decree for the ... support and maintenance [of] the spouse,\u201d upon the <em>\u201crequests </em>\u201d of \u201ceither party to the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-103(A), -107.1. Clearly, the \u201cexercise of such power remains dependent upon the pleadings having raised the issue.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Boyd, </em>2 Va.App. 16, 19, 340 S.E.2d 578, 580 (1986). This well established principle recognizes that the \u201coffice of pleadings is to give notice to the opposing party of the nature and character of the claim, without which the most rudimentary due process safeguards would be denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a decree entered \u201cin the absence of pleadings upon which to found the same ... is void.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Potts v. Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 207, 181 S.E. 521, 525 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Moreover, the \u201cspecial statutory power to grant divorces\u201d and afford related relief was \u201cconferred upon [the] courts\u201d by the legislature. <em>Erickson-Dickson v. Erickson-Dickson, </em>12 Va.App. 381, 387, 404 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1991). \u201c \u2018It is elementary ... that neither courts of law nor equity have any inherent power to dissolve marriage. The power to decree a divorce is purely statutory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blankenship v. Blankenship, </em>125 Va. 595, 598, 100 S.E. 538, 539 (1919) (quoting <em>Rumping v. Rumping, </em>36 Mont. 39, 91 P. 1057 (1907)); <em>see Day v. Day, </em>8 Va.App. 346, 348, 381 S.E.2d 364, 365-66 (1989). Therefore, unless the \u201cprerequisites necessary for exercising that jurisdiction\u201d are \u201cspecifically pled[,] ... the proceedings [are] a nullity.\u201d <em>Erickson-Dickson, </em>12 Va.App. at 387, 404 S.E.2d at 392; <em>see also Rogers v. Damron, </em>23 Va.App. 708, 712-13, 479 S.E.2d 540, 541-42 (1997) (subject matter jurisdiction requires jurisdiction over the attendant relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Here, husband\u2019s bill of complaint properly invoked the court\u2019s jurisdiction to decree the divorce. However, the absence of a specific request for an adjudication of spousal support precluded the court from obtaining jurisdiction over that subject matter. <em>See Rogers, </em>23 Va.App. at 712-13, 479 S.E.2d at 542-43. Husband\u2019s vague prayer that the court \u201cdecree that the plaintiff and defendant be perpetually protected in their persons and property\u201d was insufficient to raise the issue. <em>See Boyd, </em>2 Va.App. at 19, 340 S.E.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Accordingly, the purported revocation of \u201call prior orders with regard to spousal support\u201d was a nullity and, contrary to husband\u2019s contention, Rule 1:1 did not affect the authority of the court to correct a void provision of its original decree. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-428(A)(ii). A judgment void <em>ab initio </em>for want of jurisdiction \u201cmay be attacked in any court at any time, directly or collaterally.\u201d <em>Rook v. Rook, </em>233 Va. 92, 95, 353 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1987); <em>see Morse v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 466, 468, 369 S.E.2d 863, 864 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Husband\u2019s assertion that the earlier order of spousal support terminated by operation of law upon entry of the divorce decree is also without merit. An existing order of spousal support survives a subsequent decree of divorce which is silent on the issue. <em>See Werner v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 623, 624-25, 186 S.E.2d 76, 77-78 (1972); see <em>also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-244(A), 20-79(a); <em>Martin v. Bales, </em>7 Va.App. 141, 145-46, 371 S.E.2d 823, 826 (1988). As the Court instructed in <em>Werner, </em>either party, by proper pleading, \u201ccould have asked the Circuit Court to make specific provision in the final divorce decree for allowance or denial of [spousal support]. If such a provision had been included in the decree, the jurisdiction of the [district court] would have ceased under \u00a7 20-79(a).\u201d <em>Werner, </em>212 Va. at 625, 186 S.E.2d at 78; <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-244(A). However, because \u201cneither party sought to have such provision made,\u201d the preexisting support order \u201ccontinue[d] in full force and effect.\u201d <em>Werner, </em>212 Va. at 625, 186 S.E.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. Wife contends that the record is insufficient to permit appellate review. We disagree and address the merits of the appeal. <em>See Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 96, 99, 341 S.E.2d 400, 402 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
