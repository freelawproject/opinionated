Jones appeals the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s decision denying him medical benefits. For the reasons stated, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Jones filed a claim for an occupational disease contracted as a result of his exposure to asbestos in the course of his employment with E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company (employer). After a hearing, the deputy commissioner denied his claim for a permanent scheduled loss under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B)(17):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">In terms of asbestos caused pleural plaque and diaphragmatic plaque, none of the physicians have provided an analysis sufficient to conclude, with any degree of probability or likelihood, the extent of this condition or its medical characterization. Without such an analysis, it would be mere speculation to draw a conclusion regarding the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ant\u2019s pleural condition and whether or not it amounts to a stageable level of asbestosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Although the deputy commissioner found that Jones\u2019 condition had not yet reached a ratable stage of asbestosis, he did award Jones lifetime medical benefits for Jones\u2019 occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The employer appealed, and the full commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award. The full commission ruled that because the asbestosis had not reached a <em>ratable </em>level under Code \u00a7 65.2-503, it had therefore not yet reached a <em>compensable </em>level. Accordingly, the commission ruled that medical benefits could not be awarded for a non-compensable disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We find that the commission\u2019s interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is too narrow. The deputy commissioner made a factual finding, with which the commission concurred, that the presence of disease was established, evidenced by asbestos fibers, scarring, and pleural thickening. The employer and the commission cite <em>Mayo v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>70 O.I.C. 181 (1991), for the proposition that undisputed asbestosis that has not reached a ratable level under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 (formerly Code \u00a7 65.1-56) is not a compensable occupational disease and renders the claimant ineligible for any benefits under the Act. We disagree. Simply because the disease fails to rise to the level of a permanent loss on the schedule of Code \u00a7 65.2-503 does not automatically preclude an award of medical benefits. To the extent that <em>Mayo </em>conflicts with our own reading of the Act, <em>Mayo </em>does not accurately state the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-403 allows an award of medical benefits to employees who have an occupational disease covered by the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If Jones\u2019 condition constitutes an occupational disease, he is entitled to those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The Act defines an occupational disease as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>A. As used in this title, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">B. A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">1. A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease;</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">2. It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment;</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">3. It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column;</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Code \u00a7 65.2-400. Upon review of the statutory language and the factual findings of the commission, we conclude that Jones\u2019 condition falls within the definition of an occupational disease. He is therefore entitled to medical benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-403. Whether a permanent loss compensable under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 accompanies the disease has no impact upon an award under Code \u00a7 65.2-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>We reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to enter an award not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\">. Section 65.2-403 allows the same medical benefits as those awarded for an injury by accident. We note that the commission frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>awards medical benefits for accidental injuries where no other compensation is awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
