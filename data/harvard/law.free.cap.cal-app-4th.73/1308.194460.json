Two issues are presented. The first is whether the trial court erred in granting a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), eliminating the jury\u2019s apportionment of liability to manufacturers of asbestos flooring in addition to Congoleum. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we find that the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by substantial evidence and reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of a JNOV. The second issue concerns the proper setoff of settlements entered into by other defendants allegedly at a time when Ehret was still alive and damages for pain and suffering were potentially available. We consider this issue in the published portion of our opinion. We hold that an apportionment of the settlements between economic and noneconomic damages is required. Because Ehret\u2019s heirs did not meet their burden of offering evidence to support their proposed good faith allocation of the settlements, we hold that the settlements should be apportioned between economic and noneconomic damages according to the formula set forth in <em>Espinoza </em>v. <em>Machonga </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 268 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 498],</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Factual and Procedural Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">In 1996 Ehret, a journeyman floor covering contractor, was diagnosed with terminal pericardial mesothelioma. He filed suit against several flooring manufacturers and distributors, including Congoleum. He alleged that asbestos in various flooring products he had installed 20 to 30 years earlier caused his illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">All manufacturers other than Congoleum settled. The settlements totaled $2,565,000. One distributor, L.D. Brinkman &amp; Co. (Brinkman), also remained in the case through trial. Brinkman was successor in interest to A.L. Greenbaum Company, a distributor that allegedly handled the products of flooring manufacturers Congoleum, Amtico, and Flintkote.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">During trial, Ehret died. The trial continued as a wrongful death action with Ehret\u2019s widow and three other heirs as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>Ehret\u2019s deposition testimony was admitted at trial. He testified that he had installed, removed, and sanded asbestos floor covering materials manufactured by Congoleum, Armstrong, Amtico, Azrock, Mannington, Flintkote, and Kentile. He did not use the products of any one manufacturer more than the products of any other manufacturer. He testified that he installed hundreds of thousands of asbestos floor tiles and sheet goods over 20 years of his career. He knew when floor covering and sheet goods that he installed contained asbestos because the packaging was marked as containing asbestos and because he could see the fibers when he cut the material. He recalled that all of the manufacturers started discontinuing use of asbestos at about the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">A defense witness and employee of Congoleum, Michael Sapienza, testified that when he started with Congoleum in 1983 he analyzed all competitors\u2019 products and they all contained asbestos. Previously, as an employee of Kentile, Sapienza also had analyzed competitors\u2019 products and had found them to contain asbestos. In about 1983, Congoleum was in the process of taking asbestos out of its flooring products; other manufacturers were doing the same. Flooring manufacturers did not compete based on the composition of their flooring or how the products were made. Those qualities were similar among the various manufacturers\u2019 products. The manufacturers competed based on color and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">One of Congoleum\u2019s defenses was that the asbestos in its flooring was encapsulated in a plastic binder and thus could not have harmed Ehret. However, plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. William Longo, testified that broken or sanded floor tiles produced uncoated chrysotile asbestos fibers. Plaintiffs\u2019 other expert, Dr. Samuel Hammar, testified that the amount of asbestos to which Ehret was exposed by use of Congoleum\u2019s floor tile alone was sufficient to cause mesothelioma, the disease from which Ehret died. For purposes of his opinion, Dr. Hammar assumed that one-fifth or one-sixth of the floor tile to which Ehret was exposed was Congoleum product.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Plaintiffs also offered evidence that Congoleum had supplied products containing asbestos to other flooring manufacturers. There was testimony that Congoleum sold an asbestos felt backing for flooring to Amtico and Mannington. In addition, plaintiffs presented evidence that Congoleum had failed to warn users of potential risks of working with asbestos flooring and that such risks were known or knowable at the time of manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The jury returned a special verdict, finding in favor of Ehret\u2019s heirs and against Congoleum and Brinkman. The jury found that the flooring manufactured by Congoleum was defective, that Congoleum had failed to warn of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>a known or knowable potential risk, and that Congoleum\u2019s acts were a cause of Ehret\u2019s fatal illness. In response to a question that asked the jury to apportion fault for Ehret\u2019s fatal illness, the jury assigned 25 percent fault to Congoleum and 12.5 percent each to Armstrong, Amtico, Azrock, Manning-ton, Flintkote, and Kentile. The jury also found that A.L. Greenbaum Company (the predecessor of defendant Brinkman) distributed the asbestos flooring products of Congoleum, Flintkote, and Amtico. The jury award totaled $3,322,551, consisting of $622,551 for medical and burial expenses and loss of past and future earnings, $2,550,000 for loss of care, comfort and society to Ehret\u2019s widow, and $50,000 for loss of care, comfort and society to each of Ehret\u2019s three other heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Immediately after the jury\u2019s verdict, the court and counsel discussed the need to determine an appropriate offset from the verdict against Congoleum in light of settlements that had been entered into by other defendants. It was agreed that the offset issue would be briefed in a motion filed by Congo-leum. Counsel for Congoleum asked the court to require the plaintiffs to produce the settlement documents because \u201cI would need that information for off-sets.\u201d Counsel for Ehret\u2019s heirs stated that the settlements were confidential, and the court indicated that it could review the settlements in camera. During the colloquy, one of the counsel for Ehret\u2019s heirs stated: \u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a single settlement fully effectuated yet, has there?\u201d However another counsel for plaintiffs stated that \u201call settlements were effected during the time of [Ehret\u2019s] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Judgment was entered in accordance with the jury\u2019s special verdict and notice of entry of judgment was served on June 27, 1997. Thereafter Congoleum and Brinkman filed several posttrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Congoleum filed a motion to vacate or modify judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 663. Congoleum argued that its liability for noneconomic damages should be limited to its percentage of fault pursuant to Civil Code section 1431.2 (commonly known as Proposition 51). Congo-leum asked the trial court to reduce the jury\u2019s award of economic damages by a portion of the settlements entered into by other defendants before trial, according to the formula set forth in <em>Espinoza </em>v. <em>Machonga, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th 268 <em>(Espinoza). </em>In <em>Espinoza </em>the court determined the portion of a settlement to be set off from the economic damages portion of a judgment by applying the percentage of the economic damages award in relationship to the total award of damages. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 276-277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">In opposition to Congoleum\u2019s argument concerning settlement setoffs, Ehret\u2019s heirs argued that the court should weigh the various factors that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>existed at the time of the settlements and make an allocation of the settlement amounts between the wrongful death and personal injury actions. Plaintiffs argued that such an allocation was required because the settlements were entered into while Ehret was alive and had a viable claim for damages for pain and suffering, but the jury\u2019s verdict in the wrongful death action could not include damages for pain and suffering. Plaintiffs suggested that 80 percent of the settlement amounts should be credited to Ehret\u2019s personal injury action. Plaintiffs did not present the settlement documents to the court, offer any evidence of the settlement terms, or provide any evidentiary support for their assertion that the settlements were entered into while Ehret was still alive. Plaintiffs offered no evidence in support of their requested allocation of damages (other than a description of Ehret\u2019s suffering included in their brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">On July 9, 1997, Congoleum also filed a motion for new trial, arguing that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive and again seeking offsets for settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Brinkman filed a motion to vacate judgment on July 7, 1997, and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on July 14, 1997. One ground for Brinkman\u2019s motions was that the jury\u2019s apportionment of 12.5 percent liability to Flintkote and Amtico was not supported by substantial evidence. Brinkman had an interest in eliminating any apportionment of liability to Flintkote and Amtico because Brinkman was held vicariously liable as a distributor of their products.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brinkman joined Congoleum in arguing that any jury award should be reduced by a setoff for settlements. Brinkman also filed a motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">On July 22, 1997, the trial court heard Congoleum\u2019s and Brinkman\u2019s motions to vacate or modify judgment. After hearing argument on Brink-man\u2019s motion, the trial court held that Congoleum had not met its burden of proving that other manufacturers\u2019 products contributed to Ehret\u2019s injuries. Based on this ruling, the court eliminated apportionment of fault to manufacturers other than Congoleum and ordered that a judgment notwithstanding the verdict be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">The trial court also held that apportionment of noneconomic damages pursuant to Civil Code section 1431.2 did not apply in this case (although the court noted the uncertain state of the law regarding the applicability of that section to asbestos cases in light of the fact that the statute applied prospectively only). The trial court also held that the settlements with other defendants should be apportioned between personal injury claims and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>wrongful death claims so that the portion attributable to pain and suffering was not set off against the jury award. The trial court ascribed 75 percent of the settlements to payment for pain and suffering, ordering that 25 percent of the settlements be subtracted from the jury verdict, resulting in a total verdict against Congoleum and Brinkman in the amount of $2,681,301. On July 29, 1997, the court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">On August 22, 1997; the court heard argument on Congoleum\u2019s motion for new trial on grounds of excessive damages and denied that motion. The court also heard argument on the remainder of Brinkman\u2019s contentions and denied its motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">At the August 22 hearing, the court and counsel discussed <em>Buttram </em>v. <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 520 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 438, 941 P.2d 71] <em>(Buttram), </em>which had been decided by the California Supreme Court after the July 29., 1997, hearing. The trial judge and counsel agreed that <em>Buttram </em>required reversal of the court\u2019s prior ruling that Civil Code section 1431.2 did not apply to this case. The court stated that, in light of the applicability of Civil Code section 1431.2, it would restructure the judgment and would revisit the allocation of the pretrial settlements. The court ordered counsel to file additional briefs and set a further hearing date of September 24, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Congoleum filed a notice of appeal on September 22, 1997. The trial court issued a minute order staying further proceedings in the trial court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 916, subdivision (a) in light of Congo-leum\u2019s notice of appeal. The September 24 hearing therefore did not proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">\n<em>Allocation of Fault to Other Manufacturers</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">\n<em>Setoff of Settlements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">Ehret\u2019s heirs argue that this court may not consider the issue of setoffs to Congoleum\u2019s liability based on settlements with other defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>because the trial court has not yet issued a final ruling on that issue. However, the trial court did rule on the issue and later lost jurisdiction to alter that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Congoleum raised the issue of setoffs in its motion to vacate or modify judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 663 and in its motion for a new trial. Brinkman raised the same issue in its motion to vacate judgment. The court heard argument on the motions to vacate on July 22, 1997, and ruled on how the settlements should be applied to reduce the jury\u2019s verdict. The trial court\u2019s ruling is set forth in its July 29, 1997, order entering a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Subsequently, on August 22, 1997, the court heard argument on new trial motions, ruled on portions of those motions, and indicated that, based on new case authority, he intended to restructure the judgment with respect to setoff for settlements. However, before the court heard further argument, it lost jurisdiction to alter the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The trial court lost the power to rule on new trial motions on August 26, 1997, 60 days after service of notice of entry of judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 660.) The court already had ruled on the motions to vacate judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 663 and, on July 29, 1997, had entered a different judgment applying a setoff that it had determined to be proper. The time within which the court on its own might enter a different judgment notwithstanding the verdict expired at the same time the court lost the power to grant a new trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">When an appeal was filed, the effect was to \u201c \u2018remove[] from the jurisdiction of the superior court the subject matter of the judgment. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Beresh </em>v. <em>Sovereign Life Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 547, 552 [155 Cal.Rptr. 74], quoting <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Hazel Hurst Foundation </em>(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 686, 689 [286 P.2d 53].)  \u201cDuring the pendency of an appeal, the trial court is without power to hear a motion to vacate judgment from which an appeal has been taken [citations].\u201d <em>(Copley </em>v. <em>Copley </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 248, 298 [178 Cal.Rptr. 842].) The point of the rule is to preserve the status quo while the appeal is decided. <em>(Pazderka </em>v. <em>Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 658, 666 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 242].)  While the trial court\u2019s desire to revisit its prior ruling in light of new law is understandable, the rules provide a finite period of time to alter a jury verdict and then allow an appeal to stay further proceedings in the trial court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>Thus the trial court\u2019s opportunity to affect the verdict has ended and the issues of setoff raised in the court below now must be considered on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">After the California Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Buttram, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 520, it is clear that Civil Code section 1431.2 applies to this case, as Ehret\u2019s heirs appear to concede. <em>Buttram </em>held that Civil Code section 1431.2, which applies prospectively only, governs a cause of action for damages arising from the latent and progressive disease mesothelioma if the plaintiff was diagnosed with the disease or discovered his injuries subsequent to June 4, 1986, the effective date of Civil Code section 1431.2. Ehret discovered his injuries in 1995, and thus Civil Code section 1431.2 governs this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Civil Code section 1431.2 was enacted as part of the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986 (popularly known as Proposition 51). It provides: \u201cIn any action for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, based upon principles of comparative fault, the liability of each defendant for non-economic damages shall be several only and shall not be joint. Each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of non-economic damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant\u2019s percentage of fault, and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1431.2, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 877 governs offsets for pretrial settlements reached with joint tortfeasors. It provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhere a release, dismissal with or without prejudice, or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort. . . it shall have the following effect: flQ (a) It shall not discharge any other such party from liability unless its terms so provide, but it shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release, the dismissal or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it whichever is the greater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>The basic principles governing the interplay between Civil Code section 1431.2 and Code of Civil Procedure section 877 are now well established. (See generally, <em>Poire </em>v. <em>C.L. Peck/Jones Brothers Construction Corp. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1838 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 631] <em>(Poire).) </em>Under Civil Code section 1431.2, a defendant is only responsible for its share of noneconomic damages as that share has been determined by the jury. \u201cTherefore, a nonsettling defendant may not receive any setoff under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 877 for the portion of a settlement by another defendant that is attributable to noneconomic damages.\u201d (39 Cal.App.4th at p. 1838.) After application of Civil Code section 1431.2, \u201c. . . there is no amount that represents a common claim for noneconomic damages against the settling and nonsettling defendants\u201d and thus Code of Civil Procedure section 877 has no applicability to noneconomic damages. <em>(Hoch </em>v. <em>Allied-Signal, Inc. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 48, 64 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 615].)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The issue concerning setoffs that is in contention on this appeal is what portion of the settlements should be set off against the economic damages portion of the verdict against Congoleum. Congoleum argues that because Ehret\u2019s heirs did not provide the terms of the settlement agreement to the trial court, the entire amount of the settlements should be set off against the economic damages award. In the alternative, Congoleum argues that the court should apply the formula adopted in <em>Espinoza, </em>which determines the portion of the settlement to be set off from the economic damages judgment by applying the percentage of the economic damages award in relationship to the total award of damages. <em>(Espinoza, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 276-277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Ehret\u2019s heirs contend that, because damages for pain and suffering were available at the time of the settlements but not at the time of trial, the jury\u2019s wrongful death verdict does not provide a reliable basis for apportioning the settlement sums between economic and noneconomic damages. Plaintiffs urge that the trial court\u2019s apportionment of 75 percent of the settlements to noneconomic damages (pain and suffering) should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">First, we reject Congoleum\u2019s contention that the economic damages award against it must be reduced by the entire amount of the pretrial settlements with other defendants. Congoleum cites cases (e.g., <em>Dillingham Construction, N.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Nadel Partnership, Inc. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 264 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 207]; <em>Erreca\u2019s </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1475 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 156]) holding that a plaintiff who seeks to allocate a settlement among different types of damages must provide the terms of the agreement to the nonsettling parties and demonstrate that the allocation is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>good faith. Congoleum argues there can be no allocation of the settlement sums between economic and noneconomic damages in this case because Ehret\u2019s heirs have not disclosed the terms of the settlement agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Congoleum\u2019s argument is contrary to <em>Espinoza. </em>That case considered the proper offset for a settlement that did not differentiate the amounts attributable to economic and noneconomic damages. Although Code of Civil Procedure section 877 provides that a settlement shall reduce joint tortfeasors\u2019 liability by the amount stipulated in the settlement \u201cor in the amount of the consideration paid for it whichever is the greater,\u201d <em>Espinoza </em>held that, in order properly to implement Civil Code section 1431.2, an undifferentiated settlement must be apportioned between economic and noneconomic damages so that the setoff applies only to economic damages. <em>(Espinoza, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 274-277.) \u201cTo do otherwise would, in effect, cause money paid in settlement to be treated as if it was paid as a joint liability. This could not properly be done on a verdict and we see no basis why it should be done on a settlement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 276-277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The absence of a court approved pretrial allocation of a settlement between economic and noneconomic damages does not preclude a court from making a postverdict allocation. <em>(Greathouse </em>v. <em>Amcord, Inc. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 831, 840-841 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 561]; see <em>Poire, supra, </em>.39 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1840-1841 [rejecting the argument that a nonsettling <em>defendant </em>lost the right to seek allocation of a pretrial settlement between economic and noneconomic damages by not raising the issue when the court approved the settlement as being in good faith].) Some allocation of an undifferentiated settlement between economic and noneconomic damages is required because only the amount attributable to the joint responsibility for economic damages may be used as an offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">In the absence of any other .allocation, <em>Espinoza </em>provides that the percentage of economic damages reflected in the jury verdict be applied to determine the percentage of the settlements to be offset. <em>(Espinoza, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 276-277.) The <em>Espinoza </em>formula is now well established. (See, e.g., <em>McComber </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 512, 517 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 376]; <em>Poire, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1838-1839.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Second, we hold that, assuming it would be proper for a court to allocate a settlement between economic and noneconomic damages in a proportion different from that reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict, Ehret\u2019s heirs did not meet their burden of proof in requesting such an allocation. Ehret\u2019s heirs had the burden of offering evidence of the terms of the settlements and the timing of the settlements in order to establish the good faith of the allocation they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>proposed. They failed to meet this evidentiary burden, and therefore failed to establish a basis for an allocation other than that dictated by <em>Espinoza.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">It is not yet settled whether and when a trial court can allocate a pretrial settlement between economic and noneconomic damages. In <em>Espinoza, </em>the court did not reach the question \u201cwhether a trial court presiding over a good faith settlement hearing should make [an allocation of a settlement between economic and noneconomic damages] if it is requested to do so.\u201d <em>(Espinoza, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 277, fn. 9, citing Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877.6.) Similarly, in <em>Greathouse </em>v. <em>Amcord, Inc., supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th 831, the court assumed, but did not decide, that the trial court has power \u201cto determine the amount of a settlement credit in a hearing under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 that satisfies due process standards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 841.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">In <em>Greathouse </em>the court also held that the <em>only </em>appropriate postverdict apportionment of a pretrial settlement between economic and noneconomic damages was the allocation reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict (i.e., allocation according to the <em>Espinoza </em>formula). (35 Cal.App.4th at pp. 838-841.) \u201cWhen the issue [of allocation between economic and'noneconomic damages] was brought before the court in plaintiffs\u2019 posttrial motion, it had already been decided in a fully adversary proceeding \u2014 the trial itself. The jury\u2019s apportionment of damages between economic and noneconomic damages should be binding on the trial court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 841.) The court nevertheless acknowledged that \u201c[i]n other cases, pretrial settlement may involve elements of damages, such as attorney fees, that have a differential impact on various defendants \u201c and \u201c[did] not reach the complexities presented by such cases.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 840, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">We assume without deciding (1) that a trial court presiding over a good faith settlement hearing may allocate a pretrial settlement between economic and noneconomic damages, and (2) that in this case it might be appropriate to allocate the pretrial settlements between economic and noneconomic damages in a proportion different from that reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict if damages for Ehret\u2019s pain and suffering were available at the time of the settlements but not at the time of the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Nevertheless, in order to obtain the benefit of an allocation of the amount of a settlement, the plaintiff is required to make \u201can evidentiary showing . . . to justify such allocation.\u201d <em>(Erreca\u2019s </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1491.) \u201cThe statutory requirement of good faith extends not only to the amount of the overall settlement but as well to any allocation which operates to exclude any portion of the settlement from the setoff.\u201d <em>(Knox </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 825, 837 [167 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 463], quoted with approval in <em>Erreca\u2019s </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1491.) Where there is a complete dismissal of a defendant, and a plaintiff seeks an allocation of the settlement with that defendant for purposes of limiting the setoff against another defendant\u2019s liability, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish facts to justify the allocation. <em>(Knox </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Ehret\u2019s heirs did not meet that burden in the court below. Because they sought a postverdict allocation different from the calculation that <em>Espinoza </em>prescribes in the absence of a pretrial allocation, Ehret\u2019s heirs bore the burden of establishing an evidentiary basis for their proposed allocation. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a major component of the settlements is attributable to pain and suffering obviously depends critically on whether the settlements were agreed to before or after Ehret died. Moreover plaintiffs\u2019 argument assumes sub silentio that the settlements were not structured to reduce the amount payable by a settling defendant if Ehret did not survive trial. Yet plaintiffs did not provide the court with evidentiary support for these critical assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of establishing the good faith of any proposed allocation between economic and noneconomic damages requires plaintiffs to reveal whether any settlement agreement includes an allocation. The good faith of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed allocation cannot be determined without knowing whether that proposal is contradicted by any different allocation in the settlement agreement. In making an allocation between economic and noneconomic damages, a plaintiff has an interest in allocating as little as possible to economic damages and a settling defendant has \u201cno incentive to oppose the plaintiff\u2019s allocation because [the settling defendant is] entirely unaffected by it.\u201d <em>(Greathouse </em>v. <em>Amcord, Inc., supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 841.) If the settlements in this case included allocations that were less favorable to the plaintiffs than the allocation they requested in posttrial motions, the allocations in the settlements obviously should have affected the trial court\u2019s good faith determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">In order to establish a good faith basis for an allocation different from the <em>Espinoza </em>formula, Ehret\u2019s heirs had the burden of offering evidence of the terms of the settlements, including any allocation therein, and of the timing of the settlements. Ehret\u2019s heirs had a full opportunity to offer this evidence before the court made its July 22, 1997, ruling on allocation. Because they failed to meet their burden, the trial court\u2019s allocation must be reversed. (See <em>Contemporary Investments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Safeco Title Ins. Co. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 999, 1003, 1005 [193 Cal.Rptr. 822] [party\u2019s failure to offer evidence on an issue on which that party had the burden of proof requires reversal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>Because Ehret\u2019s heirs have failed to make out an adequate basis for a good faith allocation of the settlements, and because <em>Espinoza </em>requires that there be some allocation of the settlements between economic and noneconomic damages <em>(Espinoza, supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 274-277), we apply the percentage allocation method prescribed by that case. Thus, the computation of the judgment against Congoleum is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Economic damage award to Ehret\u2019s widow (18.7% of total damages) $622,551.00</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Minus setoff for settlements by other defendants (18.7% x $2,565,000) -$479.655.00</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Congoleum\u2019s liability for economic damages $142,896.00</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">Plus Congoleum\u2019s share of noneconomic damage award to Ehret\u2019s widow (25% x $2,550,000) +$637,500.00</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Plus Congoleum\u2019s share of noneconomic damage award to other heirs ($50,000 each x 3 heirs x 25%) +$ 37.500.00</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Congoleum\u2019s total liability $817 8Q6 nr&gt;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">The trial court\u2019s grant of a JNOV is reversed and the case is remanded for the court to enter judgment against Congoleum in the amount of $817,896. Congoleum shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-19\">Epstein, Acting P. J., and Curry, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Brinkman had an indemnity claim against Congoleum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1308.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b982-7\">In a motion filed during the pendency of the appeal, Congoleum asked this court to adjudicate the effect on Congoleum\u2019s liability of a settlement between Ehret\u2019s heirs and Brinkman that took place during this appeal. We decline to do so. Congoleum had notice on December 2, 1998, when Brinkman filed an application for extension of time with this court, that Brinkman had reached a tentative settlement with plaintiffs. Brinkman\u2019s appeal was dismissed by this court on January 14,1999. Yet Congoleum waited until this case was set for argument to ask that the Brinkman settlement be considered on appeal. Ehret\u2019s heirs therefore have not had an adequate opportunity to brief this issue. The function of an appellate court ordinarily is to review actions taken by the trial court. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 330, pp. 371-372.) There is insufficient basis for deviating from this general rule in the current posture of this case, particularly where to do so would require the taking of evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b987-20\">Congoleum also appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for new trial. However, Congoleum\u2019s brief states that it waives its arguments for a new trial if this court reverses the trial court\u2019s grant of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and permits setoffs for the settlements such that the judgment against Congoleum is no more than $817,896. Because we order entry of judgment in that amount, we do not consider Congoleum\u2019s arguments for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
