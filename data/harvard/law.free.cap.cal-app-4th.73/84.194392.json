Defendant barged into the house where Raines was hiding out from him and kidnapped Raines at gunpoint. He drove Raines around town, from pay phone to pay phone, while Raines tried to arrange payment of $200 in ransom. Defendant kept the loaded gun pointed at Raines most of this time and threatened to shoot him if he could not get the money, if he did anything \u201cfunny,\u201dor if the police intervened. Defendant was captured, and Raines was freed, when the police raided the ransom \u201cdrop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In the published portion of this opinion, we will hold there was sufficient evidence that defendant intentionally confined the victim in a manner which exposed the victim to a substantial likelihood of death, so as to support a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We will also consider the \u201cmultiple victim\u201d exception to Penal Code section 654. This applies where the defendant has committed violent crimes against multiple victims. We will hold that burglary is a violent crime for purposes of the \u201cmultiple victim\u201d exception when the jury finds that, in the commission of the burglary, the defendant personally used a firearm. We will also hold that the trial court may determine the identity of the victim (or victims) of a violent crime for this purpose even though no victim was named in the information or by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In the nonpublished portion of this opinion, we find, no reversible error. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Defendant supplied victim Daniel Raines with methamphetamine for resale. Defendant would \u201cfront\u201d Raines an eight-ball (an eighth of an ounce of methamphetamine); Raines would sell it, use the proceeds to repay defendant, and keep any profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">In late December 1996, Raines made the mistake of keeping and using one of defendant\u2019s eight-balls. As a result, he was unable to repay the $200, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>he owed defendant for it. When defendant angrily confronted him, Raines told defendant he was going to a friend\u2019s house to get the money. But Raines did not come back; instead, he started hiding out from defendant by staying with various friends, each for only a few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On January 15, 1997, Raines was staying with a friend in Winchester. Jennifer Grundman, who lived there, and a man named Rick were also present. About 11:30 a.m., defendant opened the front door and came in. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Michelle Estrada, came in behind him. Defendant was holding a revolver. He announced, \u201cI\u2019m going to take Danny.\u201d \u201cHe owes me money.\u201d Defendant then pointed the gun \u201cin [Raines\u2019s] face\u201d and said: \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me. You\u2019re going to pay your debt.\u201d Rick said, \u201cHe\u2019s not going with you.\u201d Defendant cocked his gun, pointed it at Rick, and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re willing to take a bullet for your friend?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Defendant took Raines by the one arm; Estrada took him by the other arm. Defendant was still pointing the gun at Raines\u2019s stomach. They walked him out to defendant\u2019s car and told him to get in. Defendant\u2019s two young daughters were in the backseat. Defendant said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get my money, mother fucker. You\u2019re going to get my money. I want my money today. You ain\u2019t leaving my sight until I get my money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Shortly after defendant began driving, he unloaded his gun and gave it to Estrada. According to Estrada, she put it in the trunk; she testified that, about two hours later, when defendant dropped her off, it was still there.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">According to Raines, however, he was still afraid because Estrada, who was sitting right behind him, had the gun. About 15 minutes later, defendant reloaded the gun. While he drove, he held the gun under his right leg, pointed at Raines. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything funny, . . . because the gun is pointed straight at you . . . .\u201d \u201cI could shoot it at any time.\u201d Later, defendant took the gun out from under his leg and held it on his lap. He threatened to shoot Raines if he did not get his money. He also threatened several times to shoot Raines if the police got involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Defendant drove to a gas station in Hemet, where Raines made several calls from a pay phone in an effort to raise the money. Estrada went with him while he called. Eventually, an acquaintance named Kim Yoakum told Raines she would try to get the money for him. Defendant drove Raines to another gas station, where Raines called Yoakum again. Once again, Estrada stayed with him while he called. Sometime after this, defendant dropped Estrada and their children off at a friend\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Yoakum tried to raise the money, but failed. Nevertheless, she agreed to meet defendant at an AM/PM minimarket and to give him the money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Defendant told Yoakum not to notify the police. Raines, too, told her not to get the police involved. Yoakum, however, called the police immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">After defendant and Raines arrived at the AM/PM, defendant noticed an unmarked police car. He said, \u201cIf it\u2019s a set up, I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d As defendant was driving away, the police car pulled in front of him, blocking his path. Defendant maneuvered backward, then forward again, but more police cars boxed him in. Meanwhile, Raines jumped out of the moving car. A police officer pulled defendant out of the car and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Inside the car, on the floorboard on the driver\u2019s side, the police found a fully loaded .357-magnum revolver. Estrada identified it as defendant\u2019s. They also found 4.9 grams of methamphetamine in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">A jury found defendant guilty of kidnapping for ransom (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a)), first degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (a)), possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)), transportation of methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11379, subd. (a)), possession of methamphetamine while armed with a loaded, operable firearm (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370.1, subd. (a)), and assault with a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The jury also found that, in the commission of the kidnapping, defendant intentionally confined the victim in a manner which either caused him to suffer bodily harm or exposed him to a substantial likelihood of death. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a).) It further found that, in the commission of the kidnapping, the burglary, and the assault, defendant personally used a firearm. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a).) In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found that defendant had served five prior prison terms (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The trial court dismissed the convictions for possession of methamphetamine while armed and for assault with a firearm, all the personal firearm use allegations and all but two of the prior prison term allegations. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of life without the possibility of parole on the kidnapping for ransom, plus a total determinate term of nine years and eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The Sufficiency of the Evidence of a Substantial Likelihood of Death</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence he intentionally confined Raines in a manner which exposed Raines to a substantial likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The interpretation of the applicable statute is a question of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1091 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 439].)  The determination of the historical facts is committed to the jury. We \u201c \u2018must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence \u2014 that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value \u2014 such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.] We \u2018 \u201cpresume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 509 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119], cert. den. (1996) 516 U.S. 1121 [116 S.Ct. 932, 133 L.Ed.2d 859].) Whether the facts (when so viewed) meet the statutory standard (when so construed) is a question of law. (See <em>Western States Petroleum Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 570 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 139, 888 P.2d 1268].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Penal Code section 209, subdivision (a), defines the crime of kidnapping for ransom, reward, or extortion. It provides that, if \u201cany person subjected to any such act suffers death or bodily harm, or is intentionally confined in a manner which exposes that person to a substantial likelihood of death,\u201d the penalty is life in prison without the possibility of parole. Otherwise, the penalty is life in prison <em>with </em>the possibility of parole. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Immediately prior to 1982, the penalty of life without parole applied only if the victim \u201csuffer[ed] death or bodily harm.\u201d (Former Pen. Code, \u00a7 209; Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7 15, p. 1262.) In 1982, the statute was amended to extend the penalty of life without parole to cases in which the victim \u201cis intentionally confined in a manner which exposes such person to a substantial likelihood of death . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 4, \u00a7 1, pp. 4-5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The People have never claimed Raines suffered bodily harm. There was evidence that, when Raines first got into the car, defendant hit him in the mouth with the back of his hand. This caused Raines \u201ca little bit\u201d of pain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>but no \u201cbruises or anything like that.\u201d Defendant also hit Raines in the chest with his elbow. In addition, when Raines jumped out of defendant\u2019s car, the door hit him, and he got \u201cscraped up a little bit.\u201d  These would appear to be the sort of \u201ctrivial injuries]\u201d that are insufficient to constitute bodily harm within the meaning of the statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 511, 517 [282 P.2d 898] [fact that victim\u2019s wrists were bound so as to cause pain and impair circulation was insufficient evidence of \u201cbodily harm\u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 690, 711 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365] [fact that victim fell on sidewalk, absent evidence of any resulting injury, was insufficient evidence of \u201cbodily harm\u201d], revd. on other grounds (1967) 388 U.S. 263 [87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Dacy </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 216, 220 [85 Cal.Rptr. 57] [four-inch cut requiring more than twenty stitches, plus smaller cuts, bruises, and \u201csuperficial abrasions,\u201d constituted \u201cbodily harm\u201d].)  In closing argument, the prosecutor elected to rely on a substantial likelihood of death; he did not argue Raines suffered bodily harm. We therefore limit our consideration to whether the jury could find defendant intentionally confined Raines in a manner which exposed him to a substantial likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The first case to construe the \u201csubstantial likelihood of death\u201d provision was <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrano </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1672 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 305], There, the defendant and his accomplices kidnapped the victim at gunpoint. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1674.) When the police located their hideout, they \u201cused [the victim] as a shield, made it to a car, and drove off, leading the police on a seventy mile-per-hour chase on surface streets during which the culprits ran three red lights.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1675.) On appeal, the defendant did not raise, and the appellate court therefore did not discuss, the sufficiency of the evidence to show a substantial likelihood of death.  The court did hold, however, the \u201csubstantial likelihood of death\u201d provision was not unconstitutionally vague: \u201cWe find nothing indicating that the Legislature intended the amendment to be read in any but its plain ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1676-1677.) \u201cThe Legislature . . . plainly meant to enhance punishment for a kidnapper who intentionally increases, by a certain degree, the risk of death otherwise inherent in kidnapping. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1676.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We have found only one case dealing with the sufficiency of the evidence of a substantial likelihood of death. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 52 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 434], the defendants tried to escape from a Youth Authority facility by taking the librarian hostage. They held her at the point of a \u201cshank,\u201d or homemade knife; they threatened to kill her with it unless they were given a truck in which to make their getaway. Once they had obtained the truck, they took the librarian with them and threatened to kill her if anyone interfered. After an officer sprayed Mace into the truck, it crashed into a tree. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 58-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The appellate court held there was sufficient evidence that the defendants had intentionally confined the victim in a manner which exposed her to a substantial likelihood of death. \u201cBefore the truck was delivered, appellants choked [the victim] unconscious, stabbed her in the stomach, and severely bruised and sprained her right arm. The method of confinement and appellants\u2019 use of [the victim] as a hostage exposed her to a substantial risk of death. [\u00b6] The trial court also found that the escape in the truck posed a substantial risk of death because it could have led to a high speed pursuit. This was not impermissible speculation. The Legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u2018likelihood\u2019 allows and requires the trier of fact to draw reasonable inferences in determining whether the victim was exposed to a substantial likelihood of death.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chacon, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 61.) The court also observed: \u201cIntentional movement of the victim may create a substantial risk of death. [Citations.] [\u00b6] Here, after appellants dragged [the victim] to the truck, and sped away from the library, the truck ran into a tree. The force of the impact broke the windshield, jammed the doors shut, and collapsed the steering wheel. The trial court factually found that the escape with [the victim] created a \u2018substantial risk of her death.\u2019 Substantial evidence supports this factual determination. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 61-62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The \u201csubstantial likelihood of death\u201d provision was added in response to <em>People </em>v. <em>Schoenfeld </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 671 [168 Cal.Rptr. 762]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chacon, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 59, fn. 3; <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrano, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1676; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1227, fn. 12 [277 Cal.Rptr. 382]; <em>Review of Selected 1982 California Legislation </em>(1983) 14 Pacific L.J. 357, 601-602.) <em>Schoenfeld </em>involved the notorious Chowchilla kidnapping; it held the victims\u2019 emotional distress, which led them to suffer nosebleeds, stomachaches, and fainting, did not constitute \u201cbodily injury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pp. 687-688.) The Legislature evidently intended to permit the imposition of life without the possibility of parole in any future case similar to <em>Schoenfeld. </em>Thus, as defendant concedes, \u201cthe <em>Schoenfeld </em>case provides some insight into the sort of circumstances to which the amendment applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The <em>Schoenfeld </em>defendants hijacked a school bus at gunpoint. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pp. 676-677.) They transported the children in overcrowded vans, without food, water, or toilets, for nearly 12 hours. They then imprisoned them in a \u201cpreviously buried furniture van.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 677-678.) The buried van afforded about six and a half square feet of floor space per person. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678.) It was supplied with plenty of water and a little food. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678 and fn. 8.) \u201cCrude holes had been cut in the fender wells of the van to serve as primitive toilets.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678.) The defendants had installed a ventilation system and had tested it to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>sure it would work for at least 48 hours. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678 and fn. 9.) Nevertheless, the van soon became stuffy and malodorous. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678.) If their ransom demand were not met, or if any of the children became ill, the defendants planned to halt the kidnapping and release the victims. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 676, fn. 4.) After the.victims were in the van for about 16 hours <em>(id., </em>at p. 676), however, they managed to reopen the sealed entrance hole. All the victims escaped unharmed. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Here, the jury could reasonably find defendant intentionally confined Raines in a manner which exposed him to a substantial likelihood of death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant kept a fully loaded gun pointed at Raines, first in the house, then on the walk to the car. While driving around, defendant continued to point the gun at Raines. Defendant threatened to shoot Raines if he could not come up with the money, if he did anything \u201cfunny,\u201d or if the police got involved. Defendant argues that his ransom demand was small and Raines admitted owing the money. In the end, however, Raines <em>was </em>unable to come up with the ransom. Moreover, the police <em>did </em>become involved. Based on these facts, the jury was entitled to find Raines was exposed to a substantial likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Defendant understandably focuses on the fact that, for some period of time, the gun was unloaded and out of his hands. According to Raines, however, the gun was still in the hands of Estrada, defendant\u2019s accomplice, and she was sitting right behind him. Also, according to Raines, defendant took back the gun and reloaded it 15 minutes later. This brief lessening of the immediate danger is insufficient to defeat the jury\u2019s finding. Defendant also argues that he committed the kidnapping in front of witnesses; hence, he was not motivated to kill Raines to avoid identification. He also notes that he brought his family along. The weight to be given these matters was for the jury to decide. Even assuming the jury could have found defendant would not have killed Raines, it was not compelled to do so. The jury\u2019s implied finding to the contrary was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Raines was not in as much danger as the victim in <em>Chacon, </em>who was stabbed in the stomach, choked into unconsciousness, and driven into a tree. However, as the <em>Chacon </em>court held, the jury was entitled to consider various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>possibilities even though they did not come to pass, including the possibility that defendant would shoot Raines because he could not come up with the money or because the police intervened. Certainly it would seem Raines was in more danger than the victims in <em>Schoenfeld, </em>who, though buried underground, were supplied with food, water, and a working ventilation system, and who were to be released if they fell ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Defendant therefore argues that, as a matter of law, a \u201cgarden-variety\u201d kidnapping at gunpoint should not be sufficient to support a finding of a substantial likelihood of death. He argues that, if the same penalty applies to a kidnapping at gunpoint, such as this one, as applies to a kidnapping in which the victim suffers death or bodily harm, a kidnapper will have little incentive to refrain from harming or killing the victim. We recognize that in discussing a pre-1982 version of the aggravated kidnapping statute, the Supreme Court declared that one of the rationales for an increased penalty when the victim \u201csuffers death or bodily harm\u201d was deterrence: \u201c \u2018[Kidnappers would be less likely to inflict violence upon their victims if they knew that such abstention would save them from the death penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 516, quoting <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1945) 324 U.S. 282, 284 [65 S.Ct. 666, 667-668, 89 L.Ed. 944].) This reasoning, however, applies with less force to the \u201csubstantial likelihood of death\u201d version of the statute. The statute is still meant to deter, but its deterrent aim has been lowered. By extending the increased penalty to cases in which the kidnapper has exposed the victim to a substantial likelihood of death, the Legislature\u2019s purpose necessarily shifted from deterring actual injury to deterring risk-creating behavior. Accordingly, any reduced disincentive effect follows from the Legislature\u2019s deliberate amendment of the statute, not from our holding carrying out that amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We also note that a kidnapper still has ample incentive to avoid harming or killing the victim. If the victim dies during the kidnapping, the kidnapper ordinarily will be guilty of first degree felony murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189) and subject to the death penalty. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(B).) If the victim suffers serious harm, the kidnapper may be guilty of an additional offense, such as assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)), and may be subject to an enhancement for the personal infliction of great bodily injury. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Defendant also argues the more severe penalty was not intended to apply to an \u201cordinary\u201d kidnapping such as this and should be reserved for more egregious kidnappings. He relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 511 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677]. As we noted earlier, <em>Jackson </em>held a \u201ctrivial injury\u201d is insufficient to constitute bodily harm within the meaning of Penal Code section 209. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 517.) There, the only evidence of bodily harm was that the victim\u2019s wrists had been bound with chains \u201cso as to \u2018cut in\u2019 and impair to some extent the circulation of blood. There was no breaking of the skin, but \u2018a few little marks\u2019 similar to those which would be made by the band of a wristwatch.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 516-517.) The Supreme Court held this did not support a finding that the victim had suffered bodily harm \u201cof the nature contemplated by the Legislature in providing the more serious penalty for a kidnaping.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 517.) \u201cIf the more serious penalty may be imposed when the only injury is of a nature similar to that shown by the present record, which concededly is almost necessarily an incident to every forcible kidnaping, neither the purpose of enhancement of the penalty for the more heinous crime nor the intention of deterring the kidnaper from killing or injuring his victim is subserved.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In <em>Daniels, </em>the Supreme Court held that movements of a robbery victim which \u201care merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself\u2019 fail to satisfy the asportation element of kidnapping for robbery. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1139.) It reasoned that, otherwise, almost every robbery, just so long as it involved the slightest movement of the victim, could be prosecuted as an aggravated kidnapping. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1130-1132.) It also noted a concern that kidnapping for robbery, which carried a penalty (at that time) of death or life imprisonment, ought to require more egregious conduct than robbery, which did not. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The <em>Daniels </em>court discussed and relied on <em>Jackson: </em>\u201cJust as we recognized in <em>Jackson </em>that some minor injuries are necessarily incidental to the crime of forcible kidnaping, so we now recognize that some brief movements are necessarily incidental to the crime of armed robbery. . . . And just as we concluded in <em>Jackson </em>that such incidental injuries are \u2018not of the nature contemplated by the Legislature\u2019 in prescribing the bodily harm element of aggravated kidnaping, so we now conclude that such incidental movements are not of the scope intended by the Legislature in prescribing the asportation element of the same crime.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1134, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">We do not believe <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Daniels </em>support defendant\u2019s contention, for two reasons. First, the use of a gun to create a substantial likelihood of death is by no means \u201can incident to every forcible kidnaping.\u201d We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>willing to assume many kidnappings for ransom \u2014 or even most \u2014 involve facts similar to those here. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible to commit kidnapping for ransom without using a gun to create a substantial likelihood of death. First, one need not use a gun at all. The kidnapper (or kidnappers) may simply overpower the victim. This is particularly true in the prototypical kidnapping for ransom, in which the victim is a child. Second, even if one uses a gun, one need not create a substantial likelihood of death. Here, for example, defendant could have committed the kidnapping without creating a substantial likelihood of death simply by using an unloaded gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Second, in <em>Daniels, </em>the distinction in penalty was between kidnapping for robbery, which was punishable by death or life imprisonment, and robbery, which was punishable by as little as one year in prison. (Former Pen. Code, \u00a7 213; Stats. 1923, ch. 128, \u00a7 1, p. 271 [in effect through Dec. 31, 1967]; Stats. 1967, ch. 149, \u00a7 1, p. 1216 [in effect from Jan. 1, 1968].) Even in <em>Jackson, </em>the distinction was between a potential death penalty and life with the possibility of parole. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 515, quoting former Pen. Code, \u00a7 209; Stats. 1933, ch. 1025, \u00a7 1, p. 2617.) We share the concern that so drastic a difference in penalty should reflect a significant difference in culpability. Here, however, the distinction in penalty is between life without the possibility of parole and life with the possibility of parole. We recognize that a defendant sentenced to life with the possibility of parole may be paroled after as little as seven years. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3046.) Nevertheless, we believe this distinction in penalty is not disproportionate to the distinction in culpability between one kidnapper who threatens the victim with a gun in a manner which exposes the victim to a substantial likelihood of death and another who does not. Even assuming that, under our holding, the majority of kidnappings for ransom do expose the victim to a substantial likelihood of death, we believe this is both intended by the Legislature and required by the language of Penal Code section 209, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">At the same time, we are not holding the use of a loaded gun, standing alone, necessarily exposes the victim to a substantial likelihood of death as a matter of law. Inasmuch as there was additional evidence here of a substantial likelihood of death, we are not called upon to address this question, and we express no opinion on it. We merely hold there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that defendant intentionally confined Raines in a manner which exposed Raines to a substantial likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Cruel and Unusual Punishment<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The Application of Penal Code Section 654 to the Burglary and the Kidnapping</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Defendant contends the trial court violated Penal Code section 654 by imposing separate and unstayed sentences for both the burglary and the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u201cSection 654 provides that even though an act violates more than one statute and thus constitutes more than one crime, a defendant may not be punished multiple times for that single act. [Citations.] The \u2018act\u2019 which invokes section 654 may be a continuous \u2018 \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d . . . comprising an indivisible transaction . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The divisibility of a course of conduct depends upon the intent and objective of the defendant. . . . [I]f the evidence discloses that a defendant entertained multiple criminal objectives which were independent of and not merely incidental to each other, the trial court may impose punishment for independent violations committed in pursuit of each objective even though the violations shared common acts or were parts of an otherwise indivisible course of conduct.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Akins </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 331, 338-339 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 338], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Liu </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1135 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 578].)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Burglary consists of entry into a house or other specified structure with the intent to commit a felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.) Thus, ordinarily, if the defendant commits both burglary and the underlying intended felony, Penal Code section 654 will permit punishment for one or the other but not for both. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 492 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610] [burglary and intended murder], cert. den.

Under this exception, \u2018even though a defendant entertains but a single principal objective during an indivisible course of conduct, he may be convicted and punished for each crime of violence committed against a different victim.\u2019 [Citations.] The reason for the multiple victim exception is that \u2018when a defendant \u201c \u2018commits an act of violence with the intent to harm more than one person or by means likely to cause harm to several persons,\u2019 his greater culpability precludes application of section 654.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1756, 1781 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 73], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 553, 587 [180 Cal.Rptr. 266, 639 P.2d 908] and <em>People </em>v. <em>McFarland </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 798, 803 [254 Cal.Rptr. 331, 765 P.2d 493], respectively.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Burglary, standing alone, is not a violent crime for purposes of the multiple victim exception. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1028 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 67]; <em>In re Asean D. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 467, 475, fn. 10 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 572].) However, it may be treated as such when there is a finding that the defendant inflicted great bodily injury in the commission of the burglary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 886 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552] [great bodily injury allegation under former Pen. Code, \u00a7 461 (Stats. 1967, ch. 150, \u00a7 1, p. 1216)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 674, 679-681 [244 Cal.Rptr. 17] [great bodily injury enhancement allegation under Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7].) We believe it also may be treated as such when there is a finding that the defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of the burglary. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a).) For example, robbery is deemed a violent crime <em>(People </em>v. <em>Champion </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 879, 935 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 547, 891 P.2d 93], cert. den. (1996) 516 U.S. 1049 [116 S.Ct. 714, 133 L.Ed.2d 668]), even though it may be committed by fear as well as actual force. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211.)  The \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm has been defined as either \u201cconduct which actually produces harm . . . [or] conduct which produces a fear of harm or force by means or display of a firearm . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Masbruch </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1001, 1007 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 760, 920 P.2d 705], italics omitted, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 666, 672 [102 Cal.Rptr. 776, 498 P.2d 1024].)  By analogy, any crime involving the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm should be deemed violent for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Both kidnapping for robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (b)) and simple kidnapping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207, subd. (a)) require force or fear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 517, fn. 13 [simple kidnapping]; see People v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1126 [definition of kidnapping for robbery incorporates elements of simple kidnapping].) Thus, both kidnapping for robbery and simple kidnapping have been held to be violent crimes for purposes of the multiple victim exception. <em>(In re Ford </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 183, 184 [57 Cal.Rptr. 129, 424 P.2d 681] [kidnapping for robbery]; <em>In re Wright, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 656 [kidnapping for robbery]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guevara </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 86, 90 [151 Cal.Rptr. 511] [simple kidnapping].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Kidnapping for ransom, however, can be committed by \u201cseiz[ing], confining], inveigling], entic[ing], decoy[ing], abduct[ing], [or] concealing]\u201d the victim. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a).) Thus, it would seem it can be committed without force or fear. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 621 [205 Cal.Rptr. 775, 685 P.2d 1126] [dictum].) But even assuming, without deciding, kidnapping for ransom is not a violent crime in itself, here the jury also found that, in the commission of the kidnapping, defendant personally used a firearm. Hence, the kidnapping, too, was a violent crime for purposes of the multiple victim exception. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Glaude </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 633, 644 [190 Cal.Rptr. 479] [defendant found guilty of murder, plus simple kidnapping involving personal firearm use; \u201cThe kidnaping ... at gunpoint was an act of violence involving a different victim, thus precluding the application of Penal Code section 654.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Defendant argues, however, there was no named victim of the burglary. He cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 873. There, the information expressly alleged the defendant robbed John Keating. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 879.) It also alleged the defendant committed a burglary in the course of which he inflicted great bodily injury on Charles Burk. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 882.) In holding that the multiple victim exception applied, the Supreme Court explained: \u201c[T]he victim of the robbery as <em>alleged, proved and found to be true </em>was John Keating who was accosted and threatened at gunpoint. . . . [T]he burglary <em>alleged, proved and found to be true </em>is a crime of violence committed against Burk. Defendant being convicted of a second crime of violence against a second victim, [Penal Code] section 654 does not preclude the imposition of punishment for both the robbery and the burglary convictions.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 886, italics added, fn. omitted; see also <em>In re Ford, supra, 66 </em>Cal.2d at pp. 183-184 [\u201cPetitioner was properly sentenced on both the kidnaping count and the robbery count because the People alleged and proved and the jury found that he kidnaped victims A, B, and C for the purpose of robbery (count I) as well as robbing C (count II).\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Here, by contrast, the information did not allege, and the jury did not find, that any particular person was the victim of either the burglary or the related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>personal firearm use enhancement. Defendant concludes the multiple victim exception cannot apply. We think this reads too much into <em>Miller. </em>Certainly under <em>Miller, </em>if it has been alleged, proved, and found true that the defendant committed violent crimes against multiple named victims, this is sufficient to invoke the multiple victim exception; but <em>Miller </em>does not hold this is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We know of no case in which the court declined to apply the multiple victim exception simply because the victims had not been named in the information. Ordinarily, in determining whether Penal Code section 654 applies, the trial court is entitled to make any necessary factual findings not already made by the jury. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 730-731 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640], cert. den. (1997) 519 U.S. 1061 [117 S.Ct. 696, 136 L.Ed.2d 618].) Moreover, a number of cases have upheld the application of the multiple victim exception based on evidence of multiple victims, without considering whether the identities of those victims had been pleaded. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 427 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 148], the defendant fired four shots toward a security guard who was standing inside a doorway. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 431.) He was convicted of assault with a firearm, and discharging a firearm at an occupied building. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 430.) The appellate court held the multiple victim exception applied. It noted evidence that the guard had tried to move \u201c \u2018children and other people\u2019 \u201d who were standing near the door away. It concluded the guard was the only victim of the assault, but there were other victims of the discharge of a firearm at an occupied building. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 434-435; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 431.) It seems unlikely that the \u201cchildren and other people\u201d had been alleged as additional victims. In any event, the court discussed only the evidence; it did not find it necessary to discuss the allegations or the findings. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1729, 1736-1737 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 464] [multiple victim exception allows multiple punishment for discharging firearm at an occupied vehicle and for attempted murder of one of the passengers; evidence at preliminary hearing gave defendant notice of multiple victims].) Here, the trial court could properly find multiple victims even though the information did not specify, and the jury did not make any finding regarding, the identity of any victim of the burglary or the personal firearm use.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s implied finding of multiple victims is supported by substantial evidence. Indeed, defendant does not argue otherwise. Raines was indubitably the victim of the kidnapping. Grundman was the victim (or at least a victim) of the burglary, because she lived in the home. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 712, 720-722 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 958 P.2d 1083], and cases cited [burglary statute protects occupant\u2019s possessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>interest in building].) Grundman also was a victim of defendant\u2019s menacing display of a firearm during the burglary. It could be argued that Raines, too, was a victim of the burglary and the personal firearm use. Nevertheless, there was at least one victim of the burglary and the personal firearm use who was not also a victim of the kidnapping. This was sufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 886, fn. 11; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1784-1785; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 681; <em>People </em>v. <em>Masters </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1124, 1128 [241 Cal.Rptr. 511].)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We conclude the trial court did not err by imposing separate and unstayed sentences for the kidnapping and the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Ramirez, P.

It could be argued a substantial risk of danger during the original abduction, before Raines was fully \u201cconfined\u201d in defendant\u2019s car, would fail to satisfy the statute. But even if so, defendant\u2019s conduct during this earlier period is some evidence of a substantial risk of danger at a later period. For example, defendant stopped Rick from interfering by pointing the gun at him and threatening to shoot him. This is additional evidence that, when defendant pointed the gun at Raines and threatened to shoot Raines, Raines was exposed to a substantial likelihood of death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 84.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
