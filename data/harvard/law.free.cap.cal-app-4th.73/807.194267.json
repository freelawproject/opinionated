J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARyn\">A jury convicted defendant Regino Custodio of possessing a sharp instrument while confined in a penal institution (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4502, subd. (a); further section references are to this code) and found that he had a prior serious felony conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law (\u00a7 667, subds. (d) &amp; (e)) and had served two prior separate prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). He was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In the published part of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that section 4502, subdivision (a) is unconstitutionally vague. As we shall explain, viewing the statute according to the fair import of its terms and its purpose, a person of ordinary intelligence would know what it does and does not prohibit. Considering the nature of the item found in defendant\u2019s cell (including its tapered shape and the length and firmness of its sharp metal point) and the fact it.is not a necessary possession for an inmate, the person would know it is a sharp instrument which falls within the prohibition of section 4502, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we find merit in only one of defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. The People concede, and we agree, the trial court erred in failing to award defendant presentence credits. Hence, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>shall modify the judgment to award the appropriate credits, and affirm as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">During a search of defendant\u2019s cell, a correctional officer found a plastic barrel of a ballpoint pen with a piece of metal like a sewing machine needle sticking out of it. An expert opined that the object was \u201cvery capable of being used as a weapon\u201d because the metal was extremely stiff, had been affixed by melting the plastic of the pen barrel, and the entire object had a tapered shape so that \u201conce it starts, there is nothing going to stop it from going as hard as one . . . push[es] it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Both the correctional officer and the expert testified about \u201ccup picks,\u201d which generally are used by inmates to decorate plastic items. According to the expert, a cup pick \u201cusually[]has a small, a pointed point that has a blunt backing on it. Might stick out an 8th to a quarter inch\u201d and ordinarily is used by inmates to decorate plastic items.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The expert never had seen a cup pick as \u201cfirm\u201d as the item seized from defendant\u2019s cell, and agreed that \u201c[tjypically cup picks have softer or less firm tips\u201d than the item in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Defendant testified that he used the item, for \u201cartistic talents\u201d to engrave his cup and sunglasses. He did not believe it was a weapon or sharp instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Section 4502, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who, while at or confined in any penal institution . . . possesses or carries upon his or her person or has under his or her custody or control any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slung-shot, billy, sandclub, sandbag, or metal knuckles, any explosive substance, or fixed ammunition, any dirk or dagger or sharp instrument, any pistol, revolver, or other firearm, or any tear gas or tear gas weapon, is guilty of a felony</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Defendant claims the term \u201csharp instrument\u201d in this section violates due process of law because it is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>\u201cDue process requires that criminal statutes be reasonably definite. ... In order for a criminal statute to satisfy the dictates of due process in this regard, it must meet two requirements. \u2018First, the provision must be definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed. . . . Because we assume that individuals are free to choose between lawful and unlawful conduct, \u201cwe insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he [or she] may act accordingly. Vague laws trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.\u201d . . . ftQ Second, the statute must provide definite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bamba </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1120 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 450], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Facial attacks on section 4502 based upon claims that it is unconstitutionally vague have been rejected over the past 50 years. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Steeley </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 591, 596-597 [72 Cal.Rptr. 368]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 537, 539-541 [60 Cal.Rptr. 671]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crenshaw </em>(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 26, 27-28 [167 P.2d 781].)  \u201cUnless a statute facially tenders a present total conflict with constitutional provisions, any overbreadth in a statute is ordinarily cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which the statute is applied.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Siller </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 36, 49 [231 Cal.Rptr. 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">While a statute imposing criminal liability \u201cmay be declared invalid in [its] entirety if piecemeal adjudication of the legality of the statute would entail the vague or uncertain future application of the statute\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Siller, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 49), we see no such danger with respect to section 4502, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Defendant\u2019s complaint is that the term \u201csharp instrument\u201d is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it \u201cfails to give adequate guidance to law enforcement as to the standards for enforcement.\u201d For example, he points out that officers apparently ignore an inmate\u2019s possession of a sharpened pencil even though it is a \u201csharp instrument\u201d capable of being used as a weapon. Thus, he complains, the absence of a statutory definition for sharp instrument \u201cplaces almost unfettered discretion in the hands of law enforcement,\u201d \u201cpermits and encourages an arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law,\u201d and leaves an inmate to speculate whether a particular sharp object violates the statute. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">\u201cIn analyzing whether a statute is sufficiently definite to pass constitutional muster, we look not only at the language of the statute but also to legislative history and California decisions construing the statute.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Bomba, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 1120.)  By prohibiting prison inmates from possessing any instrument or weapon of the kind specified in the statute, section 4502, subdivision (a) is intended to protect inmates and correctional staff \u201cfrom the peril of assaults with dangerous weapons perpetrated by armed prisoners.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 476, 481 [156 P.2d 979].) It applies to instruments that can be used to inflict injury and that are not necessary for an inmate to have in the inmate\u2019s possession. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morales, supra, </em>252 Cal.App.2d at p. 541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Thus, viewing the statute \u201caccording to the fair import of [its] terms, with a view to effect its objects and to promote justice\u201d (\u00a7 4), a person of ordinary intelligence would know what is and what is not prohibited by the statute. For example, the person would understand that section 4502, subdivision (a) does not apply to a sharpened pencil \u2014 which ordinarily is used for a legitimate and necessary purpose \u2014 unless the inmate uses the pencil as a weapon. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614, 620-621 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100].) Accordingly, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Nor is the statute vague as applied in this case. Asserting that a \u201ccup pick\u201d is a device made by an inmate for the ordinary purpose of using it to engrave designs on plastic items, such as cups, and suggesting that the \u201ccup pick\u201d found in his possession \u201cwas no more dangerous than is a pen or pencil,\u201d defendant argues (1) he was required to speculate whether it was prohibited by section 4502, subdivision (a), and (2) he was prosecuted \u201cpurely on the whim of a prison guard who chose to deal with this situation as a felony criminal offense rather than simply as an administrative matter, as apparently are the other \u2018cup pick\u2019 cases.\u201d Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Evidence established that the sharp instrument seized from defendant\u2019s cell was capable of being used to inflict injury as a stabbing device, and that the instrument was not necessary for defendant to have in his possession. This is not a situation where a device used for artistic purposes was possessed in a prison craft room. In fact, defendant concedes that all \u201ccup picks\u201d found in prison cells are confiscated by the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Therefore, defendant reasonably should have known he could not lawfully possess the sharp instrument in his cell. There is no evidence to support his suggestion that the possession of a \u201ccup pick\u201d by an inmate does not ordinarily lead to prosecution pursuant to section 4502, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Considering the nature of the item found in defendant\u2019s cell (including its tapered shape and the length and firmness of its sharp metal point) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>fact it is not a necessary possession for an inmate, a person of ordinary intelligence would know it is a sharp instrument which falls within the prohibition of section 4502, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The judgment is modified to give defendant credit for 55 days of actual custody and 26 days for good conduct, a total of 81 days of presentence credit. As modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect the modification, and to send a copy of the amended abstract to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Sims, J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 807.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
