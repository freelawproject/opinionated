He claims he received ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>assistance of counsel in that his attorney failed to defend against the charge on the ground appellant had not been constitutionally convicted of a prior registrable offense. This contention is further addressed in a related petition for writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, appellant additionally urges that the use of his prior rape conviction both as an element of the substantive registration offense and as a \u201cstrike\u201d to enhance his sentence was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Appellant was charged by information filed on January 13,1997, with one count of failing to register as a sex offender between September 1 and November 21, 1996. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 290, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was alleged that appellant had previously been convicted of rape (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(2)) on May 23, 1984. It was further alleged that appellant was presumptively ineligible for probation under section 1203, subdivision (e)(4), and that his sentence was subject to enhancement under section 667.5, due to four prior felony convictions and prison terms: the 1984 rape conviction; an October 17,1980, conviction for first degree burglary (\u00a7 459); a September 13, 1989, conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021); and a February 11, 1991, conviction for petty theft after serving a term for another theft (\u00a7 666). Two of these priors were alleged as \u201cstrikes\u201d under section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2): the 1980 burglary and the 1984 rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">On January 15, 1997, appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the priors. Appellant\u2019s motions to dismiss for improper venue and under section 995 were denied on April 10, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">On April 21, 1997, appellant waived trial by jury and a court trial began. On motion of the prosecution, the court dismissed the first alleged \u201cstrike\u201d prior, the burglary. On April 24, the court found appellant guilty of violating section 290, subdivision (a)(1), and found true all of the allegations regarding priors (except the one dismissed). On June 16, appellant\u2019s motion to strike the remaining \u201cstrike\u201d prior was denied. On the same date, appellant was sentenced to a total prison term of six years and eight months, consisting of the lower term of sixteen months for the section 290 conviction, doubled under section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1), plus one-year terms for each of the four priors under section 667.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on June 27, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">On May 23, 1984, appellant entered a plea of nola contendere to the charge of rape in violation of section 261, subdivision (a)(2). The declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>appellant signed at the time indicated he had been informed the maximum penalty that could be imposed as a result of his plea was \u201cnine years and four years parole\u201d and did not say anything about the requirement to register as a sex offender. At the hearing, after the court had accepted appellant\u2019s plea of no contest to the rape charge, the district attorney asked to have the record reflect that appellant was \u201csubject to having to register as a sex offender based on this conviction,\u201d noting that the plea form did not contain this information but that defense counsel had discussed the issue with appellant. Defense counsel acknowledged that appellant understood this. The court asked appellant if he understood he would \u201chave to register as a sex offender to the police department due to [his] conviction in this case if [he was] convicted.\u201d Appellant answered in the affirmative and indicated he still wished to plead no contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In the present case, appellant was found guilty of failing to register as a sex offender in violation of section 290 between September 1 and November 21, 1996. The facts underlying his failure to register are not relevant to the issues on appeal or on the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">I.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">fl.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Appellant additionally contends the trial court impermissibly used his prior rape conviction both as an element of the section 290 violation and as a \u201cstrike\u201d which augmented his sentence under section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1). He claims this dual use offended the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 796 [135 Cal.Rptr. 411, 557 P.2d 995] <em>(Edwards) </em>and <em>In re Shull </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 745 [146 P.2d 417] <em>(Shull).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">In <em>Shull, </em>the defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to the prison term provided by statute for that offense. He was further sentenced to an additional term provided by statute for individuals who possessed certain weapons during the commission of the offenses of which they were convicted. <em>Shull </em>held this dual use of the weapon possession as an element of the substantive offense and as the basis of an enhancement of punishment was impermissible. Reasoning that the statute defining the term for assault with a deadly weapon was a specific one while the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>establishing the enhancement applied generally to felonies, the <em>Shull </em>court employed the principle that a special statute controls over a general statute to conclude the Legislature had fixed the penalty for the offense of assault with a deadly weapon and did not intend additional punishment to be imposed in the absence of any additional factor. (23 Cal.2d at pp. 750-751.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In <em>Edwards, </em>the court followed this rule in holding that a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm could not be subjected to a greater minimum term of punishment than would normally be prescribed for the offense under a statute establishing increased minimum terms for defendants previously convicted of felonies. Such dual use of the prior convictions, <em>Edwards </em>explained, \u201cruns afoul of the established rule that when a prior conviction constitutes an element of criminal conduct which otherwise would be noncriminal, the minimum sentence may not be increased because of the indispensable prior conviction.\u201d (18 Cal.3d at p. 800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In the present case, appellant argues that section 290, subdivision (g)(2), is a special statute, defining as a felony the offense of willfully failing to register where the registration requirement is based on a felony offense. Characterizing section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1), as a statute of general application, appellant maintains <em>Edwards </em>and related case law preclude application of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law based on the same prior conviction underlying the section 290 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Several cases have rejected the argument that a single prior conviction may not be used both to establish an element of the charged offense and to constitute a \u201cstrike.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yarborough </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1417, 1419-1421 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 402]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nobleton </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 76, 80-84 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 611]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sipe </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 468, 484-489 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 266] <em>(Sipe).) </em>In <em>Sipe, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony escape (\u00a7 4532, subd. (b)) after leaving the honor farm where he was serving time after a conviction for residential burglary. Among other arguments on appeal, he relied on <em>Edwards </em>to urge that the same prior conviction could not be used both to convict him of the substantive offense and to increase his sentence under the Three Strikes law. <em>Sipe </em>found <em>Edwards </em>inapplicable because section 667, subdivision (e) \u2014 the analogous provision in the initiative version of the Three Strikes law to section 1170.12, subdivision (c) \u2014 is not an enhancement but rather \u201can alternate sentencing scheme.\u201d <em>(Sipe, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 485, 488.) It further rejected application of the <em>Edwards </em>rule because it viewed <em>Edwards, </em>which predated the adoption of the determinate sentencing law, as having been invalidated by the adoption of determinate sentencing. (36 Cal.App.4th at p. 488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Nobleton, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th 76, the People challenged the trial court\u2019s refusal to use the prior conviction upon which the offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>possession of a firearm by a felon was based to impose an enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b); the defendant argued the single prior could not be used both to prove the substantive offense and to bar probation under the Three Strikes law. Like <em>Sipe, Nobleton </em>found <em>Edwards </em>inapplicable because \u201c. . . section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) are not enhancements, but establish a separate sentencing scheme for recidivists\u201d and because it viewed <em>Edwards </em>as having been superceded by statute. (38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 82-83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">With regard to <em>Edwards\u2019s </em>viability, <em>Sipe </em>and <em>Nobleton </em>relied upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Bruno </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1102, 1106-1107 [237 Cal.Rptr. 31]. <em>Bruno </em>was the first of a number of Court of Appeal cases to conclude the <em>Edwards </em>rule did not survive the adoption of determinate sentencing. This conclusion was based on the fact that section 1170, as originally enacted, included a sentence subsequently dropped by amendment before the operative date of the statute. The sentence, which <em>Bruno </em>viewed as codifying <em>Edwards, </em>provided: \u2018In no event shall any fact be used twice to determine, aggravate, or enhance a sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra, 191 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 1106; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price (1992) </em>4 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1277-1278 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 263]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vega </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 506, 512 [273 Cal.Rptr. 684], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>McClanahan </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 860, 872, fn. 6 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 719, 838 P.2d 241]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Levell </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 749, 752-753 [247 Cal.Rptr. 489].) These cases thus took the view that the Legislature had \u201celiminated the <em>Edwards </em>rule by first codifying it and then deleting the codification.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Darwin </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1101, 1103 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 894].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Darwin, supra, 12 </em>Cal.App.4th at pages 1103-1104, disagreed with the reasoning of these cases. \u201cThe original version of Penal Code section 1170 did <em>not </em>codify the <em>Edwards </em>rule. The holding in <em>Edwards </em>was that if a prior conviction is an \u2018element\u2019 of an offense, the prior may not be used for sentence enhancement. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>.18 Cal.3d at p. 800.) The later-deleted sentence in the original version of section 1170 did not address the dual use of a prior as an element of an offense and for sentence enhancement, but merely addressed sentencing, stating that a fact could not be used twice to \u2018determine, aggravate, or enhance a sentence.\u2019 These two points are not the same. Thus, the legislative action did not abrogate the <em>Edwards </em>rule.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The California Supreme Court addressed the disagreement about the viability of <em>Edwards </em>without resolving it in <em>People </em>v. <em>Baird </em>(1995) 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Cal.4th 126, 131 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 65, 906 P.2d 1220]. The question in <em>Baird </em>was whether the prison term resulting from a prior felony conviction used to establish the felon element of a charge under section 12021 could be used to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence under section 667.5, subdivision (b). After noting the disagreement between the courts of appeal regarding <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court concluded <em>Edwards </em>was inapplicable because, in the <em>Baird </em>situation, a single <em>conviction </em>was not being used both to establish an element of the offense and to enhance the sentence. Rather, the <em>conviction </em>was used to establish the element of the offense while the <em>prison term </em>was the basis of the enhancement. The multiple use of the prior was not precluded by <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 857 P.2d 1163], which precluded imposition of cumulative sentence enhancements under section 667 and section 667.5, subdivision (b): Since it was not the case that \u201call or nearly all felony convictions used to establish the ex-felon element of a section 12021 violation [would] have resulted in the service of a prior prison term,\u201d allowing both uses of the prior would not mean the penalties prescribed for section 12021 violations would become a year longer by application of section 667.5, subdivision (b), \u201c \u2018in all but a very few cases.\u2019 \u201d (12 Cal.4th at p. 134, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 1142, 1150.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">While <em>Baird </em>did not expressly resolve the question of the continued viability of <em>Edwards, </em>it is interesting to note that it found <em>Edwards </em>inapplicable without finding the <em>Edwards </em>rule had been abrogated. In any event, in the absence of any clear indication the Supreme Court would find the <em>Edwards </em>rule no longer viable, we are free to agree with the reasoning of Division Five of this court in <em>Darwin, </em>which we find more persuasive than that of the cases that have found <em>Edwards </em>to have been legislatively overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The third case to find that a single prior conviction may be used both to establish an element of the charged offense and to constitute a \u201cstrike\u201d is precisely on point with the present case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yarborough, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1419-1421.) In <em>Yarborough, </em>the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for child molestation was used both as an element of the charged offense of failing to register as a sex offender under section 290 and as a \u201cstrike\u201d which served to double the defendant\u2019s sentence for the registration offense. <em>Yarborough </em>distinguished <em>Edwards </em>on a narrow reading of <em>Edwards's </em>holding. <em>Yarborough </em>described <em>Edwards </em>as having \u201cannounced the limited rule that when the underlying prior conviction constitutes an element <em>\u2018of criminal conduct which otherwise would be noncriminal,' </em>the sentence may not be enhanced because of the underlying conviction. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 800.)\u201d (65 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420, italics in <em>Yarborough.) </em>In <em>Edwards, </em>the possession of a firearm would not have constituted criminal conduct had it not been for the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of sale of marijuana. By contrast, <em>Yarborough </em>stated that in the section 290 situation, \u201cthe underlying felony offense is for an <em>omission </em>of required conduct by a convicted sex offender. It does not involve an <em>act </em>at all, let alone an act that is otherwise legal. Yarborough\u2019s failure to register as a sex offender in violation of section 290, former subdivision (g)(3) is inherently criminal, unlike the mere possession of a firearm.\u201d <em>(Yarborough, supra, </em>at p. 1420.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We cannot agree with Yarborough's reasoning. <em>Yarborough </em>is confusing in that it refers to the \u201cunderlying\u201d offense in <em>Edwards </em>as the prior conviction for sale of marijuana but refers to the \u201cunderlying\u201d offense in <em>Yarbor-ough </em>as the \u201comission of required conduct by a convicted sex offender.\u201d The \u201comission of required conduct\u201d related not to the underlying offense \u2014 there, child molestation \u2014 but to the current offense of failing to register. Nevertheless, <em>Yarborough's </em>point appears to be that the conduct (omission) made criminal by section 290 \u2014 the failure to register \u2014 is inherently a criminal act. The obligation to register, however, arises only upon conviction of an offense listed in section 290. Without the prior conviction of a registrable offense, the act (or omission) of failing to register cannot be viewed as criminal because there is no obligation to register. Just as a prior conviction for a felony offense makes otherwise lawful possession of a firearm unlawful, a prior conviction for a registrable offense makes lawful failure to register unlawful. To say the failure to register is inherently criminal is to presuppose the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Moreover, while <em>Edwards </em>stated its holding in the limited form quoted by <em>Yarborough, </em>the case law upon which it was based does not limit application of the rule to circumstances in which the conduct constituting the current offense would be <em>noncriminal </em>but for the prior conviction. In <em>Shull, supra, </em>23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Cal.2d 745, for example, the current offense was assault with a deadly weapon; <em>Shull </em>rejected application of a statute that would have added a term of punishment because of the defendant\u2019s possession of a weapon. The conduct underlying the current offense \u2014 assault\u2014would have been criminal regardless of the defendant\u2019s weapon use but was made more serious because of that use. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Floyd </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 879 [80 Cal.Rptr. 22, 457 P.2d 862], the convictions were for attempted robbery in ,the first degree and robbery in the first degree, with the degree determined by the fact the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon during commission of the crimes; <em>Floyd </em>rejected application of statutes increasing the minimum term or adding an additional term for defendants armed with weapons. The conduct underlying the current conviction \u2014 robbery\u2014would have been criminal even without the fact of arming, which served to increase the seriousness of the offense. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 772 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Satchell </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 28, 36-40 [98 Cal.Rptr. 33, 489 P.2d 1361, 50 A.L.R.3d 383], involved convictions for possession of a concealable weapon by a felon and assault with a deadly weapon, and refused to allow application of a statute increasing the minimum term for defendants armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the offense. As with <em>Shull, </em>the conduct underlying the assault conviction would have been criminal regardless of the weapon possession. The general point to be gleaned from these cases, taken together, is simply that a single fact may not be used both to constitute an element of the offense (whether or not the underlying conduct would have been criminal without that fact) and to increase the punishment for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><em>Yarborough </em>also indicated in a footnote that \u201c. . . the vitality of the <em>Edwards </em>rule in the context of the three strikes law is in doubt\u201d due to \u201cauthority that the three strikes law is not an enhancement law but a separate sentencing scheme for recidivists.\u201d (65 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420, fn. 4.) That the Three Strikes law does not provide for enhancements was also an alternate ground for the holdings of <em>Sipe </em>and <em>Nobleton. </em>\u201c \u2018The legislative determination, that under these circumstances the base term is doubled, does not constitute an enhancement. Instead, it is the articulation of a parallel sentencing scheme for specifically described recidivists. An enhancement is \u201can additional term of imprisonment added to the base term.\u201d (Rule 405(c).) A base term is \u201c. . . the determinate prison term prescribed by law. . . .\u201d (Rule 405(b).)\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nobleton, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 81, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 587, 595 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 474].) \u201c[A]n enhancement is . . . characterized by a\u2018focus on an element of the commission of the crime or the criminal history of the defendant which is not present for all such crimes and perpetrators and which justifies a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>higher penalty than that prescribed for the offenses themselves.\u2019 . . . It is distinguished from the term prescribed for the underlying crime itself. . . . F0 Section 667, subdivision (e)(1),[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] does not provide for any kind of \u2018added term.\u2019 Instead, it defines the term for the crime itself, supplanting the term that would apply but for the prior serious or violent felony.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 656, 667 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 776], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>DeLoza </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 585, 600, fn. 10 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 255, 957 P.2d 945], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 194, 207-208 [249 Cal.Rptr. 850, 757 P.2d 1013].)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">According to these authorities, the rule of <em>Edwards </em>is not violated by using the same prior conviction to establish an element of the offense , and to sentence to a double term under the Three Strikes law. Since the Three Strikes law establishes a parallel sentencing scheme for repeat offenders, the prior conviction is viewed as not being used to enhance the sentence that would otherwise be applicable but to trigger the application of a sentencing scheme imposing a different penalty for the current offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">This analysis glosses over the essential point of <em>Edwards, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 796, and the cases upon which it was based: that a single fact may not be used both as an element of the current offense and as the basis for imposition of more severe punishment than would otherwise be prescribed for the offense. <em>Edwards </em>itself was not dealing with a sentence enhancement as that term is defined in the cases discussed above \u2014 it was a predeterm\u00ednate sentencing case. In <em>Edwards, </em>section 12021, the statute defining the offense of possession of a weapon by a felon, prescribed a minimum term sentence; former section 3024, subdivision (c), which <em>Edwards </em>held could not be applied, provided for a greater minimum term sentence. Of the cases cited in <em>Edwards, Ford </em>also rejected application of a statute prescribing a greater minimum term than that otherwise provided for the offense; <em>Floyd </em>and <em>Shull </em>rejected application of statutes that would have added additional terms. While the latter would be viewed as enhancements under the definitions above, the statutes providing for greater minimum terms would not. <em>Sipe, </em>for example, concluded section 667, subdivision (e), was \u201can alternate sentencing scheme, not an enhancement\u201d because it \u201cdoes not add a term to defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d but rather \u201cprovides an alternate method to calculate either the determinate term or minimum term for an indeterminate sentence.\u201d <em>(Sipe, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">To state that the rule of <em>Edwards </em>does not apply to dual use of a prior conviction to prove an element of the offense and to constitute a \u201cstrike\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>because section 667, subdivision (e), or section 1170.12, subdivision (c), is not an enhancement takes <em>Edwards </em>completely out of the context of its facts and the law under which it was decided. As a case decided under indeterminate sentencing, <em>Edwards </em>was not concerned with \u201cenhancement\u201d as that term is now understood but simply with <em>increasing </em>punishment on the basis of the same fact used to convict a defendant. Application of former section 3024 in <em>Edwards </em>would have subjected the defendant to a greater minimum term sentence because of his prior conviction, just as is the case with application of the Three Strikes law. Technically, there may be a difference between adding a specified term to the otherwise prescribed punishment for an offense because of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction, as with an \u201cenhancement,\u201d and choosing to apply an alternative and harsher sentencing scheme because of that prior. Semantics aside, however, use of a single prior conviction as an element of a substantive offense and as a strike obviously increases the defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of that prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Thus far, our Supreme Court has not held that a single fact may be the basis both of an element of the charged offense and of a sentence enhancement. As discussed above, <em>People </em>v. <em>Baird, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 16, specifically avoided deciding the continued validity of <em>Edwards </em>by concluding the statute in question there, section 667.5, subdivision (b), required enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence because of a prior <em>prison </em>term, a separate fact from the prior <em>conviction </em>used as an element of the offense. This factual distinction cannot be made in the present case: Appellant could not have been convicted of the offense of failing to register without proof of his prior rape conviction, and he could not have been sentenced under the Three Strikes law without proof of the same conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Nevertheless, despite our disagreement with case law finding <em>Edwards </em>either no longer viable or inapplicable to the Three Strikes situation, it must be remembered that the rule applied in <em>Edwards </em>is one intended to effectuate legislative intent. <em>Edwards, </em>and the other cases it cited, derive from <em>Shull. Shull, </em>as discussed above, applied the principle that a specific statute controls over a general one, to conclude the Legislature did not intend the fact of deadly weapon use to increase the punishment specifically stated for the offense of assault with a deadly weapon as it would for an offense in which use of a deadly weapon was not an essential element. <em>(Shull, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d at p. 750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The intent behind the enactment of the Three Strikes law was clearly stated by the electorate. According to the statement of intent contained in the initiative measure by which section 1170.12 was adopted, \u201c \u2018It is the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u2019 \u201d (Prop. 184, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994) Preamble, reprinted at Historical and Statutory Notes, 50B West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code (1999 pocket supp.) foil. \u00a7 1170.2, p. 145.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, this section shall be applied in every case in which a defendant has a prior felony conviction as defined in this section.\u201d Construing the similar language of section 667, subdivision (f)(1), <em>Sipe, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th 468, concluded that \u201c[t]his absolute language permits only the interpretation that the Legislature intended more severe punishment for recidivist felons, regardless of whether a prior conviction is a component of their current felony.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 489.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, section 1170.12, subdivision (c), states that its provisions for calculating sentences shall apply \u201cin addition to any other enhancements or punishment provisions which may apply.\u201d These provisions demonstrate a broad intent to have the Three Strikes law apply to all recidivists coming within its terms. This intent would be frustrated by allowing the <em>Edwards </em>rule to limit the prior convictions that could be used to trigger application of the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Appellant levels a number of arguments against this conclusion. First, appellant argues that <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628] (Romero) rejected the broadest construction of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language in section 667, subdivision (f)(1), by refusing to read this language as overriding section 1385. (13 Cal.4th at pp. 523-524.) As <em>Romero </em>explained, however, because section 1385 is specifically included in section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(2), the Three Strikes law cannot be applied \u201cNotwithstanding any other law\u201d without reference to section 1385. (13 Cal.4 th at pp. 519-520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Appellant notes that <em>Romero </em>declined to interpret the Three Strikes law as eliminating courts\u2019 power under section 1385 \u201c \u2018absent a clear legislative direction to the contrary\u2019\u201d because \u201cthe statutory power to dismiss in furtherance of justice has always coexisted with statutes defining punishment and must be reconciled with the latter.\u201d <em>(Romero, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 518.) Since the <em>Edwards/Shull </em>rule has also been around for a long time, appellant urges we should not interpret the Three Strikes law to have eliminated the rule without a clear expression of such intent. To say that the Three Strikes law applies \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>however, is just such a clear expression. Just recently, the Supreme Court decided that a conviction for which sentence was stayed under section 654 may nevertheless be used as a \u201cstrike.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 24, 26 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 294, 954 P.2d 557].) Section 654, of course, has been around as long as section 1385. In reaching its conclusion, <em>Benson </em>discussed the language of section 1170.12, subdivision (b), that a \u201cstrike\u201d must be defined as provided in the Three Strikes law \u201c \u2018[notwithstanding any other provision of law.\u2019 \u201d (18 Cal.4th at p. 31, italics omitted.) We recognize that the case in <em>Benson </em>was even more clear, as section 1170.12, subdivision (b)(1)(B), expressly states that a \u201cstay of execution of sentence\u201d shall not \u201caffect the determination that a prior conviction is a prior felony for purposes of this section.\u201d We nevertheless find the language of section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), sufficiently clear to indicate an intent to override contrary principles such as the <em>Edwards </em>rule. In <em>Romero, </em>which declined a broad interpretation of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language, the Supreme Court noted that the need for clear direction before interpreting the Three Strikes law as overriding section 1385 was \u201cincreased in this instance by the grave constitutional questions that would follow from the recognition of a prosecutorial veto power.\u201d (13 Cal.4th at pp. 518-519.) The issue in the present case does not rise to this level.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellant also urges that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language refers only to the subdivision immediately following it, which deals with the prosecutor\u2019s obligation to plead and prove priors, and power to move to dismiss them. Section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), however, states: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, this <em>section </em>shall be applied . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Other language in section 1170.12 uses the terms \u201csubdivision\u201d and \u201cparagraph\u201d to refer to specific parts of the statute. Accordingly, the use of the term \u201csection\u201d must be viewed as referring to the entire section 1170.12. Appellant cites Justice Chin\u2019s dissent in <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pages 42-43, in which he states that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language of section 1170.12, subdivision (b), \u201cmerely refers to the definition of a qualifying conviction\u201d set forth in that subdivision. Appellant takes from this that the similar language in section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), refers only to that subdivision. Justice Chin\u2019s point in <em>Benson, </em>however, was not that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language was necessarily limited by the <em>subdivision </em>in which it appeared but that it was limited by the substance of the sentence: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law and for the purposes of this section, a prior conviction of a felony shall be defined as . . . .\u201d The language of section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), is of much broader application: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, this section shall be applied in every case in which a defendant has a prior felony conviction as defined in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Appellant quotes <em>Romero\u2019s </em>statement that \u201c[a] simpler reading of the language in question (\u2018 [notwithstanding any other law\u2019) that more likely describes its probable intent is this: The Three Strikes law, when applicable, takes the place of whatever law would otherwise determine defendant\u2019s sentence for the current offense. The language thus eliminates conflicts between alternative sentencing schemes.\u201d <em>(Romero, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 524.) This statement was made in reaction to the Attorney General\u2019s argument in that case that \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language in section 667 similar to that in section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), meant Three Strikes sentences must be imposed without a court\u2019s being able to exercise its power under section 1385. The rejection of this construction of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language in the context of section 1385 does not necessarily dictate the result in the present case, as suggested by the result in <em>Benson </em>discussed above. Appellant characterizes <em>Edwards </em>as a rule about deciding which law is applicable, the general or the specific. Given the express intent behind the Three Strikes law, however, the Legislature and electorate cannot be viewed as having intended its application to be limited whenever a specific statute defined a term for a particular offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Appellant argues a broad reading of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language would lead to absurd and unconstitutional results: For example, the language of section 1170.12 would mean this statute applied and not section 667, while the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language of section 667, subdivision (f)(1), would mean section 667 applied and not section 1170.12. Given the lack of substantive difference between the provisions of section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and section 1170.12, this argument is not difficult to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On rehearing, appellant additionally argues that the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any other law\u201d applies only to other <em>statutory </em>provisions and not to the <em>Edwards/Shull </em>rule, which appellant views as a \u201cprinciple of statutory construction which governs the relationship between laws.\u201d We do not view this characterization as accurate. The rule of <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Shull, </em>that a prior offense used to establish an element of an offense may not also be used to increase punishment for a conviction of the latter offense, is an <em>application </em>of the general rule that specific statutes control over general ones. It is the general rule that states a principle of statutory construction; <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Shull </em>rely upon that principle to state a rule applied in criminal sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d has expressly been interpreted in other contexts as referring to both statutory and deci-sional law. <em>(In re Marriage of Dover </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 675, 678, fn. 3 [93 Cal.Rptr. 384] [phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d in former Civil Code section 4001, authorizing Judicial Council to provide by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>rule for practice and procedure, made rules so promulgated \u201c \u2018sui generis\u2019 and controlling over both statutory and decisional law\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>DeLaCruz </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 955, 963 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 202] [language \u201cnotwithstanding other provisions of law\u201d in section 12403.7 is \u201cterm of art\u201d which \u201chas been read as an express legislative intent to have the specific statute control despite the existence of other law which might otherwise govern,\u201d citing Dover]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 68, 73-74 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 742] [\u201cnotwithstanding any other law\u201d language in section 667, subdivisions (c), (d) and (f)(1), is \u201cterm of art\u201d expressing \u201clegislative intent \u2018to have the specific statute control despite the existence of other law which might otherwise govern,\u2019 \u201d quoting DeLaCruz]; <em>State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 637, 639 and fn. 2 [60 Cal.Rptr. 653] [Gov. Code, \u00a7 955.2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The cases upon which appellant relies to restrict application of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language of section 1170.1, subdivision (d)(1), to other statutes, as opposed to decisional law, are not controlling. <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 246-247 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365] rejected an argument that the Three Strikes laws established exclusive sentencing schemes superceding the death penalty law, holding the Three Strikes laws are not exclusive, as each states it applies \u201c \u2018in <em>addition to </em>any other . . . punishment provisions which may apply\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e), 1170.12, subd. (c), italics [in <em>Alvarez]).\u201d </em>(Alvarez, at p. 247.) The Court did not mention the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language in sections 667, subdivision (f)(1) or 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1). It is obvious, however, that an interpretation of that language as precluding application of the death penalty law to a defendant who was a recidivist within the meaning of the Three Strikes laws would be completely contrary to the express legislative intent behind the Three Strikes laws, to ensure greater punishment of recidivists.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Alvarez) (1997) 14 Cal.4th 968 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 928 P.2d 1171] held that the Three Strikes law did not abrogate trial courts\u2019 discretion to declare a \u201cwobbler\u201d offense a misdemeanor. Appellant maintains that application of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language of section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), would preclude such exercise of discretion. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assumption, however, when a trial court exercises its discretion to declare a wobbler to be a misdemeanor, the Three Strikes law, including the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language, is simply not applicable. The Three Strikes law is triggered only if the defendant is convicted of a felony offense. (14 Cal.4th at p. 975.) As <em>Alvarez </em>explained, when a trial court declares a wobbler to be a misdemeanor, there simply is no felony conviction to trigger application of the Three Strikes law. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 975-976.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">In <em>California Housing Finance Agency </em>v. <em>E.R. Fairway Associates I </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1508, 1515-1516 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 591], the court explained: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>\u201cThe introductory phrase of [Health and Safety Code] section 51205(f), \u2018[notwithstanding any other provision of law,\u2019 qualifies the operative language of the section entitling the prevailing party to recover \u2018costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u2019 Thus \u2018any other provision of law\u2019 relating to costs, <em>to the extent contrary to or inconsistent with [.Health and Safety </em>Code] <em>section 51205 (f), </em>is subordinated to the latter provision.\u201d (Italics added.) Focussing on the italicized language, appellant urges that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language in section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), does not preclude application of the <em>Edwards/Shull </em>rule because the rule is not inconsistent with the ensuing provisions of section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), which concern dismissal of prior convictions and use of prior convictions in plea bargaining. As indicated above, however, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language of section 1170.12, subdivision (d)(1), does not apply only to that subdivision but to all of section 1170.12. The <em>Edwards/Shull </em>rule prohibiting dual use of prior convictions <em>is </em>inconsistent with the Three Strikes law as a whole, the express intent of which is to \u201censure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (Prop. 184, <em>supra, </em>Preamble, reprinted at 50B West\u2019s Ann.

For example, while the offenses of sodomy (\u00a7 286) and oral copulation (\u00a7 288a) are always registrable offenses under section 290, they would qualify as prior convictions under section 1170.12 only if committed \u201cby force, violence, duress, menace, threat of great bodily injury, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person.\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7, subd.

Many other offenses listed under section 290 (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7266, 266c, 266h, 266i, 266j, 267, 285, 288.2, 311.2, 311.3, 311.4, 311.10, 311.11, 314, 647.6) would not qualify as \u201cstrikes\u201d or would so qualify only if the defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury or used a firearm.
