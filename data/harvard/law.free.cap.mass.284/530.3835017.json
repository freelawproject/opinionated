Due notice of the rulings and decision at a later time made by the judge was given to the petitioner but it filed no writing concerning the same with the clerk. The final sentence of Rule 72 of the Superior Court (1932), which governs the case at bar, is in these words: \u201cExceptions to any other opinion, rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ing, direction or judgment made in the absence of counsel shall be taken by a writing filed with the clerk within three days after the receipt from the clerk of notice thereof.\u201d This rule is unequivocal and mandatory. Its effect is to do away with the possibility of misunderstandings likely to arise in the absence of explicit written statement. It renders of no legal value anticipatory verbal arrangements for exceptions to be taken when future adverse rulings not then announced may be made. There is nothing in <em>Leyland </em>v. <em>Pingree, </em>134 Mass. 367, <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>169 Mass. 516, or <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Newton Street Railway, </em>186 Mass. 113, which affords support to the petitioner\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
