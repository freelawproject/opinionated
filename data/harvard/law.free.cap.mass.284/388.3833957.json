Hearing was granted to the employee on March 31, 1930, upon his claim that he was suffering further disability. The single member found that he had sufficiently recovered so that he was no longer incapacitated for work and was therefore not entitled to compensation. On recommittal another hearing was had ending in November, 1930, when the single member reported that the employee was not incapacitated from the effects of his injury. On review by the Industrial Accident Board in January, 1931, the employee\u2019s motion that his case be recommitted again to the single member was denied, and the finding that the employee was not incapacitated for work as the result of his injury was affirmed and compensation was denied. Final decree was entered in the Superior Court denying the employee\u2019s motion for an additional hearing, affirming the finding that he was not incapacitated for work as the result of his injury and denying his claim for compensation. The employee\u2019s appeal brings the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Whether the employee was suffering incapacity at these subsequent dates was a pure question of fact. He was a witness before the single member. There was medical testimony. It is not necessary to narrate the evidence. How much of it was entitled to credence was for the determination of the single member and the board on review. The case at bar is governed in every particular by <em>De Pietro\u2019s Case, ante, </em>381, and the decisions there collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\"><em>Decree </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
