This is a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the workmen\u2019s compensation act, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 497. <em>Fabrizio\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 352. <em>Langford\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 461. The conduct of the employee in keeping at work as long as he could was not such a voluntary exposure to danger not contemplated by the contract of employment as to carry his injury outside \u201cthe course of his employment,\u201d under the rule laid down in <em>Eifler\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 1, and <em>Roberts\u2019s Case, ante, </em>316.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The important question is, which of two successive insurers is liable? Claim was made against each. The Standard Accident Insurance Company ceased to be the insurer on January 10, 1932, and the Service Mutual Liability Insurance Co. became the insurer on January 15, 1932. The board found that the employee became totally incapacitated for work on February 11, 1932, and that \u201cthe accumulation of dust in the employee\u2019s lungs absorbed during the period from January 15, 1932, to February 11, 1932, was sufficient to [cause] and did cause the final breakdown on the latter date, during the coverage by the Service Mutual Liability Insurance Co.\u201d Although the employee ceased to work on February 11, 1932, because he was laid off, the board could find that on that day he had reached the end of his capacity for work. From a decree against the Service Mutual Liability Insurance Co., it appealed. The claim against the other insurance company was dismissed by the Industrial Accident Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">An insurer under the workmen\u2019s compensation act must take an employee as he m.ay happen to be during the term of the policy. It is immaterial that the employee is unusually susceptible to personal injury, or to serious consequences in the event of personal injury, or that personal injury is impending because of the cumulative effect of years of exposure to the hazards of the trade. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 494, 497. <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 288. <em>Cusick\u2019s Case, </em>260 Mass. 421. <em>Fabrizio\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 352, 354. <em>Colantueno\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 1. <em>Panagotopulos\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 600, 606, 607. <em>Langford\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 461, 463. The insurer is responsible for any compensable personal injury occurring within the period covered by its policy. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26. When the injury results from an accident which happens at a single moment, the time of occurrence of the injury is seldom in doubt. <em>Carroll\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 203, 207. Compare <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 31, 37, 38. In a case like the present, more difficulty may arise. Generally speaking, compensation is allowed only for impairment of earning capacity. <em>Federico\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 430. In cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>personal injury through the gradual accumulation in the body of harmful foreign matter, it has been held that a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d occurs when the accumulation becomes so great as to cause incapacity for work, and not before. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 388, 391. <em>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 164. <em>Bergeron\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 366. <em>Fabrizio\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 352. <em>Langford\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 461. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 481, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">An expert physician testified that \u201cit would be perfectly possible\u201d for the amount of dust inhaled between January 15, 1932, and February 11, 1932, to \u201cupset his [the employee\u2019s] equilibrium,\u201d which may be interpreted as meaning to make definite his incapacity for work. Another testified that the dust inhaled during that period \u201cwould be detrimental\u201d with \u201cthe load he was already carrying in his lungs.\u201d This opinion was expressed in answer to a hypothetical question assuming a medical history which could be found true upon the testimony of other witnesses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 72, <em>et seq. </em>The Service Mutual Liability Insurance Co. contends, however, that this testimony is not enough to support the finding for the employee. It is true that where the evidence shows no greater likelihood that facts which must be proved really existed, than that such facts did not exist, the necessary preponderance of evidence in favor of the existence of such facts is lacking, and the party having the burden of proof fails. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 528. <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>244 Mass. 57, 60. <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>255 Mass. 297, 301, <em>et seq. Traverse </em>v. <em>Wing, </em>260 Mass. 527. <em>Atlas </em>v. <em>Silsbury-Gamble Motors Co. </em>278 Mass. 279, 282, 283. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Benz Kid Co. </em>279 Mass. 533, 537. <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Economy Grocery Stores Corp. </em>282 Mass. 548. See also <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Fleischman Co. </em>262 Mass. 437. Where the relation of cause and effect between two facts has to be proved, the testimony of an expert that such relation exists <em>(Cooper\u2019s Case, </em>271 Mass. 38), or probably exists <em>(Marlow </em>v. <em>Dike, </em>269 Mass. 38, 40; <em>Rash </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>271 Mass. 247, 252; <em>Blanchard\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 413, 415), has been held enough. But the testimony of an expert that such relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>is possible, conceivable or reasonable, without more, leaves the issue trembling in the balance. <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>New England Fuel &amp; Transportation Co. </em>251 Mass. 389. <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>257 Mass. 525. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Weene, </em>258 Mass. 178. <em>Falco\u2019s Case, </em>260 Mass. 74. <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 355. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 365, 369. Slight additional circumstances, however, may tip the scale. Expert testimony that an accident would be an adequate cause of subsequent disease has been held \u201csufficient, taken in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that his health was good before the accident.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>185 Mass. 602, 606. See also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>197 Mass. 512, 515; <em>Carmossino\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 35; <em>Littlefield\u2019s Case, </em>281 Mass. 434; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>240 Mass. 461, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In the present case, the employee was found to be incapacitated for work on February 11, 1932. The amount of dust inhaled during the four weeks immediately preceding was, in the opinion of experts, sufficient to be \u201cdetrimental,\u201d and a \u201cperfectly possible\u201d cause of his incapacity. Since the condition from which he was suffering was' cumulative, the dust inhaled during the last period of labor before incapacity became manifest was most likely to be decisive. We think that the finding of the board, in effect that it was the last straw which broke down the employee\u2019s capacity for work, cannot be pronounced unsupported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
