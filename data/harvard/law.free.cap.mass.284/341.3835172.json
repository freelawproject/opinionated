Damages were assessed by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">At the conclusion of the evidence the defendant made nine requests for rulings, all of which were granted except the second, third, fourth and ninth. The second and ninth were as follows: 2. Upon the law and all the evidence there is no evidence that the defendant was a bailee for hire. 9. Upon the law and all the evidence there is no evidence of negligence of the defendant. These requests were denied on the ground stated by the judge that he found to the contrary. The third and fourth requests were as follows: 3. The obligations of the defendant with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s car were not greater than the terms of the invitation extended by the defendant to the plaintiff. 4. Upon the law and all the evidence the invitation extended by the defendant to the plaintiff did not go beyond permission to come upon the land and to leave a car in the space as it stood. These requests were refused on the ground that they were inapplicable in view of the finding of the judge. The judge specifically found \u201cthat the defendant was a bailee for hire; that he was negligent in failing to prevent the removal of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile from his parking space by a stranger; and that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care.\u201d These findings were followed by the recital \u201cwhich findings of fact were supported by the evidence presented at the trial.\u201d The judge found for the plaintiff. The defendant claimed a report to the Appellate Division which found that there was no prejudicial error and ordered the report dismissed. From that order the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The facts found by the trial judge, that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>parked his automobile on the defendant\u2019s lot and paid him twenty-five cents, the usual amount charged by the defendant for such parking, constituted the defendant a bailee for hire as he thereby took the automobile into his care and custody for a compensation. The nature or amount of the compensation received was immaterial as the law will not undertake to determine the adequacy of the consideration. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>10 Gray, 366. The defendant, having become a bailee for hire, was bound in the circumstances disclosed to exercise due care in order to return the automobile to the owner in as good condition as when received. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Maykel Automobile Co. </em>234 Mass. 198. <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>244 Mass. 57. <em>Guttentag </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>245 Mass. 212. The decisions in <em>Ex parte Mobile Light &amp; Railroad Co. </em>211 Ala. 525, <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Oklahoma State Fair Association, </em>95 Okla. 294, and <em>Suits </em>v. <em>Electric Park Amusement Co. </em>213 Mo. App. 275, rest upon different facts from those appearing in the present case. It follows that the defendant\u2019s second request was rightly denied. The third and fourth requests being inapplicable to the facts found could not properly have been given. It remains to consider the defendant\u2019s ninth request, that there is no evidence of negligence of the defendant. The finding that five minutes after the plaintiff parked his automobile the defendant saw a stranger drive it over the curbing, which was five or six inches high, to the street, instead of leaving by either of the two driveways, and made no attempt to stop him, well warranted a finding of negligence. It follows that the defendant\u2019s ninth request could not properly have been granted. It could have been found that the theft of the automobile was the natural result of the negligence of the defendant. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Stewart-Warrier Speedometer Corp. </em>223 Mass. 44, 46. The cases of <em>Fielding </em>v. <em>S. Z. Poli Realty Co. </em>274 Mass. 20, <em>Teall </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>275 Mass. 448, and other cases cited by the defendant are not applicable to the facts found in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
