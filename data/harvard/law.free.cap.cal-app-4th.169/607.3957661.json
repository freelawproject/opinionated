The jury trial took place during October 2006. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">In 1982, Scott Emerson Felix was convicted of three counts of false imprisonment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 236) against three separate victims, two counts of oral copulation and one count of rape against two additional victims, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>one count of assault with the intent to commit rape against a sixth victim. The crimes were committed in April, October, and September 1982. In each case, Felix approached strangers on the street or in other public places, used threats or force against them, and attempted to or succeeded in forcing them to perform sexual acts on him. For these crimes, Felix was sentenced to 19 years four months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Felix was released on parole sometime before 1993. He had numerous parole violations between October 1993 and December 1995. In May 1994, his parole was revoked for six months. He had been charged with several crimes, including assault and battery, possession of a dangerous weapon, possession of stolen property, and threats or harassment. In March 1995, Felix\u2019s parole was revoked for one month, based on a curfew violation, dishonesty, and noncooperation. In August 1995, Felix was arrested for stalking, but his parole was continued. In March 1996, Felix\u2019s parole was revoked for nine months for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">While Felix was in custody for the March 1996 parole revocation, the People filed a petition to commit him as a sexually violent predator (SVP) pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Felix was found to be an SVP, was committed to a two-year term, and, pursuant to subsequent petitions to extend his commitment, was ultimately committed through July 22, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The People filed a petition to extend Felix\u2019s commitment from July 22, 2002, to July 22, 2004 (2002 petition). A trial still needed to be held on that petition when July 22, 2004, was approaching, so the People filed a second petition to extend Felix\u2019s commitment from July 22, 2004, to July 22, 2006 (2004 petition). The 2002 and 2004 petitions were consolidated in 2004. A trial had still not been held on the consolidated petitions as the expiration date of July 22, 2006, was approaching, so the People filed a third petition to extend Felix\u2019s commitment from July 22, 2006, to July 22, 2008 (2006 petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">As of July 2006, the consolidated 2002 and 2004 petitions had been assigned to Judge Mary Morgan for trial. When the 2006 petition was filed, Felix challenged Judge Morgan pursuant to Penal Code section 170.6, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>2006 petition alone was assigned to Judge James J. McBride. A probable cause hearing was held on the third petition and probable cause was found to exist. The 2006 petition was eventually scheduled to go to trial October 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On August 1, 2006, Felix filed a motion to dismiss the 2006 petition on the ground of \u201cjudicial estoppel.\u201d He argued the People were estopped from bringing the petition by virtue of a consent decree California entered into in <em>United States v. California </em>(C.D.Cal., 2006, No. CV-06-2667-GPS) (Mayberg). Felix argued that the 2006 petition, which was based on a primary diagnosis of \u201cparaphilia not otherwise specified,\u201d conflicted with a term of the consent decree. He argued the consent decree was binding on the People in the instant action under the doctrine of judicial estoppel. The relevant section of the consent decree required the State Department of Mental Health (DMH) to ensure that clinically justified diagnoses be provided for each individual under its care and particularly that any \u201cnot otherwise specified\u201d diagnoses be \u201ctimely addressed (i.e. within 60 days), through clinically appropriate assessments, and resolved in a clinically justifiable manner.\u201d Felix argued, \u201cThe state seeks to continue detaining Felix on the basis of a diagnostic theory which the state previously repudiated via a voluntary agreement before a Federal Judge. . . . The state must either refine its diagnosis <em>now, </em>or dismiss the instant petition.\u201d The People opposed the motion, arguing paraphilia not otherwise specified is an appropriate diagnosis under SVPA and that nothing in the consent decree bars the state from seeking SVPA commitment of an individual with that diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">On August 8, 2006, Felix filed a second motion to dismiss the 2006 petition, which argued that the court\u2019s probable cause finding was unsubstantiated because the People failed to allege or prove at the hearing that Felix committed a \u201crecent overt act\u201d of criminal sexual violence prior to the initiation of SVPA proceedings in 1996. The People opposed the motion, arguing the SVPA does not require proof of a recent overt act before a commitment petition may be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On September 11, 2006, Judge McBride denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">On September 8, 2006, the People moved to consolidate the three pending petitions for trial. The motion was denied. The consolidated 2002 and 2004 petitions remained scheduled for trial before Judge Morgan. The third petition, filed July 2006, was scheduled for trial before Judge McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">On September 20, 2006, the Governor signed the Sex Offender Punishment, Control, and Containment Act of 2006 (Stats. 2006, ch. 337; Senate Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.)), which was urgency legislation that went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>into effect immediately. (Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a7 62.) Among other things, Senate Bill No. 1128 changed the term of commitment for SVP\u2019s from two years to an indeterminate term. (\u00a7 6604, as amended by Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On September 27, 2006, the People moved to amend the pending petitions against Felix so that each would seek commitment for an indeterminate term. On October 3, Judge Morgan granted the motion as to the consolidated 2002 and 2004 petitions \u201cwithout in any way indicating what kind of commitment I would make if, in fact, the jury found the petition to be true.\u201d The court added, \u201cWe will litigate that issue later if there is any reason to.\u201d As far as the record discloses, Judge McBride never ruled on the motion as to the 2006 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">A jury trial on the consolidated 2002 and 2004 petitions took place in October 2006. In the meantime, trial was continued on the 2006 petition. On October 18, 2006, the jury found that Felix was an SVP as defined in section 6600. On October 20, following legal argument on the issue of the appropriate term of commitment, the court committed Felix for an indeterminate term. On October 23, Judge McBride dismissed the 2006 petition over Felix\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">On October 26, 2006, Felix filed a notice of appeal from the judgment and commitment entered October 20 and the dismissal of the 2006 petition entered on October 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">I., II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">III. <em>Estoppel by Consent Judgment in </em>Mayberg<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">In <em>Mayberg, </em>the United States Department of Justice sued the State of California, DMH Director Stephen Mayberg (in his official capacity only), and other state officials \u201cto remedy an alleged pattern or practice of conduct that was alleged to deprive patients of Metropolitan State Hospital, in Norwalk, California, and Napa State Hospital, in Napa, California [State Hospitals] of rights, privileges, and immunities secured or protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>(Mayberg, supra, </em>No. CV-06-2667-GPS.) On the same day the complaint was filed, the parties stipulated to a consent judgment requiring the defendants to take measures to improve conditions in the state hospitals. The court signed the judgment on May 15, 2006. On August 2, 2006, the complaint and consent judgment were amended to encompass Atascadero State Hospital in addition to the other named hospitals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The thrust of the consent judgment is to require defendants to use a \u201cRecovery philosophy of care and a Psychiatric Rehabilitation model of service delivery\u201d designed to strengthen and support each individual\u2019s recovery and rehabilitation. To that end, \u201cTherapeutic and rehabilitation services shall be designed to address each individual\u2019s needs . . . .\u201d The judgment imposes detailed requirements for these individual assessments. In the area of psychiatric assessments and diagnoses, the judgment requires the defendants to \u201cuse the diagnostic criteria of the most current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ... for reaching the most accurate psychiatric diagnoses.\u201d The judgment sets forth assessment requirements for the first 24 hours and first seven days of the patient\u2019s admission to the state hospital. It then provides, \u201cEach State Hospital shall ensure that: i. clinically justifiable diagnoses are provided for each individual, and all diagnoses that cannot be clinically justified for an individual are discontinued no later than the next review; ii. the documented justification of the diagnoses is in accord with the criteria contained in the most current DSM (as per DSM-IV-TR Checklist); iii. differential diagnoses, \u2018deferred,\u2019 or \u2018rule-out\u2019 diagnoses, and diagnoses listed as \u2018NOS\u2019 (\u2018Not Otherwise Specified\u2019) are timely addressed (i.e., within 60 days), through clinically appropriate assessments, and resolved in a clinically justifiable manner; and iv. \u2018no diagnosis\u2019 is clinically justified and documented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Felix argues the People are judicially estopped from proceeding on the commitment petitions filed against him because the consent judgment precludes the type of diagnosis rendered in his case. He argues \u201cthe State of California seeks to continue to detain the defendant indefinitely based on a diagnostic theory which the State has recently and specifically repudiated in a voluntary agreement in a federal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Judicial estoppel applies when a party is successful in asserting a position in a judicial proceeding: the party will be estopped from taking a completely inconsistent position in a subsequent judicial proceeding. <em>(MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental &amp; Metal Works Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Cal.4th 412, 422 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 755, 115 P.3d 41].) Felix has not shown that the defendants in the Mayberg action successfully asserted the position that NOS (not otherwise specified) diagnoses should be timely addressed and resolved in a clinically justifiable manner. Rather, the defendants acquiesced in a consent judgment that imposed this requirement on the state hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Nor are the People estopped under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. \u201cThe doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of an issue previously adjudicated if: (1) the issue necessarily decided in the previous suit is identical to the issue sought to be relitigated; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits of the previous suit; and (3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party, or in privity with a party, to the previous suit. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Producers Dairy Delivery Co. v. Sentry Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 903, 910 [226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920].) A stipulated judgment may properly be given collateral estoppel effect if the parties manifest an intent to be collaterally bound by the judgment, as by stipulating to a specific factual finding. <em>(California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 658, 664-665 &amp; fn. 2 [268 Cal.Rptr. 284, 788 P.2d 1156].) Felix argues the consent judgment \u201cimplicitly recognized what the introduction to the DSM IV makes clear: \u2018NOS\u2019 diagnoses are inherently limited and imprecise. Although useful as an initial diagnoses [szc] pending further investigation, a persistent NOS label as a primary diagnosis may well be a sign that the patient, despite some symptoms of mental disease, may not actually suffer form [szc] any identifiable and treatable disease.\u201d Neither the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders nor the consent judgment supports this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) explains: \u201cBecause of the diversity of clinical presentations, it is impossible for the diagnostic nomenclature to cover every possible situation. For this reason, each diagnostic class has at least one Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) category .... <em>There are four situations in which an NOS diagnosis may be </em>appropriate(DSM-IV-TR (2000) p. 4, italics added.) First, \u201c[t]he presentation <em>conforms to the general guidelines for a mental disorder </em>in the diagnostic class, but the symptomatic picture does not meet the criteria for any of the specific disorders. This would occur either when the symptoms are below the diagnostic threshold for one of the specific disorders or when there is an atypical or mixed presentation.\u201d (Ibid., italics added.) Second, an NOS diagnosis may be appropriate if the presentation \u201cconforms to a symptom pattern that has not been included in the DSM-IV Classification but that causes clinically significant distress or impairment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Third, an NOS diagnosis may be appropriate if there is \u201cuncertainty about etiology (i.e., whether the disorder is due to a general medical condition, is substance induced, or is primary).\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Fourth, an NOS diagnosis may be appropriate \u201c[i]f there is insufficient opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>complete data collection ... or inconsistent or contradictory information, but there is enough information to place it within a particular diagnostic class.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>In other words, the DSM-IV-TR lists particular instances when an NOS diagnosis is clinically appropriate in the mental health setting, like the SVP determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Felix cites isolated language in these four categories to argue an NOS diagnosis is a \u201cfallback\u201d diagnosis that is \u201cneither complete nor effective,\u201d but is \u201cby its nature, tentative or imprecise.\u201d As to the first category, Felix emphasizes the language that the symptoms may be \u201cbelow the diagnostic threshold for one of the specific disorders,\u201d but he ignores the language requiring the presentation conform to the general guidelines for mental disorder or providing that an NOS diagnosis might be based on an atypical or mixed presentation rather than on symptoms being below a diagnostic threshold. As to the second category, he emphasizes the language that the symptom pattern has not been included in the DSM-IV-TR, but ignores the language that the pattern \u201ccauses clinically significant distress or impairment.\u201d As to the third category, he emphasizes the language regarding uncertain etiology, but ignores the fact that the category is not based on uncertainty about the patient\u2019s symptoms. As to the fourth category, he emphasizes the language about insufficient information, but ignores the requirement of sufficient information to place it within a particular diagnostic class. Indeed, as to all categories, Felix ignores the fact that the DSM-IV-TR provides such diagnoses \u201cmay be appropriate\u201d if they satisfy the listed criteria. Felix\u2019s lay opinion that such diagnoses are \u201cincomplete and only preliminary to a true, \u2018clinically justifiable\u2019 diagnosis\u201d is contradicted by the DSM-IV-TR itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Felix also misrepresents the substance of the consent judgment. The judgment makes no express assertion (or finding) that NOS diagnoses are incomplete and unreliable. Nor does the consent judgment implicitly recognize such an assertion. The judgment requires NOS diagnoses to be addressed and resolved in a \u201cclinically justifiable manner.\u201d Nothing precludes a further NOS diagnosis as a \u201cclinically justifiable\u201d resolution of the original diagnosis. The DSM-IV-TR acknowledges that NOS diagnoses may be appropriate. Some of the circumstances in which such a diagnosis is appropriate are based on limited information that might be augmented upon a further diagnosis: for example, newly discovered information about the patient\u2019s history that places him or her within a specific classification, symptoms observed at the state hospital that bring the patient within the diagnostic threshold of a specific classification, or newly discovered information about the etiology of the patient\u2019s symptoms. The language relied on by Felix in the consent judgment follows a list of requirements for prompt diagnosis of newly admitted patients. Therefore, the language could be directed primarily at preliminary NOS diagnoses that are based on available information. Nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>judgment, however, indicates that an ongoing NOS diagnosis would not be appropriate based on all the information the state hospital is able to gather about the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">It is also significant to this court that the particular DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of paraphilia NOS has been the \u201cAxis I\u201d diagnosis in at least two important decisions discussing the legal appropriateness of an SVP finding under the SVPA. In <em>Hubbart v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1138 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584], the mental health disorder determined by the two mental health professionals (Drs. Nelson and Phenix) associated with the People\u2019s case was \u201cparaphilia not otherwise specified.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1150.) In <em>People v. Williams </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 757 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 684, 74 P.3d 779] <em>(Williams), </em>the same particular mental health Axis I diagnosis was reached by the two licensed psychologists for the prosecution (Drs. Sheppard and Franks). <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 761-762.) Indeed, Dr. Sheppard concluded that a feature of this condition \u201cpredispose[d] [Williams] to sexually violent criminal behavior, as evidenced by his repeated misconduct of this nature and the fact that \u2018even in a controlled setting [he] continues to sexually act out in about the only way he can.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 762.) The Supreme Court then noted in <em>Williams </em>that the testimony regarding this particular disorder is \u201cample evidence\u201d of the requisite proof of a serious difficulty in controlling dangerous behavior for purposes of the SVPA. <em>(Williams, </em>at p. 778.) \u201cBoth expert witnesses testified that defendant suffers from paraphilia, a serious, incurable mental disorder, which is characterized by the obsessive, repetitive, and driven nature of his criminal sexual violence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Finally, even if an NOS diagnosis were insufficient for implementation of the individualized recovery and rehabilitation treatment plans required by the consent judgment, it does not follow that they are insufficient for proof that a respondent is an SVP. The Legislature and voters have acknowledged that SVP\u2019s are a small set of extremely dangerous offenders that are very difficult or impossible to successfully treat. The People relied not only on the psychiatric diagnoses of Felix to prove he was an SVP, but also on his commission of sexually violent predatory crimes and specific psychiatric or psychological observations and assessments of his mental disorder, and dangerousness. The consent judgment in no way compels the People to provide a non-NOS psychiatric diagnosis before it can establish that a respondent is an SVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>IV. <em>Proof of Recent Overt </em>Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Felix argues proof of his SVP status was insufficient because there was no evidence he committed a recent overt act while he was out of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Section 6600, subdivision (d) provides, \u201c \u2018Danger to the health and safety of others\u2019 does not require proof of a recent overt act while the offender is in custody.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (d), as amended by Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a7 53; see also Prop. 83, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) \u00a7 24.) Former section 6600, subdivision (d) was identical. (Former \u00a7 6600, subd. (d), as added by Stats. 1995, ch. 763, \u00a7 3, pp. 5922-5923.) The statute authorizes commitment if a court or jury determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is an SVP. (\u00a7 6604, as amended by Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a7 55; see also Prop. 83, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) \u00a7 27.) An SVP is defined as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person <em>a danger to the health and safety of others </em>in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1), italics added, as amended by Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a7 53; see also Prop. 83, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) \u00a7 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Felix argues the People were required to prove in this instant case that he committed an overt act while he was released on parole in the mid-1990\u2019s. We disagree. The issue before the jury was Felix\u2019s status as an SVP at the time of trial. The lack of a \u201crecent\u201d overt act was immaterial because recently (i.e., since 1996) Felix had been in custody. Section 6600, subdivision (d) expressly provided that recent overt acts need not be proven \u201cwhile the offender is in custody.\u201d During the time of the trial we review here, and for approximately 10 years before, Felix was \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of the SVPA. Nor does due process require proof of a recent overt act in such circumstances. \u201cDue process does not require that the absurd be done before a compelling state interest can be vindicated. As in the present case, [a mentally disturbed sex offender] may have a predisposition to commit a specific type of sexual offense\u2014one that cannot, as a practical matter, be committed during confinement.\u201d <em>(People v. Martin </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 714, 725 [165 Cal.Rptr. 773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Felix contends section 6600, subdivision (d) impliedly requires proof of a \u201crecent overt act\u201d whenever a person named in an SVP petition \u201chas been out of custody for an extended period of time.\u201d However, he does not try to reconcile this \u201crecent overt act\u201d requirement with the facts in this particular case, where 10 years have elapsed since he was last out of custody, and commitment and recommitment determinations have passed without any challenge, becoming final judgments. Insofar as Felix argues that the facts of this case require the People to address the issue of any recent conduct by Felix to satisfy due process concerns, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">He relies on two cases for his argument. The first is <em>Personal Restraint of Young </em>(1993) 122 Wn.2d 1 [857 P.2d 989]. In that case, the petitioner Cunningham had \u201cbeen released from confinement on a sex offense . . . and lives in the community immediately prior to the initiation of sex predator proceedings . . . proof of a recent overt act is necessary to satisfy due process concerns . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>857 P.2d at p. 1009.) <em>Young </em>relied on a 1982 Washington Supreme Court decision, <em>In re Harris, </em>which held that recent overt acts had to be proven before an individual could be civilly committed under a statute similar to California\u2019s Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, section 5000 et seq. <em>(Personal Restraint of Young, </em>at p. 1009, citing <em>In re Harris </em>(1982) 98 Wn.2d 276, 284 [654 P.2d 109, 113].) <em>Harris </em>relied in part on the particular language of the Washington statute and in part on two federal opinions that held a recent overt act finding was a due process requirement. <em>(In re Harris, supra, </em>654 P.2d at p. 113.) Significantly, since <em>Harris, </em>a number of courts have held the due process clause does not require proof of a recent overt act to establish dangerousness sufficient to warrant a civil commitment.

Molett </em>(Tex.App. 2002) 95 S.W.3d 590, 599 [Texas\u2019s SVP Act not unconstitutional for failure to require proof of recent overt act, where the statute required proof of repeat sexual offenses and a behavior abnormality making the SVP a \u201cmenace to the health and safety of another person\u201d]; and <em>Matter of Cause No. MH-90-00566 </em>(1992) 173 Ariz. 177, 184 [840 P.2d 1042] [proof of recent overt act not required for civil commitment, where statute required proof by clear and convincing evidence of substantial probability of harm].) This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>authority is substantial; it supports this court\u2019s determination that there is no due process violation with the manner of applying the SVPA to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">It is also significant that the courts of Washington have moved away from the degree of reliance petitioner places on the <em>Young </em>holding. Simply stated, the SVP statute in Washington does not require proof of a recent overt act when the individual is in \u201ccustody.\u201d If the person named in the petition was confined or in custody at the time of the petition being filed, and therefore not \u201cliving in the community\u201d the \u201crecent overt act\u201d requirement under the statute does not apply. <em>(Det. of Lewis </em>(2008) 163 Wn.2d 188, 201 [177 P.3d 708, 715].) The rationale of <em>Young </em>is therefore limited to its factual predicate. It would not apply in this case where Felix has been in custody for approximately 10 years before the trial which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The other case cited by Felix is <em>In re Detention of Gonzales </em>(Iowa 2003) 658 N.W.2d 102. There, the statute in question, when applied to the facts in the case, expressly obligated the trial court to find that the person had committed a recent overt act. Gonzales was not confined at the time the petition was filed. The Iowa statute expressly stated that a proper finding of \u201c \u2018 \u201c[l]ikely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence,\u201d \u2019 \u201d for a nonconfined subject, could be found \u201c \u2018only if the person commits a recent overt act.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 103, italics omitted.) Obviously, the circumstances in this case diffuse reliance on this case interpreting specific provisions of an Iowa statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The United States and California Supreme Courts have exhaustively examined the issue of what showing is required to confine a sexually violent predator against his or her will consistent with the due process clause. (See, e.g., <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 407 [151 L.Ed.2d 856, 122 S.Ct. 867]; <em>Williams, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 757.) These controlling decisions require a finding of dangerousness to one\u2019s self or others that is linked to a mental disorder causing serious difficulty in controlling one\u2019s behavior. <em>(Williams, </em>at pp. 771-772, discussing <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407.) The decisions do not require proof of recent overt acts as a constitutional minimum for these types of civil commitments. The requirements of two convictions for sexually violent offenses and evidence of a current mental disorder making it likely the individual will reoffend satisfy the due process dangerousness requirement in this context. <em>(Williams, </em>at pp. 764, 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Even if the state is required to prove an overt act during Felix\u2019s most recent sustained period out of custody, the requirement was satisfied here. During that period (the mid-1990\u2019s), Felix was repeatedly returned to custody for parole violations. Dr. Scherrer testified at the 2006 trial that the length of time Felix was out of custody was insufficient to conclude he was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>significant risk for committing further sexually violent offenses. Combined with his prior convictions for sexually violent offenses involving more than two separate victims and the current psychiatric opinion that he had a mental disorder that caused him serious difficulty in controlling his behavior, the totality of this evidence demonstrated sufficient dangerousness to involuntarily commit Felix as an SVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">V, VI.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The indeterminate term of commitment imposed October 20, 2006, and the dismissal of the 2006 petition are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Simons, Acting P.
