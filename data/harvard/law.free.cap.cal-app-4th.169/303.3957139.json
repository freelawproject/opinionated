Code, \u00a7 12025, subd. (a)(2)), and carrying a loaded firearm in a public place (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(1)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to the middle term of two years in state prison for the conviction of carrying a loaded firearm in a public place, and sentence on the remaining conviction was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In this appeal defendant claims that his conviction of possession of a concealed weapon violates the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the trial court gave erroneous instructions in response to jury questions on the charge of carrying a loaded firearm in a public place. He also challenges the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision to deny probation and impose a state prison term. We conclude that the conviction of possession of a concealed weapon does not contravene defendant\u2019s Second Amendment rights as interpreted in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller </em>(2008) 554 U.S._[171 L.Ed.2d 637, 128 S.Ct. 2783] <em>(Heller), </em>and the court properly instructed the jury on carrying a loaded firearm in a public place. We also find that no prejudicial sentencing error occurred. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">On the evening of June 6, 2007, Officers Kevin Murphy and Michael Leite of the Oakland Police Department\u2019s Crime Reduction Team were on patrol in a \u201csemi-marked police vehicle\u201d in the 1400 block of 57th Avenue in East Oakland, an area notorious as an \u201copen air drug market.\u201d The officers approached a group of \u201cfive Black males\u201d ranging in age from 17 to \u201cmid-20\u2019s\u201d clustered near the \u201csidewalk area\u201d at the rear of a 1980\u2019s vintage brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Toyota Corolla parked in the driveway at 1423 57th Avenue. Some of them were holding open bottles of alcohol, and one was in possession of a clear plastic baggie. The vehicle was abandoned and had no license plates; the residence appeared to be unoccupied and had a \u201cfor sale sign\u201d on the front lawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">After observing the \u201csubjects drinking in public,\u201d the officers decided to contact the group to \u201cfurther investigate.\u201d Officer Murphy parked the police vehicle in the street facing into the driveway directly behind the Toyota. As he did so, all of the individuals who had been congregating around the Toyota put their alcohol containers down and began to scatter in different directions. The two officers focused on different individuals in the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Officer Leite observed defendant walk from the right front comer of the Toyota to the right rear of the vehicle. Defendant then turned toward the vehicle, leaned down, and pulled a black revolver from the waist pocket of his black, hooded sweatshirt. He opened his hand and tossed the revolver under the abandoned Toyota in front of the right rear tire. As defendant began to \u201cwalk away,\u201d Officer Leite arrested and handcuffed him. From under the car Officer Leite recovered the gun, which he identified as a Smith and Wesson .38-caliber Special. He opened the cylinder of the revolver and discovered five live rounds inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Meanwhile, Officer Murphy noticed another individual in the group, Antonio Poole, make \u201ca very quick movement\u201d away from the Toyota toward a staircase as he closed a clear plastic baggie that the officer suspected contained marijuana. Poole threw the baggie over the staircase and onto the lawn. Officer Murphy detained and handcuffed Poole. William Shaw, who was also in the group, was arrested on an \u201coutstanding warrant.\u201d They were later transported to North County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The other two young men in the group, Tyree Ewing and Chad Frazier, were detained but not arrested. Aaron Frazier, a relative of both Chad Frazier and William Shaw, approached from a \u201crear apartment complex\u201d and spoke to some of the individuals in the group after they were detained and handcuffed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Frazier was agitated and complained to the officers that \u201chis family and friends were the subjects\u201d who had been detained. He specifically expressed to the officers that defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d Frazier also informed the officers that \u201che was on parole\u201d and \u201cpossibly had a warrant for his arrest.\u201d After the officers confirmed through a \u201crecords check\u201d that Frazier was \u201ca parolee at large with a warrant for his arrest,\u201d he too was \u201ctaken into custody and transported to jail.\u201d At the jail, Frazier reiterated to the officer that defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t have no gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Frazier testified that he was in a parked car at the scene in front of 1423 57th Avenue, and observed the group of five who had converged around the abandoned Toyota, drinking alcohol. He \u201cdidn\u2019t see\u201d defendant in possession of a gun. Frazier knew his cousin, William Shaw, \u201chad the gun\u201d in his back pocket before the police arrived. He then heard the sound of \u201cmetal hitting the ground\u201d when the officers pulled their car onto the sidewalk. Frazier testified that Shaw must have been the one who \u201ctossed\u201d the gun under the car after the \u201cpolice pulled up.\u201d He was convinced that defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Defendant testified in his defense that about 8:30 p.m. on June 6, 2007, he arranged with his \u201cweed person,\u201d John, to meet at 1423 57th Avenue to purchase marijuana. Defendant was aware that his friends bought marijuana \u201cin front of that house,\u201d although he did not know the people who lived at the residence and had never been there to purchase drugs before. For about 10 minutes before the police arrived, he was \u201cjust talking, drinking,\u201d and \u201cmingling\u201d around the Toyota with his friends who had congregated there. Defendant was standing on the left side of the car near the base of a stairwell when he noticed the police officers pull into the driveway and park at a slant. As the officers got out of their vehicle, everyone started to move around. Defendant heard the sound of \u201cmetal hitting the ground.\u201d He placed his bottle on the top of the Toyota and walked toward the church on the comer, but an officer told everyone \u201cto come back\u201d and stand on the left side of the car. Officer Leite picked up the gun and handcuffed defendant. The officer then told defendant he was \u201cgoing to jail\u201d for possession of the gun, despite defendant\u2019s protest that the gun did not belong to him. Defendant denied that he possessed the gun \u201cat any time\u201d during the incident. He claimed that the gun belonged to Shaw. Defendant testified that he observed Shaw in possession of the same gun a few days before.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">I. <em>The Conviction of Possession of a Concealed Weapon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Defendant claims that in light of the recent United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 U.S._[171 L.Ed.2d 637], his conviction of possession of a concealed weapon on \u201cprivate property\u201d \u201cviolate[s] the protections under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d His position is that as applied to his possession of a concealed weapon \u201con a private driveway,\u201d Penal Code section 12025, subdivision (a)(2) must be found constitutionally \u201coverbroad,\u201d as it \u201ccannot be reconciled with the protection afforded by the Second Amendment\u201d as stated in the <em>Heller </em>opinion. He asks us to reverse the conviction as constitutionally impermissible under the facts presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>A. <em>Defendant\u2019s Failure to Object at Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We first resolve the Attorney General\u2019s contention that defendant forfeited his \u201cSecond Amendment claim\u201d by failing to object on that ground in the trial court. The Attorney General argues that defendant\u2019s \u201cas applied challenge\u201d does not \u201cpresent a pure question of law,\u201d but rather demands analysis of \u201cdisputed facts\u201d that relate to his status as a \u201cpermissive visitor\u201d on private property, and therefore the issue was \u201cforfeited\u201d without an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u201cOrdinarily, a criminal defendant who does not challenge an assertedly erroneous ruling of the trial court in that court has forfeited his or her right to raise the claim on appeal. [Citations.] As the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>United States v. Olano </em>[(1993)] 507 U.S. [725,] 731 [123 L.Ed.2d 508, 113 S.Ct. 1770], \u2018 \u201c[n]o procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right,\u201d or a right of any other sort, \u201cmay be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] \u2018The purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court, so that they may be corrected. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Sheena K. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 875, 880-881 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 716, 153 P.3d 282].)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We agree with the Attorney General that defendant\u2019s claim of constitutional overbreadth demands at least consideration of facts pertinent to the statutory violation. (See <em>In re Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th 875, 887.) Nevertheless, we will consider the issue on the merits for several reasons. First, the issue is still one of law presented by undisputed facts in the record before us that does not require the scrutiny of individual circumstances, but instead requires the review of abstract and generalized legal concepts\u2014a task that is suited to the role of an appellate court. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 887-888; <em>People v. Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1061 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388]; <em>In re Justin S. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 811, 815 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 466].) We also confront the issue to avert any claim of inadequate assistance of counsel. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 831-832 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 919 P.2d 1280]; <em>People v. Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, 975-976 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P2d 214]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sully </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1195, 1218 [283 Cal.Rptr. 144, 812 P.2d 163]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 196 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949]; <em>People v. Hodges </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1348, 1354-1355 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 619]; <em>People v. Williams </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 649, 657 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 58].) And finally, the defense had no reason to challenge the statute on the grounds asserted here until the decision in <em>Heller </em>was issued <em>after </em>trial of the matter was concluded and judgment was entered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sandoval </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 837, fn. 4 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 161 P3d 1146].) \u201c \u2018A defendant will be excused from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the necessity of either a timely objection and/or a request for admonition if either would be futile. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Boyette </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 432 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 58 P.3d 391]; see also <em>People v. Abbaszadeh </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 642, 648-649 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 873].) \u201cA criminal defendant cannot be deemed to have waived or forfeited a legal argument which was not recognized at the time of his trial.\u201d <em>(People v. Cardenas </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1479 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 821].) We therefore conclude defendant did not forfeit the right to appellate review. <em>(People v. Sandoval, supra, </em>at p. 837, fn. 4; <em>People v. Ibarra </em>(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1199 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 871].)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">B. <em>The Claim of Constitutional Invalidity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Turning to the merits of the claim that Penal Code section 12025, subdivision (a)(2) is constitutionally overbroad and invalid as applied to defendant\u2019s possession of a weapon on private property, \u201cwe consider the following: \u2018A statute is invalid on its face and wholly void only when incapable of any valid application. [Citation.] In determining a statute\u2019s constitutionality, we start from the premise that it is valid, we resolve all doubts in favor of its constitutionality, and we uphold it unless it is in clear and unquestionable conflict with the state or federal Constitutions. [Citation.] A challenge to a statute\u2019s constitutionality must demonstrate that its provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions. [Citation.] The corollary to the challenger\u2019s burden is that if the court can conceive of a situation in which the statute can be applied without entailing an inevitable collision with constitutional provisions, the statute will prevail. [Citation.] A statute is not facially unconstitutional simply because it may not be constitutionally applied to some persons or circumstances; at a minimum its unlawful application must be substantial and real when judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.  Unless it is in total conflict with the Constitution, any overbreadth is cured by a case-by-case analysis of the particular fact situation. [Citation.] A statute will be declared invalid in its entirety only when its scope cannot be limited to constitutionally applicable situations except by reading in numerous qualifications and exceptions, i.e., rewriting it, or if it is invalid in certain situations and cannot be enforced in others without danger of an uncertain or vague future application. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rupf v. Yan </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 411, 423-424 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 157].) \u201cA statute is only over-broad if it \u2018prohibits a \u201c \u2018substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Rubalcava </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 322, 333 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 735, 1 P.3d 52].)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Here, the precise inquiry is whether Penal Code section 12025, subdivision (a)(2) violates the Second Amendment principles articulated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Heller, </em>where the statute is enforced against a defendant who carried a concealed weapon on residential property that was, according to the evidence presented, fully accessible to the public. We begin by examining the <em>Heller </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 U.S. _, _ [171 L.Ed.2d 637, 657], in the course of invalidating a prohibition by the District of Columbia on the possession of usable handguns in the home, the court announced that the Second Amendment guarantees \u201cthe individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation,\u201d self-defense, or other traditionally lawful purposes, unconnected with service in a militia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A majority of the court held \u201cthat the District\u2019s ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any <em>lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.\u201d (Heller, supra, </em>at p. _ [171 L.Ed.2d at p. 683], italics added; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bonner </em>(N.D.Cal., Sept. 23, 2008, No. CR 08-00389 SBA) 2008 U.S.Dist. Lexis 80765, *7-*8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The court added the vital admonition, however, that \u201cwe do not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for <em>any sort </em>of confrontation, just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for <em>any purpose.\u201d (Heller, supra, </em>554 U.S._,_ [171 L.Ed.2d 637, 659].) The court emphasized that \u201cthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right [to keep and bear arms] was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. _ [171 L.Ed.2d at p. 678]; see also <em>Mullenix v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives </em>(E.D.N.C., July 2, 2008, No. 5:07-CV-154-D) 2008 U.S.Dist. Lexis 51059, *6.) Although the court declined to adopt a level of scrutiny to be imposed upon Second Amendment restrictions or specify the limitations the government may place on an individual\u2019s right to possess firearms,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a nonexclusive list of the many \u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory measures\u201d was enumerated. <em>(Heller, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>at p._, fn. 26 [171 L.Ed.2d at p. 678, fn. 26]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bledsoe </em>(W.D.Tex., Aug. 8, 2008, No. SA-08-CR-13(2)-XR) 2008 U.S.Dist. Lexis 60522, *8.) The court declared: \u201c[T]he majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that <em>prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful </em>under the Second Amendment or state analogues. [Citations.] Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [][] We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. <em>Miller </em>said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \u2018in common use at the time.\u2019 <em>[(United States </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1939) 307 U.S. 174, 179 [83 L.Ed. 1206, 59 S.Ct. 816].)] We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \u2018dangerous and unusual weapons.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Heller, supra, </em>at pp._-_[171 L.Ed.2d at pp. 678-679], fn. omitted, italics added; see also <em>U.S. v. Fincher, supra, </em>538 F.3d 868, 874; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harden </em>(D.Or., July 16, 2008, No. 06-79-KI) 2008 U.S.Dist. Lexis 54717.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Without considering either defendant\u2019s standing to raise an over-breadth challenge or the reach of the Second Amendment to laws enacted by the states <em>(United States v. Cruikshank et al., supra, </em>92 U.S. 542, 553; <em>Fresno Rifle and Pistol Club, Inc. v. Van De Kamp </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 965 F.2d 723, 729; <em>In re Rameriz </em>(1924) 193 Cal. 633, 651 [226 P. 914]), we find nothing in Penal Code section 12025, subdivision (a), that violates the limited right of the individual established in <em>Heller </em>to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation. Section 12025, subdivision (a), does not broadly prohibit or even regulate the possession of a gun in the home for lawful purposes of confrontation or self-defense, as did the law declared constitutionally in-firmed in <em>Heller. </em>Rather, section 12025, subdivision (a), in much more limited fashion, specifically defines as unlawful carrying concealed within a vehicle or \u201cconcealed upon his or her person any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, carrying a firearm concealed on the person or in a vehicle in violation of section 12025, subdivision (a), is not in the nature of a common use of a gun for lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>purposes which the court declared to be protected by the Second Amendment in <em>Heller. </em>(See <em>People v. Wasley </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 383, 386 [53 Cal.Rptr. 877].) Unlike possession of a gun for protection within a residence, carrying a concealed firearm presents a recognized \u201cthreat to public order,\u201d and is \u201c \u2018prohibited as a means of preventing physical harm to persons other than the offender.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hale </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 353, 356 [17 Cal.Rptr. 697].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A person who carries a concealed firearm on his person or in a vehicle, \u201cwhich permits him immediate access to the firearm but impedes others from detecting its presence, poses an \u2018imminent threat to public safety . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hodges, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th 1348, 1357.)  Treating as criminal defendant\u2019s concealment of a firearm under his clothing on a residential driveway that was not closed off from the public and was populated with temporary occupants falls within the \u201chistorical tradition\u201d of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous weapons in publicly sensitive places. <em>(Heller, supra, </em>554 U.S._,_[71 L.Ed.2d 637, 678].)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Rather than cast any doubt upon the continued constitutional validity of concealed weapons bans, the <em>Heller </em>opinion specifically expressed constitutional approval of the accepted statutory proscriptions against carrying concealed weapons. <em>(Heller, supra, </em>554 U.S. _, _ [171 L.Ed.2d 637, 678].) Thus, in the aftermath of <em>Heller </em>the prohibition \u201con the carrying of a concealed weapon without a permit, continues to be a lawful exercise by the state of its regulatory authority notwithstanding the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(S.D.W.Va., Aug. 4, 2008, No. 2:08-00006) 2008 U.S.Dist. Lexis 59641, *3.) We conclude that neither on its face nor as applied to defendant\u2019s particular statutory violation does Penal Code section 12025 prohibit conduct protected by the Second Amendment as defined in <em>Heller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">II. <em>The Supplemental Instructions on Penal Code Section 12031.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Defendant also argues that the trial court committed instructional error in responses to inquiries by the jury during deliberations directed at the offense of carrying a loaded firearm in a public place (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(1)), as charged in count 2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In written questions the jury asked: \u201cTo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>be found guilty of the second count: (1) must the defendant be on the sidewalk, or (2) is being on the driveway sufficient? (3) Define public place for us.\u201d After consulting with counsel, the court provided the jury with the following response: \u201c(1) No. (2) Yes. (3) The area in front of a home, including a private driveway, is a public place if it is reasonably accessible to the public without a barrier.\u201d Defendant complains that the court\u2019s response \u201camounted to a directed verdict\u201d on the element of a \u201cpublic place\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 12031. He also argues that the court inaccurately defined public place for the jury \u201cin light of the decision\u201d in <em>Heller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">A. <em>The Instruction as a Directed Verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We first confront defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s responses, considered in the entirety, effectively \u201cdirected a verdict for the prosecution on the element of a public place in section 12031, subdivision (a)(1).\u201d He asserts that the issue \u201cshould have gone to the jury,\" but the erroneous instruction \u201cin effect created a directed verdict for the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We agree with defendant that the constitutional right to a jury trial means that \u201cno matter how conclusive the evidence, a trial court cannot directly inform the jury that an element of the crime charged has been established. Absent a stipulation by the defendant that an element is established or is admitted, the trial court must submit that question to the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 168, 181 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 56]; see also <em>People v. Lawson </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 741, 747 [234 Cal.Rptr. 557].) \u201c \u2018The prohibition against directed verdicts \u201cincludes perforce situations in which the judge\u2019s instructions fall short of directing a guilty verdict but which nevertheless have the effect of so doing by eliminating other relevant considerations if the jury finds one fact to be true.\u201d [Citation.] . . . \u201c[N]o fact, not even an undisputed fact, may be determined by the judge.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. James </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 244, 271-272 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 7]; see also <em>People v. Wilkins </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 761, 778 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 743].) \u201c[I]t matters not whether the issue in question is one of fact or law. Due process requires that it be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>(People v. Wilkins, supra, </em>at p. 778.) \u201cIf a judge were permitted to instruct the jury on the basis of assertedly \u2018undisputed\u2019 evidence that a particular element had been established as a matter of law, the right to a jury trial would become a hollow guarantee.\u201d <em>(People v. Figueroa </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 714, 730 [224 Cal.Rptr. 719, 715 P.2d 680]; see <em>People v. Moore, supra, </em>at p. 180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Here, the court directly advised the jury that a guilty verdict did not require proof that defendant was on the sidewalk. The remainder of the response effectively instructed the jury that defendant\u2019s presence on the private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>driveway was sufficient to prove guilt, but only if the driveway was \u201creasonably accessible to the public without a barrier.\u201d We discern nothing in the response that usurped the jury\u2019s factfinding function. The court did not instruct the jury to find that the driveway was a public place for purposes of Penal Code section 12031. (Cf. <em>People v. Tapia </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1162-1163 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 158]; <em>People v. Jimenez </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 54, 59-60 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 12].) Instead, the instruction left the jury with the task of making two essential factual determinations based upon the evidence as a prerequisite to a guilty verdict on count 2: first, that defendant was on the driveway; and second, that the driveway was reasonably accessible to the public. The instruction given by the trial court in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry did not remove any issue of fact from the jury or direct a verdict for the prosecution. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 432, 443-444 [250 Cal.Rptr. 604, 758 P.2d 1135]; <em>People v.

Defendant further argues that the decision in <em>Heller </em>requires a reexamination of the definition of \u201cpublic place\u201d in Penal Code section 12031. He maintains that the \u201cright to bear arms outlined in <em>Heller </em>should be applied to all privately owned homes and their surrounding property that is not generally opened to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We commence our review of the content of the trial court\u2019s response by delineating the rule that when the jury specifically asked for a legal definition of the term \u201cpublic place,\u201d the court was presented with the statutory obligation \u201cto provide the jury with information the jury desires on points of law.\u201d <em>(People v. Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 985 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 746 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].) Under Penal Code \u201csection 1138 the court must attempt \u2018to clear up any instructional confusion expressed by the jury.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Giardino </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 454, 465 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 315].) \u201cThis means the trial \u2018court has a primary duty to help the jury understand the legal principles it is asked to apply. [Citation.] This does not mean the court must always elaborate on the standard instructions. Where the original instructions are themselves full and complete, the <em>court has discretion </em>under [Penal Code] section 1138 to determine what additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>explanations are sufficient to satisfy the jury\u2019s request for information. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Solis </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1002, 1015 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 464], italics added; see also <em>People v. Smithey, </em>supra, at p. 985; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 522 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].) Penal Code section 1138 does not demand elaboration upon the standard instructions by the trial court when the jury expresses confusion, but rather directs the court to \u201cconsider how it can best aid the jury and decide whether further explanation is desirable, or whether the reiteration of previously given instructions will suffice.\u201d <em>(People v. Moore </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1331 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Further, to resolve the claim of a defective jury instruction we must determine whether its \u201cmeaning was objectionable as communicated to the jury.\u201d <em>(People v. Dieguez </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 266, 276 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 160].) \u201c \u2018Here the question is, how would a reasonable juror understand the instruction. [Citation.] In addressing this question, we consider the specific language under challenge and, if necessary, the charge in its entirety. [Citation.] Finally, we determine whether the instruction, so understood, states the applicable law correctly.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Woodward </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 821, 834 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 779]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 224, 239 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 609].)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">While the term \u201cpublic place\u201d is not defined in Penal Code section 12031, the definition given to the jury by the trial court in the present case was entirely consistent with existing case law that has construed the term in the context of similar statutes. \u201cWhen construing statutes forbidding certain behavior in a \u2018public place\u2019 or \u2018public area,\u2019 California courts have routinely held that privately-owned property can constitute a public place.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tapia, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Most notably, in <em>People v. Jimenez, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th 54, 57, the defendant\u2019s sentence for selling cocaine was enhanced under Health and Safety Code section 11353.6, subdivision (b), for sale of a controlled substance \u201cwithin 1,000 feet of... a public or private elementary, vocational, junior high, or high school,\u201d which in turn was defined in subdivision (g) of the statute to mean, \u201c \u2018any <em>public area </em>or business establishment where minors are legally permitted to conduct business which is located within 1000 feet of any public or private [school].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jimenez, supra, </em>at p. 57, italics added.) The defendant contended that his sale of rock cocaine \u201cin a residential driveway,\u201d as a matter of law was not a \u201c \u2018public area\u2019 within the meaning of section 11353.6, subdivision (g).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 56, 57.) The court concluded that the residential driveway was a public area within the meaning of Health and Safety Code section 11353.6. <em>(Jimenez, supra, </em>at p. 60.) A \u201c \u2018public area,\u2019 \u201d reasoned the court, is not \u201csynonymous with \u2018public property.\u2019 When the Legislature uses the adjective \u2018public\u2019 to describe a location it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>is not necessarily implying the location is under public ownership or control. For example, it is well established a \u2018public place\u2019 for purposes of Penal Code section 647 (disorderly conduct) is not synonymous with public property, \u2018but an area where a member of the public may be lawfully present.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 59-60.) Instead, for purposes of Health and Safety Code section 11353.6, the court determined that \u201cthe term \u2018public area\u2019 should be construed to include publicly owned locations such as streets, sidewalks and bus stops as well as those portions of private property which are readily accessible to the public. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>[(1976)] 64 Cal.App.3d [297,] 301 [134 Cal.Rptr. 338], defining \u2018public place\u2019 as \u2018a location readily accessible to all those who wish to go there ....\u2019) This latter category includes private driveways.\u201d <em>(Jimenez, supra, </em>at p. 60; see also <em>People v. Tapia, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The \u201cfront area outside the house\u201d of someone who was unknown to the defendant has been found to meet \u201cthe definition of \u2018public\u2019 for the purpose of [Penal Code] section 647, subdivision (f).\u201d <em>(People v. Olson </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 592, 598 [96 Cal.Rptr. 132].) Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f) \u201c \u2018penalizes the act of <em>being </em>in a public place while under the influence of intoxicating liquor ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Olson, supra, </em>at p. 596, quoting <em>In re Spinks </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 748, 751 [61 Cal.Rptr. 743].) The court in <em>Olson </em>determined that \u201c[i]nasmuch as defendant,\u201d who was \u201ca complete stranger\u201d to the homeowner, was nevertheless \u201cable to walk through the outside area of her home to the front door without challenge, it can hardly be denied that the area is open to \u2018common\u2019 or \u2018general use.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Olson, supra, </em>at p. 598.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">And in <em>People v. Vega </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 954, 958 [96 Cal.Rptr. 391], the court offered a comparable definition of \u201cpublic place\u201d specifically \u201cfor purposes of section 12031 of the Penal Code.\u201d The court concluded that the \u201cparking lot of a market,\u201d although on private property, was a public place since it was <em>\u201caccessible to members of the public </em>having business with the market . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added; see also <em>In re Danny H. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 92, 104\u2014105 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 222]; <em>People v. Perez, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 297, 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We are also persuaded that to limit the definition of \u201cpublic place\u201d in Penal Code section 12031 to publicly owned property, as defendant suggests, would frustrate the purpose of the law, which is to provide protection from those who carry firearms in areas available or exposed to public use. A limited bright-line definition of \u201cpublic place\u201d that excludes all privately owned property would allow those who carry firearms to avoid the proscription of the law simply by moving a few steps off a road or sidewalk onto open, accessible private property, although they pose as much of a threat to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the public there as anywhere else. (See <em>In re Danny H., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 92, 104-105; <em>People v. Jimenez, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th 54, 59-60.) We conclude that the trial court properly advised the jury that a private driveway may be a \u201cpublic place if it is reasonably accessible to the public without a barrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Here, the front driveway of the residence had no obstacles to occupancy by the public. The car parked in the driveway appeared to be abandoned, and the residence was for sale. The driveway was unenclosed, visible to the public, exposed to general view, and had no other physical barrier to access. Defendant and his companions had gathered freely on the driveway, although the residence did not belong to any of them and they had no ownership or possessory interest in the property. The owner of the premises was neither present nor, as far as we know from the record, had the owner given permission to anyone to congregate there. Thus, the court did not err by instructing the jury that a finding of guilt did not depend on proof of defendant\u2019s presence on the sidewalk, and could be based on evidence he was on a driveway that was reasonably accessible to the public without a barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Finally, we discern nothing in the decision in <em>Heller </em>that restricts the permissible scope of Penal Code section 12031 to publicly owned property or otherwise renders the trial court\u2019s instruction erroneous. To the contrary, the <em>Heller </em>opinion explicitly approved of \u201csome statutory restrictions\u2014the types of people who may exercise this freedom; <em>the places where this freedom may be exercised, </em>and, the ability to buy and sell the objects of this freedom\u2014 \u2018whose constitutionality under a strict scrutiny standard would be far from clear.\u2019 <em>Heller, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2851 [(dis. opn. of Breyer, J.)].\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Booker </em>(D.Me. 2008) 570 F.Supp.2d 161, 163, italics added.) Found violative of the Second Amendment in <em>Heller </em>was a law that imposed an \u201cabsolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home,\u201d but the court endorsed traditional regulations restricting firearm possession that are designed to promote and maintain public safety on government property or in publicly sensitive areas. <em>(Heller, supra, </em>554 U.S._,_,_[171 L.Ed.2d 637, 684, 678]; see also <em>United States v. Gliatta </em>(5th Cir. 1978) 580 F.2d 156, 160; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dorosan </em>(E.D.La., June 30, 2008, Crim. B. No. 08-042) 2008 U.S.Dist. Lexis 49628, *10.) Defendant\u2019s act of carrying a loaded firearm while among a group of people congregated on a residential driveway open and available to public use in direct violation of Penal Code section 12031 does not find refuge in the Second Amendment. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s definition of public place was both a correct statement of law and constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>III. <em>The Denial of Probation.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Marchiano, P.
