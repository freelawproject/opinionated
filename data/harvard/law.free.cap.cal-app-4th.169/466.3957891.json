The portions directed to be published are: Introduction, Factual and Procedural History, section II.A., B., and C., Discussion, section LA., B., and C., and Disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b426-10\">SUZUKAWA, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">Plaintiff and appellant Rafi Moghadam (plaintiff) brought the present action against the Regents of the University of California (Regents) and nine of its officers and employees (collectively, defendants) for alleged violations of the Information Practices Act of 1977, Civil Code section 1798 et seq. (IPA or Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IPA is a privacy statute that, among other things, limits the kinds of personal information that public agencies may maintain, requires agencies to maintain personal information \u201cwith accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness,\u201d and permits individuals to inspect and request correction of agency-maintained personal information. (\u00a7 1798.18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">The core of plaintiff\u2019s claim is that defendants refused to allow him to inspect and obtain copies of some of his midterm and final exams. Among his many other claims, he also alleges that defendants destroyed some of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>exams after he asked to inspect them, maintained inaccurate and irrelevant information in his university records, failed to designate an IPA compliance officer, failed to properly safeguard the privacy of student exams, and failed to promulgate appropriate directives to ensure university-wide compliance with the IPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, concluding principally that plaintiff had not introduced any evidence that he suffered harm as a result of defendants\u2019 alleged IPA violations. After judgment was entered, the court declared defendants the prevailing parties and awarded them costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032. Plaintiff appeals from both the judgment and the cost award.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that student exams are not \u201crecords\u201d containing \u201cpersonal information\u201d within the meaning of the IPA. Defendants\u2019 alleged refusal to allow plaintiff to inspect or copy some of his exams, thus, does not violate the IPA as a matter of law. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude that plaintiff failed to introduce evidence that any of the other alleged IPA violations had an adverse effect on him; the trial court did not abuse its discretion by any of its pretrial rulings; and the trial court did not err in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to tax costs. We thus affirm both the judgment and the cost award.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">I. <em>Plaintiffs Prior IPA </em>Action<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">II. <em>The Present Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQl\">A. <em>The Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Plaintiff filed the present action on December 8, 2004, against the Regents; Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, as president of the Board of Regents; Robert C. Dynes, president of the University of California; Albert Camesale, University of California, Los Angeles\u2019s (UCLA) chancellor; Rebecca B. Beatty, UCLA\u2019s director of business and administrative services; Lee Ohanian, a UCLA professor; Anita Cotter, UCLA\u2019s registrar; and the three individual defendants named in the prior suit. The operative second amended complaint, filed May 6, 2005, asserts 12 causes of action under the IPA: (1) failure to maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s records, in violation of section 1798.18<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; (2) failure to establish appropriate rules of conduct \u201c \u2018for persons involved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of records containing personal information,\u2019 \u201d in violation of section 1798.20<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (3) failure to install safeguards to protect personal records, including student exams (which the complaint alleges are left \u201cin hallways, unguarded and open to unauthorized inspection\u201d), in violation of section 1798.21<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (4) failure to designate an employee responsible for compliance with the IPA, in violation of section 1798.22<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; (5) failure to adopt guidelines to protect rights under the IPA, particularly as they relate to the release of student exams, in violation of section 1798.30<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; (6) failure to provide plaintiff with the title and business address of the agency official responsible for maintaining his records, the procedures to be followed to gain access to his records, and the procedures to be followed to contest the contents of those records, in violation of section 1798.32<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; (7) failure to allow plaintiff to inspect his personal records, including his exams, in violation of section 1798.34, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; (8) failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>to allow plaintiff to copy his personal records, including his exams, in violation of section 1798.34, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; (9) failure to decipher coded information in plaintiff\u2019s financial aid records, in violation of section 1798.34, subdivision (c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; (10) failure to allow plaintiff to correct inaccurate data in his personal records, in violation of section 1798.35<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; (11) failure to allow plaintiff to seek a review \u201cby the head of the agency or an official specifically designated by the head of such agency,\u201d in violation of section 1798.36<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; and (12) destruction of plaintiff\u2019s records, including his exams, in violation of section 1798.77.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Plaintiff filed an application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on December 8, 2004. The court granted a TRO, but denied plaintiff\u2019s subsequent application for a preliminary injunction on February 3, 2005. Plaintiff appealed from the denial of his request for a preliminary injunction; on September 11, 2006, this court dismissed the appeal as moot after the trial court entered judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">B. <em>Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On April 19, 2006, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues. Plaintiff opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">On July 17, 2006, the day that the summary judgment motion was scheduled to be heard, plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an order shortening time to file a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. In support, plaintiff explained that he wished to amend his complaint to add a cause of action under the free speech provisions of the state and federal Constitutions and to correct errors in his complaint. The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s application, concluding that he had not made a sufficient showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">On July 26, 2006, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u2014There was no material evidence that plaintiff had incurred damages resulting from defendants\u2019 alleged breaches of the IPA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">\u2014The complaint did not allege any facts suggesting that the individual defendants acted outside the scope of their official capacities, and there was no material evidence of any such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">\u2014As to the first cause of action (alleging a failure to maintain plaintiff\u2019s records), there was no material evidence of plaintiff\u2019s claim that his records had been maintained in violation of section 1798.18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">\u2014As to the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action (alleging absence of proper IPA procedures), there were no triable issues of fact to support plaintiff\u2019s claims. Specifically, there was no credible evidence to dispute that Rebecca Beatty was UCLA\u2019s information practices coordinator or that the Regents had appropriate policies and procedures to protect the privacy, maintenance, and destruction of records. Further, the Regents\u2019 policy of discarding exams did not violate section 1798.18, and plaintiff had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>proffered any evidence that his exams had been destroyed in violation of EPA policy and procedures or due to the absence of such policies and procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">\u2014As to the second, third, and twelfth causes of action (alleging destruction of plaintiff\u2019s records), there was no material evidence that the Regents or its agents had destroyed any of plaintiff\u2019s records in contravention of section 1798.18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">\u2014As to the seventh and eighth causes of action (alleging failure to give plaintiff access to his personal records), it was undisputed that defendants had given plaintiff access to all of his exams except his Economics 102 exam; as to that exam, there was no material evidence that its loss resulted from violations of section 1798.18. Further, the undisputed evidence established that defendants had provided plaintiff all nonprivileged documents responsive to his October 29, 2003, inspection demand, in compliance with section 1798.34, subdivision (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u2014As to the ninth cause of action (alleging that the financial aid office maintained encrypted information in plaintiff\u2019s records), there was no material dispute that the so-called \u201cencrypted\u201d information were staff initials, the use of which did not violate section 1798.34, subdivision (c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u2014As to the tenth cause of action (alleging that defendants have refused to amend inaccurate information in plaintiff\u2019s records), there was no material evidence that plaintiff had ever identified the allegedly inaccurate records. Further, as to plaintiff\u2019s claim that his records did not reflect that he was \u201cIGETC\u201d certified and that this inaccuracy prevented his graduation from the university, there was no material evidence disputing that UCLA had recorded plaintiff\u2019s \u201cIGETC\u201d certification on May 19, 2005, or that he had graduated from UCLA effective winter quarter 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u2014As to the eleventh cause of action (alleging that defendants had prevented plaintiff from obtaining a review by the agency head), there was no material evidence that plaintiff ever established the prerequisite for a review\u2014i.e., an initial refusal by the agency to amend a record\u2014as required by section 1798.36.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The trial court entered judgment on August 17, 2006. Plaintiff filed this timely appeal from judgment on October 5, 2006 (B194314).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">C. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Tax Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">After judgment was entered, defendants filed a memorandum of costs, requesting $13,242. Plaintiff moved to tax costs on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(1) defendants were not the prevailing parties; (2) defendants\u2019 costs memorandum was unverified; and (3) defendants\u2019 costs were excessive and not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The motion to tax costs was heard on November 6, 2006. The court found that defendants failed to establish that plaintiff had requested a Farsi interpreter at his deposition, and it thus deducted interpreter\u2019s fees of $4,210. It overruled plaintiff\u2019s other objections and awarded defendants costs of $9,032. Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal from the costs award on January 2, 2007 (B196120).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">I. <em>The Trial Court Properly Granted Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The standard of review for summary judgment is well established. The motion \u201cshall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) A moving defendant has met its burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit by establishing that one or more elements of a cause of action cannot be established or that there is a complete defense. <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849-850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493]; <em>Lackner v. North </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1196 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 863].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">We independently review an order granting summary judgment, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>(Saelzler </em>v. <em>Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 768 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143]; <em>Lackner </em>v. <em>North, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1196.) To perform our independent review of the evidence, \u201cwe apply the same three-step analysis as the trial court. First, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings. Next, we determine whether the moving party has established facts justifying judgment in its favor. Finally, if the moving party has carried its initial burden, we decide whether the opposing party has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material fact issue.\u201d <em>(Chavez v. Carpenter </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1438 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 534].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">\u201c \u2018If, in deciding this appeal, we find there is no issue of material fact, we affirm the summary judgment if it is correct on any legal ground applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>this case, whether that ground was the legal theory adopted by the trial court or not, and whether it was raised by defendant in the trial court or first addressed on appeal. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Medill v. Westport Ins. Corp. </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 819, 827-828 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 570]; see also <em>WRI Opportunity Loans II, LLC </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 541, fn. 12 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 205] [\u201cabsent a triable issue of material fact, we may affirm the grant of summary judgment \u2018if it is correct on any theory of law applicable to the case, including but not limited to the theory adopted by the trial court\u2019 \u201d].) However, before affirming on a ground not relied on by the trial court, we must afford the parties an opportunity to present their views by submitting supplemental briefs. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (m)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">B. <em>The Information Practices Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As noted above, each of plaintiff\u2019s 12 causes of action alleged a violation of the IPA. \u201c \u2018The Information Practices Act, enacted in 1977, generally imposes limitations on the right of governmental agencies to disclose personal information about an individual. <em>(Anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1072, 1078-1079 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 597]; <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>McClatchy Newspapers </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 509, 514, fn. 2 [223 Cal.Rptr. 58].) \u201cThe statute was designed by the Legislature to prevent misuse of the increasing amount of information about citizens which government agencies amass in the course of their multifarious activities, the disclosure of which could be embarrassing or otherwise prejudicial to individuals or organizations.\u201d <em>(Anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at p. 1079.)\u2019 <em>(Jennifer M. v. Redwood Women\u2019s Health Center </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 81, 87-88 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 544].)\u201d <em>(Bates v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 367, 373 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 285].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u201c\u2018Under the Act, state agencies are required to limit the collection and retention of personal information to that necessary to accomplish the agency\u2019s specific purpose (\u00a7 1798.14). If an agency maintains such a record (\u00a7 1798.32), individuals must be informed when they request it.\u2019 <em>(Perkey v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 185, 193 [228 Cal.Rptr. 169, 721 P.2d 50].)\u201d <em>(Bates </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>124 Cal.App.4th at p. 373.) Further, agencies must maintain records as accurately and completely as possible (\u00a7 1798.18) and, if asked to correct a record, an agency must either timely do so or advise the individual making the request why it will not do so (\u00a7 1798.35).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>There is a private right of action for violations of the IPA under some circumstances. Specifically, pursuant to section 1798.45 of the Act, an individual may bring a civil action if an agency does any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201c(a) Refuses to comply with an individual\u2019s lawful request to inspect pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1798.34.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201c(b) Fails to maintain any record concerning any individual with such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications, character, rights, opportunities of, or benefits to the individual that may be made on the basis of such record, if, as a proximate result of such failure, a determination is made which is adverse to the individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c(c) Fails to comply with any other provision of this chapter, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.\u201d (\u00a7 1798.45, subds. (a)-(c).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">We address each of plaintiff\u2019s alleged IPA violations below.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">C. <em>Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Adjudication of Plaintiff\u2019s Claims That the University Failed to Safeguard the Privacy of Student Exams and to Allow Plaintiff to Inspect and Copy His Exams (First, Third, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Twelfth Causes of Action)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s first, third, fifth, seventh, eighth, and twelfth causes of action allege violations of the IPA arising out of defendants\u2019 alleged handling of his and other students\u2019 midterm and final exams. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that defendants failed to maintain his exams as the statute requires (first cause of action), failed to safeguard the privacy of student exams (third cause of action), failed to promulgate appropriate guidelines concerning the release of student exams (fifth cause of action), refused to allow plaintiff to inspect and copy some of his midterm and final exams (seventh and eighth causes of action), and destroyed some of plaintiff\u2019s exams after he asked to inspect them (twelfth cause of action).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The trial court summarily adjudicated these causes of action because, among other things, it concluded there was no evidence that plaintiff had suffered any damages as a result. Having thus resolved the motion, the trial court did not address what we believe is a logically prior question: Whether exams are subject to the IPA at all.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we conclude that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">1. <em>The IPA Applies Only to \u201cRecords\u201d Containing \u201cPersonal Information \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The IPA\u2019s scope, while broad, does not encompass all documents or information handled or maintained by government agencies. Rather, by its terms, the IPA governs the maintenance and disclosure of agency-maintained \u201crecords\u201d containing \u201cpersonal information.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cRecords\u201d are defined as \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>file or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency by reference to an identifying particular such as the individual\u2019s name, photograph, finger or voice print, or a number or symbol assigned to the individual.\u201d (\u00a7 1798.3, subd. (g).) <em>\u201cPersonal </em>information\u201d is defined as \u201cany information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history. It includes statements made by, or attributed to, the individual.\u201d (\u00a7 1798.3, subd. (a).) Student exams therefore are subject to the IPA only if they are \u201crecords\u201d containing \u201cpersonal information\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">2. <em>Plaintiffs Exams Are Not \u201cRecords\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">To our knowledge, no court has construed the term \u201crecords\u201d in the context of the IPA. However, in <em>Owasso Independent School Dist. No. I-011 v. Falvo </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 426 [151 L.Ed.2d 896, 122 S.Ct. 934] <em>(Falvo), </em>the United States Supreme Court construed \u201ceducational] records\u201d as used in an analogous federal statute, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 United States Code section 1232g. Under FERPA, \u201ceducation[al] records\u201d are \u201cthose records, files, documents, and other materials which ...[][] (i) contain information directly related to a student; and [][] (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\u201d (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The issue before the court in <em>Falvo </em>was whether \u201cpeer grading\u201d (allowing students to score each other\u2019s tests, papers, or assignments) violated FERPA\u2019s privacy provisions. The plaintiff was the mother of three children enrolled in the defendant school district. Plaintiff claimed that peer grading embarrassed her children and violated FERPA\u2019s privacy provisions. <em>(Falvo, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 429-430.) The district court found that peer-graded exams were not \u201ceducational] records\u201d subject to FERPA, and it thus granted summary judgment for defendants. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that peer-graded exams were \u201ceducation records\u201d and so the very act of grading was an impermissible release of confidential information to the student graders. (534 U.S. at pp. 429-430.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The Supreme Court reinstated the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, finding no violation of FERPA as a matter of law. It noted that under FERPA, an educational record is one <em>\u201cmaintained by an educational agency or institution </em>or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\u201d (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A), italics added.) Peer-graded assignments, the court said, are not so \u201cmaintained.\u201d It explained: \u201cThe ordinary meaning of the word \u2018maintain\u2019 is \u2018to keep in existence or continuance; preserve; retain.\u2019 Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1160 (2d ed. 1987). Even assuming the teacher\u2019s grade book is an education record\u2014a point the parties contest and one we do not decide here\u2014the score on a student-graded assignment is not \u2018contained therein,\u2019 \u00a7 1232g(b)(l), until the teacher records it. The teacher does not maintain the grade while students correct their peers\u2019 assignments or call out their own marks. Nor do the student graders maintain the grades within the meaning of \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A). The word \u2018maintain\u2019 suggests FERPA records will be kept in a filing cabinet in a records room at the school or on a permanent secure database, perhaps even after the student is no longer enrolled. The student graders only handle assignments for a few moments as the teacher calls out the answers. It is fanciful to say they maintain the papers in the same way the registrar maintains a student\u2019s folder in a permanent file.\u201d <em>(Falvo, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 432-433.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Further, the court noted that FERPA requires \u201c \u2018a record\u2019 \u201d of access for each pupil, which must be kept \u201c \u2018with the education records.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Falvo, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 434.) \u201cThis suggests Congress contemplated that education records would be kept in one place with a single record of access. By describing a \u2018school official\u2019 and \u2018his assistants\u2019 as the personnel responsible for the custody of the records, FERPA implies that education records are institutional records kept by a single central custodian, such as a registrar, not individual assignments handled by many student graders in their separate classrooms.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 434-435.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Finally, the court noted that FERPA requires educational institutions that receive federal funds to provide parents with a hearing at which they may contest the accuracy of their child\u2019s education records. (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(2).) The hearings must be conducted \u201cin accordance with regulations of the Secretary\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>which in turn require adjudication by a disinterested official and the opportunity for parents to be represented by an attorney. (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.22 (2001).) The court found it \u201cdoubtful\u201d that Congress \u201cwould have provided parents with this elaborate procedural machinery to challenge the accuracy of the grade on every spelling test and art project the child completes.\u201d <em>(Falvo, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 435; see also <em>BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 742, 754 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 519] [Pupil record \u201cis one that \u2018directly relates\u2019 to a student and is \u2018maintained\u2019 by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the school. We agree with the Supreme Court that the statute was directed at institutional records maintained in the normal course of business by a single, central custodian of the school. Typical of such records would be registration forms, class schedules, grade transcripts, discipline reports, and the like.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Falvo </em>is instructive here. Like FERPA, the IPA defines a \u201crecord\u201d as a \u201cfile\u201d that is \u201cmaintained\u201d by an \u201cagency.\u201d (\u00a7 1798.3, subd. (g).) Under both statutes, thus, a file must be \u201cmaintained\u201d to be a \u201crecord\u201d entitled to privacy protection. We agree with the Supreme Court that the ordinary meaning of \u201cmaintain\u201d is \u201cto keep in existence or continuance; preserve.\u201d (Random House Webster\u2019s College Diet. (1992) p. 819; see also Merriam-Webster Online (2008) &lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com&gt; [as of Dec. 19, 2008] [\u201cto keep in an existing state\u201d].) We thus conclude that, like FERPA, the IPA applies only to institutional records that are preserved in the ordinary course of business by a single, central custodian. In a university context, registration forms and transcripts would be typical of such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In the present case, it is undisputed that student exams are not stored or maintained by the University in a central location. Instead, pursuant to the University\u2019s written academic policies, exams are either returned to the student or held by the individual instructor until the end of the next succeeding regular term of instruction. Under no circumstances are they \u201cmaintained\u201d by the University. They therefore are not \u201crecords\u201d within the meaning of section 1798.3, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Other provisions of the IPA reinforce our conclusion that student exams are not \u201crecords\u201d subject to the IPA. Pursuant to section 1798.35, each agency shall \u201cpermit an individual to request in writing an amendment of a record\u201d and shall, within 30 days of the date of receipt of such request, either to \u201c[m]ake each correction in accordance with the individual\u2019s request of any portion of a record which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete,\u201d or \u201c[ijnform the individual of its refusal to amend the record in accordance with such individual\u2019s request, the reason for the refusal, the procedures established by the agency for the individual to request a review by the head of the agency . . . , and the name, title, and business address of the reviewing official.\u201d If student exams are \u201crecords\u201d under the IPA, then section 1798.35 gives students the right to request \u201camendment\u201d of their exam answers after the exams are completed. Further, it requires universities either to \u201c[m]ake each correction in accordance with the [student\u2019s] request\u201d or to \u201c[i]nform the [student] of its refusal\u201d to do so. Finally, if student exams are \u201crecords\u201d under the IPA, then section 1798.35 gives students the right to appeal exam-related decisions to the \u201chead of the agency\u201d\u2014i.e., the university\u2019s dean or chancellor. We find it unlikely that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Legislature intended, through the vehicle of the IPA, to permit students to \u201camend\u201d their midterm and final exams after those exams have been completed and graded or to require university heads to adjudicate exam disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that student exams are not \u201crecords\u201d within the meaning of the IPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">3. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Exams Do Not Contain \u201cPersonal Information\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">As we have indicated, the IPA applies to \u201crecords\u201d containing \u201cpersonal information.\u201d \u201cPersonal information\u201d is \u201cany information that is maintained by an agency that <em>identifies or describes an individual, </em>including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history,\u201d as well as \u201cstatements made by, or attributed to, the individual.\u201d (\u00a7 1798.3, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">No reported decision has construed the term \u201cpersonal information\u201d as used in the IPA, and thus we again reason by analogy to federal statute. Pursuant to the federal Privacy Act (Privacy Act), 5 United States Code section \u00a7 552a, \u201c[n]o agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains . . . .\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b).) A \u201crecord\u201d is \u201cany item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(a)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In <em>Tobey v. N.L.R.B. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1994) 309 U.S. App.D.C. 213 [40 F.3d 469], the Court of Appeals considered when an item or collection of information is \u201cabout an individual\u201d within the meaning of the Privacy Act. There, the plaintiff worked as a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) field officer. The NLRB used a computer system to track unfair labor practices case data, including case names, allegations made, dates of significant events, and the initials or identifying number of the field examiner assigned to the case. (40 F.3d at p. 470.) When the plaintiff filed a grievance with the NLRB, his supervisor used the computer system to conduct a search of the cases assigned to plaintiff over the prior several years. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 471.) Plaintiff then sued under the Privacy Act, contending that the NLRB had, without proper notice, maintained and used a system of records (the computer system) to retrieve personal information about him and had disclosed that information to others. (40 F.3d at p. 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The district court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s suit, concluding that the data retrieved were not \u201crecords\u201d within the meaning of the Privacy Act. <em>(Tobey </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>40 F.3d at p. 471.) The court of appeals affirmed. It noted that to be a record, information must be \u201cabout\u201d an individual. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The NLRB\u2019s computer system, however, did not contain information \u201cabout\u201d individuals\u2014instead, it contained information \u201c \u2018about\u2019 NLRB cases, such as the case name, the allegations made, the number of private-sector employees involved and the date of settlement, hearing, dismissal or closing of the case.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cAdmittedly, the system also includes the number and initials of the field examiner assigned to the case. But this no more means the information is \u2018about\u2019 the individual than it means the information is \u2018about\u2019 the date on which the case settled.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the court concluded, the NLRB\u2019s computer system was not a system of records \u201cabout\u201d the plaintiff. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 472-473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The court reached a similar result in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>National Institutes of Health </em>(D.D.C. 1996) 934 F.Supp. 464. There, the plaintiff was a physician whose articles appeared in numerous biomedical journals. Defendants were several national health organizations that maintained computer databases containing information about the articles published in such journals. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 467.) Each file in the defendants\u2019 database provided bibliographic information about an article, including the article\u2019s title, the name of the publication in which the article appeared, the name of the article\u2019s author, and a summary or abstract of the article. After a colleague of plaintiff\u2019s was placed under investigation for altering patient files, defendants annotated summaries of articles incorporating suspect patient data, including plaintiff\u2019s, with the phrase \u201c \u2018[scientific misconduct-\u2014data to be reanalyzed].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Plaintiff sued defendants for Privacy Act violations, asserting that the database files contained information \u201cabout\u201d him, and thus were records for purposes of the Privacy Act, because (1) \u201c \u2018nothing tells more \u201cabout\u201d a research scientist . . . than his scientific publications, speeches and the like,\u2019 [citation], and (2) the database files . . . contain both [plaintiff\u2019s] name and address.\u201d <em>(Fisher v. National Institutes of Health, supra, </em>934 F.Supp. at p. 469.) The district court disagreed and granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. It explained: \u201cThe court concludes that the database files are \u2018about\u2019 the articles and not Dr. Fisher or the other authors listed. The names of the authors and the annotations are part of the overall information on the articles. The fact that a reader of the abstracts could glean some insight into the type of work Dr. Fisher does by the type of articles he authors or co-authors is not sufficient to make the database files records under the Privacy Act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 470.) Further, the court said, the inclusion of plaintiff\u2019s name did not transform the database files into records. \u201cThis circuit has held that the fact that a file or document contains an individual\u2019s name is not sufficient to qualify the information as a record. [Citation.] Implicit in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>detennination is that the information must provide information <em>concerning or describing the named individual </em>for the information to be considered a record.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 471, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The court concluded similarly in <em>Unt v. Aerospace Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 765 F.2d 1440, holding that the defendant did not violate the Privacy Act by releasing a letter that the plaintiff wrote to a government agency about his employer, a government contractor. The court explained: \u201cA \u2018record\u2019 is defined under [title 5 United States Code section] 552a(a)(4) as ... [f] \u2018. . . any item, collection, or grouping of information <em>about an individual </em>that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.\u2019 [f] .. .[][].. . Consequently, for appellant\u2019s letter to be subject to restrictive disclosure, it must reflect some quality or characteristic about him. [Citation.] The letter, however, is not about Unt. Rather, it is clearly about Aerospace, a private corporation, and not an individual within the meaning of the statute. The letter reflects directly on the performance by Aerospace of its contract with the government, and only indirectly on any quality or characteristic possessed by appellant. While Unt\u2019s letter mentions his difficulties with Aerospace management, this fact does not change the communication into an item about him. The subject is Aerospace and was \u2018about\u2019 Aerospace.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1448-1449.) Thus, because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that his letter was a \u201crecord,\u201d the court concluded that the district court was correct in dismissing his Privacy Act claims. (765 F.2d at p. 1449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We find the analyses of these courts instructive here. Admittedly, the Privacy Act\u2019s definition of \u201crecord\u201d is not precisely the same as the IPA\u2019s definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d: The Privacy Act protects \u201crecords,\u201d defined as \u201cany item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency,\u201d while the IPA protects \u201cpersonal information,\u201d defined as \u201cany information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual.\u201d Significantly, however, both statutes require a relationship between the individual seeking the statute\u2019s protection and the information protected by the statute. That is, the IPA protects information that \u201cidentifies\u201d or \u201cdescribes an individual,\u201d while the Privacy Act protects information \u201cabout an individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">For the reasons discussed in the federal cases, we reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that his exams contain \u201cpersonal information\u201d within the meaning of the IPA. Although plaintiff\u2019s exam answers were authored by him, they do not \u201cidentif[y]\u201d or \u201cdescribe[]\u201d him. (\u00a7 1798.3, subd. (a).) Rather, they discuss and analyze the issues that are the subjects of the exams. As the court said in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Fisher, </em>the fact that a reader could \u201cglean some insight into the type of work [plaintiff] does\u201d by the quality of his exam answers is not sufficient to convert his exam answers into \u201cpersonal information\u201d under the IPA. (See <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>National Institutes of Health, supra, </em>934 F.Supp. at p. 470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We also reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that his exams contain \u201cpersonal information\u201d because they contain his name or student identification number. As <em>Fisher </em>suggests, an individual\u2019s name constitutes \u201cpersonal information\u201d only when it is linked to information that \u201cidentifies or describes\u201d the individual. For example, a record containing both an individual\u2019s name <em>and </em>his or her Social Security number contains \u201cpersonal information\u201d because it reveals the Social Security number assigned to that individual. In contrast, a record that contains only the individual\u2019s name, without any other identifying or descriptive information, is not \u201cpersonal information\u201d within the meaning of the IPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that student exams are not \u201crecords\u201d containing \u201cpersonal information\u201d within the meaning of the IPA. The trial court thus properly granted summary adjudication of the first, third, fifth, seventh, eighth, and twelfth causes of action of the second amended complaint.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">D., E.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">II., III.*</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The judgment and award of costs are affirmed.

(2) Do the documents sought by plaintiff constitute \u201crecords\u201d as defined by section 1798.3, subdivision (g)? (3) Are the documents sought by plaintiff \u201cmaintained\u201d by defendants within the meaning of section 1798.3, subdivision (e)? (4) What is the impact, if any, of section 1798.74 on the present case?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\"> E.g., section 1798.14 (\u201cEach agency shall maintain in its records only personal information which is relevant and necessary . ..\u201d), section 1798.19 (\u201cEach agency when it provides by contract for the operation or maintenance of records containing personal information to accomplish an agency function, shall cause ... the requirements of this chapter to be applied to those records.\u201d), section 1798.20 (each agency shall establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the disclosure or maintenance of \u201crecords containing personal information\u201d), section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>1798.28 (\u201cEach agency . . . shall inform any person or agency to whom a record containing personal information has been disclosed during the preceding three years of any correction of an error or notation of dispute . . .\u201d), section 1798.34 (agencies shall permit individuals to inspect \u201call the personal information in any record containing personal information\u201d and to have a copy made of \u201call the personal information in the record\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> We note that section 1798.74, entitled \u201cStudent Records,\u201d provides: \u201cThe provisions of Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 67110) of Part 40 of the Education Code shall, with regard to student records, prevail over the provisions of this chapter.\u201d The referenced chapter of the Education Code formerly addressed confidentiality of student records, but was repealed in 1995. (Stats. 1995, ch. 758, \u00a7 50, p. 5673.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The reference in section 1798.74 to the Education Code suggests to us that when the Legislature passed the IPA in 1977, it may have intended explicitly to exempt some educational records, including student exams, from the protections afforded by the IPA. However, in view of our determination that student exams are not \u201crecords\u201d containing \u201cpersonal information,\u201d we need not reach this issue. (Cf. <em>Lachtman v. Regents of University of California </em>(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 187, 212 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 147] [rejecting university\u2019s contention that student records are exempt from the IPA pursuant to \u00a7 1798.74].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 466.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
