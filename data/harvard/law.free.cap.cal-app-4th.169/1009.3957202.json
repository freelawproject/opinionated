J.</author>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Suze Adams appeals from a sentence of life without possibility of parole for the premeditated murder of Kristina Soult by means of arson. She contends that the trial court erred in admitting certain statements that she made when she took a polygraph examination. She also contends that her convictions for attempted premeditated murders of three other people who were at the site of the arson fire should be vacated because she did not know that they were present. Finally, she contends that the trial court erred in ordering direct restitution to the Turlock Fire Department. In the published portion of this opinion, we reject Adams\u2019s contention that her attempted murder convictions should be vacated. In the nonpublished portion of the opinion, we reject her contention that her confession should not be admitted but we agree that direct restitution to the Turlock Fire Department was erroneous. Thus, we will remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">On August 31, 2006, Adams was charged in a six-count information with committing five crimes on or about June 18, 2004, as follows: count 1, the murder of Kristina Soult (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187), with an allegation that the crime was premeditated and a special circumstance allegation that it was committed while Adams was engaged in the commission of arson (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(1)); count 2, arson of an inhabited structure or property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 451, subd. (b)); and counts 3, 4, and 5, the attempted murders (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187) of Joseph Lopes, J.V., and Andrea Marr, respectively, with allegations that the crimes were premeditated. Adams was charged in count 6 with committing an additional arson of an inhabited structure or property on or about March 25, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">On September 19, 2006, Adams pled not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">On February 1, 2007, Adams filed a motion to exclude statements that she gave on August 4, 2004, while taking a polygraph examination. On April 4, 2007, the prosecutor filed an opposition to the motion. On April 6, 2007, the court conducted an Evidence Code section 402 hearing, heard argument, and denied the motion. On May 14, 2007, the court revised its ruling and excluded Adams\u2019s statements regarding \u201ccertain evidence of controlled substances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>On May 14, 2007, Adams withdrew her plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. On May 29, 2007, a jury found Adams guilty as charged in all six counts, found the murder and attempted murders to have been premeditated, and found the special circumstance allegation to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">On July 10, 2007, the court sentenced Adams to state prison on count 1 and the special circumstance for life without possibility of parole. The court imposed a middle term of five years for both count 2 and count 6, but stayed punishment of count 2, sentenced Adams for counts 3, 4, and 5 to life with the possibility of parole, ordering those counts to run concurrent with each other but consecutive to count 6, and ordered Adams to pay direct restitution to the Turlock Fire Department in the amount of $9,309.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">On July 17, 2007, Adams filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">\n<em>Prosecutor\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\"><em>A. </em>The Fires</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">On March 25, 2004, Jerry McDaniel, the fire marshal for the City of Turlock, was dispatched to the scene of a fire. The fire was already out, and McDaniel spoke with the fireman in charge, Captain Becker. McDaniel and Becker determined that the fire originated from the wooden front porch of the house and extended \u201cup and out\u201d in a classic \u201cV-pattem,\u201d charring the front porch and front wall of the house. McDaniel originally concluded that the cause of this fire was \u201cundetermined\u201d because \u201ccigarette butts in the area\u201d could have accidentally ignited the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">On June 18, 2004, McDaniel was dispatched to the same house, again meeting with Becker, who related that a young man at the scene had advised that his mother was still inside the home. McDaniel did a \u201cbrief walk around\u201d and \u201cclearly\u201d saw \u201cthere were two separate fires set\u201d at the house, one at the backdoor and one on the front porch. Both fires grew \u201cup and out,\u201d extending into the house until intersecting, consuming much of the house and causing the front porch, the roof, and \u201call the floorboards\u201d in the house to collapse. The reason that the second fire was \u201cmuch more intense\u201d than the first was a heavier \u201cfuel content\u201d or \u201cfuel package\u201d on the front porch, in that a large stuffed chair or recliner caught fire. The fire at the backdoor started where \u201c[i]gnitable fluid was poured.\u201d The body of the young man\u2019s mother was found in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">Found in some trash cans in the area were two \u201cone gallon Ziplock seal-a-meal type bags\u201d containing what looked like pine needles. The bags <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>emitted an \u201codor of a cleaning fluid or paint thinner.\u201d Samples of the contents of these bags were sent to the Department of Justice for analysis, and the samples were determined to be \u201crosemary and alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">McDaniel concluded that both the March 25 and June 18 fires were the result of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">B. The Victims and the Suspect</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Witness interviews showed that the deceased female, Kristina Soult, was in the home at the time both fires were started. Present at the time of the first fire were Soult, Joseph Lopes, and Lopes\u2019s girlfriend. They managed to escape through the back door of the house. Present for the second fire were Lopes, Andrea Marr, who was Soult\u2019s friend, and J.V, who was Soult\u2019s grandson and Lopes\u2019s nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">During the second fire, Lopes stated that he was asleep on a couch when he was awakened \u201cby heat and light coming through the front window.\u201d He got up, woke up everyone else in the house, and tried to get them out. He last saw his mother in the hallway, when she handed J.V. to Andrea. He, Andrea, and J.V. exited the house through the backdoor, which was \u201calready hot to the touch.\u201d Upon opening the door, the \u201cfire rolled in on the floor making it difficult to get out.\u201d After exiting the house, he realized his mother was still inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Turlock Police Detective Morgan attended Soult\u2019s autopsy on June 18, 2004. Later that day, he got an anonymous telephone call from a woman subsequently determined to be the wife of David Jaen. The next day, he got an anonymous telephone call from a man who was subsequently determined to be Jaen. He met with Jaen and, as a result, came to consider Adams a suspect in Soult\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">Both Jaen and Adams were cooks who worked at the same restaurant in Turlock. Jaen also had worked with Soult around 2002 or 2003, in another restaurant. According to Jaen, Adams never told him that she was scared of Soult. Shortly after the first fire at Soult\u2019s house, Jaen learned about it from Soult\u2019s son, Joseph Lopes. He mentioned to Adams that someone had tried to bum Soult\u2019s home, and she responded that the \u201c[s]econd time around she\u2019ll do better.\u201d About a week before the second fire, Soult came into the restaurant and ate, which made Adams \u201cfurious.\u201d After the second fire, Jaen immediately suspected Adams because of her statements about the first fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Detective Morgan determined that the distance between Adams\u2019s and Soult\u2019s homes was about \u201ca mile and a half.\u201d On June 20, 2004, he searched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Adams\u2019s residence pursuant to a search warrant and found \u201cnumerous rosemary needles throughout\u201d the home. He interviewed Adams on June 20, 2004. Adams told him that Soult had phoned her repeatedly and followed her, but she denied being afraid of Soult, who she thought might have been mentally ill. She admitted that her boyfriend, Fortino Godoy, still had contact with Soult before Soult died and that \u201cshe didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">On June 21, 2004, Detective Morgan searched the dumpster next to Adams\u2019s apartment and found a \u201cbundle of branches of rosemary, . . . wrapped with a piece of twine or cord.\u201d He later learned that Adams had picked up her paycheck, and that she had left that day for Tijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">On July 2, 2004, Detective Morgan again interviewed Adams who indicated that she had just returned from Tijuana. He saw that she had put her hair in a \u201cbob\u201d and bleached it blond.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">C. The Polygraph Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">On August 4, 2004, Jeannie Brandon, a polygraph examiner with the California Department of Justice, conducted a voluntary and videotaped polygraph examination of Adams. A DVD of the interview was played for the jury, which was also provided with copies of the transcript of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">According to the transcript, Brandon advised Adams at the outset of her \u201cconstitutional rights,\u201d obtained Adams\u2019s agreement to waive those rights, and informed Adams that she could change her mind and terminate the polygraph exam at any time. Brandon informed Adams that the polygraph exam was being given in conjunction with the investigation into the death of Soult. Brandon warned Adams that it was not wise to try to lie and beat the polygraph. Brandon stated that although the case was classified as a homicide, it was possible that whoever started the fire did not intend to kill Soult, but intended only to scare her.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">Adams told Brandon that she did not know Soult that well and was acquainted with her only because Soult had previously dated her boyfriend, Godoy. Adams stated that Godoy had pretty much stopped seeing Soult when he started dating her, but was still seeing Soult sometimes. Adams initially denied setting a fire at Soult\u2019s home on the night of June 18, 2004, and denied knowing who did. When asked if she suspected anyone, she mentioned Soult\u2019s youngest son\u2019s friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Brandon mentioned an earlier fire at Soult\u2019s home and stated that someone had phoned the police with a tip, suggesting that Adams had made comments that Adams had started the first fire, and that next time, she would do it more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>professionally, such as by means of a Molotov cocktail. Adams initially claimed to have no idea what this tip was about, then denied making any comment about a Molotov cocktail, then claimed that all she said was that \u201cif\u2019 she was to do it, she would do it right. Adams claimed that she was merely joking or bragging.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Brandon suggested that \u201ctwo sets\u201d of \u201cpretty good\u201d fingerprints had been left at the crime scene, and Adams denied they were hers. Adams stated that she did not know who killed Soult or why, but expressed doubt that Soult\u2019s death was intended. Adams related that Soult did not take it well when Godoy broke up with her, stating that Soult \u201cused to call my house and threaten me all the time.\u201d Adams claimed that she would \u201csimply hang up.\u201d Soult \u201csometimes\u201d phoned Adams on a daily basis, and the most recent call was about a week before Soult\u2019s death. Adams \u201cshould have\u201d called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Adams told Brandon that she was afraid of Soult. Soult had followed her home from work in a car and had called her \u201cSusie Q.\u201d Soult also had followed her to work when Adams was being driven by Godoy. Soult even had come to Adams\u2019s workplace a few times, most recently on the Monday before the fatal fire, but did not say anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Adams initially claimed to have worked on the night of June 17, 2005. Godoy had picked her up from work and they watched a movie at her apartment, then went to sleep together, getting up the next morning at around 9:00 or 9:30 a.m. They heard about the fire and Soulf s death when \u201c[s]ome guy that walks around and collects cans\u201d told Godoy about it that morning. After learning about Soulf s death, Adams stated that she never went back to her job, and instead decided to go on vacation to \u201cSan Diego and Tijuana\u201d with a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">After Brandon gave Adams the polygraph exam, Brandon informed Adams that \u201cdeception\u201d was \u201cindicated,\u201d meaning that Adams was \u201cnot telling the truth about this fire over there.\u201d Brandon again suggested that the fire could have been set by a person who \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and \u201cacted without thinking,\u201d as opposed to a person who did it to \u201churt people.\u201d Brandon suggested that Soult \u201cwas being a bully\u201d and \u201cmay have been asking for this.\u201d Brandon suggested that Soult \u201cpushed\u201d Adams to the point that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d and opined that Adams had not \u201cmeant for this to happen ... for her to die,\u201d and then asked, \u201cDid you?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Brandon asked, \u201cWhat. . . happened?\u201d Adams ultimately responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like you said. It got out of control.\u201d Adams explained that she did not \u201cdo it\u201d just so that she could have Godoy, agreeing with Brandon that she did \u201cit\u201d because Soult \u201cwas being a bitch\u201d and driving her \u201cnuts.\u201d She finally \u201csnapped\u201d when Soult phoned her and called her \u201ca ugly fucking bitch and stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>Adams related that she went to Soult\u2019s house by herself, denying that Godoy was involved. Soult\u2019s home was not dark, and Adams did not know if the occupants of the home were asleep. She \u201ctook Rosemary and dried it and soaked it in rubbing alcohol for over a week, if not more,\u201d which made it \u201cvery flammable.\u201d She then put it on a chair on the front porch of the house and \u201clit it on fire\u201d with a match. She then went to the back of the home and did \u201c[t]he same thing,\u201d scattering the flammable material, which was in a plastic bag, around the backdoor and setting it on fire with a match. She walked to and from Soult\u2019s home. When she got back to her own home, Godoy was still asleep, as \u201che sleeps pretty heavy.\u201d She claimed that she did not mean to kill Soult and considered it to be a case of \u201ctemporary insanity\u201d because Soult, who was \u201cpsycho,\u201d was driving her nuts and causing her to fear for her own life. She felt \u201chorrible\u201d when she learned the next morning that Soult was dead, and took off to Mexico because she was \u201cscared.\u201d She admitted starting the first fire on the front porch at Soult\u2019s home in March of 2004, stating that she also used rosemary \u201c[s]oaked in rubbing alcohol\u201d on that occasion. During the fatal fire, she \u201cdid the back first\u201d and \u201cthen the front.\u201d It was about 3:30 a.m. on Friday morning, and the lights and TV were on inside the home. She threw over a fence two plastic bags that she used to carry the flammable liquid. She walked from her home to Soult\u2019s home along the railroad tracks that ran through town. Although she lit the fires at both the front and back of the house, she thought the occupants could still get out through a window.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Detective Morgan was watching the polygraph examination on closed-circuit television. He entered to speak with Adams. He questioned her about: (1) the rosemary soaked in alcohol; (2) her route to Soult\u2019s house; (3) Godoy\u2019s lack of awareness of her act; (4) the order in which the two fires had been set; and (5) whether she had encountered anyone. As for why this had occurred, Adams stated that Soult had been calling her for more than two years, and that it had \u201calways been bad. Extremely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">\n<em>Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Detective Morgan interviewed Soult\u2019s son, Lopes, on June 18, 2004. Lopes stated that his mother would sometimes phone and threaten Adams, saying things like \u201cSusie Q, do you want to come out and play with me?\u201d He said that the two women were supposed to meet at a park \u201cto fight,\u201d but Adams did not show up. He stated that, two days earlier, his mother had bragged that she had followed Adams and Godoy to Adams\u2019s job. He said that the last time he saw Godoy at his mother\u2019s house was three weeks earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Detective Morgan also interviewed Glenda Olesen, a friend of Soult\u2019s. Olesen said that Soult had told her that Soult, (1) had called Adams to tease and threaten her, and (2) had followed Adams and Godoy to Adams\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>A custodian of record for Soult\u2019s cellular telephone company testified that the call detail records indicated that Soult had made two telephone calls to Adams from the cellular telephone in May of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Adams testified on her own behalf. She stated that she had first met Godoy around 1999, when they were both working at the same restaurant in Turlock. They became romantically involved about four or five months later and remained involved for four or five years. When they first became romantically involved, Godoy was still living with Soult, but he told her that he and Soult were no longer romantically involved and were just friends. Soult made many threatening phone calls to Adams during those four or five years that Adams dated Godoy. It was \u201cvery unusual\u201d if Adams did not get such a call \u201cfor a couple of weeks.\u201d Soult usually left messages, but Adams would sometimes answer and hang up. Soult also came to the restaurant where Adams worked as a cook and made comments to the waitresses like, \u201cI don\u2019t want that bitch cooking my food.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Adams described an incident where she was walking home from work when Soult pulled up in the passenger seat of a car and said, \u201cHey Susie Q., I\u2019m going to kick your ass, and I\u2019m going to make it so bad that Fortino will never be able to be with you again.\u201d Adams went into a park, hoping to \u201cescape that way,\u201d but Soult tried to head her off, so she took another route to her apartment. When she finally got to her home, Soult was waiting for her, so she had to hide for 20 to 30 minutes until Soult finally left. This incident occurred about two months before the first fire and made Adams scared for her life. She did not call the police because she thought that it would \u201cagitate the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Adams claimed that, \u201c[f]or a long time,\u201d she had kept the jar of rosemary needles that the police seized from her apartment \u201cfor seasoning and cooking.\u201d She soaked rosemary needles in alcohol so that she could use it to \u201cstart the fire\u201d in her hibachi, which was on the patio, and she also used rosemary needles in her \u201cbath water\u201d with other herbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">Adams thought that starting the first fire would make Soult stop harassing her. She took rosemary with her because she \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything else.\u201d The decision to start the first fire was made on a \u201c[sjpur of the moment.\u201d However, according to Adams, Soult\u2019s behavior \u201cseemed to get worse\u201d after the first fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">A few days before the second fire, Soult came to Adams\u2019s apartment and followed her to work. The next day, Soult came to the restaurant, spoke with Ja\u00e9n, and then left. Jaen told Adams that Soult said she wanted to beat up Adams. On the day before the fire, Soult again followed Adams to work. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>evening, Soult called and threatened Adams. Soult \u201cseemed out of control. Her voice was nightmarish and erratic . . . .\u201d Soult phoned three more times; Adams hung up the phone twice and let the answering machine take the last call, shortly before midnight. Adams and Godoy went to bed, but Adams could not fall asleep. Because of her fear of and anger toward Soult, Adams concluded that she had to do something to protect herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Adams decided to start another fire. She got out of bed, put some rosemary soaked in alcohol into little plastic bags, and walked over to Soult\u2019s house. She put some of the rosemary on the back and front porch and lit it, and walked home. While walking home, she heard sirens and thought, \u201cgood, the fire department is coming and everything will be alright\u201d because they would \u201cput out the fire.\u201d She was \u201cpretty sure\u201d when setting the fire that Soult was home because Soult\u2019s car was there, but she had no information about anyone else being there.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">According to Adams, when she gave her initial statement to Detective Morgan, she downplayed her problems with Soult because she thought that it would make her \u201clook more guilty or suspicious.\u201d Later, she went to Mexico with a friend for a week and came back and \u201ctook the polygraph,\u201d as shown by the DVD that was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Adams asserted that the comments that the polygraph examiner made to her, suggesting \u201cmaybe it was an accident and somebody didn\u2019t mean to kill,\u201d led her to believe \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t, like, press such harsh charges on me, that things wouldn\u2019t be so bad for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Statements During Polygraph Examination<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Attempted Murder Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">Adams also contends that the three attempted murder convictions should be reversed because there was no finding that she had an intent to kill Lopes, Andrea Marr, or J.V. Adams contends that the jury was improperly instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>on the issue of attempted murder and \u201ckill zone\u201d under CALCRIM No. 600 that the prosecutor misstated the law in closing arguments, and that defense counsel failed to properly object.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Here, the jury was instructed on the attempted murder charges under a modified version of CALCRIM No. 600 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-6\">\u201cTo prove that the defendant is guilty of attempted murder, the People must prove that, one, the defendant took direct but ineffective steps towards killing another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-7\">\u201cAnd two, the defendant intended to kill that person. [][]... [f]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Adams does not challenge this part of the jury instruction. (See <em>People v. Lee </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 613, 623 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 402, 74 P.3d 176] [\u201cAttempted murder requires the specific intent to kill and the commission of a direct but ineffectual act toward accomplishing the intended killing.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">However, the jury was further instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-10\">\u201cA person may intend to kill a specific victim or victims, and at the same time intend to kill anyone in a particular zone of harm or kill zone. In order to convict the defendant of the attempted murder of Joseph Lopes, [J.V.], and Andrea Marr, the People must prove that defendant not only intended to kill Kristina Soult, but also intended to kill Joseph Lopes, [J.V.], and Andrea Marr, or intended to kill anyone within the kill zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-11\">\u201cIf you have a reasonable doubt whether the defendant intended to kill Joseph Lopes, [J.V.], or Andrea Marr, or intended to kill Kristina Soult by harming everyone in the kill zone, you must find the defendant not guilty of attempted murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Adams\u2019s defense counsel had argued that \u201cAdams did not know anybody lived in that house except for Kristina Soult.\u201d The prosecutor responded as follows: \u201cAnd, again, I want to bring up the point of attempted murder with a kill zone. You don\u2019t have to know about the other people there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">Adams contends that the prosecutor\u2019s argument misstated the law on attempted murder by means of a kill zone and that the latter part of CALCRIM No. 600, which is based upon the \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d theory enunciated by the California Supreme Court in <em>People v. Bland </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 313, 327-328 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d 1107] <em>(Bland), </em>is ambiguous because it does not fully state or explain the law of attempted murder since it permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>conviction on attempted murder even if Adams was not aware of the presence of the alleged attempted murder victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In <em>Bland, </em>the California Supreme Court held that the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d applies to murder but not to attempted murder. <em>(Bland, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 327.) \u201cIn its classic form, the doctrine of transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to kill one person but mistakenly kills another. The intent to kill the intended target is deemed to transfer to the unintended victim so that the defendant is guilty of murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">However, the California Supreme Court also recognized that \u201ca shooter may be convicted of multiple counts of attempted murder on a \u2018kill zone\u2019 theory where the evidence establishes that the shooter used lethal force designed and intended to kill everyone in an area around the targeted victim (i.e., the \u2018kill zone\u2019) as the means of accomplishing the killing of that victim. Under such circumstances, a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooter intended to till not only his targeted victim, but also all others he knew were in the zone of fatal harm. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 733, 745-746 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 163, 124 P.3d 730] <em>(Smith).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">In explaining the concurrent intent theory, the California Supreme Court quoted the following language: \u201c \u2018The intent is concurrent . . . when the nature and scope of the attack, while directed at a primary victim, are such that we can conclude the perpetrator intended to ensure harm to the primary victim by harming everyone in that victim\u2019s vicinity. For example, an assailant who places a bomb on a commercial airplane intending to harm a primary target on board ensures by this method of attack that all passengers will be tilled. Similarly, consider a defendant who intends to till A and, in order to ensure A\u2019s death, drives by a group consisting of A, B, and C, and attacks the group with automatic weapon fire or an explosive device devastating enough to till everyone in the group. The defendant has intentionally created a \u201ctill zone\u201d to ensure the death of his primary victim, and the trier of fact may reasonably infer from the method employed an intent to till others concurrent with the intent to till the primary victim. When the defendant escalated his mode of attack from a single bullet aimed at A\u2019s head to a hail of bullets or an explosive device, the factfinder can infer that, whether or not the defendant succeeded in tilling A, the defendant concurrently intended to till everyone in A\u2019s immediate vicinity to ensure A\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s intent need not be transferred from Ato B, because although the defendant\u2019s goal was to till A, his intent to till B was also direct; it was concurrent with his intent to till A.  Where the means employed to commit the crime against a primary victim create a zone of harm around that victim, the factfinder can reasonably infer that the defendant intended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>harm to all who are in the anticipated zone. This situation is distinct from the \u201cdepraved heart\u201d [i.e., implied malice] situation because the trier of fact may infer the actual intent to kill which is lacking in a \u201cdepraved heart\u201d [implied malice] scenario.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bland, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 329-330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">\u201cA kill zone, or concurrent intent, analysis, therefore, focuses on (1) whether the fact finder can rationally infer from the type and extent of force employed in the defendant\u2019s attack on the primary target that the defendant intentionally created a zone of fatal harm, and (2) whether the nontargeted alleged attempted murder victim inhabited that zone of harm. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 755-756 (dis. opn. of Werdegar, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">In <em>Smith, </em>the California Supreme Court held that multiple attempted murder convictions could be supported by evidence that the defendant fired a single bullet at two victims even without using a concurrent intent theory. <em>(Smith, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 746.) In <em>Bland, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that multiple attempted murder convictions could be supported under a concurrent intent theory by evidence that the defendant used means that created a zone of harm or a kill zone, such as a hail of bullets or an explosive device. <em>(Bland, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 329-330.) Thus, it is the means used that distinguishes attempted murder under a concurrent intent theory from \u201cnormal\u201d attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Where it may be concluded that a defendant has knowledge of the presence of other victims, coupled with the specific intent to kill, that has generally been sufficient to support a reasonable inference that the defendant intended to kill the attempted murder victims. Thus, in <em>Smith, </em>the California Supreme Court noted that \u201cwhere the evidence establishes that the shooter used lethal force designed and intended to kill everyone in an area around the targeted victim (i.e., the \u2018kill zone\u2019) as the means of accomplishing the killing of that victim,\u201d \u201ca rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooter intended to kill not only his targeted victim, but also <em>all others he knew were in the zone of fatal harm\u201d (Smith, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 746, italics added.) However, we do not agree with Adams\u2019s argument that the California Supreme Court\u2019s observations on the kill zone theory in <em>Smith </em>implies that knowledge of the presence of the alleged murder victims is required before a defendant can be convicted of attempted murder of those persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">First, the observations were mere dicta as the <em>Smith </em>court concluded that the attempted murder convictions in that case could be sustained without reference to the kill zone theory. (See <em>Smith, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 746.) Second, the fact that a rational jury could conclude that a defendant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>knows of the presence of the victims, which was the factual scenario in <em>Smith, </em>had the necessary express malice does not preclude a rational jury from concluding that a defendant who does not know of the presence of the victims also had the necessary express malice if the jury found that the defendant intentionally created a zone of harm and that the victims were in that zone of harm. Rather, the concurrent intent doctrine permits a rational jury to infer the required express malice from the facts that (1) the defendant targeted a primary victim by intentionally creating a zone of harm, and (2) the attempted murder victims were within that zone of harm. The concurrent intent theory recognizes that the defendant acted with the specific intent to kill anyone in the zone of harm with the objective of killing a specific person or persons. The theory imposes attempted murder liability where the defendant intentionally created a kill zone in order to ensure the defendant\u2019s primary objective of killing a specific person or persons despite the recognition, or with acceptance of the fact, that a natural and probable consequence of that act would be that anyone within that zone could or would die. Whether or not the defendant is aware that the attempted murder victims were within the zone of harm is not a defense, as long as the victims actually were within the zone of harm. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Vang </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 554, 563-565 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 704] [evidence was sufficient to support attempted murder convictions of inhabitants of residences even though defendants could not see all of their victims because defendants sprayed wall-piercing bullets at residences].)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">From the evidence, a rational jury could infer that Adams had the necessary express malice for attempted murder because: (1) Adams had the express intent to kill Soult by intentionally creating a zone of harm or kill zone, in that Adams set fires at both the front and back of the house, and (2) that Lopes, J.V., and Marr were within that zone of harm. Thus, we reject Adams\u2019s argument that her attempted murder convictions should be vacated because she was not aware of the presence of persons other than Soult at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Direct Restitution<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The convictions are affirmed.
