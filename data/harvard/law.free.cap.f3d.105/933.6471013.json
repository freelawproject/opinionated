Although a bankruptcy court certainly has the power to bar a debtor from further litigating the dischargeability of pending debts, the order at issue here is ambiguous. For this reason, we defer to the bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its own order as one limiting subsequent filings, not forever prohibiting the right to seek a discharge of existing debt, and reverse the district court\u2019s contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">On December 27, 1991, Shirley Mae Tomlin and her husband signed a retad installment contract with Colonial Auto Center, Inc. (\u201cColonial\u201d) to purchase a pickup truck. Eight months later, Colonial repossessed the truck, then sold it at public auction. The sale left a deficiency of $5,284.63. On May 28, 1993, Colonial obtained a state court judgment against Tomlin for the amount of the deficiency plus interest and court costs. Subsequently, Colonial obtained another judgment against Tomlin for $1,500.00 plus interest, arising from her failure to pay a deposit owing to Colonial. The balance remaining on these two judgments constitute the debt at issue in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">This is the sixth bankruptcy petition Tomlin has filed in the past seven years. On May 25, 1990, Tomlin and her husband filed a petition pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301-1330 (1994). On August 20, 1990, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Tomlins\u2019 Chapter 13 plan (an amended plan was confirmed on November 14,1990). On January 17,1991, Union Planters National Bank (\u201cUnion Planters\u201d) moved for relief from the stay imposed pursuant to Chapter 13. On May 3,1991, the bankruptcy court ordered the stay lifted. On July 15, 1991, the bankruptcy court granted the Tom-lins\u2019 voluntary motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-14\">On July 25, 1991, Tomlin individually filed a second Chapter 13 petition. She did not submit a confirmable plan and on September 12, 1991, Union Planters- moved for relief from the stay. On December 6, 1991, the bankruptcy court granted Tomlin\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">On April 24, 1992, Tomlin, again with her husband, filed still another Chapter 13 petition. During the pendency of this petition, the Tomlins neither attended creditors\u2019 meetings nor timely filed bankruptcy schedules. On June 22, 1992, the bankruptcy court heard the trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss and ordered the Tomlins to cure all defaults by June 26, 1992. The Tomlins failed to abide by that order. On July 6, 1992, the bankruptcy court ordered the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>On September 18, 1992, Tomlin filed a <em>pro se </em>Chapter 7 petition to stop the foreclosure sale of her residence. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-728 (1994). During the pendency of this petition, Tomlin did not pay the filing fee, did not attend the creditors\u2019 meeting, and did not file schedules. On November 13,1992, the bankruptcy court dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">On December 17,1992, Tomlin filed another <em>pro se </em>Chapter 7 petition again to stop the foreclosure sale of her residence. The next day, after Union Planters filed an emergency motion for relief from the stay, the bankruptcy court lifted the stay in an order in which it noted that it appeared that Tomlin had filed the petition in violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g) (1994). A month later, on January 21, 1993, the trustee filed a motion to dismiss Tomlin\u2019s petition \u201cwith prejudice\u201d because she had caused unreasonable delay that was prejudicial to her creditors by failing to: appear at an initial creditors\u2019 meeting, timely file her schedules, or prosecute the bankruptcy case she had filed two months before. Tomlin did not respond in any way to the trustee\u2019s motion. After a hearing, which Tomlin did not attend, on February 11,1993, the bankruptcy court issued a dismissal order, stating only that \u201c[f]or the reasons set forth\u201d in the trustee\u2019s motion, Tomlin\u2019s petition would be dismissed \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Twenty months later, on October 14,1994, Tomlin filed another Chapter 7 petition; this time she was represented by counsel. On November 15, 1994, the bankruptcy court entered an order discharging Tomlin\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Prior to that discharge order, Colonial filed the instant action to determine the dis-chargeability of debts pending as of the February 11, 1993 order dismissing \u201cwith prejudice\u201d Tomlin\u2019s December 17, 1992 Chapter 7 petition. Colonial moved for summary judgment, asserting that the February 11 order barred Tomlin <em>from </em>subsequently seeking to discharge debts existing at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">After a hearing, the bankruptcy court issued an order and a memorandum opinion denying Colonial\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The bankruptcy court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-8\">[T]he [February 11, 1993] dismissal order, although ambiguously designated simply \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d was intended only to invoke the sanction set forth in the first paragraph of \u00a7 109(g) \u2014 that the debtor be barred from filing another petition for 180 days. The matters addressed in the trustee\u2019s motion do not warrant imposition of the far more serious sanction of making all pending debts nondischargeable. The trustee did not request such a severe sanction in either the motion or at the hearing. And because the debtor did not appear at the hearing, the order dismissing the case was in effect by default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">Colonial appealed to the district court, which reversed. <em>Colonial Auto Center, Inc. v. Tomlin, </em>184 B.R. 720 (W.D.Va.1995). The district court recognized that, if there were \u201cany ambiguity or obscurity\u201d in an order, reference could properly be made to the \u201cfindings and entire record for determining what was decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727 (quoting <em>Security Mut. Cas. Co. v. Century Cos. Co., </em>621 F.2d 1062, 1066 (10th Cir.1980)). However, the district court found no \u201cambiguity or obscurity\u201d in the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and so held the order had the \u201cres judicata effect of precluding the discharge of debts in subsequent bankruptcy petitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Tomlin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">The first question presented here is a deceptively simple one: is the bankruptcy court\u2019s February 11, 1993 order ambiguous. Our review of this legal question is <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-14\">Colonial asserts that \u201cdismissed with prejudice\u201d can have \u201conly one reasonable interpretation,\u201d namely, the final dismissal of all claims that were, or could have been, brought in the action. Brief for Appellee at 8. Thus, Colonial claims that the February 11, 1993 order \u201cdismissing Tomlin\u2019s prior Chapter 7 case \u201cwith prejudice\u2019 had the res judicata effect of precluding the subsequent discharge of her debts existing at the filing of the dismissed case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-15\">As Colonial points out, generally \u201c[d]ismissal of an action with prejudice is a complete adjudication of the issues presented by the pleadings and is a bar to a further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>action between the parties.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Edison Bros. Apparel Stores, Inc., </em>924 F.2d 530, 534 (4th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Schwarz v. Folloder, </em>767 F.2d 125, 129 (5th Cir.1985)). Moreover, principles of res judicata certainly apply to decisions of bankruptcy courts. <em>See Katchen v. Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 334, 86 S.Ct. 467, 475, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966). Indeed, although the Bankruptcy Code establishes a general rule that dismissal of a case is without prejudice, it also expressly grants a bankruptcy court the authority to \u201cbar the discharge, in a later case ... of debts that were dischargeable in the case dismissed....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349(a) (1994); 3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00a7 349.02[2] (15th ed. rev. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">However, a bankruptcy court rarely uses its authority to bar the discharge of debts in a later case. <em>See In re Robinson, </em>198 B.R. 1017, 1023 n. 7 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1996). In any court, a dismissal order that bars subsequent litigation is a severe sanction warranted only by egregious misconduct. <em>See Durham v. Florida E. Coast Ry. Co., </em>385 F.2d 366, 368 (5th Cir.1967) (citing <em>Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962)). Given that the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose\u201d is remedial, <em>ie., </em>to afford insolvent debtors an opportunity to \u201cenjoy \u2018a new opportunity in life with a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt,\u2019 \u201d <em>Grogan v. Garner, </em>498 U.S. 279, 286, 111 S.Ct. 654, 659, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991) (quoting <em>Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, </em>292 U.S. 234, 244, 54 S.Ct. 695, 699, 78 L.Ed.. 1230 (1934)), such an order is particularly devastating in a bankruptcy case. For this reason, a permanent bar to discharge is at times referred to as the \u201ccapital punishment of bankruptcy,\u201d for it \u201cremoves much of the benefit\u201d of the bankruptcy system. <em>In re Merrill, </em>192 B.R. 245, 253 (Bankr.D.Colo.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">This \u201cdrastic sanction which may affect substantial rights of the litigant\u201d is usually limited to \u201cextreme situations.\u201d <em>In re Martin-Trigona, </em>35 B.R. 596, 601 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1983) (citing <em>Flaksa v. Little River Marine Constr. Co., </em>389 F.2d 885, 887 (5th Cir.1968)). Generally, only if a debtor engages in egregious behavior that demonstrates bad faith and prejudices creditors\u2014 for example, concealing information from the court, violating injunctions, or filing unauthorized petitions \u2014 will a bankruptcy court forever bar the debtor from seeking to discharge then existing debts. <em>See, e.g., In re Moses, </em>171 B.R. 789, 793-94 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1994); <em>Martin-Trigona, </em>35 B.R. at 601-02; <em>In re Jerry\u2019s Blue Room, </em>19 B.R. 963, 964 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">Far more frequently, if a bankruptcy court disciplines a debtor, it will do so with a different sanction, one that is less drastic, but which is nonetheless often referred to as a dismissal with prejudice. This is a dismissal triggering 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g) (1994), which temporarily bans the debtor from filing further petitions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 109(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVJ\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no individual or family farmer may be a debtor under this title who has been a debtor in a case pending under this title at any time in the preceding 180 days if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-14\">(1) the case was dismissed by the court for willful failure of the debtor to abide by orders of the court, or to appear before the court in proper prosecution of the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-15\">(2) the debtor requested and obtained the voluntary dismissal of the case following the filing of a request for relief from the automatic stay provided by section 362 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-16\">This statute was added to the Bankruptcy Code in 1984 to address the precise abuse of the bankruptcy system at issue here \u2014 the filing of meritless petitions in rapid succession to improperly obtain the benefit of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s automatic stay provisions as a means of avoiding foreclosure under a mortgage or other security interest. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>e.g., </em>1 William L. Norton, Jr., <em>Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 18:14 at 18-55-56 (2nd ed. 1994); Jeffrey W. Morris, \u201cSubstantive Consumer Bankruptcy Reform in the Bankruptcy Amendments Act of 1984,\u201d 27 <em>Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. </em>91, 101 (1985); <em>In re Faulkner, </em>187 B.R. 1019, 1022 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Thus, the Bankruptcy Code provides a bankruptcy court with authority both to bar subsequent discharge of existing debt and to bar successive petitions under \u00a7 109(g). Although the two sanctions differ dramatically in purpose and effect, bankruptcy courts often refer to both sanctions as dismissals \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Even prior to the addition of \u00a7 109(g) to the Bankruptcy Code in 1984, bankruptcy courts would order a debtor to cease filing successive petitions and refer to such an order as a \u201cdismissal with prejudice.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Damien, </em>35 B.R. 685, 687 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1983) (concluding that \u201cevery court that has considered the question has concluded that the Bankruptcy Court has discretion to dismiss with prejudice to refiling\u201d) (citing <em>In re Sando, </em>30 B.R. 474, 476-77 (E.D.Pa.1983)); <em>In re Petro, </em>18 B.R. 566, 567 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1982) (finding debtors in contempt for filing an action within a year of the issuance of an order dismissing \u201cwith prejudice\u201d their previous action).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">The language of the 1984 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code apparently has increased the prevalence of this practice. In addition to the adoption of \u00a7 109(g), codifying the court\u2019s power to temporarily bar refiling, the 1984 amendments also revised the language of \u00a7 349, adding the emphasized language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-7\">Unless the court, for cause, orders otherwise, the dismissal of a case under this title does not bar the discharge, in a later case under this title, of debts that were dischargeable in the case dismissed; <em>nor does the dismissal of a case under this title prejudice the debtor with regard to the filing of a subsequent petition under this title, except as provided in section 109(g) of this title.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">Indeed, this new language has prompted some speculation that Congress intended to eliminate a bankruptcy court\u2019s power to bar permanently the discharge of existing debt. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dennis Montali, \u201cImportant Bankruptcy Code Changes in the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984,\u201d 332 <em>PLI/Comm </em>61, 68 (1984) (New \u00a7 349(a) states that disqualification under \u00a7 109[g] constitutes a dismissal of the case with prejudice. Unfortunately, the amendment to \u00a7 349(a) can be read to exclude from the \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d label any other dismissal of a bankruptcy case since it now reads: \u201c \u2018 * * * nor does the dismissal of a case * * * prejudice the debtor with regard to the filing of a subsequent petition, except as provided in section 109[g] * * *.\u2019 \u201d); Michael T. Andrew, \u201cReal Property Transactions and the 1984 Bankruptcy Code Amendments,\u201d 20 <em>Real Prop. Prob. &amp; Tr. J. </em>47, 72 n. 107 (1985) (\u201cIt might be thought that the [language of \u00a7 349(a) ] limits the prejudicial impact of a dismissal to that provided in new \u00a7 109[g].... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">Our analysis of the plain language and \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d of the statute, <em>Maurice Sporting Goods, Inc. v. Maxway Corp. (In re Maxway Corp.), </em>27 F.3d 980, 982-83 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 240-41, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 1030, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989)), leads us to conclude that \u00a7 349 was never intended to limit the bankruptcy court\u2019s ability to impose a permanent bar to discharge that would have res judicata effect. Rather, the language of \u00a7 349, as amended, \u201cseems to make clear that the court has the power to order\u201d such a sanction \u201cin circumstances other than those dealt with by new \u00a7 109[g].\u201d Andrew at 72 n. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">But what is equally clear is that it has become common bankruptcy practice to employ the phrase \u201cdismissed with prejudice\u201d to refer to a temporary bar to filing another petition. As the court observed in <em>In re Robinson, </em>198 B.R. 1017 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-13\">The usual remedy for a bad faith filing is a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 109(g), which works to prohibit the filing by a debtor of any case under Title 11 for a period of 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>days. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g). <em>Such a dismissal is frequently and imprecisely referred to (only by bankruptcy practitioners) as a \u201cdismissal with prejudice.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1022 (emphasis added); see <em>also 2 Norton </em>\u00a7 38:19 at 33-23 (\u201cAlthough under Code \u00a7 349(a), a case may be dismissed without prejudice, where the court finds cause, the case may be dismissed with prejudice to refiling further petitions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Representative of the many cases in which a \u00a7 109(g) bar to refiling has been characterized as a dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d are several cases from courts in this circuit. <em>See, e.g., Jolly v. Great W. Bank (In re Jolly), </em>143 B.R. 383, 385 (E.D.Va.1992) (\u201cDebtors argue that the bankruptcy court misapplied [Code provisions] in dismissing Debtors\u2019 case with prejudice for 180 days.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>45 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.1994); <em>In re Hollis, </em>150 B.R. 145, 147 (D.Md.1993) (\u201cAccording to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349, dismissal of a bankruptcy petition is without prejudice, except as provided in section 109(g).\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Owings v. Doniff (In re Doniff), </em>133 B.R. 351, 354 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1991) (ordering \u201cdismissal \u25a0with prejudice pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\u201d and enjoining the debtor \u201cfrom filing a bankruptcy petition for a period of 180 days after dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">There are also numerous similar cases from other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., In re Jones, </em>192 B.R. 289, 291 (Bankr.M.D.Ga.1996) (\u201cIt is clear that the drafters of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Regulations knew how to provide for a dismissal with prejudice. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 109(g) and_\u201d); <em>In re Armwood, </em>175 B.R. 779, 787 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1994) (\u201cThe usual remedy for a bad faith filing is dismissal \u2018with prejudice,\u2019 which works to prohibit the filing by a debtor of any case under Title 11 for a period of 180 days.\u201d); <em>In re Gros, </em>173 B.R. 774, 777 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1994) (As \u201cthe debtor\u2019s multiple bankruptcy filings, coupled with involuntary dismissals [was] cause to dismiss this case with prejudice,\u201d the court barred the debtor from filing another petition for two years without court permission.); <em>In re Standfield, </em>152 B.R. 528, 539-40 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1993) (\u201cThe. totality of the circumstances warrants the imposition of dismissal of this case with prejudice ... and the prohibition of the filing of another ease for a period of 180 days....\u201d); <em>In re Jourdan, </em>108 B.R. 1020, 1021-22 (Bankr.N.D.Iowa 1989) (noting that \u201cthere is nothing to prevent a debtor from immediately refiling another Chapter 13 case ... so long as the previous dismissal was without prejudice. ...\u201d); <em>Lerch v. Federal Land Bank of St. Louis (In re Lerch), </em>94 B.R. 998, 1001 (N.D.Ill.1989) (\u201cThe clear meaning of [\u00a7 349] is that unless the court \u2018for cause, orders otherwise,\u2019 the court may not dismiss a case with prejudice for a period beyond the explicit 180-day limitation found in Section 109(g).\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">Thus, notwithstanding Colonial\u2019s assertions, in the bankruptcy context a \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d does not have \u201conly one reasonable interpretation.\u201d Rather, the term \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d in bankruptcy cases can either permanently bar discharge of certain debts or it can trigger the bar to filing successive petitions under \u00a7 109(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">Of course, the actual language of a given order may eliminate any ambiguity. The bankruptcy court\u2019s February 11, 1993 order provided that, \u201c[f]or the reasons set forth\u201d in the trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss, the ease was \u201cdismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-14\">The order contains no specific reference to the \u00a7 109(g) bar to filing successive petitions. <em>Cf. In re Dandy Doughboy Donuts, Inc., </em>66 B.R. 457, 458 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1986). Nor does it state the period of time that it would be in effect, <em>e.g., </em>the 180-day period provided in \u00a7 109(g) or a longer period. <em>Cf. Gros, </em>173 B.R. at 776; <em>In re McKissie, </em>103 B.R. 189 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>(Bankr.N.D.Ill.1989); <em>In re Conley, </em>105 B.R. 116, 117 (S.D.Fla.1989). Thus the order does not contain two of the more usual provisions indicating intent to invoke the bar to successive filings under \u00a7 109(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">However, sometimes bankruptcy courts do not include such indicia in dismissal orders but simply dismiss \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d when they nonetheless intend to bar refiling. <em>See e.g., In re Peia, </em>145 B.R. 749, 750 (Bankr.D.Conn.1992); <em>In re Hollis, </em>150 B.R. 145, 146 (D.Md.1993); <em>In re Petro, </em>18 B.R. 566, 569 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1982). Colonial argues that such unqualified \u201cwith prejudice\u201d dismissals do not provide precedent for concluding that the order at issue here was ambiguous. Brief for Appellee at 17-18. It emphasizes that the opinions accompanying the orders in <em>Peia </em>and <em>Hollis </em>indicated that all that was intended in those cases was a bar on refiling while in this case there is no similar clarification in an accompanying opinion or, indeed, any accompanying opinion at all. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">Although we agree that these cases do not provide a direct precedent for Tomlin\u2019s position, we nonetheless find them relevant. In distinguishing them, Colonial implicitly concedes that language in an accompanying opinion can change the meaning of what Colonial asserts would otherwise be an unambiguous order barring a debtor from subsequently seeking to discharge existing debts. This concession illustrates the slipperiness of a \u201cwith prejudice\u201d dismissal in the bankruptcy context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">Nevertheless, Colonial asserts that the dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d order in this case was totally \u201cunqualified\u201d and thus unambiguous. Brief for Appellee at 9. Contrary to Colonial\u2019s assertions, the order at issue here is not a totally \u201cunqualified\u201d dismissal \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d Rather, the order provides that the case is dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \u201cfor the reasons set forth\u201d in the trustee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">The trustee moved to dismiss Tomlin\u2019s Chapter 7 petition \u201cwith prejudice\u201d only after the bankruptcy court had lifted the automatic stay in an order that specifically noted that Tomlin had apparently filed her petition \u201cin violation of \u00a7 109(g).\u201d Moreover, the trustee listed the following grounds in support of its motion to dismiss: (1) Tomlin\u2019s failure to appear at the initial creditors\u2019 meeting; (2) her failure to file her schedules on time, and (3) her failure to prosecute her September 18 bankruptcy , case. These reasons hardly constitute examples of the egregious conduct and bad faith, which has generally been regarded as the necessary predicate to barring a debtor from forever seeking to discharge debts existing at the time of the dismissal order. <em>Cf. Martin-Trigona, </em>35 B.R. at 601-02; <em>Moses, </em>171 B.R. at 793-94. Rather, the usual remedy, even for far more prevalent serial filing than that presented to the bankruptcy court in this case (in moving to dismiss, the trustee only mentioned one of Tomlin\u2019s earlier filings) is the \u00a7 109(g) temporary bar to filing. <em>See, e.g., In re Penz, </em>121 B.R. at 602, 604-05 (Bankr.E.D.Okla.1990); <em>Gros, </em>173 B.R. at 777; <em>Peia, </em>145 B.R. at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">Although when moving to dismiss \u201cwith prejudice\u201d the trustee did not specifically invoke \u00a7 109(g), the bankruptcy court itself had invoked \u00a7 109(g) against Tomlin just two months before when lifting the automatic stay. Moreover, in moving to dismiss \u201cwith prejudice\u201d the trustee asserted classic \u00a7 109(g) reasons for seeking the dismissal. Accordingly, we believe the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting the trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d \u201c[flor the reasons set forth\u201d in that motion, is ambiguous. This, of course, does not mean that the order necessarily imposed a \u00a7 109(g) sanction. It may have triggered this bar or it may, as Colonial claims, have banned Tomlin from subsequently seeking the discharge of existing debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-11\">Our remaining task is to determine the meaning of the ambiguous order at issue here. When an order is ambiguous, a court \u201cmust construe its meaning, and in so doing may resort to the record upon which the judgment was based.\u201d <em>Spearman v. J &amp; S Farms, Inc., </em>755 F.Supp. 137, 140 (D.S.C.1990). <em>See also Sec. Mut. Cos. Co., </em>621 F.2d at 1066 (\u201cIf there is any ambiguity or obscurity\u201d in an order, \u201creference may be had to the findings and the entire record for the purpose of determining what was decided.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>The record here includes the 1995 memorandum opinion of the bankruptcy court interpreting its 1993 dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d to mean a bar to refiling under \u00a7 109(g). We have previously observed that w\u00e9 will defer to a district court\u2019s interpretation of its own order. <em>See Anderson v. Stephens, </em>875 F.2d 76, 80 n. 8 (4th Cir.1989); <em>Simmons v. South Carolina State Ports Auth., </em>694 F.2d 63, 66 (4th Cir.1982). We must now decide whether similar deference should be accorded to a bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\"><em>Monarch Life Ins. Co. v. Rapes </em>&amp; <em>Gray, </em>65 F.3d 973 (1st Cir.1995), is instructive. There, the bankruptcy court had entered a court order confirming a reorganization plan, and subsequently interpreted it to protect the former lawyers of an insurance company. On appeal, the insurance company argued that the order did not afford their former lawyers this protection. The First Circuit rejected the insurance company\u2019s challenge, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-6\">Even though our interpretation of the confirmation order essentially presents a question of law, the bankruptcy court in this case was <em>interpreting its own order of </em>confirmation. We think customary appellate deference is appropriate in these circumstances with respect to the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that the confirmation order was sufficiently broad to confer \u201cincidental\u201d protection to [the lawyers].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\"><em>Id </em>at 983 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">We believe that the bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its own order here similarly warrants \u201ccustomary appellate deference.\u201d The bankruptcy court was \u201cin the best position to interpret its own orders.\u201d <em>Texas N.W. Ry. Co. v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Ry. Co. (In re Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. R.R. Co.), </em>860 F.2d 267, 272 (7th Cir.1988). <em>Accord Hastert v. Illinois St. Bd. of Elect. Comm\u2019rs., </em>28 F.3d 1430, 1438 (7th Cir.1993). The First Circuit noted in <em>Monarch </em>that the bankruptcy court \u201cwas directly engaged\u201d in the earlier proceedings and thus had the \u201cbetter vantage point\u201d to make a determination on its earlier order. <em>Monarch, </em>65 F.3d at 983. Similarly, the bankruptcy court here was \u201cdirectly engaged\u201d in Tomlin\u2019s earlier ease, giving it a \u201cbetter vantage point\u201d from which to assess the order\u2019s meaning. Since \u201c[t]he court best qualified to determine why it is dismissing a proceeding is the court doing the dismissing,\u201d we will give substantial deference to the bankruptcy court\u2019s analysis on its own order to dismiss. <em>In re Bono, </em>70 B.R. 339, 343 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1987). <em>See also Ranch House of Orange-Brevard, Inc. v. Gluckstem (In re Ranch House of Orange-Brevard, Inc.), </em>773 F.2d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir.1985) (expressing reluctance to overturn a court\u2019s interpretation of its own order because \u201c[t]he Bankruptcy judge who has presided over a case from its inception is in the best position to clarify any apparent inconsistencies in the court\u2019s rulings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">Examination of the record demoh-strates that the bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of its order is reasonable in light of the facts of this case. The bankruptcy court noted that the trustee\u2019s motion did \u201cnot warrant imposition of the far more serious sanction of making all pending debts nondis-chargeable. The trustee did not request such a severe sanction in either the motion or at the hearing.\u201d Instead, the trustee cited Tomlin\u2019s failure to attend the initial creditors\u2019 meeting and failure to file her schedules. The trustee\u2019s motion stated that Tomlin had caused unreasonable delay and had prejudiced her creditors by this behavior. No doubt Tomlin\u2019s behavior constitutes an abuse of the protection afforded her by the bankruptcy system. Her purpose seemed clear; by continuously filing petitions, the automatic stay prevented foreclosure action on her home. This is the very behavior for which Congress formulated \u00a7 109(g). 1 <em>Norton </em>\u00a7 18:14 at 18-58-59. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order \u2014 as interpreted by that court \u2014 was the most appropriate sanction for the abuse Tomlin committed. By prohibiting her from filing another petition immediately after the dismissal of the case, the court prevented Tomlin from committing the very behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>that triggered the sanctions in the first place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Nor does the fact that the order at issue here contains no finding of willfulness undermine the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion it was intended to trigger a \u00a7 109(g) sanction. Colonial is quite correct that \u201cthe plain language\u201d of \u00a7 109(g) bars a subsequent filing sanction only if the bankruptcy court finds a previous case was dismissed because of a debtor\u2019s \u201cwillful failure\u201d to abide by a court order. Brief for Appellee at 15. But that finding need not be made at the time of the earlier dismissal; it can be made when the bankruptcy court is later called upon to determine if \u00a7 109(g) bars a subsequent filing. <em>See Montgomery v. Ryan (In re Montgomery), </em>37 F.3d 413, 415 (8th Cir.1994); <em>Robinson, </em>198 B.R. at 1028 n. 8; <em>In re Faulkner, </em>187 B.R. 1019, 1023 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.1995); <em>In re Pappalardo, </em>109 B.R. 622, 626 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1990). For example, in <em>Montgomery, </em>37 F.3d at 414-15, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order stated only that the ease was dismissed because the debtor failed to attend a creditors\u2019 meeting; there was no finding of willfulness. Within 180 days, the debtor sought to file another petition. <em>Id. </em>at 414. At that time, the bankruptcy court found that the prior dismissal was based on the debtor\u2019s willful failure to follow a court order and so \u00a7 109(g) barred the subsequent filing. Id. at 415. The Eighth Circuit affirmed explaining, \u201c[a] finding of willfulness was necessary only when the bankruptcy court dismissed the second petition.\u201d Id. <em>See also Faulkner, </em>187 B.R. at 1023 (\u201cSince the language of section 109(g) is set out as an eligibility requirement, the determination cannot be made until the filing of the successive case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">In the case at hand, the trustee\u2019s motion clearly indicated that Tomlin\u2019s behavior demonstrated a willful failure to prosecute her case. That the bankruptcy court made no finding of willfulness in the 1993 order is therefore not determinative. If Tomlin had filed a subsequent action within 180 days of the previously dismissed action, the court could have made that finding at that time based on a review of Tomlin\u2019s record in the earlier proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">Finally, Colonial heavily relies on <em>In re Smith, </em>133 B.R. 467 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1991), as compelling the conclusion that the order at issue here must be one prohibiting Tomlin from seeking the discharge of existing debt. That reliance is misplaced. Although <em>Smith </em>resolves differently the same issue we have grappled with here, it is no way inconsistent with our decision. In <em>Smith </em>when the debtors and trustees in a Chapter 7 case failed to come to an agreement, the trustee moved the bankruptcy court to dismiss the case or to deny discharge. Judge Riegle of the bankruptcy court granted the motion, and issued an order stating \u201cthat this ease be dismissed with prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468. Eighteen months later, the debtors filed another Chapter 7 petition and the trustee again moved to dismiss, asserting the earlier dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d precluded the debtors \u201cfrom ever seeking further relief1\u2019 under the Bankruptcy Code. <em>Id. </em>A different bankruptcy judge, Judge Grant, properly rejected that argument and then interpreted Judge Riegle\u2019s order to mean a permanent bar on discharging the debts in question at the time of the previous filing: \u201cThe dismissal of a bankruptcy case with prejudice \u2018denies a debtor [the] future discharge of debts dischargeable in that particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470 (quoting <em>Frieouf v. United States (In re Frieouf), </em>938 F.2d 1099, 1103 (10th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\"><em>Smith </em>provides no authority for Colonial\u2019s position here because the order in <em>Smith, </em>unlike that here, apparently was an unadorned dismissal \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>over, the <em>Smith </em>order was issued in response to the trustee\u2019s request to \u201cdismiss the case or ... deny the discharge.\u201d 133 B.R. at 467. In contrast, the trustee in the instant ease never requested that Tomlin be denied the right to seek to discharge her debts in the future, but instead asked that her case be dismissed on typical \u00a7 109(g) grounds. Thus, the <em>Smith </em>order differs from that presented here in that it apparently was an unqualified and unambiguous order preventing the debtor from subsequently seeking to discharge existing debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Even if the <em>Smith </em>order were identical to that at issue here (and there is no indication it was), our holding would still not be inconsistent with that of <em>Smith. </em>Our conclusion that the order before us is ambiguous does not signify that it was definitively a \u00a7 109(g) order. We deferred to the interpretation of the court that fashioned the order to resolve this ambiguity. In <em>Smith, </em>the court that fashioned the order never opined as to its meaning. If it had done so, a court subsequently examining the order might well have deferred to the original court\u2019s interpretation, as we have done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the order of the district court, which had reversed the bankruptcy court, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">. The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-353, 98 Stat. 352, 269 (1984), added new subsection (f) to \u00a7 109 to provide a 180-day bar to filing. This was redesignated as subsection (g) by \u00a7 253 of the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-554, 100 Stat. 3105 (1986). Throughout this opinion, it will be referred to as \u00a7 109(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">. Of course, as the district court recognized, a bankruptcy court can impose sanctions under \u00a7 109(g) without dismissing a case \"with prejudice.\u201d <em>See Colonial Auto Center, </em>184 B.R. at 726. What is significant is that bankruptcy courts so frequently do characterize a dismissal intended to trigger \u00a7 109(g) as a dismissal \"with prejudice.\u201d Indeed, some courts have been reluctant to impose \u00a7 109(g) sanctions if the underlying order was without prejudice. <em>See In re Felts, </em>60 B.R. 736 (Bankr.W.D.Ky.1986) (\u201cIt is the opinion of the court that the present petition is not viola-tive of 11 U.S.C. Section 109[g] since the [prior] dismissal ... expressly denoted that said dismissal was 'without prejudice.' \u201d); 1 <em>Norton </em>\u00a7 18:14 at 18-57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">. Of course, similar conduct has also been found to merit the imposition of a permanent bar to discharge the debts existing at the time of the dismissal. Some courts seem to have equated the \u201cwillful failure\u201d to obey a court order necessary to trigger a \u00a7 109(g) sanction with the \u201cbad faith\u201d leading to a permanent bar to the discharge of the debts. <em>See, e.g., In re McClure, </em>69 B.R. 282, 284-85 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1987). However, the majority of bankruptcy courts have sought clear evidence of \u201cbad faith\" before proceeding to prohibit a debtor from ever discharging then existing debts, evidence that goes beyond mere willfulness. <em>Jerry\u2019s Blue Room, </em>19 B.R. at 964 (bad faith actions merit \"serious\" and \"rarely invoked\u201d remedy of dismissal with prejudice); <em>Moses, </em>171 B.R. at 798 (same); <em>Martin-Trigona, </em>35 B.R. at 601 (same). <em>Cf. Hall v.
