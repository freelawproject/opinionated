Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). When the district court denied his motion, Chisholm pleaded guilty. He raises the <em>Lopez </em>issue again on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-28\">Chisholm recognizes that his argument has been rejected by this court and every other circuit which has considered the issue. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 262, 136 L.Ed.2d .187 (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends, however, that this court should revisit the <em>McAllister </em>decision' because it conflicts with our decision in <em>United States v. Denalli, </em>73 F.3d 328 (11th Cir.), <em>modified </em>90 F.3d 444 (1996), and with <em>Lopez </em>itself.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-31\">In <em>Denalli </em>we held that a defendant could not be convicted under the federal arson statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i), without proof that the private residence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> destroyed \u201cwas used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>in an activity that had a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\u201d 90 F.3d at 444. We reasoned that <em>Lopez </em>limited Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause authority only to activities that \u201csubstantially\u201d affect interstate commerce, and that Congress could not make it a federal crime to burn private property with a less than \u201csubstantial\u201d connection to interstate commerce, even though the statute\u2019s language does not require a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">In <em>McAllister, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that he could not be convicted under the statute prohibiting felons from possessing a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), without proof that his possession \u201csubstantially\u201d affected interstate commerce. Like <em>Denalli, McAllister </em>involved a statute that did not require a \u201csubstantial\u201d connection to commerce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>McAllister, </em>however, we ruled that so long as the weapon in question had a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce, the Constitution is satisfied. <em>McAl-lister, </em>77 F.3d at 389-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">Chisholm argues that Denalli\u2019s \u201csubstantial effect\u201d test and <em>McAllister\u2019s </em>\u201cminimal nexus\u201d test are in tension. Assuming, <em>ar-guendo, </em>that Chisholm is correct, we nonetheless are bound by the <em>McAllister </em>panel\u2019s decision, as Chisholm was convicted under the exact statute at issue in <em>McAllister, </em>and the opinion remains binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Adams, </em>91 F.3d 114, 115 (11th Cir.1996) (applying <em>McAllister </em>).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ahj8\">. <em>See also United States v.
