We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AYBn\">Following a jury trial, Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1); engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 (Count 121); and conspiring to transport funds out of the United States to promote unlawful activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count 122). The district court sentenced Gonzalez-Balderas to life imprisonment on Counts 1 and 121 and to five years imprisonment on Count 122, all to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">On appeal, a panel of the Fifth Circuit held that conspiracy in violation \u00f3f 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 is a lesser-included offense of continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>11 F.3d 1218, 1225 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 2138, 128 L.Ed.2d 867 (1994). Accordingly, we vacated Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s conviction and sentence as to the conspiracy count, as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but affirmed the convictions and sentences as to Counts 121 and 122. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">In January 1996, Gonzalez-Balderas moved for modification of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), requesting that his sentence be reduced in light of a 1994 amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) (\u201cAmendment 505\u201d), which reduced the maximum base offense level outlined in the drug quantity table from 42 to 38. The district court summarily denied the motion. Gonzalez-Balderas unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration, and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996). Subsection (c) of that provision dictates that Amendment 505 is designated for retroactive application. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IBl.lO(e), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-16\">Having determined that Amendment 505 is designated for retroactive application, we note that the decision whether to reduce a sentence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Thus we review for abuse of discretion only. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1995). In exercising this discretion, the sentencing court is guided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b), which instructs the court to \u201cconsider the sentence that it would have imposed\u201d had Amendment 505 been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. Further, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) directs the sentencing court to consider the numerous factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when determining the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1009 (listing certain of the applicable factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-17\">In the instant case, the district court summarily denied Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence without stating whether it had considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), thus leaving intact Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s life sentence. Gonzalez-Bald-eras contends that Amendment 505 serves to lower his total offense level to 42, which leaves the district court with discretion to sentence him anywhere from 360 months to life imprisonment. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A. He thus maintains that the court abused its discretion when it sentenced him at the top of the sentencing range without weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Towe, 26 F.3d </em>614, 616 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), for the proposition that a denial of a motion to amend without substantial reason appearing for such a denial is not an exercise of discretion). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number><em>But see Wkitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010 (affirming the district court\u2019s summary denial of a \u00a7 3582(e) motion on the ground that it implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Because we believe that Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s total offense level is 44, which corresponds to mandatory life imprisonment, U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A., the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reduce Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s term of imprisonment. Thus we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">The Sentencing Guidelines direct the sentencing court to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.5 when a defendant is convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. Section 2D1.5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agp\">(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-5\">(1) 4 plus the offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1 applicable to the underlying offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-6\">(2) 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.5(a). Applying the cross-reference set forth in \u00a7 2D1.5(a)(l), the base offense level is calculated by reference to the drug quantity table outlined in subsection 2Dl.l(c). The drugs forming the basis of Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s offense far exceed the top of the drug quantity table, but Amendment 505 \u2014 which applies retroactively \u2014 reduces the top base offense level of the drug quantity table from 42 to 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">Gonzalez-Balderas agrees with the analysis in the paragraph immediately above. We diverge at this point, however. He insists that his total offense level should be 42, which corresponds, in his view, to the 38 derived from the drug quantity table plus the 4 specified in \u00a7 2D1.5(a)(l). He does not enhance his offense level with any specific offense characteristics, presumably because \u00a7 2D1.5 does not explicitly list any specific offense characteristics. Further, he does not apply any adjustment for his role in the offense, because the application notes to \u00a7 2D1.5 instruct the sentencing court not to apply any adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.5 (application note 1). Thus, Gonzalez-B alder as arrives at a total offense level of 42, which translates to a term of imprisonment ranging from 360 months to life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">We agree with Gonzalez-Balderas that \u00a7 2D1.5 directs that his offense level should not be enhanced by any adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B of the Guidelines. We believe, however, that specific offense characteristics do apply to enhance his offense level. Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s error stems from the fact that he does not consider the specific offense characteristics of \u00a7 2D1.1. As noted above, \u00a7 2D1.5(a)(l)\u2014 the applicable guideline for a continuing criminal enterprise conviction \u2014 cross-references \u00a7 2D1.1 in determining the applicable offense level. Gonzalez-Balderas, however, cross-references only the drug quantity table set forth in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and not the specific offense characteristics of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">We think, however, that \u00a7 2D1.5(a)(l) references \u00a7 2D1.1 in its entirety, <em>i.e., </em>the specific offense characteristics of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b), as well as the base offense level provided for in the drug quantity table of \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). Our conclusion is supported by two distinct rationales. First, the text of \u00a7 2D1.5(a)(l) instructs the sentencing court to apply \u201c4 plus the offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1 applicable to the underlying offense.\u201d Notably, it does not specify, \u201c4 plus the <em>[base] </em>offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1/' <em>(c) ] </em>applicable to the underlying offense.\u201d Thus, although there are no specific offense characteristics listed directly under \u00a7 2D1.5, they apply, in this instance, by reference to \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">Second, this reading of \u00a7 2D1.5 is further compelled by the particular specific offense characteristic at issue: the dangerous weapon enhancement. In the instant ease, the Presentence Investigation Report enhanced Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s offense level for the \u00a7 846 drug conspiracy conviction by 2 points pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because Gonzalez-Balderas possessed a dangerous weapon. Although we vacated the \u00a7 846 conviction as violative of the Double Jeopar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>dy Clause, we are convinced that the dangerous weapon enhancement also applies to the continuing criminal enterprise conviction by reference from \u00a7 2D1.5(a)(l). The application notes to \u00a7 2D1.1 specifically instruct the sentencing court to apply the enhancement for weapon possession to offenses that are referenced to \u00a7 2D1.1, including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 2D1.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (application note 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">In the instant case, we apply the 2-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon, and thus Gonzalez-Balderas\u2019s offense level is 44 (38 from the drug quantity table plus 2 for the weapon enhancement plus 4 from \u00a7 2D1.5(a)(l)). The sentencing table instructs that the term of imprisonment for an offense level of 44 is life. U.S.S.G. eh. 5, pt. A. Although Amendment 505 did lower Gonzalezr-Balderas\u2019s offense level, a level of 44 still gives rise to life imprisonment. Because the district court was bound to sentence Gonzalez-Balderas to life imprisonment, it did not abuse .its discretion in summarily denying his motion for reduction of sentence without explicitly considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.'\u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">. Before Amendment 505, the Presentence Investigation Report calculated Gonzalez-Balderas's offense level at 46 for the continuing criminal enterprise count, thus providing for a mandatory ' life sentence. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">. The fact that the application notes to \u00a7 2D 1.5 instruct the court not to apply any adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) does not mean that the court should also not apply the specific offense characteristics from \u00a7 2D 1.1. Enhancements for specific offense characteristics are different than enhancements for a defendant's role in the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
