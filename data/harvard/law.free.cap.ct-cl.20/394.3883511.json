The governor of New Hampshire proposes, and the Secretary of War agrees, that Ne w Hampshire, to promote enlistments, shall advance the bounty and take assignments from the men. The question now is, whether the State can recover the unpaid installments forfeited by deserters?

The bounty was for service; it was not in its true sense a bounty at all; it had to be earned; it was a compensation agreed upon in advance to be paid for service when performed. The United States wanted troops, actual men, not paper rolls of deserters. New Hampshire wanted to avoid a draft; by this process she succeeded; but the United States, to the extent of this claim, instead of getting soldiers, got deserters, and is now called upon to pay $300 apiece for each of her New Hampshire deserters.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-4\"><em>Mr. Mason W.

Fry,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">\u201c <em>Provost-Marshal-General.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">Thereafter the State of New Hampshire, through its several cities and towns, furnished, within the time required, its quota of volunteers, and they were duly mustered into the service of. the United States.

Whether the United States is under obligation to so reimburse the State to the extent of all moneys advanced to the respective soldiers who were duly enlisted under said agreement, delivered at general rendezvous, and duly mustered into the service of the United States, without evidence of subsequent service on the part of the soldier1?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">It appears by an examination of the telegrams of November 4 and 5 that the Provost-Marshal-G-eneral agrees that in case the State or town furnishes the volunteers and becomes the assignee of the \u201c claims for a bounty,\u201d the government shall \u201c pay the bounties to the State or town instead of to the men at the time and iu the manner they are to be paid to the soldiers respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">This language seems too plain for dispute. In the payments of bounties the assignee is to stand \u201c instead of the men\u201d \u2014 instead of the assignors. The assignees are to be paid all the money that the \u201c claim for bounty \u201d calls for. No more is promised. Whatever the assignor might have claimed the assignee may claim. The claim for bounty is not enlarged by the assignment; nor is the time of payment changed. Whenever an installment of the \u201c claims for bounty \u201d becomes payable to the soldier the assignee may demand it; not before. The manner of payment is unchanged. The bounties are to be paid to the claimant (so runs the agreement), not only \u201c at the time,\u201d but \u201c in the manner, they are to be paid to the soldiers respectively.\u201d The word \u201cmanner\u201d must-have some meaning here. Worcester\u2019s Dictionary gives as one definition of \u201c manner\u201d a \u201c certain degree, measure, or extent.\u201d The claim for bounty in the hands of the soldier has its surroundings, its \u201c degree, measure, or extent';\u201d its conditions and its limitations. With such surroundings it passes to the assignee. At no time and in no manner could a deserter claim the future installments of his bounty. The assignee, who has agreed to abide \u201c the time and manner of the soldiers respectively,\u201d is in no better position.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">It is claimed, however, that these terms were subsequently modified or authoritatively construed by the following correspondence :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201cState oe New Hampshire,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201c Oeeioe Acting- Assistant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAO\">Provost-Marshal-General,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201c <em>Ooncord, N.

No officer nor representative of the State is a party to it. So far as appears, they learned of its existence many years after it took place. No copy of it is found in the archives of the State. Governor Gilmore, in his letter to the Secretary of War, asking for the repayment of the bounties after the State had furnished its quota, dated January 12,1864, makes no mention of this correspondence. He incloses a copy of the telegram of November 5, and relies upon that and nothing else as constituting the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The government has already paid to the State the full amount of bounties that could have been claimed by the volunteers had there been no assignment. That amount, in the opinion of the court, is all that the State is entitled to claim within the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Whether these, telegrams constitute a contract binding upon the government, and, if not, whether they were subsequently ratified by an act of Congress, under the above ruling of the court are no longer material questions. The government, in the opinion of the court, has done all that its officers engaged it should do, and whether in so doing they exceeded their authority or not does not now concern the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The court, therefore, answers both questions propounded by the Secretary in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\"><em>Ordered </em>by the court that a certified copy of the foregoing findings and opinions of the court be reported by the clerk to the Treasury Department for its guidance and action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
