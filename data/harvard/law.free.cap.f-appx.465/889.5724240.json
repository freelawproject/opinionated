Baxter, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 471 (11th Cir.2005), this court affirmed Victor Garry Baxter\u2019s convictions and sentences for distribution of crack cocaine and for possession with intent to distribute cocaine powder. In affirming his sentences, the court rejected Baxter\u2019s challenge to the fine the district court imposed, noting that the district court, in fining Baxter $10,000 payable over a thirty-year period, had departed downward from the Guidelines range of $20,000 to $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-22\">In July 2011, Baxter moved the district court to clarify the amount of the fine he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>was to pay each month while in prison. The court denied his motion. He then petitioned the district court for Modification or Remission to Deter Fine pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573, seeking deferral of payments on the fine until his release from prison. The court denied his motion, and he now appeals the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">In the interests of justice, a district court may remit or defer the payment of a fine, or extend a defendant\u2019s payment schedule, upon the Government\u2019s petition showing that reasonable efforts to collect the fine are not likely to be effective. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573. Here, because the petition was not filed by the Government, the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Baxter\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
