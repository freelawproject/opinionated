He concedes that he violated the conditions of his supervised release that prohibited him from committing another crime and from illegally reentering the United States. He argues, however, that the written judgment includes a clerical error insofar as it indicates that he additionally violated the conditions of his supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>release by committing the offense of public intoxication. The Government concedes the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Our review of the record confirms that whether Araguz had violated his supervised release conditions by committing the offense of public intoxication was not at issue during the revocation hearing. Because the district court made no mention a such a violation at any point in the revocation hearing, including during its oral pronouncement of sentence, the oral pronouncement of sentence conflicts with the written judgment, and the case is REMANDED FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE of allowing the district court to conform its written judgment to its oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
