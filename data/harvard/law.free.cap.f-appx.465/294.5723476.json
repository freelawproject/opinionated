The offense is assimilated into federal law by the Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7(3), 13, which makes state law applicable to conduct occurring on lands acquired by the federal government when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Loften argues that the ACA does not incorporate \u00a7 22.04 because the federal statute criminalizing simple assault, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(5), governs his conduct. At least, he contends that he should have been punished under \u00a7 113. Loften further argues that the district court erred by failing to apply the Sentencing Guidelines in his case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1. He notes that his sentencing range under what he contends is the most analogous Guideline, \u00a7 2A2.3, would have been lower than the two-year minimum term of imprisonment that \u00a7 22.04 mandated for his offense. He thus contends that the state minimum sentence should have become his sentencing range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). Loften argues that the district court erred by failing to give him notice that it intended to impose a sentence that exceeded the minimum sentence, and by failing to state its reasons for the decision in open court. Finally, Loften argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the availability of probation under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">At sentencing Loften preserved his final argument for review by requesting a sentence of probation. The arguments Loften made in the district court were not sufficient to put the district court on notice of the basis of the remaining arguments he now raises on appeal. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we review those arguments for plain error only. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 476-77 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Sept. 4, 2010) (No. 10-6291).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">Loften has not shown that the assimilation of \u00a7 22.04 in his case via the ACA or his sentencing pursuant to \u00a7 22.04 constituted clear or obvious error. <em>See Lewis v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 155, 164, 118 S.Ct. 1135, 140 L.Ed.2d 271 (1998). However, the district court was obligated to apply the Sentencing Guidelines in Lof-ten\u2019s case and erred by failing to consider whether an analogous Guideline existed that could be used in determining Loften\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 362 (5th Cir.2001). That error did not affect Loften\u2019s substantial rights. A review of the applicable statutes reveals no analogous Guideline. Because the district court found the Sentencing Guidelines inapplicable and imposed a non-guidelines sentence, it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>required to give Loften notice that it intended to impose a sentence that exceeded the state minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 722-23 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The district court erred by failing to state in open court the reasons for its sentencing decision; however, Loften has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights. The district court\u2019s written statement of reasons and adoption of the presentence report provided explanation sufficient to allow meaningful review of Loften\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>298 F.3d 322, 325-26 (5th Cir.2002). The district court sentenced Loften towards the low end of the statutory sentencing range, and Loften has not explained how the outcome of his case might have been different had the district court provided a more thorough verbal explanation for its choice of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Finally, Loften\u2019s argument that the district court erred by failing to consider his eligibility to be sentenced to probation or 180 days of confinement as a condition of probation lacks merit. The record does not support Loften\u2019s allegation that the district court was not aware of the various sentencing alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
