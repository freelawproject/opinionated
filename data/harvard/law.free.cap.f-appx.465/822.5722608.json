Licona argues that the district court plainly erred by allowing the government to ask Licona if other witnesses were lying and to accuse Licona of disclosing a secret grand jury subpoena. Licona also challenges the findings of the district court that she obstructed justice, held a leadership role in the fraud, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>caused a loss between $7 and $20 million. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Licona argues that the district court plainly erred when it allowed the government, without objection, to cross-examine Licona about whether its witnesses were lying, <em>United States v. Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d 1247, 1268 (11th Cir. 2011), and to suggest that Licona was prohibited from \u201cdisclosing] the existence of a secret grand jury subpoena,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3322, but the errors did not affect Licona\u2019s substantial rights especially in the light of the overwhelming evidence of her guilt, <em>see United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1109 (11th Cir.2010). Licona\u2019s coconspirators, Zudhi Abud and Oscar Ramos, testified that Licona recruited Abud and other persons to serve as straw buyers in real estate transactions executed by Ramos through his company, Alliance Mortgage Investment; received commissions for recruiting those straw buyers; and made false representations to mortgage companies that straw buyers held positions with and received salaries from Licona\u2019s company, Miaferchill. Lewis Sellars, an investigator for the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, testified that Licona deposited checks made payable to her from Alliance and another of Ramos\u2019s businesses, Alternative Renovation, into a corporate account for Edcar Repairs and Remodeling; served as a mortgage broker on fraudulent loan applications; and issued three checks between $5,000 and $20,000 from Edcar to pay three straw buyers for using their identities on four fraudulent loan applications. Licona admitted that she received a commission for referring Abud to Ramos; that Abud said he was being paid $10,000 by Ramos; and that she \u201cwent directly\u201d to coconspirator Theresa Gonzalez about a secret grand jury subpoena related to the mortgage fraud. Licona also made other inconsistent statements that the jury could consider as substantive evidence of her guilt, <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995), including testifying that she received a $5,000 commission for referring Martha Dieguez to Gonzalez allegedly for tailoring services, but later testifying that she cashed the $5,000 check for Gonzalez to pay Dieguez. Although the government in closing argument returned to the theme of its improper cross-examination of Licona about its witnesses allegedly lying, Licona argued at length that the witnesses for the government were indeed lying. The government did not argue in closing that Licona had disclosed a grand jury subpoena. And Lico-na did not request a jury instruction about either issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Licona\u2019s sentence for obstructing justice, organizing or leading the mortgage fraud, and causing a loss between $7 and $20 million. Licona obstructed justice by warning Gonzalez that their conspiracy was under investigation and providing incredible testimony in which she disclaimed any involvement in the mortgage fraud. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; cmt. n. 4 (Nov. 2010). Licona challenges the finding that she committed perjury based on Abud\u2019s testimony after being acquitted of charges involving him, but \u201ca sentencing court may consider conduct of which a defendant has been acquitted.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 154, 117 S.Ct. 633, 636, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997). Licona also acted as a leader or organizer of the mortgage fraud by recruiting and paying straw buyers, misrepresenting to mortgage companies that straw buyers were employed by Miaferchill, and processing fraudulent transactions through Edcar. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a) &amp; cmt. n. 4. Because Licona \u201cadmittedly recruited buyers\u201d for a \u201cconspiracy [that she knew] had already been organized by Oscar Ramos,\u201d she likewise was responsible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>losses stemming from the reasonably foreseeable acts of her coconspirators and the fraud she committed independently through Edcar. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(K); <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 731-32 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We AFFIRM Licona\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
