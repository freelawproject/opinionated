Sims claims error in the granting summary judgment for the defendants; the closing of his case; and the denial, as moot, of his post-judgment motion for summary judgment. After careful review, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">\u201cThis court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on the defense of qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Holmes v. Kucynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1077 (11th Cir.2003). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party \u201cshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact....\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We accept the plaintiffs version of the facts and draw all justifiable inferences in his favor. <em>Pourmoghani-Esfahani v. Gee, </em>625 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <em>see Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1486 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201c[W]hat is considered to be the \u2018facts\u2019 at the summary judgment stage may not turn out to be the actual facts if the case goes to trial, but those are the facts at this stage of the proceeding for summary judgment purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">A summary judgment motion can be opposed \u201cby any of the kinds of evidentia-ry materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves, and it is from this list that one would normally expect the nonmoving party to make\u201d the necessary showing. <em>Celotex Co'rp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Though the District Court quite rightly recognized the lack of any \u201cprocedural tool for a default summary judgment,\u201d we nevertheless conclude that the judgment entered there amounted to a default. In deciding Sims\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, the district court stated: \u201cBecause [Sims] has failed to respond to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, he <em>necessarily </em>has failed in his burden to show that qualified immunity is not appropriate\u201d (emphasis added). Similarly, with respect to Sims\u2019s assault and battery claim, the district court stated: \u201cBecause [Sims] failed to respond to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, this claim <em>necessarily </em>fails,\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">We recognize that the district court did evaluate Sims\u2019s deposition. However, this evaluation neglected to include some of Sims\u2019s testimony which must be credited because we are required to accept Sims\u2019s \u201cversion of the facts drawing all justifiable inferences in [his] favor.\u201d <em>Pourmoghani-Esfahani, </em>625 F.3d at 1315; <em>see Brown v. City of Huntsville, Ala., </em>608 F.3d 724, 728, 738-40 (11th Cir.2010) (reviewing the \u201c[p]laintiff s version of events,\u201d and holding that the district court erred in granting qualified immunity for a \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim). The district court found that, since Sims testified that he did not see who hit his leg, he could not establish the claim against Officer Leonard. Yet, in other portions of his deposition, Sims testified that Officer Leonard hit his leg, and he clarified that he knew this because Leonard was the only person close enough to him to have done it. Sims stated: \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>only spot where the hit came from was where Officer Leonard was.\u201d Though Sims might not have seen Leonard hit him, we must nevertheless make the reasonable inference from Sims\u2019s testimony that Leonard hit Sims.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">In our view, to state that a party\u2019s claim \u201cnecessarily\u201d fails because that party has \u201cfailed to respond\u201d to a dispositive motion results in the imposition of a default judgment. By entering judgment here, the district court imposed a requirement that Sims establish a \u201clegal fact,\u201d that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional principles; but Sims needed only to show facts constituting a constitutional violation. <em>See Elder v. Holloway, </em>510 U.S. 510, 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 344 (1994) (\u201cWhether an asserted federal right was clearly established at a particular time, ..., presents a question of law, not one of \u2018legal facts.\u2019 \u201d). The court must then evaluate those facts to determine whether, as a matter of law, the alleged conduct was \u201cclearly established\u201d as a constitutional violation at the time it occurred. See <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 528, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2816, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (\u201cAll [a court] need determine is a question of law: whether the legal norms allegedly violated by the defendant were clearly established at the time of the challenged actions ...\u201d); <em>see also Elder, </em>510 U.S. at 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019 (\u201cA court engaging in review of a qualified immunity judgment should therefore use its full knowledge of its own [and other relevant] precedents.\u201d (brackets in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">As a result, the district court did not adequately credit the other evidence presented by Sims, in particular his deposition testimony. The evidence put forward by Sims contains facts that, when viewed in his favor, may establish defendants\u2019 violation of a clearly established constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">We will afford the district court an opportunity to engage in this more comprehensive analysis in the first instance, examining whether the evidence shows that there remains a genuine issue of material fact and whether Sims\u2019s claim survives the defendants\u2019 assertion of qualified immunity-</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\">. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1) (\"A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by: (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
