Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) (Count One); (2) wrongful disclosure of tax return information, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103 and 7431 (Count Two); and (3) instigation of an unauthorized collection action, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433 (Count Three). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">A. Conviction and Probation</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">In 1999, Plotkin was convicted in the Eastern District of Missouri of filing false tax returns in the years 1991, 1992 and 1993, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). Plotkin was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, which he began serving in May 2001. As a special condition of his probation, Plotkin was required to \u201cfile all correct tax returns and forms required by the income tax laws of the United States, pay any taxes owed and, as requested by the U.S. Probation Office, provide copies of all filed tax forms.\u201d After Plotkin moved to Ocala, Florida, supervision of his probation was transferred to the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">In November 2005, Plotkin\u2019s probation officer, Thomas Sanders, filed a petition for revocation in the Middle District of Florida. The revocation petition alleged that Plotkin had violated his special condition of probation by failing to file his tax returns and pay taxes from 2001 to 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">The district court held two hearings on the revocation petition. During the second hearing, on June 20, 2006, the parties argued about whether the special condition of probation referred only to taxes owed in years 1991 through 1993 or to future taxes Plotkin would owe during the probationary period. After the hearing, the district court transferred probation supervision back to the Eastern District of Missouri. There, in December 2006, the district court summarily dismissed the petition and released Plotkin from probation. By this time, Plotkin\u2019s five-year probation, which began in May 2001, was apparently ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>pired, but the record does not tell us the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">B. Civil Action</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">On June 25, 2008, Plotkin filed this <em>pro se </em>complaint against the United States, probation officer Sanders, and Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) agents Rhonda Patrick, Leonard Bussmann, Lewis Leek-er, Lynda McAdon and Ken Kibort. Count One alleged that beginning in 1996 the defendants conspired to falsely convict Plotkin of tax crimes and, after his 2000 conviction, to use the probation revocation proceedings to collect unassessed taxes, in violation of Plotkin\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process rights. Count Two alleged that Defendants Leeker, McAdon and Kibort, IRS revenue agents, provided probation officer Sanders with Plotkin\u2019s tax return information for the years 1998 through 2004, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431. Count Three alleged that the United States, through IRS revenue agents Leek-er, McAdon and Kibort, used the probation revocation proceedings to collect taxes the agents knew Plotkin did not owe, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7438.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Plotkin\u2019s complaint with prejudice. Plotkin filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4W\">A. <em>Heck-Barred Bivens </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The district court did not err in dismissing Plotkin\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims arising out of his criminal convictions as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Under <em>Heck, </em>a prisoner may not bring a non-habeas civil action challenging the constitutionality of officials\u2019 action if a judgment in the prisoner\u2019s favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d unless the prisoner shows that his conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372; <em>see Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir.1995) (concluding that <em>Heck </em>applies to <em>Bivens </em>actions by federal prisoners). Therefore, a plaintiffs damages claim alleging that the defendants unconstitutionally conspired to falsely convict him is not ripe and must be dismissed unless the conviction has been invalidated. <em>Abella, </em>63 F.3d at 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Plotkin does not contend that his underlying convictions for filing false tax returns have been invalidated. Thus, to the extent Count One of Plotkin\u2019s complaint rests on the contention that the defendants conspired to secure those convictions, the district court properly dismissed it as Heck-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">B. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">To the extent Plotkin\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim in Count One relates to Plotkin\u2019s probation revocation, we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that the Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">Government officials are immune from suit if they were performing discretionary functions and their conduct did not violate a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 714 (11th Cir.2010). Plotkin argues that IRS agents Leeker, McAdon and Kibort are not entitled to qualified immunity because they acted outside the scope of their discretionary authority when they participated in his probation revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">A \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d involves actions that \u201care of a type that fell within the employee\u2019s job responsibilities.\u201d <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1265 (11th Cir.2004). In determining whether a defendant performed a discretionary function, our inquiry is not whether the act complained of was done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>for an improper purpose, but \u201cwhether the act complained of, if done for a proper purpose, would be within, or reasonably related to, the outer perimeter of an official\u2019s discretionary duties.\u201d <em>Harbert Int\u2019l, Inc. v. James, </em>157 F.3d 1271, 1282 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1266 (explaining that we temporarily put aside whether the act was committed in an allegedly unconstitutional manner, and look \u201cto the general nature of the defendant\u2019s action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Defendants Leeker, McAdon and Kibort are IRS revenue agents. Revenue agents conduct civil examinations to determine a taxpayer\u2019s civil tax liability. Plot-kin does not dispute that conducting a tax examination and testifying in a criminal proceeding about the results of that examination are part of a revenue agent\u2019s duties. Plotkin\u2019s allegations that the revenue agents acted in a knowingly false or unconstitutional manner does not take their actions outside the scope of their discretionary authority. Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that Defendants Leeker, McAdon and Kibort were acting within the scope of their discretionary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Plotkin next contends that probation officer Sanders and IRS agents Leek, McA-don and Kibort are not entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct violated his clearly established due process rights. Specifically, Plotkin argues that the Defendants represented to the court in the probation revocation proceedings that Plotkin had not paid taxes he owed and that they knew their representations were false because (although he had not paid taxes) Plotkin had appealed the tax examinations for those years and could not \u201cowe\u201d taxes until the civil appeal process had run its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">For purposes of the qualified immunity analysis, we examine: (1) whether the facts alleged establish a constitutional violation; and (2) whether that right was clearly established. <em>Randall, </em>610 F.3d at 715. We have discretion to decide which prong of this two-step inquiry to address first. <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S.Ct. 808, 818, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). We note that Plotkin does not identify whether his due process claim is a procedural one or a substantive one. To the extent his is a substantive due process claim, he has not identified any substantive due process right. To the extent he brings a procedural due process claim, he acknowledges he had two probation revocation hearings, after which the probation revocation petition was dismissed. Thus, it is far from clear that there is a due process violation. However, we need not reach this issue because any alleged due process right was certainly not clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">\u201c \u2018Clearly established lav/ is law that is sufficiently established so as to provide public officials with \u2018fair notice\u2019 that the conduct alleged is prohibited.\u201d <em>Randall, </em>610 F.3d at 715. Ordinarily, we look to the case law at the time of the alleged violation to see if the right is clearly established. <em>Id. </em>at 715-16; <em>see Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1349-52 (11th Cir.2002). Prior case law must either (1) contain a \u201cbroad statement[ ] of principle ... not tied to particularized facts\u201d such that \u201cevery objectively reasonable government official facing the circumstances would know that the official\u2019s conduct did violate federal law when the official acted,\u201d or (2) announce a constitutional violation occurred based on specific facts that are \u201cnot fairly distinguishable\u201d from the circumstances the government official faced. <em>Vinyard, </em>311 F.3d at 1351-52. In certain cases, however, the conduct \u201cso obviously violates the Constitution that prior case law is unnecessary.\u201d <em>Randall, </em>610 F.3d at 715-16; <em>see Vinyard, </em>311 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Here, Plotkin does not cite any case law clearly establishing that the defendants\u2019 alleged conduct was unconstitutional. Moreover, we find no merit to Plotkin\u2019s contention that the unconstitutionality of the defendants\u2019 alleged conduct was readily apparent even in the absence of case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">A probation officer is required to, among other things, \u201ckeep informed, to the degree required by the conditions specified by the sentencing court, as to the conduct and condition of a probationer ... and report his conduct and condition to the sentencing court,\u201d and \u201ckeep informed concerning the [probationer\u2019s] ... compliance with any condition of probation ... and report thereon to the court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3603(2), (7). As a special condition of Plotkin\u2019s probation, he was required to \u201cfile all correct tax returns and forms required by the income tax laws of the United States, pay any taxes owed and, as requested by the U.S. Probation Office, provide copies of all filed tax forms.\u201d Thus, Defendant Sanders had a duty to stay informed as to whether Plotkin complied with this special condition and report Plotkin\u2019s failure to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Moreover, the special condition is ambiguous and susceptible to multiple interpretations regarding which years it obligated Plotkin to satisfy his federal tax obligations. Indeed, after two probation revocation hearings, the district court in the Middle District of Florida could not determine its proper meaning and, thus, transferred probation supervision back to the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Second, and perhaps more importantly, it is unclear whether the phrase \u201cany taxes owed\u201d in the special condition refers to the tax amount shown due on Plotkin\u2019s federal return, the tax liability determined by a revenue agent\u2019s examination or the tax liability determined after Plotkin has exhausted any administrative and/or judicial appeals. Under these particular circumstances, we cannot say that every reasonable probation officer and IRS revenue agent would have known that reporting to the district court Plotkin\u2019s unpaid tax liabilities as determined by a revenue agent\u2019s examination constituted a due process violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">For these reasons, the district court properly concluded that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to Plotkin\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims arising out of his probation revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">C. Unauthorized Disclosure Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Plotkin argues that Defendants Leeker, McAdon and Kibort violated 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103 when they provided probation officer Sanders with Plotkin\u2019s tax return information.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">The Internal Revenue Code prohibits employees and officials of the United States from disclosing taxpayers\u2019 return information, \u201cexcept as authorized by [the Internal Revenue Code],\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a), and provides a civil remedy for damages for unauthorized disclosures. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7431. However, disclosure in a judicial proceeding is allowed where \u201cthe taxpayer is a party to the proceeding, or the proceeding arose out of, or in connection with, determining the taxpayer\u2019s civil or criminal liability, or the collection of such civil liability.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(A). Furthermore, damages are not recoverable for an unauthorized disclosure if the disclosure \u201cresults from a good faith, but erroneous, interpretation of section 6103.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Here, Plotkin\u2019s probation revocation proceedings are an extension of his criminal proceedings for tax crimes. As such, the defendants\u2019 disclosure of Plotkin\u2019s tax returns was authorized under \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>disclosure was not authorized, we conclude that the Defendants\u2019 actions fell within the good faith exception given that the Internal Revenue Manual (\u201cIRM\u201d) allowed for disclosure of return information to a probation officer under the circumstances presented here. <em>See </em>IRM 5.1.5.20 (permitting disclosure where the information relates to a taxpayer convicted of a criminal tax violation, the probation officer was charged with ensuring that the probationer complies with internal revenue laws and the information is limited to those years specified by the conditions of probation); <em>Comyns v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 1034, 1034 (11th Cir.2002) (affirming district court\u2019s order concluding that the good faith exception applies if the agents followed the relevant agency regulations and manuals and those regulations and manuals constitute a reasonable interpretation of the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">D. Unauthorized Collection Action Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Under the Internal Revenue Code, a taxpayer may bring a damages claim against the United States \u201c[i]f, in connection with any collection of Federal tax with respect to a taxpayer, any officer or employee of the [IRS] recklessly or intentionally, or by reason of negligence, disregards any provision of this title, or any regulation promulgated under this title.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a)-(b). The action must be brought within two years after the cause of action accrues. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7433(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plotkin\u2019s claim that the probation revocation proceedings were an unauthorized collection action, but do so on statute of limitations grounds. <em>See Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharm., LP, </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that we may affirm on any ground supported by the record, regardless of whether it was relied upon by the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">Count Three of Plotkin\u2019s complaint alleges that Defendants Leeker, McAdon and Kibort used the probation revocation proceedings to try to circumvent the tax collection procedure set out in the Internal Revenue Code. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>Count Three states a \u00a7 7433 violation, that claim accrued at the latest by June 20, 2006, at the second probation revocation hearing. <em>See Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561-62 (11th Cir.1996) (stating that the general rule under federal law is that a claim accrues and starts the statute of limitations period when the plaintiff knew or should have known that he was injured and who inflicted the injury).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plotkin did not file his complaint until June 25, 2008, more than two years after the second probation revocation hearing. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plotkin\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court order granting a motion to dismiss, applying the same standard as the district court, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Randall v.
