Haspel argues that his sentence, at the high end of the guideline range, is unreasonable. Haspel argues that the district court failed to consider the statutory factors for sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), failed to credit expert testimony that Haspel is amenable to treatment for mental illness, and failed to account for Haspel\u2019s undischarged sentence for Medicare fraud. Haspel also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard of review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010). When \u201ca term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment,\u201d the district court has the discretion to decide whether the terms will run concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">Haspel\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court stated that it had considered the relevant sentencing factors, and the district court did not rely on any impermissible factor. Haspel\u2019s sentence at the high end of the guideline range is also substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
