The court imposed an enhanced sentence because Eason was a career offender; he has a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, which the court considered as a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-27\">Eason did not appeal his sentence, but in July 2008, he moved the district court to reduce his sentence based upon his actual innocence, citing this court\u2019s holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number><em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), that carrying a concealed weapon does not constitute a crime of violence for sentencing purposes. Because his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon is not a crime of violence, Eason argued, he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of that crime. The district court denied his motion, and, on April 21, 2009, we affirmed the ruling. <em>United States v. Eason, </em>323 Fed.Appx. 827 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">On February 11, 2009, while that appeal was pending, Eason moved the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence on two grounds: (1) his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to appeal his sentence, and (2) he is actually innocent of his sentence in light of our decision in <em>Archer </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). The district court rejected both grounds and denied his motion. He appealed, and we granted a certificate of appealability on one issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred in determining that a freestanding challenge to a career offender sentence imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, brought pursuant to <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), fails to state a cognizable claim on collateral review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">We withheld consideration of this appeal pending our decision in <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2011). <em>McKay </em>controls the disposition of this appeal. In <em>McKay, </em>as here, the \u00a7 2255 movant, McKay, failed to appeal his sentence and claimed in his \u00a7 2255 motion, as Ea-son does in this case, that he was actually innocent of his sentence on the ground that the district court, at sentencing, erred in treating his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon as a crime of violence. Although the district court denied McKay relief and a COA, this Court granted him a COA on the following issue: \u201c[wjhether the district court erred in finding that [McKay's] sentencing claim about the career-offender enhancement is not cognizable in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and, if cognizable, whether this sentencing claim is proeedurally defaulted in any event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1195. We ultimately declined to address the cognizability issue in <em>McKay, </em>but affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of relief based upon McKay\u2019s procedural default, i.e., his failure to raise his <em>Archer </em>claim on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1195-96, 1198-1200. In doing so, we kept the actual innocence exception to procedural default narrow. <em>Id. </em>at 1199. Specifically, we \u201cdecline[d] to extend the actual innocence of sentence exception to claims of legal innocence\u201d involving guideline sentencing enhancements. <em>Id. </em>The facts of Eason\u2019s case are indistinguishable from <em>McKay. </em>Therefore, we conclude that Ea-son\u2019s claim of actual innocence regarding his guideline sentence cannot excuse his procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
