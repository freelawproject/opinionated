Smith argues that the district court erred in finding he was not in \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury,\u201d a determination that would require Smith to pay the full $350.00 filing fee if he were to re-file his complaints. <em>See id. </em>And relatedly, Smith argues that the district court erred in denying as moot three motions he had pending upon dismissal of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under the PLRA\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008). The \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision \u201cbars a prisoner, who has filed three or more complaints that have been dismissed as frivolous or malicious or for failure to state a claim, from filing a complaint <em>in forma pauperis, </em>unless the prisoner is \u2018under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The magistrate judges\u2019 reports and recommendations confirm, and Smith does not dispute, that he qualifies as a three-striker under Section 1915(g). So, in order to bring his claims <em>informa pauperis, </em>Smith must be \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury,\u201d including at the time he filed his complaints. <em>See Medberry v. Butler, </em>185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that a three-strike prisoner was not \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d because the threat he alleged at Everglades Correctional Institution \u201chad ceased prior to the filing of his Complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In determining whether a prisoner is in imminent danger, we look to the prisoner\u2019s complaint \u201cas a whole,\u201d construing it liberally and accepting his allegations as true. <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1350 (in evaluating whether prison\u2019s failure to treat inmate with HIV placed him in imminent danger of serious injury, looking to the whole of his complaint by considering his allegations of current skin and vision problems as well as the \u201calleged danger of more serious afflictions\u201d in the future).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In his initial Complaint, filed in September 2010, Smith alleged civil rights violations by correctional officers at Everglades Correctional Institution. Among those allegations, Smith claimed that in August 2010 Sergeant Brown punched him in the abdomen, despite his having had hernia surgery nine days before.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Smith initiated a separate action by filing another complaint on February 5, 2011. In that complaint, Smith alleged correctional officers\u2019 retaliation for his September 2010 suit. Specifically, he claimed that Sergeant Brown had repeatedly threatened him with violence more severe than the earlier punch in the gut. According to Smith, on January 9, 2011, Sergeant Brown told him that \u201cif I do not withdraw my lawsuit that the punch to my abdomen was just a taste of what he ... would do to me.\u201d Smith also alleged that, on January 15, 2011, Sergeant Brown called him over from the recreation line \u201cand told me that he don\u2019t give a fuck about what I write up and that the day that he hit me in the abdomen was just an example of what he can do to me and get away with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">The magistrate judge evaluated Smith\u2019s September 2010 complaint on February 10, 2011. In recommending the dismissal of that complaint, the magistrate judge took judicial notice of the allegations in Smith\u2019s February 2011 complaint, but concluded that \u201c[i]t is clear that in the six months following the filing of this [September] complaint, the plaintiff has not been placed in imminent danger.\u201d Over Smith\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissed the case. Smith\u2019s February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>2011 complaint followed a similar course and was dismissed on March 21, 2011. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Accepting Smith\u2019s allegations as true, and viewing them as a whole, Smith has alleged mistreatment and the danger of more serious abuse. <em>Cf. Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1350 (finding imminent danger of serious physical injury where mistreatment exposed prisoner to the \u201calleged danger of more serious afflictions\u201d). Smith\u2019s September 2010 complaint alleged that correctional officers, including Sergeant Brown, engaged in physical violence against him. And his February 2011 complaint contained specific allegations that the physical violence would become more dangerous: fresh threats of severe violence by the same officer, Sergeant Brown. The court was aware of those allegations when it dismissed both the September 2010 and the February 2011 complaints. We therefore conclude that the allegations made in Smith\u2019s complaints showed an \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury,\u201d at the time of filing and since, sufficient to permit his filing these claims <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In light of this conclusion, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s complaints under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including the disposition of the three motions that were denied as moot following the dismissal of Smith\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\">. Smith also argues that the magistrate judge erred in denying his motion to consolidate his February 2011 case with two earlier civil rights cases, including the September 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>case. But Smith did not timely object to the magistrate judge's order denying his motion to consolidate and has, therefore, waived any objections. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) (stating that a party \u201cmay not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-11\">. In his February 2011 complaint, Smith alleges that this incident took place four days before his hernia surgery. For our purposes, the timing of this incident is equally significant, whether it happened four days before a scheduled surgery or shortly thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
