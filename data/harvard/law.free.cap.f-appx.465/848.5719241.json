His role was to cash fraudulent checks and give the proceeds to the people running the scheme. Those people paid Weaver $500 for serving as the \u201cfinal link\u201d in their plan. After Georgia authorities arrested Weaver on unrelated charges, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of passing counterfeit securities of corporations and organizations in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513. He pleaded guilty to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">The presentence investigation report recommended a base offense level of 6 and added 2 levels because the intended loss from the scheme was $6,923.40. Subtracting 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility, Weaver\u2019s total offense level was 6. The PSR recounted Weaver\u2019s extensive criminal history, which included three convictions for possession of cocaine, two convictions for public drunkenness, two convictions for theft, two convictions for criminal trespass, and one conviction for criminal damage to property. The PSR recommended a criminal history category of III, which yielded a guidelines range of 2-8 months imprisonment when combined with Weaver\u2019s total offense level. The statutory maximum was 120 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">After Weaver did not object to the PSR, the court adopted the PSR\u2019s findings. Weaver and the government then argued for a within-the-guidelines prison sentence. The court varied upward and sentenced Weaver to 24 months imprisonment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>court found that the upward variance was necessary because Weaver had a long history of committing crimes, receiving lenient sentences, spending minimal time in jail, and violating probation. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">Well, when he is out, he is committing crimes, and I will not be able to stop him from committing crimes. He will go back and commit more crimes, fraud, bad checks, counterfeit, drugs. So the only protection I can give the public is when he is in jail he at least is not committing crime.... And the guidelines simply do not address this type of behavior, the history that he has compiled and the characteristics that he has indicated.... He would have defrauded as many businesses as possible by passing fraudulent checks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The court also said that Weaver was the \u201cfinal link\u201d in a plan that was \u201cdestructive of trust in the banking systems\u201d and that it intended the sentence to \u201cprovide deterrence for some future criminal conduct by this defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Weaver contends that his 24-month prison sentence is procedurally unreasonable, arguing that the district court imposed that sentence based exclusively on his criminal history and personal characteristics, instead of on a consideration of all \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that it failed to adequately explain the upward variance. He also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, arguing that the district court improperly balanced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by placing undue weight on his criminal history and characteristics and that the sentence created an unwarranted disparity between Weaver and the \u201ccountless, similarly situated defendants, who are and have been sentenced within the guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">We apply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a sentence. <em>United States v. White, </em>663 F.3d 1207, 1215 (11th Cir.2011). We first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to consider the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors or failing to adequately explain an upward variance from the guidelines range. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). If the sentence is not procedurally unreasonable, we determine whether it is substantively reasonable. <em>White, </em>663 F.3d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Our substantive reasonableness review is guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1217. The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in that statutory provision. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Those purposes include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment of the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). Among other factors, the district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guidelines range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging it. <em>White, </em>663 F.3d at 1217. We will vacate a sentence for substantive unreasonableness \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The district court did not commit procedural error in imposing Weaver\u2019s 24-month prison sentence. The record establishes that the court adequately explained its decision to impose an upward variance from the guidelines range and that it properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the court did not explicitly state that it had considered each of those factors, it did explicitly base the prison sentence on a consideration of the applicable guidelines range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, Weaver\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to deter future criminal conduct, and the goal of protecting the public from Weaver\u2019s future criminal conduct. \u201cA sentencing court is not required to incant the specific language used in the guidelines or articulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3533(a) factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Nor has Weaver demonstrated that his prison sentence is substantively unreasonable. His sentence was well below the statutory maximum prison term of 120 months, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum), and the record establishes that the sentence takes into account not only Weaver\u2019s history and characteristics but also the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court\u2019s specific finding that the nature and circumstances of the offense, Weaver\u2019s history and characteristics, deterrence of criminal conduct, and protecting the public from Weaver\u2019s future criminal conduct justified an upward variance from the guidelines range does not amount to an improper balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and does not render the sentence substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
