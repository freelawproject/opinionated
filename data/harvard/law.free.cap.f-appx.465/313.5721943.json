Tatum filed this suit pro se, alleging that \u201crepresentatives of the S.B.A. are ... intentionally forwarding its monthly billing statements, dated and metered postmarked after the due date to generate additional interest and/or subject [Tatum] to a state of delinquency.\u201d The district court dismissed Tatum\u2019s claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction after finding that Tatum failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). The district court was correct that Tatum cannot bring his claim under the FTCA. We nevertheless VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND the case for consideration of jurisdiction under the SBA\u2019s \u201csue and be sued\u201d clause, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 634(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-19\">A claimant may bring an FTCA claim only after he \u201cha[s] first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672, the Attorney General has established regulations prescribing steps an FTCA plaintiff must take in order to present his claim. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 14.1-14.11. One regulation requires that the claimant send the agency concerned a written notification of the incident underlying his claim, along with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>demand for \u201cmoney damages in a sum certain.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2(a). The district court ruled that two letters Tatum submitted to the SBA\u2019s Deputy Inspector General did not include the required \u201csum certain\u201d demand. We express no opinion regarding that conclusion because there is a separate obstacle to FTCA jurisdiction over Tatum\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The FTCA waives the United States\u2019s sovereign immunity for \u201ctort claims.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\u201d) Tatum\u2019s complaint describes the SBA\u2019s mishandling of his loan as \u201cIntentional And/Or Negligent Tort behavior,\u201d but his specific factual allegations are suggestive of an action for breach of his loan agreement with the SBA. The only potentially applicable tort theories would seem to be fraud or possibly negligent misrepresentation of the amounts owed on Tatum\u2019s loan. Claims arising from \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d or \u201cdeceit\u201d are among several types of tort claim that are excluded from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Tatum\u2019s allegations thus fall outside the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)\u2019s corresponding grant of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">To the extent Tatum brings a breach of contract claim against the SBA, the district court may have jurisdiction to hear his claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 634(b), which empowers the SBA\u2019s administrator to sue and be sued and gives district courts jurisdiction to hear such suits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">(b) Powers of Administrator In the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this chapter the Administrator may\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">(1) sue and be sued in any court of record of a State having general jurisdiction, or in any United States district court, and jurisdiction is conferred upon such district court to determine such controversies without regard to the amount in controversy; but no attachment, injunction, garnishment, or other similar process, mesne or final, shall be issued against the Administrator or his property[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Although tort claims against the SBA can proceed, if at all, only under the FTCA, \u00a7 634(b) constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to breach of contract claims against the SBA. <em>A.L.T. Corp. v. Small Bus. Admin., </em>801 F.2d 1451, 1461-62 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Tatum is pro se, so we interpret his pleading liberally. <em>See Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 740 (5th Cir.2002). The substance of Tatum\u2019s allegations may assert a contract claim, but it is unclear whether Tatum intended to sue the SBA or the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court can determine the scope of Tatum\u2019s intended claim on remand, and if necessary give him the opportunity to amend his complaint to more clearly identify the legal basis of his claim and the entity he wishes to sue. <em>See Pena v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 984, 986-87 (5th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>In remanding the case for <em>consideration </em>of jurisdiction under \u00a7 634(b) we express no opinion on whether Tatum has exhausted any administrative procedures that may be required to bring suit under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. The civil cover sheet for the case identifies the United States as the defendant, and Tatum\u2019s complaint lists \u201cUnited States of America\u201d in its caption. But the complaint's second paragraph states that \u201c[m]ade defendant herein, is the United States Small Business Administration ...,\" and the summons for the suit was served on the SBA\u2019s Inspector General, Peter L. McLintock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-14\">. We note that an amended breach of contract claim may also fall within the Little Tucker Act\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity and grant of federal jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00a7 1346(a)(2), if the amended complaint waives Tatum\u2019s right to recover in excess of $10,000. <em>See Woodard v. Marsh, </em>658 F.2d 989, 992 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
