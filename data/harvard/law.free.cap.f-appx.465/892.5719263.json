BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">A.Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">In June 2004, pursuant to a written plea agreement, Bell pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of five grams or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). In the plea agreement, Bell agreed to cooperate fully with the government. In turn, the government agreed that, depending upon when Bell completed his cooperation, it would \u201cconsider whether\u201d Bell\u2019s cooperation qualified as substantial assistance warranting the filing of either a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion or Rule 35(b) motion. The plea agreement further provided that \u201c[i]n any case, the defendant understands that the determination as to whether \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 has been provided or what type of motion related thereto will be filed, if any, rests solely with the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida,\u201d and that Bell agreed he \u201ccannot and will not challenge that determination, whether by appeal, collateral attack or otherwise.\u201d The plea agreement also stated that \u201c[t]he government will make known to the Court and other relevant authorities the nature and extent of defendant\u2019s cooperation and any other mitigating circumstances indicative of the defendant\u2019s rehabilitative intent by assuming the fundamental civic duty of reporting crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">B. 2004 Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">At the start of the August 2004 sentencing hearing, the district court noted that it had denied Bell\u2019s motion to continue sentencing. The district court then asked \u201cwhat is it that [Bell\u2019s] doing.\u201d Defense counsel responded that an active investigation was ongoing based on information Bell provided and that the case agent was present. The case agent agreed with defense counsel that Bell was needed for the investigation and that Bell had \u201cprovided historical information.\u201d The parties agreed that they had been hoping for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. However, defense counsel stated that Bell was no longer seeking a continuance, and Bell \u201cexpeet[ed] he will be back on a Rule 35.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">The district court found that the applicable guidelines range was 188 to 235 months. Bell argued that, although his cooperation \u201chas not risen to the level at this point to receive a downward departure from the Government,\u201d the district court should consider Bell\u2019s cooperation and impose a sentence at the low end of the range. The government did not object to a low-end sentence. The court sentenced Bell to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment and noted that it would carefully consider any Rule 35 motion the government filed. Bell did not file a direct appeal of his sentence or a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">C. 2011 <em>Pro Se </em>Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">In 2011, Bell filed the instant <em>pro se </em>motion asking the district court to enforce the plea agreement and compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion. Bell\u2019s motion claimed that the government had breached the plea agreement by \u201cfailing to make known to the court the Nature and Extent of defendant[\u2019]s Cooperation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>through either a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion at sentencing or a post-sentencing Rule 35(b) motion to reduce Bell\u2019s sentence. Bell\u2019s motion cited several instances of his pre- and post-sentencing cooperation and contended that the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion was in bad faith and not rationally related to a legitimate government end.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The district court denied Bell\u2019s motion. The court found that Bell \u201cwholly failed to demonstrate that the Government\u2019s decision not to file a motion for reduction of sentence was based on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d The court denied Bell\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration. Bell filed this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Under Rule 35(b), after a sentence has been imposed, the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence upon the government\u2019s motion based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The government has the power, but not the duty, to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (involving substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)); <em>United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Wade </em>to Rule 35(b) motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Where, as here, a plea agreement states that the government will \u201cconsider\u201d whether to the defendant\u2019s cooperation qualifies as substantial assistance and that this determination is in the government\u2019s sole discretion, the government does not breach the agreement by failing to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1499-1500 (11th Cir.1993). Under such circumstances, \u201cjudicial review <em>is </em>appropriate only when there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, such as race or religion.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86,112 S.Ct. at 1843-44; <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1052. A defendant who claims only that he provided substantial assistance or who makes only generalized allegations of an improper motive is not entitled to a remedy or even an evidentiary hearing. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844; <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502 n. 5. Therefore, when the plea agreement leaves to the prosecutor\u2019s sole discretion whether to file a substantial assistance motion, we will not review a defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor refused in bad faith to file such a motion. <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502 &amp; n. 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Here, the government did not agree to file a Rule 35(b) motion and did not breach the plea agreement by failing to do so. Rather, the government agreed to \u201cconsider\u201d whether Bell\u2019s cooperation constituted substantial assistance warranting the filing of a Rule 35(b) motion. Moreover, Bell\u2019s motion does not allege, much less show, a constitutionally impermissible motive for the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion. Instead, Bell\u2019s motion alleges only that Bell cooperated before and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>after sentencing and that the government refused in bad faith to file a Rule 35(b) motion. Because Bell\u2019s motion does not meet the threshold standard for judicial review, the district court lacked the authority to compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Bell tries to circumvent our precedent by alleging that the breach he wants remedied is the government\u2019s refusal to \u201cmake known\u201d to the district court \u201cthe nature and extent of\u2019 his cooperation. At sentencing, however, the parties agreed that Bell\u2019s cooperation did not yet warrant a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Bell\u2019s case agent was present and indicated to the sentencing court that Bell had provided \u201chistorical information\u201d but was still needed in an investigation. Bell did not ask the case agent to elaborate on the nature and extent of his cooperation. Bell also did not object that the case agent\u2019s statement was insufficient to inform the sentencing court of his cooperation. In fact, Bell successfully argued that based on his cooperation he should receive the low end of the applicable guidelines range. Under the circumstances, we see no breach by the government of its duty to inform the sentencing court of Bell\u2019s cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">What Bell essentially is arguing is that the government\u2019s duty under the plea agreement to inform the district court of Bell\u2019s cooperation required the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion. This interpretation of the plea agreement would render meaningless the government\u2019s right under the plea agreement to determine, in its sole discretion, whether Bell\u2019s cooperation constituted substantial assistance warranting a Rule 35(b) motion. Reading the plea agreement as a whole, the government\u2019s filing of a substantial assistance motion under either U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or Rule 35(b) triggers the government\u2019s duty to inform the district court of the nature and extent of Bell\u2019s cooperation and not vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Alternatively, even liberally construing Bell\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion as a petition for a writ of mandamus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, we conclude that the district court\u2019s ruling was not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the wording of the plea agreement, Bell could not demonstrate that he had a clear right to, and that the government had a clear, nondiscretionary duty to file, a substantial assistance motion. <em>See Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that a writ of mandamus is appropriate only when (1) the plaintiff has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) no adequate remedy is available\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">As to the government\u2019s alleged failure to inform the sentencing court of Bell\u2019s cooperation, Bell did not show that he had \u201cexhausted all other avenues of relief.\u201d <em>See Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1258. At sentencing, Bell agreed that his cooperation did not yet merit a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion, Bell did not object to the case agent\u2019s description of Bell\u2019s cooperation, and Bell did not raise this breach issue on direct appeal or in a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion. After sentencing, as discussed above, the government does not have an obligation to inform the district court of Bell\u2019s cooperation until it has filed a Rule 35(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in denying Bell\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion, whether it is construed as a post-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>motion under <em>Wade </em>or as a petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">. Bell's <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal states that he is appealing the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. However, it is clear from Bell\u2019s argument on appeal that his overriding intent is to appeal the denial of his underlying <em>pro se </em>motion to enforce the plea agreement. <em>See KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, </em>465 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-11\">.
