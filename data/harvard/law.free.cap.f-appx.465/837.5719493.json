(\u201cDCDC\u201d). He maintains that, when he was transferred to the BOP\u2019s custody, his sentence was recalculated and the 154-day credit that he previously had been awarded while in DCDC custody was deducted. The BOP deducted it on the ground that he failed to submit documentation verifying the award of DCEGT. The BOP was wrong, he says, because it overlooked the fact that he provided it with an official \u201cFace Sheet,\u201d which documents the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">An inmate may challenge with a \u00a7 2241 petition the BOP\u2019s interpretation or administration of credits such as those involved in this case. <em>See, e.g., Byrd v. Hasty, </em>142 F.3d 1395, 1397 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing inmate\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the BOP\u2019s denial of his request to participate in a drug abuse treatment program). Under the National Capitalization Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (the \u201cRevitalization Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 105-33, \u00a7 11231(a)(1), 111 Stat. 251, 734 (1997), the custody of inmates, like Sawyers, incarcerated under the D.C.Code was transferred to the BOP. D.C.Code \u00a7 24-101(a). Section 24-221.01(a) of the D.C.Code provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A76\">Every person whose conduct complies with institutional rules and who demonstrates a desire for self-improvement by successfully participating in an academic or vocational program, including special education and Graduate Equivalency Diploma programs, shall earn educational good time credits of no less than 3 days a month and not more than 5 days a month.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">D.C.Code \u00a7 24-221.01(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">An inmate whose offense conduct occurred between April 11, 1987, and August 5, 2000, is entitled to earn DCEGT. BOP PS \u00b6 12.2(e). \u201cFor D.C.Code offenders transferred to the BOP, educational good time credits are noted in the \u2018Conduct Credits\u2019 section of the DCDC Face Sheet. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 12.2(i). Under BOP policy, however, DCEGT credits are not to be awarded \u201cuntil the D.C. Educational Good Time form is received from the Supervisor of Education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 12.2(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Sawyers, as a \u00a7 2241 petitioner, in claiming entitlement to 154 days of DCEGT earned while incarcerated in the DCDC, had the burden of proving that the BOP had received the D.C. Educational Good Time form from the Supervisor of Education and, having received it, incorrectly calculated his parole eligibility date. Sawyers failed to prove this, however, as the district court properly found. And because he failed to satisfy his burden of proof, he was not entitled to \u00a7 2241 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-10\">.
