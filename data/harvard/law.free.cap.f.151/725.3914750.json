On the 28th day of that month it ceased to do business, and Charles S.

After negotiations had been continued for some days, the board of public works and the defendants reached an agreement which was reduced to writing ami executed under date of March 24,1900, the agreement on the part of the defendants being made in the name of the Terre Haute Pipe Line Service Company, and executed by defendant Ijams as president, and defendant Conzman as secretary. This agreement, among other things, provided that the Terre Haute Pipe Line Service Company should within 20 days from th'e approval of the agreement by the common council of the city of Terre Haute, Ind., pay into the city treasury $10,000, and that the company should within two years spend not less than $100,000 in the construction of its plant, and should also give a bond to the city in the sum of $10,000 conditioned for the faithful performance of the agreement on the part of the company. On April 3, 1900, the agreement, with an ordinance approving and ratifying the same, was submit! ed to the common council and referred to a committee. On April 10, 1900, at the next meeting of the common council, an agreement with the Terre Haute Pipe Line Service Company, signed by defendant Ijams, as president, and defendant Conzman, as secretary, was approved, in which it was recited that the $10,-000 called for by the contract of March 24, 1900, had been paid into the city treasury, and it was agreed that the sum so paid should never be refunded under any circumstances. The ordinance approving the contract of March 24, 1900, was then taken up and passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-7\">\u201c(5) It became known on the 35th day of March, 1900, that the board of public works would make the contract, which was afterwards executed under date of March 24, 1900, and within a day or two afterwards all of the defendants met and decided upon a plan of campaign for getting the contract approved by the common council, and, among other things, agreed that certain members of the council should be seen by certain of the defendants. At the close of this meeting, defendants West and Miller, at the suggestion of defendant Conzman, signed two blank printed forms of notes used by the Vigo County National Bank. Neither of these forms was dated, nor was anytime of maturity stated. In one of them the sum of $10,000 was written, but in the other no amount was stated. Defendant Conzman stated at the time that it was not yet known what amount it would take to purchase the site for the plant, and that he would get both notes signed by some of the other defendants before they were used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-8\">\u201c(0) On April 24, 1900, all the defendants met, and the president and secretary were directed to accept the contract made with the city, and to provide for the bond called for in the, contract, and the president and secretary, together with the consulting engineer, were authorized to locate and purchase property on which to erect the plant. The president and secretary were further authorized to make a contract with J. Motto Martin and Eugene E.

A. Conzman, treasurer, and this account on that date was credited and charged with $10,000. Defendant Conzman filled the blanks left in the note for $10,000 previously signed by defendants West and Miller by giving the note the date of April 10, 1900, and making it payable on demand, and had the same taken by the bank on the 12th day of April, 1900, all without the knowledge or consent of either West or Miller.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b742-5\">\u201c(8) On May 23, 1900, a piece of real estate in the city of Terre Haute which had been selected by defendants I jams and Conzman as, a site for the plant was purchased for the sum of $5,600, and that amount was paid by defendant Conzman out of the funds of the Vigo County National Bank.

The facts in this controversy, as found by the trial court, are not challenged, and error is assigned alone upon the conclusions of law. It is contended on behalf of the plaintiffs in error that no individual liability was created against them under the facts stated, and that the money was loaned either upon corporate credit, or upon the credit of the purported notes of Miller and West. On the other hand, the defendant in\" error contends that recovery is authorized upon the. conceded facts of the association of the plaintiffs in error, as co-adventurers, both in procuring the franchise from the city of Terre Haute and the site for a plant, for the mutual benefit of the associates, and in obtaining and using the means advanced by the Vigo County National Bank to that end. If the .findings establish such state of facts, the associates have received the moneys of the bank which, ex sequo et bono, they ought to repay, and, under the general rule at common law (Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236, 246, l5 L. Ed. 576; Nash v. Towne, 5 Wall. 689, 702, 18 L. Ed. 527; White v. National Bank, 102 U. S. 658, 661, 26 L. Ed. 250; Louisiana v. Wood, 102 U. S. 294, 298, 26 L. Ed. 153), the recovery in assumpsit is authorized. If the plaintiffs in error, together with Conzman and West, the other associates, acted or appeared to act as individuals, for individual benefit, in these steps, and were not recognized by the bank as mere representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tives of a purported corporation in its transaction, their obligation to the bank' is unaffected by the question discussed in the briefs, whether they had formed a corporation either de facto or de jure, and whether the corporators became liable through abandonment of their venture. Obligation predicated upon the equitable doctrine referred to does not involve inquiry as to the liability incurred by stockholders for corporate indebtedness, arising from want of complete organization, abandonment, or other cause, either statutory or at common law. The question in this aspect is whether the plaintiffs in error obtained the benefits of the money advanced by the bank through mistake or imposition (Louisiana v. Wood, supra, and 9 Notes U. S. Rep. 1083), or other circumstances which oblige them \u201cby the ties of natural justice and equity to refund\u201d (Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 247, 15 L. Ed. 576); and for its solution the facts are neither complicated nor doubtful, as we believe, under the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The project of procuring a franchise from the city of Terre Haute to supply the citizens with refrigerating fluids and heating and illuminating gases was the joint undertaking, for mutual benefit, of the several plaintiffs in error and Conzman and West. All of the associates, except West, attended the meetings of the board of public works of the city, and took part in the negotiations for such franchise and in making the offer to pay the municipality $10,000 therefor, and all were alike active in procuring approval of the contract by the common council. In furtherance of the project, the associates executed \"and filed articles, purporting to form a corporation to become the grantee of the proposed franchise, under the name of \u201cTerre Haute Pipe Line Service Company,\u201d the articles stating that the capital stock \u201cshall be five hundred thousand dollars,\u201d and naming the several associates as directors for the first year. Officers were elected, Conzman being chosen secretary and treasurer. While the findings state that the parties became associated for the purpose of procuring the franchise from the municipality, \u201clate in December, 1899, or early in January, 1900,\u201d the above-mentioned corporate form was adopted March 1, 1900, and their negotiations for the franchise commenced on the following day. No capital was paid in and no capital stock was subscribed for or issued at any time, and neither of the associates contributed any funds to the purported corporation, nor was any subscription or cash payment for stock intended by either of the associates. Issues of stock and of bonds was contemplated, but not carried out, whereby shares of stock, \u201cfully paid and nonassessable,\u201d were to be apportioned to these associates for their services as promoters, and bonds were to be sold to provide funds for the purchase of lands, erection of plant, and operation of the business; and \u201cout of the first moneys realized\u201d from such sale it was expressly agreed that \u201call moneys which had been advanced to the service company by the parties to the agreement, or by other parties, should be refunded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">With no funds raised for. the purpose, therefore, the individual associates not only solicited the franchise, but promised the payment of $10,000 and performance of other conditions precedent to the grant, arid understood and discussed the necessity to have means provided for such cash payment, and that, \u201cas evidence of good faith, they woitld also have to purchase probably a lot upon which to construct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>plant,\u201d to s\u00e9cure approval by the common council. There is no finding that they made aqy express agreement or direction for providing these means. It is found, however, that the associate Conzman, who was, as well, cashier of the Vigo County National Bank, was actively engaged with the plaintiffs in error, as co-adventurer, throughout the project, both in the efforts to obtain the franchise and in their meetings to carry out the objects; that, at the close of their conference which \u201cdecided upon a plan of campaign for getting the contract approved by the qommon council,\u201d Ctmzman produced \u201ctwo blank printed forms of notes used by the Vigo County National Bank,\u201d which were then signed by the associates West and Miller, in blank, upon Conzman\u2019s suggestion and stateihent \u201cthat it was not yet known what amount it \u25a0would take to purchase the site for the plant, and that he would get both notes signed by some of the other defendants before they were used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The means for both requirements were obtained from the bank referred to, in this wise: (l) \u00d3n April 3d, Conzman drew a check for $10,000, signed by himself with the appellation \u201cTreasurer,\u201d payable to the order of the city treasurer, which was indorsed by and placed to the credit of the payee on the books of the bank April 7th; on April 12th an account was opened on the books of the bank, in the name of \u201cG. A. Conzman, Treasurer,\u201d with credit and debit for $10,000, and Conzman at the same time filled one of the above-mentioned blank notes with that amount, dated it April 10th, made it payable on demand, and placed such note in the bank\u2014\u201call without the knowledge or consent of either West or Miller.\u201d (2) On May 31, after the purchase of a proposed site for the plant, Conzman paid the purchase money, $5,600, from funds of the bank, by filling out the remaining blank note with that amount (no consent being given), placing the note in the bank, opening an account therein in the name of \u201cG. A. Conzman,\u201d with a credit and debit covering the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">It thus appears that both sums were procured by Conzman at the bank through his relation as cashier, no concurrence appearing upon the part of any other bank official. The funds, however, were procured and used on behalf and for the benefit of all the associates, including himself, and Conzman was in no sense the representative of the bank in the contrivance to accomplish those objects. The purported corporation which was formed to take the franchise, was not only without substance in funds or property when the associates made their offers for the franchise and discussed the need to raise means to meet their promises, but no suggestion appears that such means were to be sought on corporate paper or credit. That they delegated to Conzman the making of arrangements for such means, for joint use and benefit, is unmistakable. With no capital provided for their embryonic corporation, it could not have been expected that any bank or money lender would advance the large amount required upon the strength alone of corporate credit, nor is it reasonable to infer that either of the parties understood the delegation to be so limited. Moreover, the subsequent agreement of the associates (May 28th), in reference to division of stock and issue of bonds for the enterprise, indicates their understanding that they were liable to be called upon for personal advances to meet these payments, as it was expressly provided that \u201call moneys which had been advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>to the service company .by the parties to the agreement, or by other parties, should be refunded\u201d out of the \u201cfirst moneys realized from sale of bonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">As none of the associates offered to furnish the money out of hand, and all were to share the benefits of its use, it was reasonable for the delegate to assume, as he appears to have assumed, that any ultimate burdens would be borne by all; and in any view Conzman was plainly authorized to use the money when obtained for the intended joint benefit. So, in obtaining the money from the bank and applying it for their use, Conzman was exclusively their agent and representative\u2014-not acting as cashier, or on behalf of the bank\u2014and the methods he employed for the transaction at the -bank, whether with or without their sanction, furnish no ground for their defense in this suit. They are of force, however, by way of evidence (1) that Conzman and at least two of the other associates understood that the money was not to be raised upon corporate credit, and <em>(2) </em>that the transaction at the bank disclosed neither loans upon corporate credit, nor entries to charge the bank with acquiescence in a loan upon such credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Whether there was express agreement between the. associates to join in notes for these loans does not appear, nor is such agreement essential upon this issue. The finding, in effect, that Conzman proceeded upon that view, to the extent of obtaining the signatures of West and Miller to blank forms of notes, with the promise to have them signed by others before use, but failed to carry out his promise, and made unauthorized use of such signatures, as purported vouchers for loans, in taking the moneys from the bank, establishes the fact that the bank was imposed upon, whatever the intention was on the part of Conzman respecting other signatures. The money thus taken, with or without the sanction of other officers of the bank, as a loan, was directly applied by Conzman to the intended use and benefit of the plaintiffs in error as co-adventurers. Under the well-settled doctrine at common law, exemplified in the leading cases above cited, the money was obtained at their instance and applied for their use, and recovery is rightly awarded against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
