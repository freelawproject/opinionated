Jahn, then resident at Chicago aforesaid, one James B. Mc-Dermott, then resident at Chicago aforesaid, and one Kathryn G. McDermott, then resident at Chicago aforesaid, and a class of persons then resident within the said United States not capable of being resolved into individuals, and not capable, by reason of a want of information on the part of the said grand jurors, of being all named in this indictment, that is to say, such of the persons, being desirous of engaging in the saloon business in the said City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>Chicago, and o\u00ed entering into a partnership to engage in such business in the said Oity, as should make answer to certain advertisements by him, the said Frank Van Deusen inserted and caused to be inserted in divers newspapers and public prints published in the said City of Chicago, to the effect following, that is to say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1004-4\">\u201cSaloon Partner Wanted\u2014Old Established place, near city hall; honest man; \u25a0each draw $125 moDth; small amount.

And the grand .jurors further charge that at.the time of the devising, and at the time of the executing, of the said scheme and artifice, the said business was not paying large net profits, and was not paying net profits amounting to from two hundred and fifty dollars to three hundred \u2022dollars per month, or any such sum, and was paying little or no net profits, as he, the said Frank Van Deusen, then and there well knew, and the said Frank Van Deusen then and there intended that the said several persons who should pay their moneys for a one-half interest in the said business should not receive respectively, and that none of them should receive, one-half of the net profits in the said business, (if there should be any net profits in the said business,) .and then intended that the said persons respectively should receive little or none of the net profits of the said business, (if there were any) and then intended that the said persons respectively should receive none of the net profits of the said business (if there were any) which he could prevent them from receiving; and the said Frank Van Deusen did merely intend by this means to obtain possession of such moneys as should be paid to him, the said Frank Van Deusen, by the said person so intended to be defrauded, for purchasing a one-half interest in the said saloon business, and the same moneys to convert to the own use of him', the said Frank Van Deusen, without rendering any thing or service of value to the said persons therefor, and thereby to defraud those persons of the same; which said scheme and artifice to defraud, he, the said Frank Van Deusen, when so devising the same, and when executing the same as hereinafter in this court mentioned, intended to effect, and which said scheme and artifice was a scheme and artifice to be effect, by opening correspondence and communication, by means of the Post Office Establishment of the said United States, with the several persons so intended to be defrauded, and by inciting those persons to open communications with him, the said Frank Van Deusen, by means of the Post Office Establishment of the said United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1004-6\">The further facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1004-7\">Samuel H.

An elaboration of that conclusion is unnecessary. The case in this respect is fully sustained by the following decisions. U. S. v. Bernard (C. C.) 84 Fed. 634; Stokes v. U. S., 157 U. S. 187, 15 Sup. Ct. 617, 39 L. Ed. 667; U. S. v. Hess, <em>124 </em>U. S. 483, 8 Sup. Ct. 571, 31 L. Ed. 516; Durland v. U. S., 161 U. S. 306, 16 Sup. Ct. 508, 40 L. Ed. 709; U. S. v. Roring (D. C.) 91 Fed. 881; and this disposes of all the errors principally relied upon, except the one relating to the admission of evidence of the revocation by the mayor of plaintiff in error\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The testimony on which that assignment of error is predicated is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-6\">Edward L. Foreign, called as a witness on behalf of the prosecution, testified as follows: Am a police officer. I understand the saloon at 155 Washington Street is still running; I understand a man by the name of Davis is the proprietor. i do not know .of my own knowledge. I cannot state whether Mr. Van Dusen is in business there at present. I think not. 1 met Mr. Van Dusen at 155 AVashington Street on March 10th. I asked him if lie was Mr. Aran Dusen and he said yes sir. I told him I would like to see his license. He brought me over to the bar and showed me the license, and I took the number and the name \u201cFrank Van Dusen.\u201d Which appeared to be on the license and he asked me if I was taking the numbers of licenses all around, and I told him no, only that place. And he asked me the reason and I told him he had not conducted a proper place of business there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">Mr. Foos: I move that be stricken out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">The Court: IIow is that material?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-9\">Mr. Childs: I want to siiow by this witness that the license had been revoked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-10\">The Court: That is stricken out. If you want to show that it was revoked, show it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">Mr. Childs: Show he is not in business now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">A\u00ed\u2019\\ Foos: AVe do not contend lie is in business, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-13\">The Court: Q AATiat do you know about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-14\">A AVhy I was sent there to investigate by the chief of police and Mr.- and myself got three affidavits, and he recommended revocation of the license to Mayor Dunne who revoked it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-16\">Sir. Foos: 1 do not see any materiality in that, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-17\">The Witness: Here is a revocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-18\">The Court: That is the best evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-19\">Mr. Childs: 1 offer this revocation of license in evidence signed by E. H. Dunne, mayor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-20\">The Witness: That is the original and one copy was 'given to Mr. Van Dusen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-21\">Mr. Childs: Q Is this the original revocation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-22\">A Yes, sir, and the endorsement is on the back by the police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-23\">Mr. Childs: I offer this revocation in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-24\">Mr. Foos: I do not see where that is material your Honor, in any way, shape or form of examination, except to excite the prejudice of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-25\">The Court: How is it material ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-26\">Sir. Childs: AArhy to show that he was carrying on this business and that his license was revoked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-27\">The Court: What is the date of the revocation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-28\">A March 14th, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-29\">Mr. Foos: AVhat does that amount to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-30\">The Court: Was he advertising for partners after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-31\">Air. Childs: Not after that, but this was shortly after Mr. McDermott went into the business with him which was the 12th of February.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>The Court: I do not believe it is material; objections sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-4\">Mr. Foos: I move that the testimony o\u00a3 the witness be stricken out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-5\">The Court: Motion overruled. Exception by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">It will be noted that early in the colloquy, when counsel for plaintiff in error asked the court to strike out the testimony of the witness relating to witness\u2019 taking the number of plaintiff in error\u2019s license, and the reason for taking such number, that plaintiff in error had not conducted a proper place of business, the same was stricken out; and, also, that on plaintiff in error\u2019s objection to the fact of revocation going in as evidence, such fact was excluded. Now the court ought to have excluded as well, the further remark of the witness (a remark not called for however, by any question put) that he was sent there by the Chief of Police to investigate, that he recommended the revocation of the license, and that it was revoked\u2014a failure on the part of the court that would have constituted error, had the attention of the court been specifically called to its presence in the record, and a motion to strike out been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">But the attention of the court was' not specifically called to this portion of the witness\u2019 testimony. The motion to strike out was_ to strike out the whole of the witness\u2019 testimony. Presumably, bad this remark of the witness\u2014a remark as already stated wholly irresponsive to any inquiry put\u2014been called to the attention of the court, as something still standing in the record, a motion to strike it out would have prevailed; for the court\u2019s mind on that subject had already been twice indicated. Nor can we infer that this testimony was referred to subsequently during the course of the trial; for in that case the court doubtless would have stricken it out, as the other statements were stricken out. So that, these being the circumstances, the matter now objected to appears to have been one of those occurrences, that in a trial of considerable length are lost sight of, and exert no final effect upon the verdict \u2014matters raked out of the record only under the closer inspection that preparations for a court of review brings on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Now when a writ of error is predicated upon matter appearing in the record like this, the party who brings the writ must show that he has been reasonably specific in calling it to the attention of the trial court. He cannot be permitted to bring such matters to the surface for the first time in the court of review. That would be unfair, both to the court that tried the case, and to the general administration of criminal justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
