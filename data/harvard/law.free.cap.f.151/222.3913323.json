S. 375, 17 Sup. Ct. 597, 41 L. Ed. 1039, except that the notice is printed on the front, instead of the back, of the ticket. It is to be observed, however, in the case cited that the \u201cCabin.Passengers\u2019. Contract. Ticket\u201d was prefaced by the following statement: \u201cThe Notices to Passengers below, form part of and must .appear on each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>contract ticket.\u201d Moreover, such \u201cNotices to Passengers\u201d thus printed below ended (at the foot of the sheet) with the words in bold type, \u201cSee hack,\u201d and were continued on the back. That decision in effect holds that, unless the condition relied upon is included in that part of the \u201cTicket Contract\u201d which contains the agreement to transport and is signed by the agent of the carrier, it is merely a notice. The notice in this case is on the face of the ticket, but is in the margin and not included in that part of the ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">On the question of fact we agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Decree affirmed, with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
