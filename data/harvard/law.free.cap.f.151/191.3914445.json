They went to a depth of 1,240 feet. Oil-bearing rock was found at 955 feet. It was penetrated 285 feet. This was a proper depth for finding oil in that territory. On May 18th the well was completed and was shot. It was cleaned out on the 19th, and the pumps wore started. Only water came. On the 20th and for some days thereafter small quantities of oil were obtained, when suddenly large volumes of salt water prevented the well from producing oil. The pumps were kept working day and night \u201cuntil some time after the commencement of this suit,\u201d on June 10th. During this time appellees in good faith tried to produce oil, and they operated skillfully in an endeavor to ascertain whether the well could be made a paying one or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-4\">A well in that territory at that time could be drilled, shot, and equipped for pumping in from 15 to 25 days; and contractors, whose terms were reasonable, were available to appellees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">In their operations on appellant\u2019s land appellees expended $1,677 before May 20th; and after that date, $$,704, of which the sum of $1,551 was for machinery, which they subsequently removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">Appellant had full knowledge of appellees\u2019 operations, both before and aftr \u00e9r May 20th, and made no objection whatever prior to beginning this suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-7\">C.

Diamond Plate Glass Co. v. Curless, 22 Ind. App. 346, 52 N. E. 782, and Same v. Echelbarger, 24 Ind. App. 124, 55 N. E. 233, were decided by the Appellate Court in 1899 and 1900, and were expressly disapproved by the Supreme Court in Hancock v. Diamond Plate Glass Co., 162 Ind. 146, 70 N. E. 149, decided in 1904. Knight v. Coal Co., 47 Ind. 105, 17 Am. Rep. 692, decided in 1873, was a case of an estate at will in realty, and its inapplicability to a contract right to explore for oil and gas, substances which, owing to their fugitive nature, are not subject to ownership until reduced to possession, was pointed out in New American Oil Co. v. Troyer (Ind. Sup.) 77 N. E. 739, decided in 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Under the Indiana law appellant had the right to terminate appellees\u2019 privilege of exploration by giving them notice for a reasonable time prior to May 20, 1904, that no further extension would be granted. And appellees could have held over only by finding gas or oil in paying quantities within such reasonable period. Consumers\u2019 Gas Trust Co. v. Littler, 162 Ind. 320, 70 N. E. 363; Same v. Worth, 163 Ind. 141, 71 N. E. 489; Same v. Ink, 163 Ind. 174, 71 N. E. 477; Same v. Crystal Co., 163 Ind. 190, 70 N. E. 366; Dafayette Gas Co. v. Kelsey, 164 Ind. 563, 74 N. E. 7; Manhattan Oil Co. v. Carrell, 164 Ind. 526, 73 N. E. 1084; New American Oil Co. v. Troyer (Ind. Sup.) 76 N. E. 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">But the Circuit Court ruled correctly, we believe, that the rights of .appellees were not terminated by the notice of March 26th, for two reasons. .</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u2018 <em>1. </em>-Appellant h\u00e1d the burden of proving that, from' March 26th to May 20th was a reasonable time within which to ascertain whether oil or gas in paying quantities could be found. The evidence has not been brought before us. That the time was reasonable the master has not found as a fact; nor is it the inevitable inference from the evidentiary facts in the report. True, the report states that a well could be drilled, shot, and equipped for pumping in from 15 to 25 days. But the likelihood of encountering large volumes of salt water is not negatived, nor the fact that the water might be pumped off and a paying well produced. And the reasonable time, for such operations is not disclosed affirmatively. If it were necessary to draw an inference, the facts in relation to appellees\u2019 operations, namely, that they worked diligently and skillfully from April 16th until after Jun\u00e9 10th without being able to ascertain whether oil or gas could be found in paying quantities, might warrant a finding that a period of 55 days was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">2. The notice itself is confused and ambiguous. The lease \u201cwill not be extended beyond May 20th; or delay in operations on said premises be delayed 'beyond such period; nor will a money consideration be accepted for further extension or delay in operations.\u201d Did appellant mean that for a period' beyond May 20th money would be refused, but that diligent operations for the discovery of oil or gas would be accepted until the question of the profitableness of the enterprise could be determined? It is immaterial whether such in fact was her meaning. Immaterial also whether that interpretation was a fair one to put upon the notice. For appellant knew from appellees\u2019 actions that such was their construction of the notice, and she approved of that construction while they expended $3,704 after May 20th, of which $2,203 would be a loss unless they had the right to continue their operations to success.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
