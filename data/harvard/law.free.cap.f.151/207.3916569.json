Tlie day the petition was filed the court appointed a receiver to take charge of the properly of the company until either the petition should be dismissed or a trustee should qualify. The next day, January 5th, on petition of the receiver, the court authorized an examination of witnesses before a referee with respect to the assets of the company. In obedience to a subpoena, plaintiff in error, an attorney at law, appeared for examination on January 18th. The examination was conducted by counsel for the receiver in one of the rooms of the referee\u2019s chambers, before a stenographer, in the absence of the referee. Plaintiff in error was not an officer or stockholder of the Johnson &amp; Knox Lumber Company. He had attended to some matters for it, but had not been its general attorney. At and subsequent to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, lie had no connection with the company. At the time of his examination, and for a considerable time prior thereto, he was the attorney of a Mr. Johnson who formerly had been an officer and stockholder of the lumber company. In his examination it appeared that, as attorney for Johnson, he had been present at negotiations with one Creelman in regard to Johnson\u2019s taking care of promissory notes held by Creelman, on which .Johnson was. liable as maker, indorser, or guarantor.

The referee had gone to luncheon. Plaintiff in error returned to his office, without any agreement having been entered into respecting his further attendance. That afternoon the referee without plaintiff in error\u2019s knowledge entered an order continuing the hearing to the next day, January 17th. About 11 o\u2019clock of the 17th counsel for the receiver telephoned to plaintiff in error inquiring whether he would appear before the referee. Plaintiff in error replied that if his presence was further required he would insist upon being subpoened. ' :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-26\">\u2022 On the 18th the referee certified plaintiff in error\u2019s examination to the \u25a0 court.- On the 19th counsel for the receiver, as the bill of exceptions shows, orally moved for a rul\u00e9 on plaintiff in error to show cause why he should not produce the contract between Johnson and Creelman. No notice whatever had been given to plaintiff, in error, but he chanced to be in court on another matter at the njoment the motion was made. He stated that his position during the examination had been that the document was the property of his client, that his possession of it was privileged, and that the contract therein contained did not relate to the acts or property of the Johnson &amp; Knox Lumber Company; |m.d that he desired an opportunity to resist the motion. In the course of a' colloquy between cotirt, counsel for the receiver and plaintiff iu error; it. appeared that plaintiff in error on returning to his office in the aft-' ernoon of the 16th had found that the dbcument was in his office and not in the hands of his'client, and- that he mailed the document to his client whose residence was in Milwaukee. Thereupon the court, about 11:30 o\u2019clock, ordered that.plaintiff in error produce the document before the referee at 2 o\u2019clock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-27\">, \u201cMr. Latham;.

Xour honor, I feel that the order should be simply an order on me to show cause why the document should not be produced, and then the matter can be referred to tlie/referee, and the question I have presented can be argued. As I have stated before, I am entirely unprepared this morning, as I had no notice of this proceeding and happened in court in another matter entirely, and I do want an opportunity to be heard on the question relating to whether this document is one that I can be compelled to produce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">\u201cThe Court: I will let the order stand as I have entered it, and you can take the matter up before the referee at 2 o\u2019clock.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">At the hour named plaintiff in error appeared before the referee, without the document, and tendered an answer, which the referee refused to receive. The referee certified to the court that plaintiff in error had failed to produce the document, and had tendered an answer. Whereupon counsel for the receiver served notice on plaintiff in error that on January 22d lie would move for ail attachment for contempt \u201cfor failure to produce a certain contract in pursuance of the court\u2019s order of January 19th.\u201d The motion was made orally \u201cthat he \u201ce attached for contempt for two reasons: First, for failing to appear at the time; and, second, for not producing the paper in accordance with the rule entered in this court.\u201d 'Vo affidavit and Information, or complaint, was ever filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">Plaintiff in error filed a sworn answer, to the effect that all of liis actions in question had been taken in good faith, and in the belief that his duty to his client required such a course; that the contract was wholly between Johnson and Creelman and related exclusively to their private affairs; that the Johnson &amp; Knox Lumber Company was cot a party thereto nor interested therein; and that the contract came into his possession in <em>his </em>capacity of attorney for Johnson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-9\">In the course of his testimony plaintiff in error stated, in substance, that when he returned the 'ioeinneut to his client he intended no disrespect to the court or to the referee, but acted only as he believed his duty to his client justified; and that, if the receiver should cause him to be served with a subpoena duces tecum or pliould apply for an order to show cause why the document should not be produced, he desired and intended to raise the legal question of the wv-eiM'rh right; and that, if the court should disagree with him, he would ' firact his client either to take up the ruling for review or to comply with the order-- \"but I did not feel tlmt I should so advise my client until \u00cd had had a hearing on these questions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-10\">Milwaukee is leSi-.-tlun 100 miles from Chicago.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-11\">The cont-aH was executed in duplicate, and Creelman had his copy in Chicago.

Counsel for the receiver saj that plaintiff in error was guilty of three contumacious acts: First, in failing to appear before the referee on January 17th; second, m Jailing to produce tir\u00e9 document before the referee in obedience to the* court\u2019s order of the 19th; and, third, in sending the document to his client on the ,16th:\u2022 - . ' .......</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>At the end of plaintiff in error\u2019s examination by counsel for th\u2019e receiver no matter was left open except the receiver\u2019s right to compel the production of the document. Plaintiff in error had attended in obedience to an ordinary subpoena. When the question arose',and plaintiff in error answered that if he had the paper he would not voluntarily produce it, counsel said \u201cWe will have to subpoena you to produce it.\u201d No fe\u00e9s were paid or tendered for attendance on the 17th. No subpoena duces tecum was served. No notice of an appli-, cation for an order to produce was given. In avoidance, it might be said that each of such steps would have been fruitless on account of 'plaintiff in error\u2019s act in sending the document to his client in the afternoon of the 16th. But this, if true, would merely confess the obvious, that the facts relating to the first charge are worthless except in so far as they may bear upon the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The second charge comes to the same point. Plaintiff in error was not brought into court by legal process. He chanced to be present when the motion was called\u2019 -up. He did not enter his appearance. He did not consent to the order. He asked to have his day in court in resistance to the motion. If in truth a plea of privilege were sust\u00e1ined, an order to produce would be erroneous. This order, being a determination of rights without a hearing, a judgment without process and without trial, was void. And when it is urged that plaintiff in error was not entitled to a hearing because of his act in turning the paper back to his client, the whole case is brought down to the third charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">This question of criminal contempt, for an act not committed in the presence of court or referee, was not formulated in an information or complaint, was not even stated in the oral motion for the writ of attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u25a0 Passing that, we will take the finding as the complaint. The court found that the contract between Johnson and Creelman provided for the payment of debts of the Johnson &amp; Knox Lumber Company; that the filing of the petition and the appointment of the receiver subjected the contract to the jurisdiction of the' court; that plaintiff -in error sent the document beyond the reach of the process of the court for the purpose and with the intent of defeating or impeding the administration of justice; that Johnson gave the document to plaintiff in error because he was an officer of the court; that plaintiff in error held the paper as an officer of the court and in sending it beyond reach of process was guilty of misconduct in his official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The finding that the contract provided for the payment, of debts of the lumber company is in the teeth of the sworn answer.' Of course the filing of the answer did\u2019not require the discharge of \u00a1plaintiff in error. It was open to the moving party or to the court to bring out countervailing evidence. The only claim of such is the examination before the referee\u2019s stenographer. The statements therje.. that the contract was wholly between Johnson and Creelman, and (that Johnson in providing for his indebtedness to Creelman included his liability as indorser or guarantor of a note executed by the luimber com - pany as maker, instead of contradicting, supports the answi <em>'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The document was not sent beyond the reach of the process of the court.' ' Johnson at Milwaukee, though in another district, as a witness-was subject to the court\u2019s process as fully as if he had been in the Northern District of Illinois. Section 876, U. S. Rev. St. [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 667]. Further, the contract was in duplicate, and one copy was in Chicago, subject to use in disputing plaintiff in error\u2019s-sworn answer or for any other purpose to which it could legitimately be put.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">There is no evidence to show that Johnson put the document in plaintiff in error\u2019s hands as an officer of the court below. The record is that plaintiff in error received the paper as attorney for Johnson. Not a shadow of a suggestion appears that this was done for the purposes of or in connection with any matters in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">As to plaintiff in error\u2019s intent in returning the paper to his client, the finding repudiates the sworn answer. Concededly, if an act speaks for itself as being contumacious, the respondent\u2019s oath that no disrespect was intended need not be accepted. But nearly every page of the record confirms the answer. Plaintiff in error\u2019s repeated endeavor was to obtain a hearing upon his and his client\u2019s rights. Nothing in the record warranted a denial of a hearing on the mere-fact that he had turned the paper over to his client. He was not under process for its production. He did not put it beyond the reach of process. It was not even proved that the document was beyond his own ability to produce. While there is no direct evidence that he-continued able to produce the paper, an inference to that effect is deducible from his protest against the entry of the order at 11:3() o\u2019clock that he produce it at <em>2, </em>namely, that it was a physical impossibility to get the document back from Milwaukee by that hour, and also from his testimony touching motive, namely, that he deemed it his duty, according to Dord Mansfield\u2019s holding in Rex v. Dixon, 3 Burrows, 1687, to return the paper to his client who owned it, but that, if on a hearing of a motion against himself the ultimate decision should be against his contentions, he would advise his client to produce the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Our conclusion being that the findings of the court, and particularly the finding of criminal intent, were each without warrant, it is unnecessary to pass upon the contention that counsel for the receiver, in conducting the examination, had an entirely erroneous conception; of the functions of a receivership in bankruptcy pending adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The judgment is reversed, with the direction to dismiss the proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
