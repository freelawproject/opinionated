The Attorney General\u2019s office is empowered to apply to enjoin such fraudulent or illegal activities, to take proof and to issue subpoenas \u201c[i]n connection with any such application\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7 63 [12]). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (42 USC \u00a7 1320d <em>et </em>seq.) authorizes the production of medical records where they are reasonably related to a \u201clegitimate law enforcement inquiry\u201d (45 CFR 164.512 [f] [1] [ii] [C] [1]; <em>see Matter of La Belle Creole Intl., S.A. v Attorney-General of State of N.Y., </em>10 NY2d 192, 196-197 [1961]).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">We agree with Supreme Court that when investigating possible violations of law at a health related facility <em>(see e.g. </em>42 USC \u00a7 1320a-7b), the Attorney General\u2019s office functions as a \u201chealth oversight agency\u201d within the meaning of HIPAA (45 CFR 164.501, 164.512 [d]). The Attorney General has demonstrated \u201cauthority, relevancy, and some basis for inquisitorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>action\u201d <em>(Matter of A\u2019Hearn v Committee on Unlawful Practice of Law of N.Y. County Lawyers\u2019 Assn., </em>23 NY2d 916, 918 [1969], <em>cert denied </em>395 US 959 [1969]), and except where \u201cthe futility of the process to uncover anything legitimate is inevitable or obvious or where the information sought is utterly irrelevant to any proper inquiry\u201d a subpoena will not be quashed <em>(Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v Abrams, </em>71 NY2d 327, 331-332 [1988] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Finally, we note that the requirement of Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12) that a party under investigation \u201cengage in repeated fraudulent or illegal acts\u201d refers to the party operating the business, here respondent nursing home, not to a person in its care. While the subpoenaed records involve incidents of patient misconduct, they reflect respondent\u2019s failure to protect the rights guaranteed to patients under Public Health Law \u00a7 2803-c. Thus, we regard the incidents as relevant to, and indicative of, the overall pattern of mismanagement under investigation, not as mere isolated lapses in patient care.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b208-4\">Nardelli and McGuire, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmTj\">concur in a separate memorandum by McGuire, J., as follows: I agree with Justice Tom\u2019s concurrence that the order of Supreme Court should be affirmed, but reach that conclusion for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Justice Tom\u2019s concurrence upholds the issuance of the subpoenas solely on the ground of the Attorney General\u2019s authority under Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12). I would not rely on that statute. The Attorney General argues that Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12) is not limited to consumer fraud cases, and I do not quarrel with the argument at that level of generality. But it is far from obvious that the Attorney General\u2019s authority under Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12) is so sweeping as to authorize the issuance of subpoenas to respondent seeking the medical records of four residents relating to two incidents of, as the Attorney General characterizes it in his brief, \u201csexually aggressive behavior\u201d by two of the four residents. More particularly, I have serious doubts that these two incidents satisfy the statute\u2019s requirements of either \u201crepeated . . . <em>illegal acts\u201d </em>or \u201cpersistent . . . illegality\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7 63 [12] [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Notably, the Attorney General does not venture any explanation of the \u201cillegal\u201d character of the \u201csexually aggressive behavior\u201d engaged in by the two residents. If the Attorney General\u2019s authority under this statute is so sweeping, it would appear that the Attorney General could issue subpoenas to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>hospital or nursing home whenever he had reason to believe that two patients had been harassed by another patient or that one patient had twice been harassed by another patient. Moreover, under the Attorney General\u2019s view of his powers under Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12), it appears to be irrelevant that the ostensibly \u201cillegal\u201d conduct was not committed by the party being investigated. That is hard to square with the terms of the statute, which authorizes the Attorney General to bring suit and investigate \u201c[w]henever any person shall engage in repeated fraudulent or illegal acts or otherwise demonstrate persistent fraud or illegality in the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7 63 [12]). Although it is not clear what conduct would satisfy the requirements of repeated illegal acts or persistent illegality under the Attorney General\u2019s view, presumably the Attorney General does not contend that two instances of patient neglect or negligent medical care occurring in a hospital or nursing home would be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Justice Tom\u2019s concurrence, however, apparently embraces that extraordinary contention. It first correctly recognizes that \u201cthe requirement of Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12) that a party under investigation \u2018engage in repeated fraudulent or illegal acts\u2019 refers to the party operating the business, here respondent nursing home, not to a person in its care.\u201d It then goes on to state that the two \u201cincidents of patient misconduct\u201d establish the requisite illegal acts by respondent because they \u201creflect respondent\u2019s failure to protect the rights guaranteed to patients under Public Health Law \u00a7 2803-c.\u201d Presumably Justice Tom is referring to paragraph (h) of section 2803-c (3), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]very patient shall be free from mental and physical abuse.\u201d I respectfully submit that it is far from obvious that any nursing home or hospital in this state engages in \u201cillegal acts\u201d within the meaning of Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12) whenever, over some indefinite but perhaps protracted period of time, a patient commits two acts, or two patients each commit one act, that can be characterized as \u201cmental [or] physical abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Instead, I would uphold the validity of the subpoenas under N-PCL 112 (b) (6). The subpoenas are part of a broader investigation\u2014one respondent concedes is proper\u2014into financial and governance issues. In litigating his motion to compel compliance with the subpoenas and the cross motion to quash, the Attorney General made a strong showing of significant financial and governance irregularities. At least under these circumstances, in pursuing his investigation into both possible mismanagement by respondent\u2019s board members and officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>and diversion of charitable funds from its mission as a nursing home, the Attorney General is entitled to assess the extent to which mismanagement and misuse of charitable funds may have resulted in compromised patient care. Determining the scope of the harm done, after all, may inform and thus is relevant to a decision by the Attorney General concerning the appropriate remedial measure <em>(see </em>N-PCL 112 [a] [authorizing various remedial measures in an action or special proceeding brought by the Attorney General under the N-PCL]).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">N-PCL 112 (b) (6) provides that \u201c[i]n connection with any such <em>proposed </em>action or special proceeding [authorized by N-PCL 112 (a)], the attorney-general may . . . issue subpoenas in accordance with the civil practice law and rules\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Matter of Abrams v Alliance For Progress </em>(136 Misc 2d 1022, 1025 [1987]), which respondent relies on, states in dicta that the Attorney General\u2019s authority to issue subpoenas under N-PCL 112 (b) (6) \u201cpresuppose[s] a decision by the Attorney-General to bring the proceedings to the adjudicative stage.\u201d In my view, however, the Attorney General\u2019s authority to issue subpoenas under N-PCL 112 (b) (6) does not depend on an antecedent decision actually having been made to commence one of the specified actions or special proceedings. The word \u201cproposed\u201d certainly does not require the conclusion that such a decision must have been made, and the statute does not state that the Attorney General may issue subpoenas \u201cin connection with any such action or special proceeding that has been commenced.\u201d To condition the Attorney General\u2019s authority to issue a subpoena on an antecedent decision to commence one of the specified actions or proceedings would at least sometimes cause the Attorney General to commence or decide to commence an action or proceeding before being satisfied that doing so was appropriate. For these reasons, and because of the broad scope of the Attorney General\u2019s authority over not-for-profit corporations <em>(see Matter of McDonell, </em>195 Misc 2d 277, 278-279 [2002]), I would construe the word \u201cproposed\u201d to mean \u201cpotential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">I also would reject respondent\u2019s argument, advanced as an independent ground for reversal, that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (42 USC \u00a7 1320d <em>et seq.) </em>forbids it from disclosing to the Attorney General the medical records sought by the subpoena. The Attorney General argues that HIPAA does not bar disclosure of the records sought for two reasons: because the Department of Law is a \u201chealth oversight agency\u201d as that term is defined by the relevant regulation (45 CFR 164.501), and the Attorney General is a \u201claw enforcement official\u201d within the meaning of the same regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tion. Under that regulation, a \u201claw enforcement official\u201d is \u201can officer or employee of any agency or authority . . . empowered by law to . . . [i]nvestigate or conduct an official inquiry into a potential violation of law\u201d or to \u201c[p]rosecute or otherwise conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding arising from an alleged violation of law.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Respondent expressly states in its reply brief that it \u201cdoes not dispute that the Attorney General is a \u2018law enforcement official\u2019 within the meaning of HIPAA.\u201d It contends, however, that it nonetheless may not disclose the medical records because they are not \u201crelevant and material to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry\u201d (45 CFR 164.512 [f] [1] [ii] [C] [1]). Thus, this argument is not an independent ground for reversal but rather collapses into respondent\u2019s challenge to the legitimacy of the investigation that resulted in the subpoenas. As that challenge is without merit, respondent\u2019s contention that HIPAA precludes compliance with the subpoenas also is without merit. As respondent\u2019s reliance on the disclosure prohibitions of HIPAA is easily disposed of on this ground, I would not decide the less simple question of whether the Department of Law is a \u201chealth oversight agency.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\"> The Attorney General does not rely on his authority under Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12) to seek relief on account of \u201crepeated <em>fraudulent. . . </em>acts\u201d or \u201cpersistent <em>fraud\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
