But no claim that warrants legal relief now by a federal court is set forth. As for the claim of citizenship, the district court has correctly explained why that must fail. The court also explained why the other civil and constitutional rights discussed by the Plaintiff state no legal complaint against any defendant. The case must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
