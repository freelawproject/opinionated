Toledo contends that the BIA erred in deferring to the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination given the testimonial and documentary evidence contained in the record. Toledo also argues that she proved that she was persecuted due to nationality and membership in a particular social group of family.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">Before the BIA, Toledo only challenged the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination. As the BIA noted, Toledo failed to offer any \u201csubstantive arguments\u201d challenging the immigration judge\u2019s alternative decision that, even if Toledo were deemed credible, she failed to establish that a central reason she was targeted by her assailants was due to a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 349-50 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, as she failed to exhaust the immigration judge\u2019s alternative decision for denying withholding of removal, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">Before this court, Toledo does not raise her claim for relief under the CAT. It is thus deemed abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
