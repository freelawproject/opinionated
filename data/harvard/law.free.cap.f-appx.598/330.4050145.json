Bashorun maintains she made the necessary showing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>be eligible for asylum and withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Bashorun, however, has abandoned her claims by failing to brief them sufficiently. <em>See, e.g., Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (holding arguments not briefed are abandoned). Her counseled brief states claims in a perfunctory and eonclusory manner. Bashorun fails to cite the record or otherwise discuss pertinent facts, does not apply the relevant legal standards to the specific facts of the case, and provides no legal analysis or substantive discussion of the bases for her claims. Furthermore, she does not address the grounds upon which the IJ and the BIA denied her claims, and does not identify any particular claimed error by them. (Moreover, we need not consider new evidence or claims not' offered in the administrative proceedings or extraneous contentions that do not concern the instant case. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).) Accordingly, Bashorun has waived her claims for relief. <em>See, e.g., Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833; <em>Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 182 (5th Cir.1986) (per curiam); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-30\"> Pursuant to 5th cir. r. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th cir. r. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
