Whether Perkins\u2019s causes of action are vested in his bankruptcy estate so that he lacks standing to bring this appeal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-19\">2. Whether, in determining that Perkins failed to create a triable issue on his discrimination and retaliation claims, the district court erroneously viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-20\">First, because the instant causes of action arose after Perkins filed for bankruptcy, the action did not become part of his bankruptcy estate; and his bankruptcy proceeding had no effect on his standing in the district court or on appeal. Second, contrary to Perkins\u2019s contentions, the district court viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to him; but that court nonetheless concluded that he failed \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 to establish a triable issue for his discrimination or retaliation claims. On appeal, Perkins has not challenged the district court\u2019s legal standards, although he does quarrel about some immaterial facts. The district court mainly concluded that the evidence failed to show sufficient adverse employment acts or to show white employees were treated differently and better. Because Perkins has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>point to a reversible error on the part of the district court, we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the defendants on all of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
