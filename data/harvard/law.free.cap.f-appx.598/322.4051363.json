In the first opinion, we discussed Statin\u2019s argument that the district court erroneously denied his motion for change of venue to Texas state court, which we construed as a motion to remand. <em>Statin v. Deutsche Bank Nat\u2019l Trust Co., </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. \u2014, \u2014, 2014 WL 7235168, *1-*2 (5th Cir.2014). Finding the record insufficient because Statin did not specifically press his amount in controversy challenge below, we remanded the case so that the district court could determine the amount in controversy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-22\">The district court ordered the parties to submit evidence to show the amount in controversy. The Defendants submitted a Residential Broker Price Opinion compiled by JPMorgan Chase Bank that valued the property at $87,500. <em>See id. </em>at-, 2014 WL 7235168 at *1 (\u201cThe value of the property is the relevant consideration for determining the amount in controversy for these common foreclosure cases seeking injunctive relief\u2019 (citing <em>Farkas v. GMAC </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>Mortg., L.L.C., </em>737 F.3d 338, 341 (5th Cir.2013))). Statin did not submit any evidence, although we had previously taken judicial notice that the Harris County Appraisal District valued the property at $62,392. <em>Id. </em>at-, 2014 WL 7235168 at *2. The district court found that the amount in controversy exceeded the statutory minimum at the time of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The record is therefore sufficient to evaluate whether we have subject matter jurisdiction based on removal. \u201c[Rjemoval of an action is proper on the basis of the amount in controversy asserted ... if the district court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds the [statutory minimum].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c)(2)(B). The district court has done just that. As such, subject matter jurisdiction exists and we may now consider the merits of Statin\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Statin raises three non-jurisdictional arguments. First, Statin argues that the district court violated his constitutional rights by dismissing his case without giving him the opportunity to present evidence on the merits. However, the district court accepted all facts alleged in Statin\u2019s complaint as true and held he failed to state a claim. Statin\u2019s argument is nothing more than an attack on the procedure circumscribed by Rule 12(b)(6), which does not violate the Constitution. <em>See Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979) (describing the \u201cmany procedural devices developed since 1791 that have diminished the civic jury\u2019s historic domain [but] have been found not to be inconsistent with the [Constitution].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Second, Statin argues that he will suffer irreparable harm if we do not reverse. But regardless of the consequences of the ruling below, Statin must identify a legal error warranting reversal. <em>Shakouri v. Raines, </em>582 Fed.Appx. 505, 506 (5th Cir.2014) (\u201c[The] failure to address the district court\u2019s bases for dismissing the claims, without even the slightest identification of any error in the district court\u2019s legal analysis or its application to his suit, is the same as if he had not appealed that judgment.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Finally, Statin claims that he lost the opportunity to amend his complaint because the Clerk of Court failed to mail him notice of the district court\u2019s order requiring him to amend his complaint. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 77(d)(1) (requiring the clerk to immediately serve notice of all orders or judgments). However, nothing in the record supports Statin\u2019s argument. Statin did not, for example, provide an affidavit or a copy of the letter showing a late postmark date. As the Defendants point out, the record undercuts Statin\u2019s position: the docket sheet shows that the Clerk mailed the district court\u2019s order on the same day it was entered. <em>See United States v. Moon, </em>129 F.3d 609 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cThat some notice was mailed ... is evidenced by the docket entry stating that the parties were notified.\u201d). Statin himself acknowledges that he received the district court\u2019s order more than a week before the deadline for amending his complaint. Therefore, Statin cannot show that the Clerk failed to provide him timely notice or violated any rule of civil procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
