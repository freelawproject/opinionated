He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 160 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release on each count. He contends that the district court erred by applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">We review the district court\u2019s factual finding that \u00a7 201.1(b)(1) applies for clear error. <em>See United States v. King, </em>773 F.3d 48, 52 (5th Cir.2014). The enhancement was based on the firearm found with $20,000 in cash in a dresser drawer in a bedroom in Miller\u2019s mother\u2019s house. Regardless of whether the $20,000 was intended to be used in a subsequent drug transaction, a preponderance of the evidence plausibly established a temporal and spatial relationship between the firearm, Miller\u2019s drug dealing, and Miller. <em>See id. </em>at 52-53. The firearm was found in the same dresser drawer as $20,000 in drug proceeds and in the same house where Miller admitted that he gave drug proceeds to his sister to store elsewhere and packaged $66,000 in drug proceeds to be used in a subsequent drug transaction. This undisputed evidence supported the district court\u2019s implicit inference that Miller possessed the firearm to protect himself and his drug proceeds. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>161 F.3d 909, 912-13 (5th Cir.1998). The district court also did not clearly err in finding that Miller did not meet his burden of showing that it was clearly improbable that the firearm was related to his drug dealing. <em>See King, </em>773 F.3d at 52-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
