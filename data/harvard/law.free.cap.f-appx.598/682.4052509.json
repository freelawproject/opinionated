On appeal, Cooper argues that: (1) the district court procedurally erred in determining the guideline range for the revocation by finding his Florida state conviction for false imprisonment, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.02, was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2; and (2) his sentence, imposed below the guideline range, was substantively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). When reviewing for reasonableness, we apply the abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 954 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 995, 184 L.Ed.2d 772 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">First, we are unpersuaded by Cooper\u2019s claim that the district court procedurally erred in determining the guideline range for the revocation. If a defendant violates a condition of supervised release, the district court may, after considering the relevant factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), continue supervised release or revoke the sentence of supervised release and resen-tence the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other things, the district court must consider the correct advisory guideline range. <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)). \u201c[The] recommended sentencing range is based on the classification of the conduct that resulted in the revocation and the criminal history category applicable at the time\u201d of the defendant\u2019s original sentencing. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2007) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Pursuant to \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines, upon a finding of a Grade A violation, the court \u201cshall revoke\u201d supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l). A \u201cGrade A\u201d violation is defined as \u201cconduct constituting (A) a federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that (i) is a crime of violence.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">Section 4B1.2(a) defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include any offense that either \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d or that \u201cis burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), (2). Notably, the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), and, therefore, we apply a similar analysis in deciding whether a given offense qualifies as a crime of violence or a violent felony. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">When analyzing a case under \u00a7 4B1.2, we generally apply a \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d looking \u201cno further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011) (quotations omitted). In doing so, we disregard the label placed on the state crime and instead look to whether the conduct necessary to establish a conviction under the state law is a natural equivalent to the offenses designated as crimes of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 1242. In <em>United States v. Schneider, </em>we conducted a categorical analysis of Florida\u2019s false imprisonment statute to determine whether Florida\u2019s false imprisonment statute is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. 681 F.3d 1273, 1276 (11th Cir.2012). We found that false imprisonment was \u201ccomparable to [the enumerated offense of] burglary with respect to the degree and kind of risk produced\u201d because the risk created by false imprisonment, even if accomplished by deceit, \u201carises from the possibility that the victim might try to resist or escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281. Accordingly, we held that Florida\u2019s false imprisonment crime, \u201ceven when accomplished secretly, produces a serious potential risk of physical injury to another for purposes of the residual clause of the [ACCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1282 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In this case, the district court did not commit procedural error in finding that Cooper's Florida false imprisonment conviction was categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d based on our holding and analysis of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.02 in <em>Schneider. </em>Although <em>Schneider </em>involved an inquiry as to whether Florida\u2019s false imprisonment statute was categorically a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA, the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2 is \u201cvirtually identical,\u201d and the analysis is similar. <em>Alexander, </em>609 F.3d at 1253. In particular, <em>Schneider </em>concluded that false imprisonment was \u201ccomparable\u201d to the enumerated offense of burglary, which is also designated as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Schneider, </em>681 F.3d at 1281; <em>Lockley, </em>632 F.3d at 1242; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">As for Cooper\u2019s argument that false imprisonment does not ordinarily entail a risk of injury, this was also foreclosed by <em>Schneider. </em>There, we held that the risk of injury in false imprisonment arose \u201cfrom the possibility that the victim might try to resist or escape\u201d even in situations where the victim was imprisoned \u201csecretly.\u201d <em>Schneider, </em>681 F.3d at 1281. Finally, it does not matter whether false imprisonment constitutes \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct\u201d because false imprisonment is not a crime of strict liability, negligence, or recklessness. <em>Id. </em>at 1280-82. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Cooper\u2019s conviction constituted a Grade A felony for purposes of determining his advisory guideline range under \u00a7 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Nor is Cooper\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable. To assess substantive reasonableness, we consider the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion and imposes a substantively unreasonable sentence when it fails to afford consideration to relevant [\u00a7 3353(a) ] factors that were due significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>vant factor, or commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted). But \u201cwe will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [court] accorded to a given [\u00a7 3553(a)] factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted). We reverse only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation omitted). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Ordinarily, we expect a sentence within the advisory guideline range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed below the statutory maximum is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Here, Cooper\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. As the record shows, the court properly weighed the factors and carefully reviewed the evidence \u2014 including the testimony of the victim, the proceedings in Cooper\u2019s state court conviction, and Cooper\u2019s medical records \u2014 before imposing a sentence below the guideline range and the two-year statutory maximum penalty. In addition, the district court discussed: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, which involved the solicitation of a prostitute and restraining of the victim; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including Cooper\u2019s health conditions; and (3) the applicable guidelines, including the guideline-imprisonment term for a Grade C violation, before stating that the 14-month sentence was \u201csufficient but ... not greater than necessary\u201d to satisfy the purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4)(B), 3583(e)(3). The record also reveals that the district court did not abuse its discretion by giving significant weight to the aggravating factors \u2014 including the nature and seriousness of the offense \u2014 nor did it improperly insert the judge\u2019s personal judgment in the decision. Finally, there is no evidence that the court gave undue weight, or factored in his prior convictions, beyond his criminal history category, in determining the sentence at hand. Accordingly, Cooper has not met his burden to demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, nor did the court abuse its discretion in imposing a total 14-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-11\">. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), when a defendant violates a condition of his supervised release, the district court must consider the factors outlined in \"section[s] 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u201d in determining whether to impose a sentence of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1308 (11th Cir.2014); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). These factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with needed training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (5) the kinds of sentences and the guideline range; (6) any pertinent policy statements; (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (8) the need to provide restitution to any victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
