After review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">In January 2007, while in the United States on a visitor\u2019s visa, Mora applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), listing Lobo as a derivative beneficiary. The Department of Homeland Security subsequently issued Petitioners\u2019 notices to appear, charging them with removability pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 287(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for having remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">The IJ conducted a merits hearing on Mora\u2019s asylum application at which she and one of her sons testified. According to the credible hearing testimony, Petitioners were active members of the anti-Chavez Democratic Action Party. In July 2003, people whom Petitioners think may have been \u201cChavistas\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> broke into Petitioners\u2019 home, damaging the roof, refrigerator, kitchen, and living room furniture; defacing family pictures; and writing graffiti on the kitchen wall. Petitioners then began receiving threatening phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">In September 2003, Petitioners\u2019 son Frank, a priest and a chaplain with the Venezuelan military, was riding in a helicopter with several high-ranking military personnel when it crashed. Mora and Frank both testified that they believed that the crash was the result of sabotage targeting Frank and the other military officials for their anti-Chavez beliefs. The official government report following the crash concluded that it was an accident. Later that month, Petitioners\u2019 home was broken into a second time and the intruders took dishes, emptied drawers, and again wrote graffiti on the walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">- In January 2004, as he was leaving their home, Petitioners\u2019 son William was assaulted by people Petitioners believed to be Chavistas. The Chavistas hit William really hard, but ran off when the neighbors came outside. William did not go to the hospital for medical treatment, but his bruises and hematomas were treated at home. Petitioners continued to receive harassing phone calls and people they believed to be Chavistas often drove motorcycles by Petitioners\u2019 home at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">In October 2004, Petitioners opened a video rental store, and, in January 2005, presumed Chavistas came into the store asking why Petitioners only carried American films. In February 2005, the windows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>of the Petitioners\u2019 car were broken while it was parked in the video store\u2019s parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In October 2006, Lobo was in a car accident after he turned in the proceeds of a raffle held to benefit Petitioners\u2019 political party and the parties\u2019 presidential candidate. Lobo got <em>nervous </em>because he thought he was being following by Chavis-tas, and he lost control of the vehicle and crashed. Later that month, Petitioners decided to leave the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">After the hearing, the IJ denied Mora\u2019s application and ordered Petitioners removed to Venezuela. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Before this Court, Petitioners do not dispute that they are removable as charged, but contend that the BIA erred in finding that Mora did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). When the BIA explicitly agrees with the findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the BIA and IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). Here, because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings regarding past persecution and well-founded fear of future persecution, we review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">In a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Under the substantial evidence test, we draw every reasonable inference from the evidence in favor of the decision, and reverse a finding of fact only if the record compels a reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 1351. We must affirm if the BIA\u2019s decision is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is insufficient to reverse. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). The INA defines a refugee as a person who cannot return to his or her home country due to \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate either past persecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution, based on a statutorily listed factor. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). If the applicant demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebutable presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>If the applicant cannot demonstrate past persecution, she must demonstrate that her well-founded fear of future persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">We have held that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007). In determining whether the petitioner has suffered persecution, we consider the cumulative effects of the incidents. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">We have previously concluded that circumstances involving only minimal violence do not compel a conclusion of persecution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353 (upholding the BIA\u2019s determination of no past persecution where the petitioner was \u201carrested while participating in a student demonstration, interrogated and beaten for five hours, and detained for four days, but ... did not prove that he suffered any physical harm,\u201d and state authorities monitored him after his release and ordered him to appear before a university disciplinary committee and a state court); <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (upholding the BIA\u2019s determination of no past persecution where the petitioner was threatened with arrest by students who lacked the power to carry out that threat, \u201cin conjunction with [a] minor beating\u201d that merely resulted in \u201cscratches and bruises\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">On the other hand, we have held that repeated death threats accompanied by the attempted kidnapping of the petitioner\u2019s daughter and the attempted murder of the petitioner whose moving vehicle was shot at multiple times, but he was not struck by the bullets or physically injured, constituted persecution. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1233. We have also held that the petitioner suffered past persecution based on the totality of the verbal death threats, an attempted attack, and one attack by three gunmen who threw the petitioner to the ground, hit him with the butt of a rifle, and broke his nose that occurred over an 18-month period. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2007). In addition to in-person threats or violence against the petitioner, we have held that threats against others can support a claim of past persecution where the threat \u201cconcomitantly threatens the petitioner.\u201d <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1009 &amp; n. 7 (finding past persecution where the applicant suffered \u201crepeated death threats, two physical attacks [which resulted in minor physical injuries], the murder of a family friend, and a kidnapping cut short only by a harrowing escape\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Mora failed to establish past persecution. Mora\u2019s testimony established that, over an approximately three-year period, her family\u2019s home was broken into and vandalized twice, she received an unspecified number of threatening and harassing phone calls, people suspected of being Chavistas drove past her home on motorcycles at night, her car windows were broken, one son was assaulted, her other son was in a helicopter crash, and her husband was in a car accident. Even when viewed cumulatively, we cannot conclude that these incidents compel a finding that Mora suffered persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Unlike <em>De Santamar\u00eda, Sanchez Jimenez, </em>and <em>Mejia, </em>this is not a case where the threats were accompanied by attacks or attempted attacks on Mora or her family members. While Mora asserts that the helicopter crash was an attempt on her son Frank\u2019s life based on his political activity, neither she nor Frank offer anything more than their own speculation that the crash was the result of sabotage or that Frank, who was in the company of high-ranking military officials, was specifically targeted for his anti-Chavez beliefs. Moreover, the official report on the helicopter crash concluded that it was an accident. Likewise, there is no evidence that Lobo\u2019s accident was an attempt on his life. Mora\u2019s own \u25a0testimony reflects that Lobo got nervous because he believed he was being followed, lost control of his vehicle, and drove off the road into a telephone box, not that Chavis-tas intentionally forced him off the road. Thus, we are left with the threatening phone calls, the house and car being broken into, motorcycles driving past the home, and the assault of Petitioners\u2019 other son that resulted in nothing more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>bruises. When compared to our precedent, these remaining incidents do not compel the finding that these incidents were anything more than isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353; <em>Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1174. Because Mora did not establish past persecution, there is no presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the BIA did not err in denying Mora\u2019s asylum application, and we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-12\">. Lobo is a citizen of Venezuela and a native of Colombia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-18\">. The term \"Chavista\u201d indicates a person supportive of the Chavez regime in Venezuela.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b758-15\">. To the extent that Petitioners\u2019 appellate brief is construed as raising an argument that she established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a pattern or practice of persecution, we lack jurisdiction to review this argument because she is raising it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006) (stating if a petitioner has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to consider the claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b758-24\">. Petitioners' petition for review does not challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of Mora's claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief, and thus, these claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v.
