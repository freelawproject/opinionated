For the reasons herein, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Thorne filed the present lawsuit in response to METRO\u2019S termination of his employment as a Bus Operator on March 29, 2013. In his original petition, Thorne alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 resulting in discrimination, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination. Thorne also alleged violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution as well as corresponding Texas constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The district court dismissed Thorne\u2019s lawsuit for \u201cwant of prosecution.\u201d Thorne appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal. On appeal, Thorne fails to provide any legal argument as to why the district court\u2019s dismissal was erroneous. Thorne provides no legal authority other than a citation to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55, which governs a court\u2019s entry of a default judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d <em>Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988) (citations omitted). Accordingly, Thorne has inadequately briefed his claim and, therefore, has effectively abandoned it. <em>See United States v. Knezek, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 321 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\">. To the extent that Thorne argues that the district court erred in not granting his motion for default judgment, we disagree. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for default judgment for abuse of discretion, keeping in mind that a default judgment is a drastic remedy that should only be resorted to by courts in extreme situations. <em>See Lewis v. Lynn, </em>236 F.3d 766, 767 (5th Cir.2001). Thome did not present to the district court, and has not presented to this court, facts indicating that this case presents such an extreme situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
