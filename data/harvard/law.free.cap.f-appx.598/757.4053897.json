Kennedy challenges the four-level increase of his base offense level for having \u201cotherwise used\u201d a dangerous weapon, a sledgehammer. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) (Nov.2013). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Even if we were to assume that the district court erred by applying the \u201cotherwise used\u201d enhancement, that error was harmless because it did not affect Kennedy\u2019s sentence. The district court announced that it would have imposed the same sentence without the enhancement \u201cto adequately take into consideration the [statutory] sentencing factors,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2006). Kennedy\u2019s sentence of 70 months is within his advisory guideline range, and we ordinarily expect that a sentence within the advisory range is reasonable, <em>see United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). And Kennedy\u2019s sentence is below his maximum statutory sentence of 20 years of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">We AFFIRM Kennedy\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
