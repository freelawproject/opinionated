In his instant petition, Hankerson again relied on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), to argue that he should not have had his sentence enhanced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because his prior conviction for aggravated battery did not constitute a violent felony. As background, in dismissing an earlier \u00a7 2241 habeas petition, the district court had adjudicated on the merits Hankerson\u2019s claim that, under <em>Begay, </em>his prior conviction for driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) did not constitute a violent felony for purposes of the career-offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1. In its order dismissing that earlier petition, the district court had reasoned that (1) the petition was untimely because Hankerson had filed it more than a year after the Supreme Court had decided <em>Begay; </em>(2) he could not satisfy the requirement of <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), of demonstrating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense; (3) he had not received a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum, such that, under <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), </em>the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) did not apply to his sentencing claim; and (4) his claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d of the career-offender enhancement failed because he did not allege that he was factually innocent of his offenses of conviction, and the actual-innocence exception did not apply to claims of guidelines error.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>On appeal, Hankerson argues the merits of his claim that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of his career-offender enhancement because his prior conviction for aggravated battery did not constitute a violent felony. Nevertheless, he provides no argument in response to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition as successive under \u00a7 2244(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Upon a thorough review of the record, and after consideration of Hankerson\u2019s brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2013). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Under \u00a7 2241, a district court has the power to grant a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner in custody in that district. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a), (d). Under \u00a7 2244(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS5Y\">No circuit or district judge shall be required to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the detention of a person pursuant to a judgment of a court of the United States if it appears that the-legality of such detention has been determined by a judge or court of the United States on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus, except as provided in section 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a). In <em>Antonelli v. Warden, </em>we held that a district court erred in dismissing a petitioner\u2019s second \u00a7 2241 petition for the petitioner\u2019s failure to obtain our permission to file a second or successive petition for habeas corpus relief, as \u00a7 2241 petitions are not subject to our \u201cgatekeeping\u201d function as \u00a7 2255 motions are. 542 F.3d 1348, 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Nevertheless, we affirmed the district court\u2019s alternative dismissal of the petition under \u00a7 2244(a) upon its finding that the claims in the second petition were \u201csuccessive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352. We concluded that, because the claims raised in the second \u00a7 2241 petition previously had been adjudicated on the merits in the first \u00a7 2241 petition, the second \u00a7 2241 petition was successive, and the district court properly dismissed it under \u00a7 2244(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-15\">The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-16\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-17\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, dr otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). We have explained that this definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). <em>United States v. Chitwood, 676 </em>F.3d 971, 975 n. 2 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">In <em>Begay, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a New Mexico DUI conviction constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. 553 U.S. at 139-40, 128 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>1583-84. The Supreme Court interpreted the enumerated list of burglary, arson, extortion, and the use of explosives as having a limiting effect on the residual clause, \u201cor otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141-43, 128 S.Ct. at 1584-85. The Court then concluded that the residual clause did not cover all crimes that involved a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d but only those crimes that were \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to the enumerated list of crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 128 S.Ct. at 1584-85 (citation omitted). The Court also noted that all of the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes \u201ctypically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. at 1586 (quotation marks omitted). By contrast, New Mexico\u2019s DUI statute did not involve such conduct, and, thus, did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Id. </em>at 145-48, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">A one-year statute of limitations applies to the filing of habeas corpus petitions and motions to vacate. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(d)(1), 2255(f). The limitation period runs from the date on which (1) the judgment of conviction became final; (2) an unconstitutional impediment to filing was removed; (3) a new retroactively applicable right was initially recognized by the Supreme Court; or (4) facts supporting new claims could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence, whichever date is latest. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(d)(1), 2255(f). The one-year statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 2241 habeas petitions. <em>See Peoples v. Chatman, </em>393 F.3d 1352, 1353 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas petition was subject to the one-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)); <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1058-62 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that there was a single ha-beas corpus remedy for state prisoners governed by both \u00a7 2241 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and that, thus, the habeas corpus remedy authorized by \u00a7 2241 was subject to the restrictions of \u00a7 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The district court\u2019s power to grant a writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241 is limited by the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e), which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by [a \u00a7 2255 motion], shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). When a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h). Such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1307-08. In <em>Wofford, </em>we stated that a petitioner meets the requirements of the savings clause when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. 177 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">In <em>Gilbert, </em>we held that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) \u201cdoes not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the sentencing guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d 640 F.3d at 1323. We initially noted that the text of the savings clause does not indicate that it authorizes the filing of a \u00a7 2241 petition to remedy a guidelines miscalculation that can no longer be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1307. Furthermore, the bar on filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion could not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of a prisoner\u2019s detention, or otherwise \u201cthe savings clause would eviscerate\u201d the statutory bar on successive motions to vacate. <em>Id. </em>at 1308. We emphasized that one of the principle purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) was to ensure a greater degree of finality for convictions, and that permitting prisoners to use the savings clause to assert guidelines-based attacks after the denial of a first \u00a7 2255 motion would wreak havoc on the finality interests that Congress sought to protect by imposing a statutory bar on successive motions. <em>Id. </em>at 1310-11. We also rejected Gilbert\u2019s argument that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of being a career offender because \u201c[a] defendant who is convicted and then has the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement, or any other guidelines enhancement, applied in the calculation of his sentence has not been convicted of being guilty of the enhancement. If guidelines enhancements were crimes, they would have to be charged in the indictment and proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320. <em>See also Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132 (11th Cir.2014) (en banc) (holding that a <em>Begay </em>claim is not cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 motion unless the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing Hankerson\u2019s instant \u00a7 2241 petition as successive under \u00a7 2244(a). The district court adjudicated the merits of his <em>Begay </em>argument in his first \u00a7 2241 petition. While he now relies on <em>Begay </em>to challenge a separate prior conviction for aggravated battery instead of the prior DUI conviction he sought to challenge in his initial \u00a7 2241 petition, the district court\u2019s reasoning for rejecting his reliance on <em>Begay </em>\u2014 timeliness and failure to satisfy the requirements of <em>Wofford </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>\u2014 was not limited to his challenge to his DUI conviction and would apply equally to his current challenge to his aggravated-battery conviction. Thus, because the district court previously adjudicated his <em>Begay </em>claim on the merits in his first \u00a7 2241 petition, his second \u00a7 2241 petition again raising <em>Begay </em>as the basis for challenging his career-offender sentence was successive, and the district court properly dismissed it under \u00a7 2244(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
