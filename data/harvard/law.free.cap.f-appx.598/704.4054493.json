The district court sentenced Dixon as an armed career criminal after concluding that his extensive criminal history included the requisite three prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Dixon challenges for the first time on appeal his status as an armed career criminal, contending that one of his prior convictions was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and that another was not a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">Ordinarily, we review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). <em>See United States v. Kirk, </em>767 F.3d 1136, 1138 (11th Cir.2014). The same goes for whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2009). But because Dixon did not challenge his status as an armed career criminal at his sentence hearing, we consider only whether the district court plainly erred in sentencing Dixon as one. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1283 (11th Cir.2006). To prevail under plain -error review, Dixon must show: \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). If Dixon makes these showings, we may then exercise our discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously \u201caffects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Error is not plain unless it is clear or obvious under our case law or the Supreme Court\u2019s. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Joseph, </em>709 F.3d 1082, 1095-96 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cIt is the law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (same); <em>United States v. Magluta, </em>198 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>F.3d 1265, 1280 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] district court\u2019s error is not \u2018plain\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019 if there is no precedent directly resolving a[n] issue.\u201d), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>203 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Dixon contends that two of his prior convictions are not ACCA predicate offenses. The first is a 1998 Georgia felony conviction for obstructing or hindering a law enforcement officer, in violation of Georgia Code section 16-10-24(b) (1998). Dixon argues that this offense is not a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d The second is a 1998 Georgia felony conviction for possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute it, in violation of Georgia Code section 16-13-30(j) (1998). Dixon argues that this offense is not a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Under Georgia Code section 16 \u2014 10\u2014 24(b) (1998), anyone who \u201cknowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any law enforcement officer ... in the lawful discharge of his official duties by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer ... is guilty of a felony.\u201d We have not explicitly considered in a published opinion whether a conviction under this statute qualifies as a predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. We have, however, asked the same question \u2014 and answered it in the affirmative \u2014 with respect to a nearly identical Florida statute. <em>See United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that a conviction under Florida Statute section 843.01, which provides that anyone who \u201cknowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer ..., is guilty of a felony,\u201d is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)). Because error is not plain unless it is \u201cclear under current law,\u201d and our current law clearly cuts against Dixon\u2019s claim, he has failed to demonstrate plain error. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777; <em>see Joseph, </em>709 F.3d at 1095-96; <em>Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291; <em>Magluta, </em>198 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">As for his drug conviction, Dixon contends that it is not a predicate \u201cserious drug offense\u201d because \u201cdiscovery in the case showed that the amount of marijuana he possessed was less than 28 grams or an ounce and therefore he was actually guilty of Misdemeanor Possession of Marijuana and that the sentence is apparently illegal.\u201d That argument is meritless. The statute under which Dixon was convicted makes it a felony for any person to \u201cpossess with intent to distribute marijuana.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-13-30(j)(1)-(2) (1998). Thus, the quantity of marijuana that Dixon possessed with intent to distribute is irrelevant. <em>See United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2003). Dixon\u2019s drug conviction falls squarely within the ACCA\u2019s definition of a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\">. Generally, a defendant convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), as Dixon was, faces a sentence of up to 120 months imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(2). But if he is deemed an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), he faces a sentence of 180 months to life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e). The ACCA's harsher penalties apply if the defendant \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
