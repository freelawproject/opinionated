Based on this guilty plea, the pre-senteneing report applied a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). It further noted an additional one-level reduction under section 3El.l(b) would be withheld by the government because Aguilar-Munoz \u201cfailed to waive certain appellate rights.\u201d Aguilar-Munoz filed a written objection to the withholding of this additional one-level reduction. Subsequently, he offered to conditionally and partially waive his right to appeal and provided the government with a signed waiver. The government agreed in principle but insisted Aguilar-Munoz sign an alternative form agreement. Aguilar-Munoz never signed the agreement, and the case proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">At sentencing the parties discussed their inability to reach an agreement with respect to Aguilar-Munoz\u2019s offer to waive his appellate rights, and counsel for the defendant again \u201cobjected] to the denial of the third point.\u201d Consistent with governing precedent at the time, the district court overruled the objection. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Since Aguilar-Munoz\u2019s sentencing, the guidelines have been amended to provide: \u201cThe government should not withhold [a \u00a7 3El.l(b) ] motion based on interests not identified in \u00a7 3E1.1, such as whether the defendant agrees to waive his or her right to appeal.\u201d We have held this amendment to be a clarification, and thus retroactive. <em>See United States v. Palacios, </em>756 F.3d 325, 326 (5th Cir.2014). To the extent it interferes with application of Amendment 775, <em>Newson </em>is therefore no longer the law. <em>Id. </em>at 326 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Based on the foregoing developments, if the government withheld the one-level reduction based on Aguilar-Munoz\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal, there was undisputedly error. <em>See United States v. Torres-Perez, </em>No. 14-10154, 777 F.3d 764, 2015 WL 394105, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan.29, 2015); <em>see also Palacios, </em>756 F.3d at 326 (noting that the government \u201cconceded error\u201d after Amendment 775 took effect). However, because Aguilar-Munoz offered to waive his appellate rights, the government argues that the plain error standard of review applies and that <em>Palacios </em>does not govern this case\u2019s outcome. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The error that Aguilar-Torres complains of on appeal is the same error he alerted the district court to. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). \u201c[T]he district court was aware of the [defendant\u2019s] argument that the government was in error to withhold a motion for a third-level reduction,\u201d and \u201cthe district court specifically declined to grant a one-level reduction.\u201d <em>See Torres-Perez, </em>777 F.3d 764, 2015 WL 394105, at *2. Moreover, it was only after filing his written objection, and as a necessity given then-governing law, that Aguilar-Munoz attempted to acquiesce to the government\u2019s improper demands. He never waived the original objection. Aguilar-Munoz frames his argument differently on appeal than he did before the district court because the law changed. The error remained the same and our ordinary standard of review applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Accordingly, we review Aguilar-Munoz\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. Ill </em>F.3d 764, at *3. In determining whether the court made any procedural errors we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>review \u201cthe district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We find that, under <em>Palacios </em>and <em>Torres-Perez, </em>it was error to withhold the further one-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b). The government argues <em>Pa-lacios </em>is inapt because, ultimately, the government did not refuse the one-level reduction based on Aguilar-Munoz\u2019s refusal to waive appellate rights. It points to a facially compelling bit of evidence: Aguilar-Munoz in fact <em>offered </em>to waive his appellate rights. <em>Q.E.D. </em>The government\u2019s argument loses steam as quickly as it gathers it, however. The government insists it refused to grant the one-level reduction based on \u201cother consideration (ie., his failure to adopt other non-waiver provisions).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We need not embark at this stage on the task of determining whether the government\u2019s true reason in denying the one-level reduction was Aguilar-Munoz\u2019s refusal to adequately waive appellate rights. Either way, the government withheld the one-level reduction \u201cbased on interests not identified in \u00a7 3E1.1.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., supp. to app. C, amend. 775, at pp. 43-46 (2013). This was error. <em>See Torres-Perez, 777 </em>F.3d 764, 2015 WL 394105, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Because the defendant preserved the claim of error and the \u201cdistrict court committed a procedural error, we must remand unless the proponent of the sentence establishes that the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo establish harmlessness, the government must \u2018convincingly demonstrate that the court would have imposed the very same sentence if it had not made an erroneous calculation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 719 (5th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">While the government does not address the harmless error standard, it does argue that \u201cthe available \u2018additional evidence\u2019 suggests that the district court would have imposed the same 75-month sentence even if it had considered the allegedly correct range.\u201d What, in the government\u2019s view, the evidence \u201csuggests\u201d is not sufficient to convince us as required by the harmless error standard. Not only did Aguilar-Munoz receive a within-guidelines sentence, the sentencing, judge also \u201cdenied [him] the additional reduction point because it did not yet have guidance from this court that the rule announced in <em>New-son </em>was no longer correct.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe government has not convincingly demonstrated harmlessness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The sentence is vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
