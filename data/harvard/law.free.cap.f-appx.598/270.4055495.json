Felix Antonio JIMENEZ-QUELIX, also known as Harly Canales, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"AY0\">No. 14-50494</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A4R\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"AUak\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AeV\">March 18, 2015.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b298-22\">Before KING, JOLLY, and HAYNES, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-23\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b298-24\">Felix Antonio Jimenez-Quelix (Jimenez) appeals the 57-month within-guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for illegal reentry following deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that the guidelines range was too high to fulfill \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is. not empirically based and effectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record. Jimenez also contends that the range overstated the seriousness of his nonviolent reentry offense and failed to account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Because Jimenez did not argue in the district court that his sentence was unreasonable, his argument is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). He acknowledges that his failure to object to his sentence in the district court results in the application of the plain error standard of review, conceding that the issue is foreclosed by <em>Peltier, </em>however, he notes that the circuits are divided on whether a failure to object to the reasonableness of the sentence upon its imposition requires plain error review, and he seeks to preserve that issue for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">As Jimenez\u2019s sentence was within the guidelines range, a presumption of reasonableness applies. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). To rebut the presumption of reasonableness, a defendant must show that his sentence fails to take into account a factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and for purposes of preserving the issue for possible further review, Jimenez argues that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because the illegal reentry Guideline lacks an empirical basis. As Jimenez concedes, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">We have consistently rejected \u201cdouble counting\u201d arguments and arguments that \u00a7 2L1.2 results in excessive sentences because it is not empirically based. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We also have rejected the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument that Jimenez asserts. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Jimenez\u2019s personal history, before imposing the sentence. Jimenez\u2019s motives for reentry are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). He has not shown that the district court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor and thus fails to demonstrate that the district court plainly erred. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
