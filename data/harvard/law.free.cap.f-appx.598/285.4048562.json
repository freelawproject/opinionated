He now petitions this court for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) upholding the decision of the immigration judge (IJ) pretermitting his request for cancellation of removal. The primary thrust of Martinez\u2019s petition is that the BIA erred in determining that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal based on his prior Texas conviction for assault family violence, which was determined to be a crime involving moral turpitude. Although we generally lack jurisdiction to review the decision to deny discretionary relief, including cancellation of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 1229b, we retain the authority to review \u201cquestions of law,\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), including whether the BIA properly determined that an alien committed a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Hyder v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The Attorney General has the authority to cancel the removal of a deportable nonresident alien if the alien meets certain conditions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l). However, an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is not eligible for such relief. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Martinez was convicted of violating Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(a)(1), which prohibits \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing] bodily injury to another.\u201d We have previously upheld the BIA\u2019s determination that a conviction under this statute qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Esparza-Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>699 F.3d 821, 823-24 (5th Cir.2012). Although Martinez asserts that his conviction constitutes a petty offense that does not bar cancellation of removal, his 210-day sentence exceeded six months and thus does not fall under this exception. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). Because the BIA correctly determined that Martinez\u2019s assault conviction constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal, it did not address his argument that his Texas conviction for tampering with a government record was not a crime involving moral'turpitude or was a petty offense; we also decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Additionally, Martinez asserts that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for voluntary departure. This court generally lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from the denial of such a request. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f). However, because the BIA determined that Martinez\u2019s assault conviction rendered him statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure, we have jurisdiction to review this legal question. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Hyder, </em>506 F.3d at 390. Because Martinez\u2019s assault conviction constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude occurring less than five years before his request for voluntary departure, the BIA correctly determined that Martinez was statutorily ineligible for relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(B), 1101(f)(3). Accordingly, Martinez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
