Asrar moved to reopen based on an alleged breach of confidentiality, which he asserted resulted in changed conditions or circumstances in Pakistan. Asrar asserts: the BIA\u2019s rejection of his claim that the removal proceedings should be reopened based on his breach-of-confidentiality claim was arbitrary and contrary to law; and the BIA erred in concluding there was no evidence of a breach, and in determining he failed to show changed-country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-24\">Asrar was convicted of an aggravated felony (unlawful possession of ammunition) and sentenced to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment. Subsequently, he was ordered removed to Pakistan. His petition for review was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because he was removable as an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony and failed to raise a constitutional claim or a question of law. <em>Asrar v. Gonzales, </em>229 Fed.Appx. 326 (5th Cir.2007). Therefore, with respect to the denial of Asrar\u2019s motion to reopen, we have jurisdiction to review only constitutional and legal questions. <em>E.g., Escudero-Arciniega v. Holder, </em>702 F.3d 781, 785 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-25\">Whether the BIA erroneously weighed or ignored evidence regarding changed conditions in Pakistan, which Asrar alleged resulted from the purported confidentiality breach, and whether the evidence Asrar presented established such changed conditions, are questions of fact and do not raise either a constitutional or legal question. <em>E.g., id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-26\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
