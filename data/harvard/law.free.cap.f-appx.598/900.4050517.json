The district court granted- Branch Banking &amp; Trust Company\u2019s (BB &amp; T) unopposed motion for summary judgment and awarded damages totaling $8,416,147.82. The defendant-appellants do not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that they were in default or the total calculation of damages. Rather, the only issue on appeal is whether the district court\u2019s order fails to assign the amount of damages due from each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-17\">The parties agree that the district court\u2019s order sets out the amount of damages due on each of the defaulted loans but that it does not identify which defendant owed those amounts. Our review confirms that the district court\u2019s order should be more precise. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment but remand for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to indicate the specific amount of damages for which each defendant is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-21\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
