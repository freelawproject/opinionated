The district court determined' that the suit was best classed as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it. In this appeal, Arnold argues that his claims are properly brought under \u00a7 2241 because they concern fundamental errors in the criminal process and because the claims have not previously been considered on the merits. He also argues that the district court erred by not considering <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 138 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">When considering the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Our analysis of Arnold\u2019s arguments and pertinent authority shows no error in connection with the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Because Arnold\u2019s arguments relate to events that occurred prior to or at sentencing, his suit arises under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426 (5th Cir.2005). He has already filed the one \u00a7 2255 motion to which he is entitled, and he has not received authorization to file another. Consequently, the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h); <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Insofar as Arnold contends that he should be permitted to file a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 because <em>Alleyne </em>meets the parameters of the savings clause, he is mistaken. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). This court has held that <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>United States v. Olvera, </em>775 F.3d 726, 730 (5th Cir.2015). Moreover, Arnold\u2019s reliance on <em>Alleyne </em>is misplaced. <em>Alleyne </em>extended the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to hold that any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increases the statutory minimum sentence must be alleged in an indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1. Here, Arnold\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on a prior conviction, not because of some other fact. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i). Further, since the decision in <em>Alleyne </em>implicates the validity of a sentence, <em>Alleyne </em>does not establish that Arnold was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> Pursuant to 5th <em>Cm. </em>R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
