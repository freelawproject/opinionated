On appeal, Vitela argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to take the recommended sentencing range of three to ninth months into account and by imposing sentences that were greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). She further contends that the district court did not give adequate weight to the mitigating factors and arguments that she presented during the revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-25\">The district court\u2019s sentencing decision was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 496 (5th Cir.2012). Before pronouncing Vitela\u2019s sentences, the district court expressly considered the applicable policy statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>range under Chapter Seven of the Guidelines Manual promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission, the maximum statutory sentence that Vitela faced, and Vitela\u2019s arguments in favor of leniency. While Vitela\u2019s sentences exceeded the applicable policy statement range, they were within the statutory maximum term that she faced. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a); <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 287-88 (5th Cir.1997). We have routinely upheld such sentences. <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
