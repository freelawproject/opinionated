In two separate judgments, the Florida trial court ruled in favor of Michael. The first granted quiet title to the property and ejectment of Errol. The second judgment awarded Michael $248,000 in compensatory damages and $119,000 in punitive damages. Errol appealed the judgments to the Second District Court of Appeal, which affirmed. <em>Crossdale v. Crossdale, </em>114 So.3d 944, 944 (Fla. 2d DCA 2013) (unpublished table opinion). Errol appealed that decision to the Florida Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Crossdale v. Crossdale, </em>120 So.3d 560, 560 (Fla.2013) (unpublished table opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Having exhausted his options in state court, Errol sought a fresh start in federal court. On August 23, 2013, he filed suit <em>pro se </em>in the Middle District of Florida. His second amended complaint contained eight counts and named as defendants his brother Michael, Stacy Bianco, James Bianco, Patricia Crossdale, Linda Worth, and Worth\u2019s company Worthit Realty, LLC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint sought money damages for racketeering, extortion, theft by deception, conversion, collusion, due process violations, conspiracy, and fraud. The gist was that \u201cDefendant Michael A. Crossdale unjustly used the [Florida state] court to cheat[,] swindled and to defraud [Errol] out of money and property.\u201d Each count complained of injuries Errol purportedly suffered as a result of the outcome of the state court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that, under the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. The district court agreed and dismissed the case on that ground. This is Errol\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>713 F.3d 1066, 1069 (11th Cir.2013). Put briefly, <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>is a narrow preclusion doctrine that bars a state-court loser from later enlisting a U.S. district court to reverse his state-court loss. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The doctrine has its basis in two federal jurisdiction statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1257 and 1331. Section 1331 provides that district courts are courts of \u201coriginal jurisdiction.\u201d They thus generally lack appellate jurisdiction, including appellate jurisdiction over state courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Instead, appellate jurisdiction over final state court judgments implicating federal law or the federal Constitution is the sole province of the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1257(a); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486-87, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1317, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The Supreme Court has limited the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine\u2019s applicability to those cases in which (1) the plaintiff was the loser in state court, (2) the plaintiff is complaining of an injury caused by the state court\u2019s judgment, (3) the state court\u2019s judgment was \u201crendered before the district court proceedings commenced,\u201d and (4) the plaintiff is \u201cinviting district court review and rejection\u201d of the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. Further, the doctrine applies only to claims that were actually brought in state court or claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). A claim is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment \u201cif it would effectively nullify the state court judgment, or it succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">In this case, the district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Errol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>lost in state court. The state court\u2019s decision became final no later than July 18, 2013, which was a month before Errol filed his federal complaint on August 23, 2013. The injuries he complained of in his federal complaint \u2014 loss of money and property \u2014 resulted from the state court\u2019s judgment and \u201cinvited district court review and rejection\u201d of the state court judgment. <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. Errol\u2019s argument in the district court could succeed only if that court determined that the Florida state courts were wrong when they ruled that Michael was the rightful owner of the Cape Coral property and that Errol had obtained title to that property through fraud. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260. The district court correctly determined it did not have jurisdiction to consider that question. <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Errol also contends that the state court judgments resulted from fraud on the court and should thus be.exempted from <em>Rooker-Feldman. </em>Even if this court had recognized a fraud exception to that doctrine, which it has not, Errol\u2019s argument is little more than a claim that the state court result was wrong and the only possible reason for it was fraud. That argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-14\">. The Court of Appeal's order read, in its entirety, \"PER CURIAM.
