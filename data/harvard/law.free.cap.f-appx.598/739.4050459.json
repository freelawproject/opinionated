At sentencing, Mr. Perez-Prado objected to the base offense level calculation contained in his presen-tence investigation report. Specifically, Mr. Perez-Prado argued that a base offense level of 20 pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines was not merited because his prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>conviction for possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana under Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2) was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court agreed, sustaining his objection to the PSI and assigning Mr. Perez-Prado the lower base offense level of 14 pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(6). On appeal, the government argues that this calculation was error. After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. See United States v. Jerchower, </em>631 F.3d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir.2011). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2009) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines for purposes of applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm pursuant to \u00a7 922(g)(1) ordinarily receives a base offense level of 14. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) &amp; comment n. 3. In relevant part, the Guidelines provide that the base offense level increases to 20 if the defendant committed the offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). For purposes of applying \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2B\">an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4B1.2(b). See \u00a7 2K2.1, comment n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>No. 13-15227, 775 F.3d 1262, 2014 WL 7250963, slip op. at 11 (11th Cir. Dec. 22, 2014), we recently held that a conviction under \u00a7 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes constitutes a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, we hold, for the reasons substantially stated in our opinion in <em>Smith, </em>that it was error for the district court to conclude that Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s 2011 conviction under \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2) did not qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.2(b). We therefore vacate Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
