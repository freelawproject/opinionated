We agree and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">Banks filed suit against DHI Mortgage Company, Ltd. (DHI), Bank of America, and Juanita Strickland in Texas state court. Bank of America removed to the district court on the bases of federal-question and diversity jurisdiction. Banks filed a motion to remand. The district court denied this motion, concluding that although there was no basis for federal-question jurisdiction, diversity jurisdiction was proper. On October 31, 2013, the court granted DHI\u2019s and Strickland\u2019s motions to dismiss. On April 3, 2014, the court granted Bank of America\u2019s motion for. summary judgment and entered a final judgment. On May 1, 2014, Banks filed a \u201cmotion for reconsideration, or, in the alternative, motion for new trial.\u201d On June 16, 2014, the district court construed Banks\u2019s motion as a motion for relief under Rule 60(b) and denied the motion. Banks filed his notice of appeal on July 25, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b302-23\">Subject to certain exceptions, a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed \u201cwithin 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When certain motions are filed, \u201cthe time to file an appeal\u201d is extended to begin to run \u201cfrom the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, Banks\u2019s motion for reconsideration is the relevant motion. The court disposed of this motion on June 16, 2014. Banks\u2019s notice of appeal was due on July 16, 2014, but was filed on July 25, 2014. Banks\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-24\">\u201cThe filing of a timely notice of appeal ... is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Banks does not dispute that the notice of appeal was untimely. Instead, he contends that because, his appeal challenges the district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tion, this court may exercise jurisdiction over the untimely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Banks relies on an exception to res judi-cata that allows \u201ca <em>collateral attack </em>on a <em>state court judgment </em>on the ground that the state court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter\u201d in certain narrow circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This exception does not apply to the present case, as Banks brings a <em>direct appeal </em>of a <em>federal court judgment. </em>Further, when a party directly appeals on the ground that a federal district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, we enforce the normal deadlines for filing a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over Banks\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
