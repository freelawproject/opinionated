Reyes argues that his within-guidelines 24-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that the district court should have sentenced him below the guidelines range of imprisonment because the unlawful reentry Guideline is not empirically based and effectively double counts a prior conviction and because his individual characteristics warranted a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As Reyes concedes, his arguments regarding the reentry Guideline are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009). Further, he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
