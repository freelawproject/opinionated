Sula complained that the defendants unconstitutionally denied him release to mandatory supervision and that he was denied due process in connection with his mandatory-supervision hearings in 2012 and 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Because Sula\u2019s complaint was dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim for relief, we review its dismissal de novo. <em>Rogers v. Boatright, </em>709 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.2013). The district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim seeking monetary damages against the defendants in their official capacities, a claim Sula asserts he did not raise, will be disregarded. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Sula did not plausibly establish that the supervisory defendants were personally involved in the alleged constitutional violation or acted with deliberate indifference. <em>See Coleman v. Sweetin, </em>745 F.3d 756, 763 (5th Cir.2014); <em>Porter v. Epps, </em>659 F.3d 440, 446 (5th Cir.2011). Further, to the extent Sula complained that the parole-officer defendants arbitrarily and capriciously denied his mandatory-supervision release, an adjudicative function, the parole-officer defendants enjoy absolute immunity. <em>See Hulsey v. Owens, </em>63 F.3d 354, 356-57 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">The district court correctly dismissed Sula\u2019s claims, \u201cno matter the relief sought,\u201d that challenged the denial of his release to mandatory supervision. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>see also McGrew v. Texas Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 160-61 (5th Cir.1995) (applying <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), in a Texas prisoner\u2019s suit under \u00a7 1983 alleging illegal imprisonment based on the revocation of mandatory supervision). The district court correctly dismissed Sula\u2019s claims based on alleged due process violations during his 2012 and 2013 mandatory-supervision hearings because Sula did not plausibly establish that he was denied the requisite due process and thereby prejudiced. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 15-16, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979); <em>Simpson v. Ortiz, </em>995 F.2d 606, 609 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">As the district court properly dismissed Sula\u2019s federal claims, its decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law claims was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Batiste v. Island Records Inc., </em>179 F.3d 217, 226 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">The judgment of the district court dismissing Sula\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED. His motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>Cnty., Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
