Specifically, he contends that the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) failed to ascribe adequate weight to certain aspects of his testimony at the removal hearing, and that the BIA wrongly concluded that the new evidence supporting his motion to reopen did not show changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). When a petitioner fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">A petition for review must be filed with a court of appeals no later than 30 days after the date of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(b)(1) &amp; (2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2). The statutory time limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is jurisdictional and is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>See Chao Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>677 F.3d 1043, 1044-46 (11th Cir.2012) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction a petition for review that this Court\u2019s clerk did not receive until 31 days after the BIA issued its order).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Under any measure, Garcia Molina\u2019s petition fails. Garcia Molina abandons on appeal any challenge to the BIA\u2019s January 17, 2014 order denying his motion to reconsider by not discussing that order in his brief. As to his arguments regarding the BIA\u2019s December 9, 2010 and July 29, 2013 orders, we lack jurisdiction to consider those arguments, as the instant February 18, 2014 petition for review was untimely filed more than 30 days after those orders were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\">. Although Garcia Molina listed his wife, Jul-ieta Antonia Milagros Santander Palermo, as a derivative beneficiary in his underlying application for asylum, and the instant petition for review likewise names her, Garcia Molina does not reference Santander Palermo in his brief on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
