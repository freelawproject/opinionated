Smith\u2019s total offense level of 43 was determined by application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2) and (b). Although he had no criminal history points under the Sentencing Guidelines, Smith\u2019s prior criminal history involved sexual exploitation of minors. He acknowledged that he produced the images involved in the offense of conviction, images which included photographs of the genitalia of his disabled daughter. Smith also was extensively involved with the online child pornography community, and he encouraged others to produce child pornography. Based upon a total offense level of 43 and a criminal history category of I, the guideline imprisonment range was life imprisonment; however, because the statutory maximum sentence was 20 years on each count, the guideline imprisonment range became 240 months per count, or 480 months. The district court sentenced Smith to the guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-21\">\u201cAppellate review for substantive reasonableness is highly deferential, because the sentencing court is in a better position to find facts and judge their import under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Where, as here, the sentence is within the guidelines range, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>court employs an abuse of discretion standard of review, and the sentence is afforded a presumption of reasonableness that is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a \u00a7 3553(a) factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factors, or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>654 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Smith\u2019s assertion that the district court\u2019s sentence should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness is without merit. The district court was within its authority to order consecutive sentences for each of Smith\u2019s separate offenses, and because the sentences fell within the advisory guidelines range, they were entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473-74 (5th Cir.2006) (noting a court\u2019s authority to impose consecutive sentences for different offenses, even if they are imposed in a single proceeding and that \u201ca rebutta-ble presumption of reasonableness also applies to a consecutive sentence imposed within the parameters of the advisory federal guidelines\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) (mandating consecutive sentences where the sentence imposed <em>on the </em>count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment). As he concedes, Smith\u2019s argument that a sentence imposed upon application of \u00a7 2G2.2 should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Miller, </em>665 F.3d 114, 119-23 (5th Cir.2011), which held that a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2 is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See also United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 228 (5th Cir.) (finding similar challenge to the sentence foreclosed by <em>Miller </em>), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 681, 187 L.Ed.2d 555 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Smith\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence also is without merit. First, Smith\u2019s characterization of the severity of his offense is inaccurate. Smith\u2019s \u201cnude\u201d pictures of his daughter included a close up image of her genitalia. Further, the relevant conduct associated with Smith\u2019s offense included his heavy involvement with the child pornography community, his encouragement of others to produce child pornography, and his past criminal behavior, which included the physical victimization of minors. Although he suggests that his sentence is in disparity with other similar defendants, Smith cites no cases establishing this fact. In sum, Smith has failed to meet his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s presumptively reasonable sentence was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Scott, </em>654 F.3d at 555. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
