Car-man argues that a state trial court violated his right to due process as guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment by failing <em>sua sponte </em>to conduct a hearing to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. <em>See Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). The district court ruled that it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for a Florida appellate court to reject Carman\u2019s argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b735-19\">We divide the background of this appeal in three parts. First, we discuss Carman\u2019s trial and post-trial proceedings. Second, we discuss Carman\u2019s direct appeal. Third, we discuss Carman\u2019s federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-20\">\n<em>A. Carman\u2019s Conviction and the Denial of his Motion for a New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-21\">In 2005, Carman was charged in a Florida court for abusing two minors. Car-man\u2019s second amended information alleged that he had sexually battered S.M., a child under the age of 12, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(2)(a), and had twice touched G.C., a child under the age of 12, in a lewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>or lascivious manner, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 800.04(5)(b). Carman moved to sever the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">On the first day of trial, August 18, 2005, defense counsel announced that he was abandoning the motion to sever, and the trial court questioned Carman about the matter. The trial court asked Carman if he thought that it was in his-best interest to dismiss the. motion, and Carman responded affirmatively. The trial court also asked Carman if he had been coerced or enticed to dismiss the motion, and Carman responded negatively to both inquiries. Finally, the trial court asked Carman if he was satisfied with his trial attorney\u2019s advice and Carman responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Defense counsel reported that Carman had \u201ctaken some prescription medication\u201d and that it might affect his ability to \u201cassist ... properly in his defense.\u201d Defense counsel stated that Carman\u2019s family had complained that morning that Carman was \u201cseeing double and could not wake up and [was] not acting himself.\u201d Counsel also said that he had talked to Carman, he was acting differently, and he had \u201ctaken some prescription [nerve] medication\u201d that counsel had \u201casked ... [Carman] at some point in the past to wean himself off of.\u201d According to counsel, Carman had taken \u201cone [pill] after midnight\u201d to help him sleep. The trial court remarked that .Carman \u201cseems to be okay ... just looking at him\u201d and based on \u201cthe questions ... [being] asked.... \u201d But defense counsel countered that he \u201chad to hold [Carman] up in the street ... [to] talk[ ] to him\u201d and that his \u201cinvestigator, who ... knows [Carman], has noticed that his heart is racing, although he looks fairly composed on the outside.\u201d Counsel insisted that Carman was not \u201cresponding ... the way [he] f[elt] like [Carman] should be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The trial court questioned Carman to ensure that he understood what had transpired so far. The trial court asked Car-man \u201chow [he][was] feeling today,\u201d and Carman responded, \u201cI\u2019m kind of groggy, a little bit groggy.\u201d In response to being asked if he could \u201chear all right,\u201d Carman stated, \u2018Yes, I can hear.\u201d And Carman responded affirmatively to being asked if he comprehended \u201c[t]he questions [that he was] just asked ... about the severance motion.\u201d When asked if he understood \u201cthat [he][had] the right to theoretically have two trials; ... one on the one alleged victim and one on the other alleged victim,\u201d Carman replied, \u201cRight.\u201d Carman acknowledged that he had talked to his attorney about the motion to sever, and then Carman explained that \u201cwe want to do them together.\u201d The trial court remarked that \u201cthe same evidence would come in probably on both the trials, or could come in on both trials anyway if you had two,\u201d to which Carman responded, \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Carman confirmed that he had ingested a prescription medicine during the previous evening. The trial court asked if Car-man had \u201ctaken any medication today,\u201d and Carman responded, \u201cToday, no. Not this morning. This was earlier.\u201d And when asked if he had taken anything \u201csince [he] woke up this morning,\u201d Carman answered, \u201cNot since I woke up, no.\u201d Carman said that he had ingested the medicine \u201cabout midnight,\u201d and that it worked \u201clike an antidepressant. It helps you sleep.\u201d Carman said that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d of the name of the medication or its dosage, but he knew that \u201cit [was] small pills, about that size\u201d that had been prescribed by \u201cDr. Whiddon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Carman stated that he took the medicine occasionally and that it did not affect his cognitive abilities. When asked if he had been \u201ctaking [the medicine] for awhile now,\u201d Carman responded, \u201cJust off and on when there\u2019s anxiety. I don\u2019t take them all the time.\u201d The trial court asked if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Carman had \u201ctake[n] them the other day for jury selection,\u201d and he said, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t take them before then, no.\u201d Car-man acknowledged that, \u201cif [he][got] anxious or nervous or something, [he] t[ook] them and they tendfed] to calm [him] down\u201d and that the medicine \u201c[n]ormally\u201d did not affect his reasoning. When asked if he could complete a crossword puzzle, Carman answered, \u201cIt might take me a little longer, but I can do it.\u201d And Carman affirmed that he was \u201cable to assist [his attorney],\u201d who Carman acknowledged would need his \u201cinput on certain things with witnesses and what they' say or ... what they might not say.\u201d The trial court asked Carman if he had \u201cany more of the medicine with [him],\u201d and Carman responded, \u201cNo,\u201d and then he interrupted the trial court to say, \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t have any more at all now.\u201d When asked if he \u201ctook the last one last night,\u201d Carman replied, \u201cThis is over with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The trial court assured Carman that he could request a recess, if one was needed. The trial court asked for an \u201cassur[ance] ... [from Carman] that if [he] need[ed] a break, [he] [could] tell [his attorney] and [the court would] take a break,\u201d and Car-man replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d The trial court also instructed Carman that \u201cif things start going too fast, [he could] stop and ... tell [his attorney] and [the court would] take a break,\u201d and Carman responded, \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d Carman also responded affirmatively when he was told that he \u201cneed[ed] to know what\u2019s going on here today and ... need[ed] to be able to help\u201d his attorney because a trial \u201cis kind of a team thing.\u201d And Carman agreed \u201cthat if [he] g[ot] confused or something that [he\u2019d] stop and tell [his attorney], and [the trial court] would take a recess ... [or] take a break if that\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">After a brief conference with Carman, defense counsel moved for a continuance on the ground that Carman \u201cc[ould] [not] assist ... today.\u201d The prosecutor responded that Carman \u201cm[ight] be a little wobbly on his pins,\u201d but that a continuance was unnecessary in the light of the \u201cin-quir[ies]\u201d made and Carman\u2019s \u201cab[ility] to understand all the questions that the Court gave [and to] make intelligent, rational responses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The trial court denied Carman\u2019s motion, but it reminded Carman that he could request a recess at any time. The trial court explained that it \u201chad a fairly extensive colloquy with Mr. Carman, and [was] convinced that he understands what\u2019s going on\u201d despite his consumption of \u201csome medication last night that\u2019s prescription medication that he takes for nerves and so forth.\u201d The trial court acknowledged that it \u201cwould feel the same way ... if [it] was sitting in [Carman\u2019s] chair,\u201d but that it \u201cth[ought] [Carman] [was] competent to go forward today.\u201d The trial court assured Carman that \u201cif things are starting to go too fast for him, or he is confused as to what\u2019s going on, that he needs to tell [his attorney], ... [who] can ask ... [for] a recess to make sure that he\u2019s able to assist his lawyer.\u201d And Carman responded affirmatively to a reminder that he had \u201cpromised ... that if things go out of hand, as far as [his] ability to keep up with things, [he] would tell [his] lawyer to stop the trial.... \u201d The trial court was confident that Carman would \u201cbe all right\u201d because \u201cas the day [went] on, and this medication that [he] took last night ... w[ore] off, [he] w[ould] probably feel better and better.\u201d Carman would be capable of assisting his attorney, the trial court opined, because \u201cthe first witness is probably not going to be called for about an hour. And that ... w[ould] assist [him] in getting [his] sea legs under [him].... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Carman \u201cma[de] gestures to the jury in reaction to things\u201d that were said by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>prosecutor during the opening statements. During a recess, the prosecutor asked the trial court to \u201cadmonish[]\u201d Carman for \u201ctrying to communicate with the jury by nodding [his] head[ ] and making gestures.\u201d The trial court remarked that it was \u201ccounter productive for anybody to do that\u201d and agreed to \u201cadmonish everyone not to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">On August 19, 2005, the jury returned its verdicts. The jury found Carman guilty of the sexual battery of S.M. and of two counts of battering G.C., as lesser-included offenses of the two charges of touching G.C. in a lewd and lascivious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">On August 29, 2005, Carman moved for a new trial. Carman argued that he had been entitled to a continuance because \u201che was incapable of assisting his own counsel in his defense at all stages of his trial on August 18-19, 2005.\u201d Carman alleged that, in addition to the evidence in the trial transcript about his mental state, he had been \u201cpale, nearly ashen in complexion\u201d when his trial commenced; he had been \u201cunsteady on his feet and used walls, chairs, and counsel table for balance\u201d; he had \u201csaid nothing to counsel and wrote no notes to counsel\u201d when the first victim and a second prosecution witness testified; he had \u201ccontinued to appear ashen and disoriented\u201d throughout the morning; he \u201cbeg[a]n to write notes and communicate with counsel\u201d after the second victim testified; his counsel had realized that his condition had been \u201cmuch more apparent and serious [after] [being] provided with an apparent suicide letter that was found in [Carman\u2019s] room after the trial\u201d; and he had \u201cingested far more Lorazepam than he disclosed to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The trial court held a hearing on Car-man\u2019s motion. Carman testified that he consumed between four and eight pills of Lorazepam in an attempt to commit suicide. Carman also presented testimony from Dr. Darren Rothschild, a forensic psychiatrist, that Carman had to have been intoxicated on the morning of trial because his previous ingestion of only one pill had \u201cknocked [him] out\u201d and that, \u201cdue to [his] intoxication[,] ... he was not competent to stand trial[] because he was unable to adequately assist in his defense.\u201d The doctor opined that, in the morning, Carman would have been \u201cconfus[ed]\u201d and \u201csedat[ed],\u201d had \u201cdifficulty processing information,\u201d and had a \u201cmemory [that was] impaired,\u201d and \u201cby the afternoon, he [w]ould have been coming to a little bit and [could] ... pay attention.\u201d Dr. Rothschild testified that Carman \u201cwould have been ... [un]abl[e] to pay attention\u201d and that his statements before trial were not credible because, \u201cwhile intoxicated, people can say all types of things\u201d and are \u201c[un]ihi-bit[ed]\u201d and, \u201cif asked superficial questions, ... [are] likely to comply yes or no and may ... respond[ ] to part of the question ... not understanding [its] full magnitude.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The trial court questioned defense counsel, who acknowledged that he had not requested a recess. Counsel had deposed the victims and had discussed the depositions with Carman before trial and the victims testified consistent with their depositions. Defense counsel stated that, after the trial commenced, he had been \u201cengaged in defending [Carman] and not monitoring his progress.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">At the beginning of Carman\u2019s sentencing hearing, the trial court denied Carman\u2019s motion for a new trial. The trial court \u201ct[ook] [Carman] at his word\u201d that he had taken some medicine and had determined that a continuance was unnecessary because he did not appear intoxicated and \u201canswered all the questions appropriately.\u201d Carman\u2019s argument that he was intoxicated, the trial court reasoned, was \u201cbelied\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>by the fact that neither Carman nor his attorney requested a recess. Even if Car-man had been intoxicated, the trial court reasoned, no new trial was necessary because Carman had not proved that he had been prejudiced. The trial court found that defense counsel had time but failed to confer with Carman about the victims\u2019 testimonies; it would have questioned Car-man\u2019s competence \u201chad those witnesses testimonies been exceedingly different than what they said at their deposition\u201d; and it was equally plausible that Carman chose not to make notes because the victims\u2019 testimonies did not differ. The trial court sentenced Carman to a mandatory term of life without the possibility of parole for the sexual battery of S.M. and to two terms of 95 days in the county jail for battering G.C. that would run concurrently with each other and to Carman\u2019s life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\n<em>B. Carman\u2019s Direct Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Carman argued, for the first time on appeal, that the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>should have conducted a competency hearing. Carman argued that a hearing should have been held because there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that he was not competent to stand trial. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.210(b). Carman also argued that the trial court had violated his right to procedural due process by failing, on its own initiative, to hold a competency hearing. <em>See Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992); <em>Pate, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836. The First District Court of Appeals affirmed summarily Carman\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\n<em>C. Carman\u2019s Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Carman filed in the district court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and alleged the violation of his right to procedural due process. The state answered that Carman was relying \u201con a factual basis not fairly presented to the <em>trial </em>court at the time a continuance was requested\u201d and Carman\u2019s Pate argument was unexhaust-ed. The state also answered that Car-man\u2019s behavior before and during trial \u201cfailed to raise a bona fide doubt as to his competency to proceed\u201d because he \u201chad no history of incompetency or mental illness\u201d; \u201c[h]is dosage had not been deliberately increased\u201d; and \u201cnothing happened during the morning session, in particular, to raise a doubt about [his] competency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">The district court denied Carman\u2019s petition. The district court ruled that \u201cCar-man ha[d] failed to demonstrate [that] the state court\u2019s rejection of [ ]his claim relied upon an unreasonable determination of the facts or constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\u201d The district court determined that the trial court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion in denying [Carman\u2019s] request for a continuance.\u201d The district court also determined that \u201cthe trial court did not err in failing to sua sponte order a competency evaluation\u201d because \u201c[t]he record supported]\u201d its \u201cimplicit[ ], if not explicit[ ], finding that there were] no reasonable grounds to suggest that Carman was not competent or [that] a bona fide doubt necessitated] a competency hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">We review de <em>novo </em>the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Moore v. Campbell, </em>344 F.3d 1313, 1321 (11th Cir.2003). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a petitioner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201cThe decision of a state court involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law \u2018if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule ... but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner\u2019s case.\u2019\u201d <em>Greene v. Upton, </em>644 F.3d 1145, 1154 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1520, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). We presume that the findings of fact by the state court are correct so long as they are supported by the record. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Fallada v. Dugger, </em>819 F.2d 1564, 1569 n. 3 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Our discussion is divided in two parts. First, we address the argument of the State that Carman failed to exhaust his claim. Second, because we conclude that Carman exhausted his claim, we address whether the decision of the state court involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>A. Carman Exhausted His Claim for Purposes of Federal Review.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Carman properly presented his <em>Pate </em>argument to the Florida courts. Before trial, defense counsel expressed reservations about Carman\u2019s ability to \u201cassist in his defense,\u201d and after the trial court found that Carman was competent to proceed, defense counsel moved, unsuccessfully, for a continuance. Carman was not required, as the State argues, to request that the trial court conduct a competence hearing. <em>See Wright v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2002) (recognizing that, although the petitioner \u201cnever requested that the trial court conduct a hearing on ... whether [he] was mentally competent to stand trial,\u201d his \u201cmental incompetency procedural due process claim ... was timely raised on direct appeal and rejected on the merits without discussion by the Fourth District Court of Appeal\u201d). It is not as though defense counsel failed to broach the subject of Carman\u2019s competency and, even if that were the case, that would \u201cnot [be] dispositive ... [and would serve as] evidence that [Carman\u2019s] competency was not really in doubt.\u201d <em>Watts v. Singletary, </em>87 F.3d 1282, 1288 (11th Cir.1996). A <em>\u201cPate </em>claim[ ] can ... be raised on direct' appeal,\u201d <em>James v. Singletary, </em>957 F.2d 1562, 1572 (11th Cir.1992), and Carman argued to the Florida appellate court that the trial court violated his right to due process by ignoring objective information that created a bona fide doubt about his competency to stand trial, <em>see Pate, </em>383 U.S. at 384-86, 86 S.Ct. at 841-42. The decision of the state court to reject Carman\u2019s argument summarily qualifies as an adjudication on the merits and is entitled to deference on ha-beas corpus review. <em>Wright, </em>278 F.3d at 1253-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">\n<em>B. The Florida Appellate Court Did Not Unreasonably Apply Clearly Established Federal Law.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">\u201cThe failure to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant\u2019s right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives him of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Fallada, </em>819 F.2d at 1568. To be incompetent, the defendant must lack the \u201c \u2018sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2019 or \u2018a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019\u201d <em>Watts, </em>87 F.3d at 1286 (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960)). A defendant\u2019s right to due process is violated when the trial court fails <em>sua sponte </em>to conduct a competency hearing when it has before it evidence that creates a bona fide doubt about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the defendant\u2019s competency to proceed with his trial. <em>Pate, </em>383 U.S. at 384-86, 86 S.Ct. at 841-42. The \u201cpetitioner shoulders the burden of proving that objective facts known to the trial court were sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt as to [his] competency.\u201d <em>McNair v. Dugger, </em>866 F.2d 399, 401 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">To determine whether there existed a bona fide doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency, a reviewing court must \u201cfocus on what the trial court did in light of what it then knew.\u201d <em>Fallada, </em>819 F.2d at 1568. Evidence about the defendant\u2019s mental condition, any irrational behavior on his part, and his demeanor at trial are all relevant, \u201cbut \u2018there are, of course, no fixed or immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further inquiry to determine fitness to proceed.\u2019\u201d <em>Watts, </em>87 F.3d at 1287 (quoting <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 908, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975)). The defendant\u2019s use of drugs is not accorded any special treatment; it is just another \u201crelevant factor\u201d in the analysis. <em>Fallada, </em>819 F.2d at 1569.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The Florida appellate court determined that the trial court did not violate Carman\u2019s right to due process, and that decision is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The objective facts known to the trial court did not create a bona fide doubt about Carman\u2019s competency to stand trial. Despite the assertions made by defense counsel and Carman\u2019s family before trial that Carman was unable to assist in his defense, Carman\u2019s colloquy with the trial court reflects that he was coherent, articulate, and understood the seriousness of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">None of the information presented to the trial court suggested that Carman was unable to consult with his counsel or failed to understand his criminal proceedings. Carman engaged in an \u201cintelligent colloquy\u201d with the trial court about his decision to abandon his motion to sever and about the effect of the prescription medication that he had consumed. <em>See Card v. Dugger, </em>911 F.2d 1494, 1519 (11th Cir.1990). Carman reported that he had taken one dose of an anti-anxiety medication to help him sleep and, although it made him \u201cgroggy,\u201d it did not affect his lucidity. When Carman stated that the medicine \u201cmight\u201d have slowed his reaction time, the trial court compensated for' the alleged difficulty by granting Carman an unqualified right to obtain a recess. Neither Car-man nor his counsel asked for a recess. And counsel, who was \u201cin the best position to ... [assess] Carman\u2019s competency,\u201d never complained during trial that Carman was not assisting in his defense. <em>See Watts, </em>87 F.3d at 1288. The trial court, which had \u201cpa[id] close attention to Mr. Carman ... and ... noticed [that] he was making notes and so forth during the course of the trial,\u201d found that Carman \u201cha[d] been able to help\u201d in his defense, and defense counsel did not dispute that finding. Immediately thereafter, Carman acknowledged that he was \u201cfeeling better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Carman argues that other evidence created a bona fide doubt as to his competency, but we cannot say that it was unreasonable for the state court to reach a contrary conclusion. Carman argues that his gestures to the jury suggested that he was incompetent, but it is equally plausible that Carman reacted to the accusations being leveled against him by vigorously denying any wrongdoing. <em>See Dusky, </em>362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. at 789. And even if we were to assume that Carman\u2019s gestures amounted to \u201cbizarre ... [or] irrational behavior[,] ... [that was not enough to] be equated with mental incompetence to stand trial.\u201d <em>See Medina v. Singletary, </em>59 F.3d 1095, 1107 (11th Cir.1995). Carman contends that the evidence about his at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>tempted suicide suggested that he was incompetent, but we \u201cmay consider only the information before the trial court before and during trial.\u201d <em>James, </em>957 F.2d at 1572.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The Florida appellate court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law when it determined that the trial court afforded Carman all the process required to ensure that he was competent to stand trial. <em>See Watts, </em>87 F.3d at 1290. The trial court accepted Carman\u2019s representation that he had taken medicine several hours before his trial, but the trial court did not have any evidence before it to suggest that Carman could not understand his criminal proceedings and assist in his defense. And Carman failed to establish that the trial court failed to account for any evidence that would have created a bona fide doubt about his competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We AFFIRM the denial of Carman\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
