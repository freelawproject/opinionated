California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Guardado has filed responses to the original brief and to the supplemental brief. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Guardado\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that this appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Although Guardado urges this court to consider whether his attorney provided effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, we conclude that the record is insufficiently developed on the pertinent issues, and we therefore decline to consider the matter. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014). Guardado may assert ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims in a habe-as corpus motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
