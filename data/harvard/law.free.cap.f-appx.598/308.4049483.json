He contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument improperly shifted the burden of proof to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Review is for plain error since Navarro did not object in the district court. <em>See United States v. Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d 276, 292 (5th Cir.2001). During closing argument, the prosecutor commented that defense counsel had not asked any questions of the victim\u2019s brother, and, therefore, his testimony regarding Navarro\u2019s motive for committing the kidnapping was unchallenged. These comments did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to Navarro because they were responsive to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument that there was another motive for the kidnapping. <em>See id. </em>Even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments constitute error, they do not constitute plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not affect Navarro\u2019s substantial rights or \u201cthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The prosecutor did not state that Navarro had an obligation to cross-examine any witness or present evidence, and several witnesses implicated Navarro in the kidnapping. <em>See Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d at 292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
