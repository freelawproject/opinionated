The IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that Ruiz was removable, pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, based on Ruiz\u2019s Florida conviction for possession of cocaine. On appeal, Ruiz argues that his cocaine possession conviction does not qualify as a removable offense. After review, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>As a threshold matter, we note that, although we lack jurisdiction to review a final removal order against an alien who has committed a controlled substance offense, we retain jurisdiction to review Ruiz\u2019s claim because its raises a question of law. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), (D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The BIA and the IJ did not err in concluding that Ruiz\u2019s cocaine possession conviction was a qualifying conviction under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B). An alien may be removed if he is eonvi\u00e9ted of \u201ca violation of ... any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance,\u201d unless the alien\u2019s sole offense is possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana for personal use. INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">At his removal hearing, Ruiz admitted that he was convicted of possessing cocaine under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(6)(a), which prohibits an individual from possession a controlled substance, including cocaine, unless obtained under a valid prescription. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(6)(a). Cocaine is a controlled substance under federal law. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (listing cocaine and other extracts from coca leaves as a Schedule II controlled substance). Thus, possession of cocaine in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(6)(a) qualifies as an offense \u201crelating to a controlled substance,\u201d within the meaning of INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Ruiz argues that because he possessed only a small amount of cocaine, his Florida cocaine possession conviction is analogous to a federal misdemeanor. However, INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B) plainly and unambiguously applies to all offenses relating to a controlled substance, other than the marijuana offenses specifically excluded, regardless of whether they are misdemeanors or felonies. It is unnecessary for the BIA to look for an analogous federal offense and apply the categorical approach, as Ruiz suggests. <em>Cf. Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1684-87, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (employing the categorical approach to determine whether state marijuana possession conviction was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">Ruiz contends that the exclusion of minor marijuana offenses should be read also to exclude similarly minor cocaine offenses. When Congress enumerates specific exceptions, however, we infer \u201cthat Congress considered the issue of exceptions and ... limited the statute to the ones set forth\u201d and are not free to read additional exceptions into the statute. <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>681 F.3d 1236, 1240 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, neither we nor the BIA may construe INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B) to exclude Ruiz\u2019s cocaine possession conviction as a removable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">For these reasons, the BIA and the IJ did not err in determining that Ruiz\u2019s cocaine possession conviction was for an offense \u201crelating to a controlled substance\u201d under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-10\">. Because the BIA explicitly agreed with the IJ's finding of removability, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). We defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of a statute if it is reasonable and does not contradict Congress's clear intent. <em>Quinchia </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. Ruiz does not challenge the IJ's denial of his request for a waiver of removability pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), except for a statement in the conclusion of his appeal brief that he is eligible for such a waiver because his cocaine possession convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>tion is not a felony under federal law. Because Ruiz makes only a passing reference to his waiver request, he has abandoned this issue. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1352 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
