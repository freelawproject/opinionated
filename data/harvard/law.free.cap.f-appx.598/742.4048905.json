At sentencing, the district court applied the statutory enhancement in the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based on Mr. Phillips\u2019 three prior drug convictions under Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) for sale or delivery of cocaine. The application of the ACCA resulted in a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. On appeal, Mr. Phillips argues that the district court erred in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>termining that his three prior convictions under \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) constituted predicate offenses under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2009). Under the ACCA, any person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has at least three prior convictions from any court \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another\u201d receives a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(1). A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">(ii) an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of then years or more is prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>No. 13-15227, 775 F.3d 1262, 2014 WL 7250963, slip op. at 11 (11th Cir. Dec. 22, 2014), we recently held that a conviction under \u00a7 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes is a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA. Accordingly, we hold, for the reasons substantially stated in our opinion in <em>Smith, </em>that the district court did not err in concluding that Mr. Phillips\u2019 three prior convictions under \u00a7 893.13(1)(a) qualified as \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d under to the ACCA. We therefore affirm Mr. Phillips\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
