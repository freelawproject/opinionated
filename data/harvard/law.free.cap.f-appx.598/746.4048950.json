The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with the findings of the immigration judge that Cadet was statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. Cadet argues that the immigration judge violated his right to due process by denying his request for a hearing to determine whether his three drug convictions in a Florida court qualified as aggravated felonies under the Immigration and Nationality Act; that his convictions for possession of cocaine are not aggravated felonies that make him ineligible for asylum; and that his offenses are not \u201cparticularly serious crimes\u201d that make him ineligible for withholding of removal. We deny in part and dismiss in part Cadet\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-20\">The immigration judge did not violate Cadet\u2019s right to due process. To establish a violation of due process, an alien must prove that he was deprived of liberty without notice or an opportunity to respond and that he was substantially prejudiced by the alleged error. See <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1144 (11th Cir.2010). Cadet was notified that he was being removed based on his three prior drug convictions, and during his master calendar hearing, Cadet argued that \u201cnone of the charges were aggravated felonies.\u201d Cadet asked for a hearing to determine the character of the offenses, but the immigration judge explained that a hearing was unnecessary because Cadet admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>to the facts in his records of conviction, which established that his drug offenses were aggravated felonies. And Cadet was not prejudiced by the denial of a hearing because it would not have changed the outcome of his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Cadet\u2019s drug offenses are aggravated felonies, which make him ineligible for asylum. An alien commits an aggravated felony if he engages in \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u201d by committing \u201ca drug trafficking crime\u201d prohibited. in section 924(c) of Title 18. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). A drug trafficking crime is defined broadly as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2), and includes the offense of \u201cknowingly or intentionally ... possessing] with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). In 1998 and 2000, Cadet was convicted of the Florida analogue to section 841(a)(1). <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) (amended 2002); <em>Donawa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1275, 1281 (11th Cir.2013). Cadet argues that his offenses do not qualify as trafficking under Florida law because of the small quantities of cocaine that he possessed, but \u201can offense ... counts ... as \u2018illicit trafficking\u2019 \u201d so long as it is a felony under the Act, <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 55, 127 S.Ct. 625, 630-31, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). And the Act punishes' as a felony the offense of knowingly possessing an indeterminate amount of cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(44), 812(c), 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C); <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>668 F.3d 1298, 1309 (11th Cir.2012). Because his convictions established that Cadet knowingly possessed a quantity of cocaine, his offenses are aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Cadet\u2019s petition for withholding of removal. An alien convicted of a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii). The Attorney General has discretion to determine whether an alien, like Cadet, who has been convicted of aggravated felonies and received a sentence of less than five years of imprisonment, has committed a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d <em>Id.; Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1143. Cadet argues that his drug offenses were not \u201cparticularly serious,\u201d but that discretionary determination is shielded from judicial review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), (a)(2)(C). We dismiss this part of Cadet\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
