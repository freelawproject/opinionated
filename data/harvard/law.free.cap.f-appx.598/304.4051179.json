Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). If the court determines that the movant is eligible for a sentence modification pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, as it did in this case, it must then consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to decide whether a reduction \u201cis warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>see United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">Contrary to Richardson\u2019s assertions, the district court\u2019s order shows that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it was under no obligation to reduce his sentence further. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. Nor was the district court required to provide reasons for why it chose not to further reduce his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 674. Richardson fails to show that the district court abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
