We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the district court failed to comply with our decision in <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), when it did not address Isaac\u2019s due process claim based on <em>Garza v. State, </em>284 Ga. 696, 670 S.E.2d 73 (2008). Isaac argued in the district court that, under the rule announced in <em>Garza, </em>the state trial court\u2019s failure to correctly instruct the jury on the kidnapping statute violated his due process rights, including the right to \u201cfair warning that his specific contemplated conduct is forbidden,\u201d depriving him of a fair trial. <em>See Garza, </em>670 S.E.2d at 76 (alteration and quotation marks omitted). The district court did not address that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\"><em>Clisby </em>requires that a district court resolve all claims for relief raised in a \u00a7 2254 petition, regardless of whether it grants or denies habeas relief. 960 F.2d at 936. Isaac therefore contends (and the state agrees) that the district court committed <em>Clisby </em>-error when it dismissed his \u00a7 2254 petition without resolving that <em>Garza </em>claim. He is correct. When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938. We therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings to include the consideration of Isaac\u2019s <em>Garza </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
