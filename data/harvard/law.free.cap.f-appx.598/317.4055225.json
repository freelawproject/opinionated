Ho argues that the district court erred by admitting the video identification made by the victim. He argues that the admission of this evidence violated- his due process right to confront the witnesses against him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>as stated in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). A supervisee has a due process right to \u201ca fair and meaningful opportunity to refute and challenge adverse evidence to assure that the court\u2019s relevant findings are based on verified facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509-10 (5th Cir.1995), <em>opinion clarified, </em>77 F.3d 811 (5th Cir.1996). This right allows confrontation of witnesses pertaining to the revocation decision and does not extend to those witnesses pertaining to the revocation sentence. <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593; <em>United States v. Beydoun, </em>469 F.3d 102, 108 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Ho asserts that this evidence was the only evidence to support a finding that he committed a Grade A violation of his release and that the evidence tainted both the decision to revoke and his sentence. Ho does not dispute that he admitted all of the revocation allegations except the assault. Because Ho admittedly possessed cocaine while under supervision, the district court had ample basis to conclude that he committed a Grade B violation. <em>See United States v. Bishop, </em>228 Fed.Appx. 464, 465 (5th Cir.2007) (finding that possession of any amount of cocaine was punishable as a felony under Texas law and therefore constituted a Grade B violation). \u201cUpon a finding of a Grade A or B violation, the court shall revoke probation or supervised release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l). As the admitted Grade B violation required that Ho\u2019s release be revoked, his assertion that the evidence related to his Grade A violation affected the decision to revoke is spurious. Ho\u2019s remaining argument is that the challenged evidence tainted his sentence. As this argument pertains to his sentence only, the confrontation arguments he makes based on <em>Morrissey </em>do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
