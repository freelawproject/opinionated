Faulkner argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) because the offense involved sophisticated means. We review the district court\u2019s factual determination that Faulkner used sophisticated means for clear error. <em>See United States v. Conner, </em>537 F.3d 480, 492 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">Faulkner created fictitious room revenue credits using the house account and issued these refunds to her personal accounts. The majority of these refunds corresponded to the current nightly room rate and taxes. Faulkner\u2019s scheme \u201cmade it more difficult for the offense to be detected,\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>726 F.3d 684, 695 (5th Cir.2013), insofar as she created fictitious refunds, keyed the refund amounts to the current room rates, and deposited the refunds into four different personal accounts. Given these facts, the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement was not clear error. <em>See Conner, </em>537 F.3d at 492. Further, we are satisfied that, given the record, the Government has carried its burden of demonstrating that any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 718-19 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
