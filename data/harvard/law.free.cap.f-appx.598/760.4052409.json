In his complaint, Vazquez alleged that OCSU, in violation of Title VII, subjected him to a hostile work environment (Count I), retaliatory discharge (Count II), and disparate treatment (Count III).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court granted OCSU summary judgment on Vazquez\u2019s Title VII claims. Vazquez appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-18\">Title VII prohibits \u201cemployers\u201d from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, color, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Likewise, it prohibits \u201cemployers\u201d from retaliating against an employee because that individual opposed any practice made unlawful by Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). An \u201cemployer\u201d is an entity that has \u201cfifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court found that OSCU was not an employer because it did not employ fifteen or more employees during the relevant time period. Vazquez challenges this finding. We find no error. Viewed in the light most favorable to Vazquez, the evidence showed that OSCU never employed more than 14 employees during the relevant time period. The Supreme Court has expressly authorized the payroll method as the primary means of determining the existence of an employment relationship. <em>Watters v. Metro. Educ. Enter., Inc., </em>519 U.S. 202, 207, 117 S.Ct. 660, 664, 136 L.Ed.2d 644 (1997). And OCSU\u2019s payroll records clearly demonstrated that it never had more than 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>employees on its payroll at any point during the relevant time period, between January 2010 and December 2012. Although Vazquez argued that OCSU actually employed more individuals than those listed on its payroll, he failed to produce any evidence in support of this claim. Vazquez\u2019s conclusory assertion that OCSU employed more than 15 employees cannot save the day. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1564 n. 6 (11th Cir.1997). In sum, OCSU was entitled to summary judgment on Vazquez\u2019s Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-16\">. The District Court also granted OCSU summary judgment on Vazquez\u2019s defamation claim (Count IV). It is not before us in this appeal because Vazquez did not challenge the court\u2019s disposition of that claim in his opening brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-19\">. As noted in the style of this case, Vazquez sued his former supervisor, Barry Melamed, in addition to OCSU. Melamed was not a Title VII \"employer\u201d and therefore was not subject to suit under the statute. <em>Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b789-17\">. We lack jurisdiction to review Vazquez\u2019s argument that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying his motion to compel discovery because he failed to object to the ruling before the District Court. <em>See Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Failure to challenge [a] magistrate judge's discovery order to [a] district court constitutes waiver of [that] claim on appeal.\u201d (citation omitted) (quotation marks omitted)). We also lack jurisdiction to review V\u00e1zquez's argument that the District Court erred in denying his F\u00e9d.R.Civ.P. 59 motion to alter or amend judgment because his notice of appeal stated that he was appealing from the District Court's order granting summary judgment. Vazquez filed his Rule 59 motion the same day he filed his notice of appeal. We cannot infer that the notice challenged the District Court\u2019s denial of that motion because the District Court did not deny the motion until two months later. <em>See McDougald v. Jenson, 786 </em>F.2d 1465, 1474 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
