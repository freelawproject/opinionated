Anyanwu contends that the district court erred in its jury instructions on these counts by including references to \u2014 and a definition of \u2014 the word \u201charbor,\u201d even though harboring was not an element of the offenses. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b647-19\">On June 19, 2012, the United States filed an 18-count criminal indictment against Defendant Anyanwu. On September 18, 2012, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment, in 104 counts, charging Anyanwu with (1) one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; (2) one count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(I); (3) 50 counts of visa fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a); (4) 49 counts of alien harboring, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv); and (5) three counts of procuring citizenship unlawfully, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1425(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-21\">During a two-week jury trial, the government called more than 30 witnesses. Through these witnesses, the government introduced evidence that, for more than ten years, Anyanwu ran a business arranging fraudulent marriages between aliens who wanted to become United States citizens and United States citizens who wanted money. Anyanwu knew that many of the aliens were in the United States illegally. By arranging the marriages, Any-anwu enabled the aliens to receive lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>permanent resident status and remain in the United States indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The marriages were shams. On the day of the weddings, Anyanwu would provide transportation to the ceremonies for the citizens, most of whom came from Huntsville, Alabama. The alien and the citizen often would meet for the first time on the day of their wedding, and the weddings were never consummated. At the ceremony, Anyanwu would take pictures of the alien and the citizen, and he occasionally had each person bring several outfits to wear for the photographs. Most of the participants in the marriages interacted with their spouse only to the extent it was needed for the wedding and for convincing Immigration officials that the marriage was real.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Anyanwu charged each alien approximately $7,500 to $10,000 for his assistance in arranging the marriage and enabling the alien to remain in the country, and he paid the United States citizens each between $500 and $900 for marrying an alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">As part of the scheme, Anyanwu created fraudulent documents that were used by the \u201ccouples\u201d to demonstrate to the government that their marriages were bona fide. Among the types of documents that Anyanwu falsified for this purpose were W-2s, joint bank account statements, lease agreements, employment verification letters, and utility bills showing the couple listed together on an account. Additionally, Anyanwu prepared the aliens and the citizens for interviews conducted by Immigration officials who investigated potential fraud. And Anyanwu suggested answers that would help convince the officials that the marriage was legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">At the conclusion of its case in chief, the government moved to dismiss 26 of the 104 counts, including 13 of the counts alleging violations of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv). Those counts were dismissed, and Anyan-wu rested his defense without calling any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The district court issued the following instruction to the jury regarding the counts of alien harboring, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\"><em>Counts 53 through </em>101<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>charge the Defendant with committing the substantive offense of illegally harboring aliens. It\u2019s a federal crime to harbor an alien knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the \u25a0 alien is in the United States illegally. </em>The Defendant can be found guilty of this crime only if all the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt: One, the alien resided or remained in the United States illegally; two, <em>the Defendant knowingly encouraged or induced the alien to reside or remain within the United States; </em>three, the Defendant either knew or acted in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien resided or remained in the United States in violation of the law; and, four, the Defendant\u2019s motive was commercial advantage or private financial gain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">An alien is any person who isn\u2019t a natural-born or naturalized citizen or a national of the United States. A citizen of the United States is a person who was born within the United States or naturalized through judicial proceedings. A person who was born outside the United States is a citizen of the United States if both parents were United States citizens and at least one of them had a residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>in the United States before the birth. A national of the United States includes any United States citizen arid any non-citizen who owes permanent allegiance to the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">To act with reckless disregard of the fact means to be aware of but consciously and carelessly ignore facts and circumstances clearly indicating that the person transported was an alien who had entered or remained in the United States illegally. <em>To harbor includes knowingly doing something to help the alien escape detection.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">(Emphasis added). Anyanwu objected to the definition of \u201charbor\u201d in the last sentence of the instruction. The district court, overruling the objection, stated that \u201cthis is right out of the pattern charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">During deliberations, the jury sent a question and asked the district court to clarify the meaning of \u201cinduced or encouraged.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After conferring with the prosecution and defense counsel, both of whom agreed to the district court\u2019s response to the question, the district court instructed the jury that \u201cencouraged means what it means in ordinary, everyday English usage. It means to encourage someone. Induce means to influence or persuade. So induced would mean influenced or persuaded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">After further deliberations, the jury asked the district court to \u201cclarify and give an example of \u2018the Defendant knowingly encouraged or induced the alien to reside or remain within the United States.\u2019 \u201d After conferring with the prosecution and defense counsel, the district court responded to the jury\u2019s question by telling the jury that \u201cany further response ... would require me to comment on the facts of the case, and that I can\u2019t do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">The jury resumed deliberations and eventually returned a verdict, finding Any-anwu guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; one count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(I); all 37 remaining counts of visa fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a); 18 of the remaining 36 counts of alien harboring, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv); and three counts of procuring citizenship unlawfully, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1425(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">The district court sentenced Anyanwu to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. Anyanwu timely appealed. On appeal, Anyanwu raises only a single jury charge issue and does not challenge his sentence. Anyanwu argues that the district court erred in its jury instruction regarding the counts of alien harboring, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv), and the count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, in violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(I).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"At0v\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">This Court reviews de novo \"jury instructions challeng~d in the district court to determine whether the instructions misstated the law or misled the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\" United States v. Gibson, 708 F.3d 1256, 1275 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 571 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>342, 187 L.Ed.2d 238 (2013). \u201cWe will not reverse a conviction on the basis of a jury charge unless the issues of law were presented inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir.2008) (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000)). The district court\u2019s jury instructions are subject to harmless error review. <em>United States v. House, </em>684 F.3d 1173, 1196 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>568 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1633, 185 L.Ed.2d 616 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">B. Alien Harboring Under \u00a7 1324</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Section 1324, under which Anyanwu was convicted of 18 counts, is entitled \u201cBringing in and harboring certain aliens.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. The subsection of \u00a7 1324 under which Anyanwu was charged makes it a crime for any person to \u201ceneourage[ ] or induce[ ] an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The elements of a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) are \u201c(1) encouraging or inducing; (2) an alien; (3) to come to, enter, or reside in the United States; and (4) knowing or in reckless disregard that the alien\u2019s coming to, entering, or residing in the United States is illegal.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1250 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">On appeal, Anyanwu argues that the district court \u201cmisstated the law that was applicable to these charges\u201d and \u201c[misled] the jury into believing that the Government could prove a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) if the evidence showed Mr. Anyanwu harbored the illegal aliens involved under a definition designed for a different code section.\u201d Anyanwu contends that the challenged jury instruction \u201callowed the Government to convict [him] on an alternative theory [of \u2018harboring\u2019] that was not set forth in the indictment\u201d and asks this Court to set aside his convictions on those 18 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">This argument ignores that the district court did charge the elements of a \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) offense. In its jury instruction, the district court stated that An-yanwu could \u201cbe found guilty of this crime only if all the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt: ... the alien resided or remained in the United States illegally[,] ... the Defendant knowingly encouraged or induced the alien to reside or remain within the United States,\u201d and \u201cthe Defendant either knew or acted in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien resided or remained in the United States in violation of the law.\u201d Although the district court consolidated the <em>Lopez </em>formulation into three elements, it did not remove any of the facts that the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Put simply, the district court\u2019s charge to the jury prohibited a conviction unless the government met the burden it was required to bear under \u00a7 1324 and this Circuit\u2019s case law. Accordingly, there was no legal error in this portion of the jury instruction as far as it went.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>We do recognize, however, that \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) does not require any proof of harboring in order to sustain a conviction. Thus, the district court's inclusion of the harboring definition was unnecessary to the extent the jury had no need to consider that definition when applying the law to the facts of Anyanwu's case. Furthermore, although the district court claimed that the definition came \"right out of the pattern charge,\" this Circuit's pattern jury instructions include a definition of \"harbor\" in the pattern instruction for an alleged violation of a different subsection of \u00a7 1324-8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii)-and there is no pattern charge for an alleged violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv). See Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) at 556-57 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Nonetheless, as noted above, \u00a7 1324 is entitled \u201cBringing in and harboring certain aliens.\u201d Thus, the district court\u2019s provision of the definition of \u201charbor\u201d provided some context to the 36 counts that were entitled \u201cAlien harboring\u201d on the verdict form. And the definition was given at the end of a series of definitions, clearly separated from the part of the jury instruction that specified the elements of a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv). Accordingly, we cannot say that the district court \u201cmisled the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party,\u201d <em>see Gibson, </em>708 F.3d at 1275, or \u201cimproperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process,\u201d <em>see Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Furthermore, although Anyanwu contends that the inclusion of a definition of \u201charbor\u201d could have allowed the jury to convict him on the basis of a theory not presented in the indictment, the jury\u2019s questions reveal that the jury properly focused on the acts alleged in the \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) counts in the indictment: inducement or encouragement of aliens to remain in the country unlawfully. The jury asked no questions about harboring aliens, but twice asked the district court about the meaning of inducement. Even if we thought that the district court\u2019s instructions had the potential to mislead the jury, the jury\u2019s clear focus on the relevant language from \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) and the relevant counts in the indictment and jury charge, which included all the elements of the crime, leads us to conclude that, at most, this was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm Anyanwu\u2019s convictions for 18 counts of inducing or encouraging an alien to enter or reside in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv), and one count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">. The superseding indictment included 104 counts, of which counts 53-101 (49 counts) were the alleged violations of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv). As noted, <em>supra, </em>the district court dismissed 13 of those counts. The jury convicted Anyanwu on 18 of the remaining \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) counts and acquitted him on the other 18 counts brought under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">. The jury also requested clarification of other terms, which related to other counts and are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\">. The government alleged that Anyanwu violated \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(I) by engaging in a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv). The district court specified the elements of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) only once, when instructing the jury on counts 53-101. Anyanwu contends that the district court's jury instruction regarding the substantive counts, therefore, constituted error with regard to the conspiracy count, as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">. The district court\u2019s jury instructions did add an element to the crime with which Anyanwu was charged. Although the district court stated that the defendant could be found guilty only if \u201cthe Defendant's motive was commercial advantage or private financial gain,\u201d \u00a7 1324 does not make such a motive an element of the crime. Rather, the defendant faces an enhanced statutory maximum sentence if such a motive is established. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(i)-(ii). However, in the district court, Anyanwu did not object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the inclusion of that element in the jury charge, and on appeal he does not challenge its inclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
