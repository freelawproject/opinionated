J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-11\">May 9, 1904, Nancy A. Stivanson, prior to 1872, was the owner of out lot No. 7, Kittanning borough, and she is the common source of title. The plaintiff claims title by a sale of her interest in the real estate by her executors, and it is admitted that his paper title is good. The defendants claim under the statute of limitation. They showed that George Washington Stivanson went into possession of the property in the spring of 1872, fenced off the back part of the lot, thirty-seven feet six inches by seventy-eight feet six inches, and built thereon a house and stable costing about $1,500. Said G. W. Stivanson lived on the land until October 8, 1888, when he died, leaving to survive him his widow, Hettie Stivanson, and three children, who are the present defendants. They continued to live upon the premises until August 5, 1902, the time of bringing this suit. It was a disputed question of fact whether the possession of the defendants and their predecessor in title ivas adverse or not. We think there Avas sufficient evidence in the case to submit to the jury on that question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>We (lid submit it and the jury found for the defendants, so that question is eliminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">The main contention of the plaintiff is that the defendants have estopped themselves from claiming the land in dispute; first, because Henrietta Stivanson, one of the defendants, gave notice at the sale that she claimed the entire property, which is inconsistent with her present claim ; and second, that the other defendants accepted the amount awarded to them upon the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate, and cannot now claim the real estate itself. We submitted these questions to the jury instructing them that if they believed that this notice was given or the money received knowingly and wilfully the verdict of the jury must be for the plaintiff, but if it was done ignorantly, or if it was done by their attorney without their knowledge or consent, then defendants were not estopped. Was this error?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">The testimony shows that the defendant, Hettie Stivanson, was poor and ignorant and made her living by washing <em>; </em>one of the other defendants was blind and another paralyzed. They never claimed more than thirty-seven and one-half feet off the back end of the lot. For thirty years they were consistent in their claim, except in the typewritten notice that was handed to the executors. We are without information as to who wrote it or why such an egregious blunder was made. It appears to have been drawn by someone who had no knowledge of what the facts of the case were.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">Equally careless were the facts that on September 7, 1903, J. H. Fainter, attorney, receipted for $85.58, the amount awarded by the auditor to the defendants out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. This money was paid after the jury was sworn and while the case was on trial. When the defendants\u2019 attorney found that he had been caught in a trap, before the testimony was closed, he offered to refund the money to the executors, and offered to pay it into court. That the plaintiff could secure any advantage over the defendants by such a course of conduct is repugnant to our sense of justice and right. However there is no evidence that the attorney collected this money with the knowledge and consent of the defendants. \u201cThe admissions of an attorney cannot be given in evidence against his client unless they are made by her ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>press or implied authority. It would be an intolerable rule if it were to be held that the rights of clients could be divested by loose expressions of their attorneys: \u201d McGarry v. McGarry, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 71. \u201c A statement made by an attorney in the absence of his client is inadmissible in evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">In order to work an estoppel the plaintiff was bound to show not only that the defendants received the money, but that they did it knowingly : Smith v. Eyre, 161 Pa. 115. Thus in the case of Spencer v. Jennings, 139 Pa. 198, the administrators received the money arising from the sale of the real estate and invested part of it for the use of the heirs. But it was then held that the right to claim an estoppel against them fell, because it was not shown that they had knowingly received the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">As to the notice given by Mrs. Stivanson it is quite apparent that it was a mistake. It misled no one, or injured no one. The executors, who were the children of Nancy Stivanson, knew full well that she did not then or never had claimed all -the property. If no one is misled the doctrine of estoppel does not apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">It is doubtful whether the receipt of money by a legatee, claiming to be entitled to receive it, and much more as an heir at law, can be treated as an election to affirm the will: Sen-singer v. Boyer, 153 Pa. 628.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">Estoppel is governed by equitable principles and to allow it to be asserted under the facts in this case would be most inequitable and unjust: Miller\u2019s Estate, 159 Pa. 562.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">And now, May 9, 1904, the motion for a new trial is refused and judgment directed to be entered on the verdict upon payment of the jury fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\"><em>.Errors assigned </em>were various instructions and rulings on evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-11\"><em>M.
