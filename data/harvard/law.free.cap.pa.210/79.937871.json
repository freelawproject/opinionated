S. Ayres was employed by defendant company as its agent to purchase the lots of plaintiff, together with other lots situate in the Erdner plan, for which service he was to receive the sum of $250 as compensation. That subsequent to February 14, and previous to June 14, H. S. Ayres died, and his son, J. D. Ayres, was authorized by defendant to act in the place of his father in consummating the purchase of the various lots in the Erdner plan which his father had previously been employed by defendant to purchase for it. After receiving the note of June 14 of the sale of the lots and the confirmation thereof by plaintiff, plaintiff executed a warranty deed for the lots, which was delivered, to Mr. Ayres as the agent of defendant, and by him delivered to the attorneys for defendant company. The deed so delivered, not being acceptable to the defendant company\u2019s attorneys, was rewritten in accordance with their instructions, reexecuted and again delivered to defendant\u2019s attorneys, who again refused to accept it, and for defendant declined to complete the purchase and take the property. The letter of J. D. Ayres to plaintiff dated June 14,1901 was written and delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to plaintiff in response to instructions received by him from the president of defendant company in New York through its officers here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-3\">Verdict for plaintiff for $2562.18, subject to question of law reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-4\">The court on motion entered judgment on verdict for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-6\"><em>B.

We think they do. The option of February, 1901, is signed by plaintiff and was delivered by him to Mr. Ayres, who in receiving it was acting as the agent of defendant under a special employment. While the option appoints Ayres plaintiff\u2019s agent to sell the lots, it was understood by plaintiff that Ayres was acting for defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>that defendant would be the purchaser. The paper should therefore be treated as an option to Ayres as the representative of defendant, and would become binding upon both parties upon an acceptance by defendant. This we have in the letter of Ayres of June 14th, 1901, written at the request of defendant\u2019s proper officers, and if anything further is required we have plaintiff\u2019s ratification of the sale in writing and the execution and tender of a deed for the lots. It seems to us the writings above referred to are sufficient to bind plaintiff, and we see no reason why they should not bind defendant. This case is similar in many respects to Smith &amp; Fleek\u2019s Appeal, 69 Pa. 474 and McClintock v. South Penn Oil Co., 146 Pa. 144, and in our opinion is ruled by those cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The judgment is affirmed on this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
