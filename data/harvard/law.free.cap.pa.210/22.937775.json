J., filed the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-10\">Thomas Allison died in the very early morning of Tuesday, August 19, 1902. On Saturday, August 16, 1902, about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, he made his last will and testament. Jonathan Allison was the scrivener of that will, and he and his wife Margaret Allison witnessed its execution. On August 22, 1902, the will was probated without objection from any source. Albert J. Allison and Thomas Gr. Allison, the executors, settled their account and immediately made distribution. On February 10, 1903, the Board of Trustees of the Chartiers Presbyterian Church, which wa,s a beneficiary under a former will made by Thomas Allison, presented its petition in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>court stating that Iris will of date August 16, 1902, was made when lie did not have testamentary capacity, that it was made by reason of Jonathan Allison having exercised undue influence over him to have him make it, and that he did not sign the paper at the end thereof, and praying that an issue be certified by this court into the court of common pleas to be tried by a jury to determine whether these allegations were true or not. After notice to the executors and legatees named in the will, testimony taken before a commissioner was submitted to the court and argued by <em>counsel; </em>and <em>the </em>question now for decision is: Should the prayer of the petition be granted and an issue awarded to be tried by a jury in the court of common pleas ? The first inquiry is: Wliat rule shall guide us in determining this question ? It is this: Suppose the issue asked for had been granted, with the executors as plaintiffs, and suppose the case were before a jury on trial, testimony closed (being the testimony now before us) and suppose the executors, the plaintiffs, had just presented this p,oint to the court: Under the evidence in this case the verdict of the jury must be in favor of the plaintiffs, would the court feel constrained to affirm the point and thus give binding instructions to find for the plaintiffs and in favor of the will ? Or, to state the rule another way: Suppose the jury had found against the will and in favor of the defendants without such a point having been presented, and the executors, the plaintiffs, had made a motion for a new trial, assigning as a reason in support of the motion that the verdict was not supported by the evidence, would the court feel constrained to set the verdict aside and grant a new trial ? This brings us to a consideration of the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">Thomas Allison, the testator, was between seventy-seven and seventy-eight years old when he died. He died of Bright\u2019s disease, with which he had been afflicted for some time. In the fore part of July, five or six weeks before his death, his illness was of an acute nature and he took his bed. From that time until his death he needed constant attention. He was blind and had been so for two years or more. The acute attack that put him to bed in the first part of July was of such a character as to make him drowsy and when not in pain he slept a great deal. The cause of this was probably the uremic poison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>in the blood produced by the condition of his kidneys. He was weak and at times did not have control of his bowels. When the medicine administered had its effect on his kidneys and the poisonous matters were thrown off and thus prevented from being taken up in the blood, he would be brighter. He sometimes would imagine that he was not at home and would tell the nurse he must go and would try to get out of bed. He sometimes would involuntarily befoul the bed and more than once put his hand in the excrement. He became unconscious on the evening of Monday, August 18,1902, and from that until one o\u2019clock A. ivr. Tuesday, the 19th, the hour of his death, was in a dying condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">Thomas Allison was unmarried and his heirs at law were Jonathan Allison, a brother, Joseph Allison, a brother, David Allison, a brother, and Mary Allison, a sister. Jonathan Allison is married, has six children living and lives in East Washington, in this county. Joseph Allison, David Allison and Mary Allison are all single and never have been married. They live on a farm in Chartiers township, in this county. Up until about four years ago Thomas Allison, the deceased, lived with them, when his eyesight became bad and he came to the home of his brother Jonathan where he resided and was cared for until the time of his death. About two years ago, as we have already indicated, he became totally blind. While he resided in Chartiers township he attended the Chartiers Presbyterian Church but was not a member. After he came to East Washington he did not attend this church and his intercourse with its members, by reason of the distance, ceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">In 1889 he made a will in which he bequeathed to the Char-tiers Presbyterian Church one hundred shares of the stock of the Exchange Bank of Pittsburg, Pa. In 1894 he made another will, revoking the will of 1889, but in which he made the same bequest to the Chartiers Presbyterian Church. The last will was written by R. V. Johnson, and he and Albert G.Allison were named as executors. The will was left in the custody of Mr. Johnson and he had it at the time of Thomas Allison\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">According to the testimony of the witnesses to the will of date August 16, 1902, it was made under the following circumstances : Just after lunch at the noon hour of that day Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Allison and Mrs. Margaret Allison were in his, Thomas Allison\u2019s, room when he asked if Jonathan had gone to town. (Jonathan\u2019s office was in Washington a half a mile or more distant from his residence.) She told him he had. She then asked him if he wanted his brother. He replied that he did; that he would like to have him here\u2014that he wanted to change his affairs. Tie had once or twice before this spoken in Mrs. Allison\u2019s presence of wanting to change his will and she supposed this was what he meant. Jonathan returned to his home between three and four o\u2019clock of that afternoon and on his return Mrs. Allison told him that \u201c Tommy \u201d wanted to see him and had requested him to come to his room as soon as he came home. He went from the library to \u201c Tommy\u2019s \u201d room, taking some writing paper with him. When he reached the room \u201c Tommy \u201d told him that he wanted to make another will. Jonathan called to his wife and asked her to get him pen and ink. She brought him the pen and ink and a book to write on. He then said to \u201c Tommy,\u201d \u201c Now, how do you want this, how do you want this property of yours left, \u2018 Tommy \u2019 ? \u201d \u201c Tommy \u201d replied, \u201c I want Mary and Joseph each to get a thousand dollars.\u201d Jonathan then said, \u201c Won\u2019t you leave David a thousand?\u201d He replied, \u201cNo, I w'on\u2019t leave David anything.\u201d Then Jonathan said, \u201c What disposition do you want to make of the balance ? \u201d He replied, \u201c I want it divided among your children equally, share and share alike.\u201d After he finished writing, Jonathan said, \u201cNow, \u2018 Tommy,\u2019 I will read you this just as I have written it.\u201d He read it over to him. He said after a moment\u2019s pause, \u201c Read that again, Jonathan.\u201d It was read a second time, when Jonathan said, \u201cIs that the way you want it?\u201d He replied, \u201c That\u2019s just the way I want it.\u201d Jonathan said, \u201cWell, are you ready to sign it? There is nobody here but mother and I to witness it, but I presume that will do; if you want to sign it, you can make your mark.\u201d He sat up in the bed and touched the pen while Jonathan held the pen and made the mark. Jonathan and Margaret at his request signed as witnesses, and \u201cTommy \u201d then said, \u201c I am satisfied; now I have got things fixed the way I want them.\u201d When this will was written he had in mind his former will, as he suggested to Jonathan that he ought to have the will that was in the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sion of R. Y. Johnson. Jonathan told him it was not necessary, as he could put in this will that all other former wills were revoked. When Jonathan and Mrs. Allison went upstairs on this occasion, James Walters, a colored boy of seventeen or eighteen years, was in Thomas Allison\u2019s room. Before the will was. written Mrs. Allison asked him to retire. After he left the room he thought he heard some one say \u201c and the rest to our children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\">Jonathan Allison and his brother, after the latter came to the former\u2019s home, on more than one occasion had talked of the wills that had been previously made, and Jonathan had expressed the decided opinion that the large bequest to the church was unnatural and wanted him to make another will. At the times these conversations were had Thomas Allison mentally was in his normal condition and was a man of strong will and did his own thinking. In easy reach of Jonathan Allison\u2019s are many residences, and it would have taken but a few minutes to have obtained two wholly disinterested persons to have witnessed the will. Jonathan Allison and Margaret Allison, who witnessed the will, in their testimony gave the' details of the execution of the will as we have stated them, and gave it as their opinion that \u201c Tommy \u201d was perfectly rational and had an intelligent idea of the business he was transacting. Four of the children of Jonathan Allison and a student at W. &amp; J. College, named Sherrard, who is a relative of the family, and all of whom were in \u201c Tommy\u2019s \u201d room on Saturday, August 16, testified that he was rational when they visited him and competent to make a will. The attending physician says that he was rational on Monday morning, August 18; that on his daily visits to him he found him rational when he talked to him. John Walters, a colored man who was employed to nurse the deceased and who was with him continuously for five or six weeks immediately before his death, testified in a rather noncommittal way, \u201c That he didn\u2019t know, but he supposed he was not competent to make a will.\u201d No other Avitness expressed an opinion that the deceased did not have testamentary capacity up until Monday morning, August 18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\">The foregoing we believe to be a fair statement of the facts relative to the execution of the will and the mental condition of the deceased as they appear in the testimony. Some wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>nesses, however, were called to discredit Jonathan Allison. R. Y. Johnson, the person named in the former will as one of the executors, testified that two or three weeks before the death of Thomas Allison, Jonathan told him that \u201cTommy\u2019s \u201d mind was giving away; that at one other time Jonathan said \u201c Tommy \u201d had not been in his right mind and fit to make a will for thirty years. At another time shortly before \u201cTommy\u2019s \u201d death, Jonathan said \u201c His mind is much better.\u201d At another time he spoke of the deceased dirtying the linen and that lie put his hand in the discharge from his bowels. That Jonathan told him the next morning after \u201c Tommy\u2019s \u201d death that he had made another will, and on being asked when, said two weeks ago. That he also said at that time that it was unfortunate that he and Mag (meaning his wife) were the only witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">Mr. Allison\u2019s version of his conversation with R. V. Johnson was that he told him that \u201c Tommy \u201d was bad with his disease; that he suffered, and sometimes would not \u201c be at himself \u201d properly. He denied that he told him that \u201c Tommy \u201d had been out of his mind and not fit to make a will for thirty years. He says that knowing that \u201c Tommy \u201d made his first will when he was mad or in a pet, he did say to Johnson that he was not fit to make a will, that no man had any business making a will when he was mad. He says he told Johnson that \u201c Tommy \u201d made a will two or three days ago, not weeks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">With the case before us as we have found the testimony in brief to be, would the court be constrained on a trial before a jury on such testimony to give binding instructions to find in favor of the proponents of the will or grant a new trial if a jury had found against the will ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">We may concede as argued by counsel that the actions of Jonathan Allison in the premises were not what those of many another man would have been under like circumstances, that he threw himself open to criticism and suspicion when he wrote his brother\u2019s will, wherein nearly his whole estate is given to his own children, and witnessed it, together with his wife. We also may concede that he thought his brother ought not to give $10,000 to the Chartiers Presbyterian Church and wanted him to change his will in this regard, and so expressed himself to him. And we may concede this showed on his part a grasp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ing disposition. But these are not the questions to be decided in this proceeding. The question here is: Is there any reliable evidence before us that Thomas Allison was so far without mind as not to know the natural objects of his bounty, the property he owned and what disposition he wanted to make of it when he made his will on August 16, 1902, or that Jonathan Allison exercised undue influence over him when he made it, so that we could say that he was coerced into making it, and that its making was not his act ? We are clearly of the opinion that the testimony submitted to the court would not supports finding in favor of the contestants on either of these questions; and if a jury so found, the court would be constrained to set the verdict aside and grant a new trial. The issue prayed for should therefore be refused. A jury should not be permitted to guess that there was testamentary incapacity at the time the will was executed, or that the will was the result of undue influence because they might think that a former will made a better disposition of the testator\u2019s property than the will contested, and that influence had been brought to bear on him to make the change. Testamentary incapacity or undue influence must be proven before a will can be legally set aside. As our Supreme Court has held: \u201c The law presumes that every one of full age competent to make a will, is of sufficient mental capacity to do the act; and allegations to the contrary must be proved. Testamentary capacity is the normal condition of one of full age, and the affirmative is with him who undertakes to call it in question, and this affirmative he must establish, not in a doubtful but in a positive manner : \u201d Grubbs v. McDonald, 91 Pa. 236.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">Undoubtedly undue influence may so operate as to destroy a will, for in such a case the testator is not a free agent; he becomes the mere implement of another\u2019s craft, and his testament that of a superior will. But influence short of this is not what is technically known as undue influence. The term has. been carefully defined, and its effect considered in many of our own cases. According to these cases, undue influence may be exercised either through threats or frauds ; but however used it must, in order to avoid a will, destroy the free agency of the testator at the time and in the very act of making the testament. Solicitations, however importunate, cannot of them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>selves constitute undue influence, for though they may have a constraining effect, they do not destroy the testator\u2019s power to freely dispose of his estate: Englert v. Englert, 198 Pa. 326.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">And now, September 26, 1903, this citation came on to be heard and was argued by counsel, whereupon, upon due consideration, the issue prayed for is refused and the petition dismissed at the cost of the petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-7\"><em>John II.
