Kirchner ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-13\">Dr. Coulter says that \u201c the boy was a good patient. He observed instructions carefully and did as he was told. ... I had full confidence in the boy to not run and jump, and felt safe in discharging the boy at that time.\u201d \u201c Did you find the boy apt and intelligent and bright, able to understand your instructions ? \u201d \u201c Yes, sir; I think he is quite a bright little boy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-15\">The father says that before the injury the boy used to go with him right along and assist about the oil wells, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>father was pumping, but that the boy was not as bright as a boy of his age ought to be, and that he couldn\u2019t tell what time it was by a watch; that he never heard any complaints from anyone for whom the boy worked, and' that the boy brought his money home; knew when he got his money and got the right amount, and that he (the witness) never told any of the persons for whom the boy worked that he was dull; that he got along all right at school, but not as fast as he thought he should. The mother says that she does not think that he is as bright as some of the boys she has <em>; </em>that it is hard to make him learn; that she doesn\u2019t think he knows anything about care. On cross-examination she says that he can read and write, but don\u2019t pick up and learn like other boys ; seems as though he couldn\u2019t get along as fast as other boys; couldn\u2019t keep up with his classes, but says she can\u2019t tell in what way he isn\u2019t as bright as the general run of boys. Aside from this it appears from the evidence of the boy that prior to the time of his injury he worked for a Mrs. Hunt in Oil City, and worked for a dairy company about a year and a half, delivering milk and butter to customers, collecting money, and getting 13.50 per week and boarding for his services. The mother further says that he went to work at Siverly when he was seven years old, and worked for about a year or a year and a half before he went to work for the dairy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\"><em>jError assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-5\"><em>A.

Allegheny Valley R. R. Co., 88 Pa. 35 ; Kehler v. Schwenk, 144 Pa. 348. In the case of the plaintiff, a boy over fifteen years of age, of intelligence and capacity enough to be sent out to earn his living in outside employment, and to go from and to his home in the cars, the evidence of want of capacity should be very clear indeed to absolve him from the rule as to negligence in riding on the platform. The evidence produced fell far short of the required standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
