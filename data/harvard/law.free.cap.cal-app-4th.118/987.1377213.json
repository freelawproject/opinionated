A pellet from one of those blasts apparently hit a 12-year-old girl in the leg and caused slight bleeding. An information charged him with, inter alia, attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder and assault with a firearm and included, inter aha, criminal street gang, personal firearm use, and personal and intentional firearm discharge allegations. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a), 245, subd. (a)(2), 186.22, subd. (b)(1), 12022.5, subd. (a)(1), 12022.53, subd. (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) A.jury found him guilty of those crimes and found those allegations true.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Before sentencing, Garcia requested a transfer from criminal court to juvenile court on the ground that at the preliminary hearing the magistrate did not find reasonable cause to believe he was subject to the discretionary direct file provisions of Proposition 21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (d)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) In opposition, the prosecutor argued that Garcia waived any jurisdictional irregularity by failing to object and, in the alternative, that the magistrate\u2019s findings of probable cause to believe he committed offenses authorizing a Proposition 21 discretionary direct file were equivalent to the missing finding. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a), 245, subd. (a)(2), 186.22, subd. (b)(1); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7707, subds. (b)(12), (b)(13), (d)(2)(C)(ii).) The court denied the request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>The court sentenced Garcia to an aggregate 45-years-to-life term in state prison\u201415 years to life for attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder consecutive to 20 years for the personal and intentional firearm discharge enhancement and 10 years for the criminal street gang enhancement\u2014and stayed all other terms. Later, the court recalled the sentence and held a hearing on Garcia\u2019s request for a juvenile disposition. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1170, subd. (d), 1170.19, subd. (a)(4); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (d)(6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">At the hearing, the court characterized as \u201ckind of a long sentence for somebody [his] age\u201d Garcia\u2019s 45-to-life term, as \u201c[p]robably\u201d acceptable the 18-year term his counsel had tried to no avail to negotiate, and as inappropriate the notion \u201che be released at the time he\u2019s 25 years, in seven years.\u201d The court noted that Garcia returned to the United States after his deportation because \u201che liked the lifestyle of the gang,\u201d that he increased his involvement in illegal gang activities after his return, and that he even shot at someone \u201cto prove he was faithful to the gang.\u201d On that record, the court imposed the identical adult sentence as before to send the message that having \u201cthe younger people pull the trigger\u201d leads to no less harsh punishment than if \u201cthe 22-year-old gang members\u201d pull the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">1. Present Recollection Refreshed<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">2. <em>Juvenile Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Garcia argues a remand for resentencing is necessary for the court to receive in evidence, read, and consider a social study by the probation officer before the exercise of discretion to impose an adult sentence or order a juvenile disposition. The Attorney General argues the court lacks that discretion and, even if the court had that discretion, a result more favorable to Garcia would not be reasonably probable since the court already considered and rejected a juvenile disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Several questions about whether a court has discretion to order a juvenile disposition after a Proposition 21 discretionary direct file are pending before the Supreme Court. (See <em>People v. Thomas </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1520 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>[1 Cal.Rptr.3d 233], review granted Oct. 1, 2003, S118052; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1537 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 223], review granted Oct. 1, 2003, S117879.) Here, on a record showing the court\u2019s consideration on the merits of Garcia\u2019s request for a juvenile disposition, we assume arguendo the court has that discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The narrow question the record here poses is whether Penal Code section 1170.19, subdivision (a)(4) requires the court to receive in evidence, read, and consider a social study by the probation officer prior to imposing an adult sentence on a Proposition 21 discretionary direct file. The language of the statute answers that question in the negative:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\u201cSubject to the knowing and intelligent consent of both the prosecution and the person being sentenced pursuant to this section, the court may order a juvenile disposition under the juvenile court law, in lieu of a sentence under this code, upon a finding that such an order would serve the best interests of justice, protection of the community, and the person being sentenced. <em>Prior to ordering a juvenile disposition, </em>the court shall cause to be received into evidence a social study by the probation officer, prepared pursuant to Section 706 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and shall state that the social study made by the probation officer has been read and considered by the court.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.19, subd. (a)(4), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Penal Code section 1170.19, subdivision (a)(4) incorporates by reference Welfare and Institutions Code section 706, which requires the court to receive in evidence, read, and consider a social study by the probation officer after a Welfare and Institutions Code section 601 or 602 finding: <em>\u201cAfter finding that a minor is a person described in Section 601 or 602, </em>the court shall hear evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the minor. The court shall receive in evidence the social study of the minor made by the probation officer and any other relevant and material evidence that may be offered, including any written or oral statement offered by the victim, the parent or guardian of the victim if the victim is a minor, or if the victim has died or is incapacitated, the victim\u2019s next of kin, as authorized by subdivision (b) of Section 656.2. In any judgment and order of disposition, the court shall state that the social study made by the probation officer has been read and that the social study and any statement has been considered by the court.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 706, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Here, the prosecutor\u2019s choice of a Proposition 21 discretionary direct file necessarily obviated a \u201cfinding that [Garcia] [was] a person described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>Section 601 or 602.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 706; see Proposition 21.) Since Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 was adopted and amended before Proposition 21 and was neither amended by or after Proposition 21, the statute cannot possibly, and indeed does not, impose a requirement that the court receive in evidence, read, and consider a social study by the probation officer prior to imposing an adult sentence on a Proposition 21 discretionary direct file. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 706; added by Stats. 1961, ch. 1616, \u00a7 2, p. 3459; amended by Stats. 1976, ch. 1068, \u00a7 50, p. 4790; Stats. 1995, ch. 234, \u00a7 3.) Again, the language of the statute answers in the negative the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The \u201cfundamental task of statutory construction is to \u2018ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 774-775 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731].) If the language is clear, the plain meaning of the words is determinative, and there is ordinarily no need to look beyond the statute itself. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 24, 30 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 294, 954 P.2d 557].)  Since the language of both Penal Code section 1170.19, subdivision (a)(4) and Welfare and Institutions Code section 706 is clear that the court has no duty to receive in evidence, read, and consider a social study by the probation officer prior to imposing an adult sentence on a Proposition 21 discretionary direct file, we have no need to look beyond the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">\u201cDefendants are entitled to sentencing decisions made in the exercise of the \u2018informed discretion\u2019 of the sentencing court.\u201d <em>(People v. Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 348, fn. 8 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686], quoting <em>United States v. Tucker </em>(1972) 404 U.S. 443, 447 [30 L.Ed.2d 592, 92 S.Ct. 589]; see <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Burke </em>(1948) 334 U.S. 736, 741 [92 L.Ed. 1690, 68 S.Ct. 1252]; <em>People v. Austin </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 155, 160-161 [178 Cal.Rptr. 312, 636 P.2d 1].) Here, the court carefully considered facts about Garcia and his crimes and thoughtfully evaluated criminal and juvenile dispositions alike before exercising informed discretion to impose an adult sentence. On that record, the court did not err in making that sentencing decision without having received in evidence, read, and considered a social study by the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">3. Sentence Modification<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We affirm the judgment and remand to the superior court to modify the judgment by striking not only the 15-to-life term for attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder but also the consecutive 10-year criminal street gang enhancement and by substituting a term of life with possibility of parole and a 15-year minimum eligible parole date. The superior court shall issue and forward to the appropriate persons an amended abstract of judgment reflecting those changes. Garcia has no right to be present at those proceedings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 407-408 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Harris, Acting P.
