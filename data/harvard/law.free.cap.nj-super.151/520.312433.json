At the close of the trial the court attendant mistakenly delivered into the jury room, together with the documentary exhibits received in evidence, the pretrial order and a copy of defendant\u2019s brief. Following discovery of this error the verdict which that jury returned on the complaint and the counterclaim in favor of Butler and against plaintiffs was vacated and a mistrial declared. Plaintiff thereupon brought this action against the county in which the trial was held and the State of New Jersey seeking recovery of damages allegedly resulting from the \u201cinadvertent delivery\u201d by the court attendant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>harmful papers. This appeal by plaintiffs follows from two separate orders for summary judgment entered by the court below in favor of defendants on considerations of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The folio-wing provisions of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>59:1-1 <em>et seq., </em>are pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\"><em>N. J. S. </em>A. 59:2-1. <em>Immunity of Public Entity Generally</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">a. Except as otherwise provided by this act, a public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out 'of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">b. Any liability of a public entity established by this act is subject to any immunity of the public entity and is subject to any defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>59:2-2. Liability of Public Entity</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">a. A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of a public employee within the scope of his employment in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">b. A public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of a public employee where the public employee is not liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>59:2-3. Discretionary Activities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">a. A public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from the exercise of judgment or discretion vested in the entity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\">b. A public entity is not liable for legislative or judicial action or inaction, or administrative action or inaction of a legislative or judicial nature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-14\">c. A public entity is not liable for the exercise of discretion in determining whether or to seek or whether to provide the resources necessary for the purchase of equipment, the construction or maintenance of facilities, the hiring of personnel and, in general, the provision of adequate governmental services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-15\">d. A public entity is not liable for the exercise of discretion when, in the face of competing demands, it determines whether and how to utilize or apply existing resources, including those allocated for equipment, facilities and personnel unless a court concludes that the determination of the public entity was palpably unreasonable. Nothing in this section shall exonerate a public entity for negligence arising out of acts or omissions of its employees in carrying out their ministerial functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">As we said of these enactments in <em>English v. Newark Housing Auth., </em>138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>425, 428-429 (App. Div. 1976), \u201cthe basic legislative premise is to re-establish immunity for all governmental bodies within its definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\"public entity.\u2019 Immunity is all-inclusive within that definition except as otherwise provided by the act.\u201d In the comment accompanying <em>N. J. S. A. </em>59 :2-l the thought is expressed that under this enactment the judicial approach should be <em>\u201cwhether an immunity applies and if not, should liability </em>attach\u201d (emphasis in original). This was said to mark a departure from that taken by our Supreme Court in <em>B. W. King, Inc. v. West New York, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>318, 325 (1967), \u201casking whether there is any reason why it [immunity] should apply.\u201d It was hopefully contemplated that \u201cin utilizing this approach the courts will exercise restraint in the acceptance of novel causes of action against public entities.\u201d The comment closes with the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">Subsection (b) is intended to insure that any immunity provisions provided in the act or by common law will prevail over the liability provisions. It is anticipated that the Courts will realistically interpret both the statutory and common law immunities in order to effectuate their intended scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Plaintiffs contend that reading together <em>N. J. S. A. </em>59:2-2(a) and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>59:2-3(a) and (d), the conduct of the court attendant, being ministerial in nature, forms the basis of governmental liability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The duly of the court attendant went no further than to carry papers from one room to another. It lay beyond his competence to separate those papers which had qualified for the jury\u2019s inspection from those which had not. Thus, he served merely as the court\u2019s appendage in the physical execution of its powers. ITis conduct, therefore, is encompassed by the provision granting immunity to public bodies under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>59:2-3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">We observe that the responsibility for insuring that only evidential material is delivered to the jury does not rest solely with the trial judge. The necessary safeguards arc to be found in the adversary process in which counsel, as officers of the court, play a part and are expected to meet their unmistakable obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
