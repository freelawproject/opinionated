Hartford Ins. </em>Co., 143 <em>N. J. Super. </em>396 (Law Div. 1976). <em>Cf. Muller Fuel Oil Co. v. Ins. Co. of No. </em>Amer., 95 <em>N. J. Super. </em>564, 578 (App. Div. 1967); <em>Yarrington v. Camarota, </em>138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>398, 401 (App. Div. 1971), aff\u2019d 60 <em>N. J. </em>169 (1972). The insurance covers only against injuries or damage which occur during the term of the policy arising from operations of the assured which were completed at any time before or during the policy period. In the light of the foregoing, plaintiff\u2019s injuries not having occurred during the policy period, no liability therefor attaches to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Law Division is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
