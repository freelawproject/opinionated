The judgments of conviction were entered following court-approved agreements between defendants and the government pursuant to which the defendants pleaded guilty to the possession and conspiracy charges, charges of attempting to import marijuana into the United States were dismissed, and the defendants preserved their rights to appeal the denial of certain suppression motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, defendants contend that the warrantless entry onto a ship on the high seas by agents of the United States Coast Guard violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and that their motion to suppress certain seized items, including thirty tons of marijuana, should therefore have been granted. For the reasons below, we conclude that the entry was lawful and we therefore affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The material facts, which have been stipulated by the parties, concern the sighting of a ship by the Coast Guard in the northern Atlantic Ocean approximately 50 miles east of Cape Cod and the boarding of that vessel by Coast Guard agents on the following day. Shortly before 10:00 a. m. on September 24, 1980, a Coast Guard airplane flying a routine patrol off the New England coast sighted a freighter drifting with its engine off and its bow pointed south-southeast. The plane circled over the ship for about fifteen minutes, and determined that \u201cPanama\u201d and the name \u201cROONDIEP\u201d appeared on the stern of the freighter. While the aircraft was circling, the ship started its engines and began heading due south; the starting of the engines was visible from the Coast Guard plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The Coast Guard plane soon resumed in its original northeastern direction, but a number of factors caused the pilot and copilot to be suspicious of the ROONDIEP. In their training programs the officers had learned that a typical type of boat on which contraband drugs were carried was a coastal freighter 150-200 feet in length, flying a foreign flag. The pilot and co-pilot had two years\u2019 and one and one-half years\u2019 experience, respectively, in flying patrols out of Cape Cod. In their previous missions the officers had seen many freighters; generally the freighters had been under way and many had been laden with cargo visible from the air. In their experience a freighter did not drift \u201cdead in the water\u201d unless something was wrong. Because the ROON-DIEP was a 210-foot freighter of apparent foreign registry, drifting dead in the water, with no visible cargo, and had started its engines as the aircraft was circling it, the officers contacted the Coast Guard communications center in Boston and asked that the name \u201cROONDIEP\u201d and the description of the freighter be checked with the El Paso Intelligence Center (\u201cEPIC\u201d). EPIC is a computerized information center of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration which regularly supplies law enforcement agencies with information about vessels suspected of engaging in smuggling. Within the hour,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the station in Boston reported that EPIC\u2019s reply was \u201cpositive\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>included information that the ROONDIEP had aliases, including the \u201cROERDOMP\u201d and the \u201cBITTERN,\u201d that most recently the ROONDIEP had been sighted anchored off Aruba and had left Aruba without going into port, and that there was reason to suspect that the vessel might be used to smuggle marijuana into the United States. (Later that day, EPIC informed the Coast Guard that the ROONDIEP was not in fact the same ship as the ROERDOMP, alias the BITTERN, which was suspected of smuggling. None of the other information provided by EPIC was retracted.) After receiving the first EPIC message, the aircraft officers contacted Lieutenant Steven Spencer in the Coast Guard\u2019s Atlantic Area Command (\u201cComlantarea\u201d) and reported their sighting of the ROONDIEP and EPIC\u2019s positive identification. The lieutenant, who had eight years\u2019 Coast Guard experience, instructed the plane to relocate the ROONDIEP and maintain surveillance of it until a Coast Guard ship could arrive; he then directed the Coast Guard cutter TAMAROA to intercept the ROONDIEP. Spencer also made official inquiries of the five major United States ports within a day\u2019s steaming distance from the ROON-DIEP\u2019s location, and contacted the Canadian Maritime Command in Halifax; he was informed that none of those ports had seen or heard from the ROONDIEP.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The actions of Lieutenant Spencer, as well as those of the cutter TAMAROA, were supervised by Comlantarea\u2019s Operational Intelligence Officer, Commander D. R. Herlihy, who had been extensively involved in the investigation of drug smuggling. Herlihy knew that for several years drug smugglers had used a technique known as the \u201cmother ship\u201d technique, in which a ship loaded with large quantities of marijuana hovers off the United States coast while smaller boats come to the ship, get the marijuana, and take it into shore. Herlihy knew that the \u201cmother ships\u201d often flew foreign flags and that a number of such ships seized by the Coast Guard over the years had flown the Panamanian flag.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">At approximately 2:20 p. m., the TAMA-ROA, captained by Commander Anthony Pettit and having been advised of the ROONDIEP\u2019s location by the aircraft pilots, approached the ROONDIEP, and established ship-to-ship radio communication. Conversation between the two ships ensued intermittently for 30 to 40 minutes. During the course of these conversations, the ROONDIEP informed the TAMAROA that its last port of call was Martinique; that its next port of call was as yet unknown because its original orders to go to \u201cMaine or Canada\u201d to pick up lumber had been can-celled; and that it was awaiting new orders, perhaps to go to Europe. The officers asked for permission to board the ROON-DIEP; the master of the ROONDIEP refused, saying that he was leaving United States waters and that he saw no need for the Coast Guard to board. Later the ROONDIEP master said he felt the weather was not conducive to bringing the TA-MAROA and the ROONDIEP together. When the TAMAROA advised the ROON-DIEP that the latter was headed toward a shallow area not part of the standard ship lanes for international traffic, the ROON-DIEP master replied that he was not concerned because the ship was in light condition and did not draw much water. On the basis of the circumstances and in particular the ROONDIEP\u2019s responses over the radio, Pettit, a fifteen-year veteran of Coast Guard service, suspected that the ROON-DIEP might be involved in smuggling. Pettit relayed his information to Herlihy.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">All of the circumstances, including the ROONDIEP\u2019s appearance, location, actions, and radioed statements to the TAMAROA, led Herlihy to conclude that the ROON-DIEP appeared to be a \u201cmother ship\u201d carrying drugs that it wanted to smuggle into the United States. At Herlihy\u2019s suggestion, appropriate government officials contacted Panamanian officials to obtain confirmation that the ROONDIEP was of Panamanian registry, to report the suspicion that it was carrying drugs, and to request permission to board it. Panamani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>an officials, as they had done in past instances, gave permission for the Coast Guard to board and search the ship, acting as agent for the Government of Panama. At approximately 8:00 p. m., Herlihy relayed word of the Panamanian government\u2019s permission to the TAMAROA, whose commander determined, in the interests of safety, to put off until morning any attempt to board the ROONDIEP. Throughout September 24 the TAMAROA kept pace with the ROONDIEP which, as the day and evening wore on, altered its course from 180\u00b0 (due south), to 150\u00b0, to 120\u00b0, to 112\u00b0, to 100\u00b0, to 90\u00b0 (due east), and finally, just after midnight, to 95\u00b0.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">By the morning of September 25 the ROONDIEP was approximately 200 miles from the coast of the United States. At 6:10 a. m. the TAMAROA called the ROON-DIEP on bridge-to-bridge radio. During the twenty-minute conversation that ensued the TAMAROA twice ordered the ROONDIEP to \u201cheave to\u201d; the ROON-DIEP responded that it was in international waters, that it did not wish to be boarded, and that it did not recognize the Coast Guard\u2019s right to board it. Finally, the ROONDIEP asked whether the TAMAROA intended to use force and the latter responded in the affirmative, stating that it was authorized to do so by the Panamanian government. At 6:30 a. m., when the ROONDIEP still refused to stop, the TA-MAROA fired six bullets from a .50 caliber machine gun into the water in front of the ROONDIEP\u2019s bow. At 6:34 a. m., under protest, the ROONDIEP stopped and put a ladder over its side. At 6:38 a. m., six Coast Guard agents, led by Ensign John An-drezjewski, boarded the ROONDIEP. After asking to see the ship\u2019s registry papers, Andrezjewski asked the ROONDIEP\u2019s captain, Colin Gregory, what cargo the ship was carrying and was told that it carried none. At 6:58 a. m. Andrezjewski went to the cargo hold, where he smelled marijuana and saw hundreds of bales of marijuana. When he returned to Gregory and asked what was in the hold, Gregory responded that Andrezjewski knew what was in the hold. Andrezjewski thereupon arrested Gregory and the six other persons found aboard the ROONDIEP, who included the defendants here. Following the arrests, the Jube brothers told the Coast Guard officers that they had obtained the marijuana in Colombia some weeks earlier and had come north to deliver it, a task for which each crew member was to receive $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">After being indicted for the narcotics offenses described above, the defendants moved unsuccessfully for the suppression of various items of evidence against them, including items seized from the ROONDIEP and all post-arrest statements made by them aboard the ROONDIEP. On the basis of the stipulated facts the district court ruled, in an opinion reported at 507 F.Supp. 480, that the boarding was authorized by 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a) (1976)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and by the consent of the Panamanian government, and that the Coast Guard\u2019s reasonable suspicions of criminal activity made the boarding of the ROONDIEP a constitutionally permissible investigatory stop under the authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In addition, relying on <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974), the court held that the Fourth Amendment was satisfied by the acquisition of Panama\u2019s consent to the boarding since Panama had authority over the vessel. *</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Following the court\u2019s denial of the suppression motions the defendants agreed to plead guilty to the charges of possession and conspiracy to possess, import, and distribute marijuana, in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining count, which charged them with attempting to import marijuana. The agreement allows them to pursue on appeal their challenge to the Coast Guard\u2019s stop and boarding of the ROONDIEP on the ground that those actions violated the defendants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The issues for our consideration on this appeal are narrowly circumscribed by reason of the limited scope of the parties\u2019 contentions. The defendants attack only the stopping and boarding of the ROON-DIEP; they do not challenge the Coast Guard\u2019s search that followed the boarding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor do the defendants contend that the Coast Guard lacked the requisite statutory or other governmental authorization for the boarding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For its part, the government concedes that the information possessed by the Coast Guard did not rise to the level of probable cause to seize the ship or those on board. The question presented thus is whether, in the absence of probable cause, the stopping and boarding of the ROON-DIEP was constitutionally permissible. We conclude that in the circumstances shown here, the stopping and boarding constituted a legitimate investigatory stop that was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">It is fundamental that governmental searches and seizures without war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>rant or probable cause are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment unless they fall within one of the Amendment\u2019s few established and well-delineated exceptions. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2043, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514,19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). One such exception is the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d exception announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889. In <em>Terry, </em>the Court ruled that even in the absence of probable cause law enforcement officers may briefly stop a person on the street for investigative purposes; if, however, the stop has the ef\u25a0fect of restraining the individual\u2019s freedom to walk away, even though he has not been arrested, the person has been \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and that Amendment requires that the stop be reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A determination of the reasonableness of the stop requires the analysis and balancing of two principal factors: the governmental need for the stop, and the degree of intrusiveness of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The first factor is itself composed chiefly of two elements. First is the nature and extent of the governmental interests involved. Law enforcement is, of course, a cognizable interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>One general interest is of course that of effective crime prevention and detection; it is this interest which underlies the recognition that a police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880. The second element of the government\u2019s need to make the stop is the factual basis that implicates the governmental interests in question. Thus, as developed in <em>Terry </em>and in subsequent eases involving both pedestrians and persons in vehicles, the government is justified in pursuing its interest in preventing or detecting crime only if the officers are \u201caware of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts that reasonably warrant suspicion\u201d that the individual is, was, or is about to be engaged in criminal activity. <em>E. g., United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2581-2582, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975); <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). This standard is less stringent than probable cause, but it too is \u201can objective standard,\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-1880, requiring a \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion,\u201d <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980) (per curiam), and it means that legitimate investigatory stops cannot be made completely at random, <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979), or at the \u201cunfettered discretion of officers in the field.\u201d <em>Brown v. Texas, supra, </em>443 U.S. 47, 51, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 2640, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979). In determining whether an officer\u2019s suspicion was reasonable the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d must be considered, <em>United States v. Cortez, supra, </em>101 S.Ct. at 695, and \u201cdue weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883. In sum, given appropriate articulable grounds for suspicion, an investigatory stop to prevent or interrupt a crime may be made in the absence of probable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Adams v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 145, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The remaining factor in evaluating the reasonableness of an investigatory stop is the degree of restraint imposed on the individual\u2019s freedom. In general, if there is an official seizure of the person, even though there has not been a formal arrest, such a seizure is too intrusive to be supportable on less than probable cause. <em>Dunaway v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979). In <em>Dunaway, </em>the restraint was the police officers\u2019 taking the suspect from his neighbor\u2019s home to the police station and detaining him there for questioning; he was not technically under arrest, but neither was he free to leave. On the other hand the Court has held that the interception of a moving vehicle, causing it to stop for questioning, is not so intrusive that probable cause is required. <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra; United States v. Cortez, supra </em>101 S.Ct. at 697; nor is it unduly intrusive to order that a person stopped for a traffic violation get out of his car. <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977). The courts of appeals, applying these principles, have held that stops at gunpoint generally amount to arrests and thus cannot be sustained in the absence of probable cause, <em>see, e. g., United States v. Ceballos, </em>654 F.2d 177 (2d Cir. 1981); <em>United States ex rel. Walls v. Mancusi, </em>406 F.2d 505, 508-09 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 958, 89 S.Ct. 2099, 23 L.Ed.2d 745 (1969); <em>United States v. Beck, </em>598 F.2d 497 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Ramos-Zaragosa, </em>516 F.2d 141 (9th Cir. 1975), but that the \u201cutilization of force in making a stop will not convert the stop into an arrest if it is precipitated by the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>of the individual being detained.\u201d <em>United States v. Beck, supra, </em>598 F.2d at 501; <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>638 F.2d 507, 523 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In general, if there is reasonable ground for suspicion that will justify an investigatory stop, reasonable force may be used to effect that stop. In <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981), the Supreme Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">[i]n upholding the \u201cfrisk\u201d employed by the officer in <em>[Terry v. Ohio, supra], </em>the Court assumed, without explicitly stating, that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit forcible stops when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed. See <em>id. </em>[392 U.S.] at 32-33 [88 S.Ct. at 1885-1886] (HARLAN, J., concurring [\u201cthe officer . . . must first have constitutional grounds to insist on an encounter, to make a <em>forcible </em>stop.\u201d (emphasis in original)]). <em>Id., </em>at 34 [88 S.Ct. at 1886] (WHITE, J., concurring [\u201cthe person may be briefly detained against his will while pertinent questions are directed to him.\u201d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 2591 n.7. The <em>Summers </em>Court went on to state that in <em>Adams v. Williams, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">the Court relied on <em>Terry </em>to hold that an officer could forcibly stop a suspect to investigate an informant\u2019s tip that the suspect was armed and carrying narcotics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">101 S.Ct. at 2592 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Further, the intrusiveness of an investigatory stop does not become unreasonable merely by the fact that it lasts longer than a few minutes. In <em>Summers, </em>the Court upheld the detention of a person whose house was to be searched pursuant to a warrant that had been issued. As officers arrived to execute the warrant they encountered the respondent coming down his front steps; they took him back inside and detained him while they searched the premises. Although the duration of the detention is not clear from the Court\u2019s opinion, it is apparent that a thorough search was conducted, since narcotics were found under a bar in the basement. In upholding the detention of the respondent while this search was going on the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">the exception for limited intrusions that may be justified by special law enforcement interests is not confined to the momentary, on-the-street detention accompanied by a frisk for weapons involved in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Adams.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 2593.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">In sum, an officer having a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable, objective facts, that criminal activity is afoot may make an investigatory stop that is reasonable in both its duration and its intrusiveness into the individual\u2019s legitimate privacy expectations. In balancing the government\u2019s law enforcement interests against the individual\u2019s interests it is generally true that the more intrusive the stop, the stronger the justification need be, <em>see Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981); <em>United States v. Vasquez, supra, </em>638 F.2d at 520, and that \u201cif probable cause is lacking, the intrusion must be no greater than the circumstance require,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">We believe these principles are as applicable to searches and seizures on the high seas as they are to searches and seizures on land. Assuming, as we do, the truth of the fundamental proposition that the Fourth Amendment itself applies to searches and seizures by government agents at sea, <em>see </em>note 8, <em>supra, </em>we see no reason to suppose that that portion of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that governs the validity of investigatory stops, developed in land-based cases, is not also applicable at sea. There can be no question that there is a governmental interest to be served. The interest in preventing smuggling of contraband into the United States, or in detecting the commission of other acts in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>United States laws does not end at the twelve-mile limit. This law enforcement interest is reflected in several federal laws, not the least of which is 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a), which provided the statutory authority for the Coast Guard boarding in the present case. <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra. </em>Section 89(a), the full text of which is set out in note 5, <em>supra, </em>gives the Coast Guard the power to \u201cmake inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests upon the high seas and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, for the prevention, detection, and suppression of violations of laws of the United States,\u201d and to use all necessary force to compel compliance with those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Given these law enforcement interests, we cannot say as a general matt\u00e9r either that the nature of the need to stop a vessel to obtain answers to relevant questions is significantly different from the need to make such stops of pedestrians or land vehicles, or that the intensity of that need is significantly less at sea than on land. The intensity of the need may well vary from land to sea, as in some instances the ability of the officials to continue surveillance of a suspect will be greater on land and in others it will be greater at sea. The factors that may affect the need, such as the openness of the medium traveled, or the weather, or the maneuverability of the vehicle, are factors to be weighed in evaluating the need to make an intrusion into the suspect\u2019s interests, rather than reasons not to apply Fourth Amendment principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Finally, we find no basis for denying the government the use of investigatory stops at sea in the fact that many vessels include living quarters for their owners or their crew. While one has a more legitimate expectation of privacy in one\u2019s living quarters than in other areas, this expectation has greater relevance to the scope of a search than to the intrusiveness of a stop. Further, there is no uniformity of circumstance such as to warrant a prohibition against <em>\u201cTerry </em>stops\u201d on the water: many boats have no residential quarters; conversely, some land vehicles do have such quarters. And some areas of the common automobile are entitled to greater privacy protection than others. <em>E. g., Compare New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981), <em>with Robbins v. California, </em>453 U.S. 420, 101 S.Ct. 2841, 69 L.Ed.2d 744 (1981). Again, the differing expectations of privacy in various kinds of vehicles or vessels may result in differences in the balancing of the interests relevant in assessing the reasonableness of an investigatory stop, but they do not make inapplicable the principles that require the balancing to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In short, we are aware of no compelling reason to fashion a different set of principles for treatment of searches and seizures on the high seas than have been developed by <em>Terry </em>and its progeny. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>617 F.2d 1063, 1095-99 (5th Cir. 1980) (en banc) (Rubin, J., concurring in result). <em>See also United States v. Lee, </em>274 U.S. 559, 47 S.Ct. 746, 71 L.Ed. 1202 (1927), applying Fourth Amendment principles developed in the open fields of <em>Hester v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1924), to the high seas. We conclude that any land-sea difference in governmental need or in intrusiveness affects only how the principles are applied, not their applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Applying <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d principles to the case before us, we have no doubt that the Coast Guard\u2019s stop and boarding of the ROONDIEP constituted a seizure of the ship and those on board within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The order that the ROONDIEP stop, enforced by the firing of shots in the water in front of its bow, clearly restrained its freedom of movement, and with it the freedom of those on board. <em>Michigan v. Summers, supra; Terry v. Ohio, supra. </em>We conclude, however, that, even excluding that bit of EPIC information that was erroneous and therefore retracted before the decision to board was made, the officials had reasonable, articulable grounds for suspecting the ROONDIEP of engaging in activities in violation of the laws of the United States, and that the stop and boarding were not unreasonably intrusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The decision to stop and board the ROONDIEP was made on the basis of the observations and analyses of officials experienced in the prevention and detection of smuggling into the United States. They had previously dealt with many \u201cmother ship\u201d operations, in which a large vessel lingers offshore while other smaller boats come to pick up narcotics. When last sighted the ROONDIEP had hovered off the coast of Aruba for a time, leaving without going into port. When the Coast Guard first encountered the ROONDIEP it was hovering 50 miles off the United States coast, lying dead in the water for no apparent reason and with no visible cargo. When discovered by the Coast Guard airplane, the ROONDIEP immediately started its engines and commenced to move on. When asked its destination it stated that its original orders had been to go to \u201cMaine or Canada\u201d \u2014 an unusual lack of certainty. Nor had officials at the nearest major ports, which included two in Maine and one in Canada, ever heard from the ROONDIEP. The ROONDIEP also had no new orders for a new destination \u2014 a circumstance the experienced officers also found suspicious. Having given these suspicious answers, the ROONDIEP bit by bit altered its course until it ultimately was heading nearly directly out to sea. By morning it had moved to a point 200 miles off the coast. On the basis of all the circumstances, the officials were entitled to suspect, drawing on their experience, that the ROONDIEP was engaged in smuggling. The suspicion was reasonable and it justified further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The stop and boarding of the ROONDIEP were not an unreasonably intrusive means of investigating further. The Coast Guard\u2019s suspicions justified a more extensive investigation than could be made merely through additional radio inquiries. The officers were not required to receive answers to their questions from whomever the ROONDIEP master chose to put on the radio. Nor were they required to continue to assess the veracity of the ROONDIEP\u2019s answers through the inferior medium of airwaves rather than face-to-face questioning. Once the Coast Guard reasonably believed that it was receiving evasive answers from the ROONDIEP\u2019s captain, it was reasonable to seek an interrogation in person. Given the ROONDIEP\u2019s apparent attempt to escape, as well as the various factors indicating that the ROONDIEP might be involved in smuggling, the most practical means of investigation was to board the ROONDIEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The firing of warning shots to stop the ROONDIEP was not unreasonable, since reasonable force may be used if needed. The ROONDIEP had for some twenty minutes refused to stop upon request. The Coast Guard\u2019s firing of shots into the water in front of the ship appears to have been the least drastic way to force the ship to stop, and the shots were directly attributable to the ROONDIEP\u2019s refusal to submit to an authorized request to stop.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">A law enforcement officer who has duly announced his authority and who has attempted to stop and question a suspect is not required \u201cto simply shrug his shoulders,\u201d . . . and abandon his investigation .... [T]he officer has the right to detain the suspect against his will. . . . Indeed, the officer \u201cis entitled to make a forcible stop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\"><em>United States v. Gomez, </em>633 F.2d 999, 1006 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 944, 101 S.Ct. 1695, 68 L.Ed.2d 194 (1981) (quoting <em>Adams v. Williams, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 145, 92 S.Ct. at 1922-1923). Since the firing of warning shots appears to have been no more intrusive than the circumstances required to get the ROONDIEP to stop, this action was not unreasonable. Nor does it appear that any force was used thereafter. Although it is to be presumed that the six-man boarding party was armed, there is no suggestion that they boarded the ROON-DIEP with guns drawn, or even displayed their guns to those on the ROONDIEP.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Cf. United States v. Arra, </em>630 F.2d 836, 838-39 (1st Cir. 1980) (\u201cOne of the three boarders, Seaman Arce, carried a loaded shotgun, and the other two had handguns. Seaman Arce stood guard over the crew . . . during the course of the document and safety inspection.\u201d). And the parties\u2019 stipulation indicates that it was only after the marijuana was found in the cargo hold that the Coast Guard officers placed the ROON-DIEP master and the other six persons found aboard under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Finally, the stop cannot be impeached on the basis of its duration. Defendants argue that the length of their investigatory detention was unreasonable because 48 minutes elapsed between the first order to stop and the eventual arrests. This contention has no merit in fact or law. First, the initial twenty minutes consisted not of a detention, but of the Coast Guard\u2019s futile verbal attempts to persuade the ROONDIEP to stop. Further, the time required to stop and to board a 210-foot freighter cannot be equated with the time required to stop and to approach an automobile. Apparently four minutes elapsed between the warning shots and the ROON-DIEP\u2019s stopping, and an additional four minutes were required for the boarding party to reach the ROONDIEP. These times seem expeditious in the circumstances. Nor can we say that the twenty minutes between the boarding at 6:38 a. m. and the discovery of the marijuana and arrests at 6:58 a. m. was an undue period. The record is silent as to what occurred during that interval; but we note that defendants\u2019 brief on appeal states that after boarding and asking for the ship\u2019s registry papers the Coast Guard \u201cwasted no time\u201d in descending to the cargo hold. In all, it appears that the detention during the investigatory stop was of reasonable duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The stop and boarding of the ROONDIEP were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Defendants\u2019 motion to suppress was properly denied and their convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-17\">.

In the meantime, the plane had been instructed, in an unrelated order, to change course and proceed south.

Such authority is not here an issue.\u201d We note that \u00a7 89 has been held to allow boarding of a foreign flag vessel in circumstances similar to these. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>617 F.2d 1063, 1076 (5th Cir. 1980) <em>(en banc), United States v. Dominguez, </em>604 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1014, 100 S.Ct. 664, 62 L.Ed.2d 644 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\">. The government advances two alternative grounds on which it urges us to uphold the boarding of the ROONDIEP. First, it argues that the Fourth Amendment simply does not apply to searches and seizures of ships on the high seas. And second, it argues that if the Fourth Amendment is applicable, the consent of the Panamanian government provided a basis for finding the boarding constitutional. While we need not reach either ground, we are constrained to note our skepticism as to the first and our rejection of the second.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-14\">In arguing that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches and seizures at sea, the government contends principally (1) that statutes passed by the country\u2019s first Congress excepted Coast Guard boardings from the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of reasonableness, and (2) that the extensive regulation of commercial shipping nullifies any privacy expectation. As for the historical argument, the 1790 statutes are hardly dispositive. Each deals with inspections of vessels in or near American ports, not on the high seas. <em>See </em>Act of July 31, 1789, Ch. 5, 1 Stat. 29. <em>See </em>Ch. 35, \u00a7 31, 1 Stat. 164 (1790). While we do not believe the issue has been squarely raised in the Supreme Court, the Court appears to have assumed that the Fourth Amendment is applicable to Coast Guard searches on the high seas. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>274 U.S. 559, 563, 47 S.Ct. 746, 748, 71 L.Ed. 1202 (1927) (\u201csearch, if any, of the motor boat at sea did not violate the Constitution, for it was made by the boatswain as an incident of a lawful arrest\u201d). Even were it assumed that the first Congress intended to allow the boarding of ships on the high seas without probable cause, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>would not settle the issue of what is a reasonable search today. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>617 F.2d 1063, 1095 (5th Cir. 1980) (en banc) (Rubin, J., concurring in result). We are bound to interpret the Fourth Amendment in the light of contemporary notions of privacy as well as contemporary technology. <em>Cf. Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). In 1789, for example, the boarding of a vessel may have been virtually the only means available to conduct an investigation. This is not the case in a world where ship-to-ship radio communication enables the Coast Guard to obtain answers to various questions and ship-to-shore radio often permits speedy verification. We thus believe that the historical argument pressed by the Government is of little help in ruling on the Fourth Amendment question here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">Nor are we persuaded to hold in this case that the Fourth Amendment does not apply because crews on commercial ships, like gun dealers or liquor purveyers, have a greatly reduced expectation of privacy because they know that they are subject \u201cto a full arsenal of governmental regulation,\u201d <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 313, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 1820-1821, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978). <em>See United States v. Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972) (firearms industry); <em>Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 72, 90 S.Ct. 774, 25 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970) (liquor industry). In the present case the Coast Guard made no attempt to cast its boarding of the ROONDIEP as an administrative inspection. We thus do not regard this as an appropriate occasion to rule on the permissible scope of such administrative actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Finally, we reject the government\u2019s argument that the consent of the Panamanian government provided an \u201cindependent constitutional basis\u201d for the boarding. We do not regard the permission granted by a foreign sovereign whose interest is purely regulatory as the kind of constitutionally sufficient \u201cthird-party consent\u201d that was envisioned by <em>United States v. Matlock, supra. </em>The efficacy of that type of consent \u201crests ... on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>415 U.S. at 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. at 993 n. 7. Whether or not the permission of Panama provides an additional source of <em>statutory </em>authorization, as a \u201cspecial arrangement\u201d between Panama and the United States pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1581(h) and 1587(a) (1976), it thus has no bearing on the constitutional issues raised on this appeal. Since the boarding of the ROONDIEP conformed to Fourth Amendment principles, the Panamanian government\u2019s permission adds nothing to the constitutional analysis; if the boarding had been unreasonable under the Constitution, permission from a foreign sovereign could not cure the constitutional infirmity. <em>United States v. Conroy, </em>589 F.2d 1258, 1265 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 831, 100 S.Ct. 60, 62 L.Ed.2d 40 (1979).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">.

And I readily agree with Judges Rubin, Kravitch, Johnson, and Randall of the Fifth Circuit that with probable cause and the usual exigencies involved in the case of vessels, a warrantless search may be conducted. <em>United States v.

Unless the ultimately responsible agency promulgates neutral, reviewable rules, I cannot see extending the <em>Terry </em>exception, <em>Terry v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (law of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d), beyond situations involving an officer on the beat to situations involving \u201ca <em>course of organized police conduct,\u201d United States v.

Such rulemaking would both regulate the discretion of law enforcement officers and for the most part eliminate the need, on review, for ad hoc, case-by-case examinations of whether those officers\u2019 suspicions, falling short of probable cause, are reasonable in light of their experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The Supreme Court has indicated that <em>Terry </em>should be interpreted narrowly, <em>see Dunaway v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 210, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 2255, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979) (\u201cBecause <em>Terry </em>involved an exception to the general rule requiring probable cause, this Court has been careful to maintain its narrow scope. <em>Terry </em>itself involved a limited, on-the-street frisk for weapons\u201d); <em>Si-bron v.

This concern, discussed by the court in <em>United States v. Barbera, </em>514 F.2d 294 (2d Cir. 1975) (border searches), gives rise to the \u201cregulatory\u201d view of the Fourth Amendment that I have previously endorsed, <em>see United States v.

I fear that a continuously widened <em>Terry </em>exception will eventually swallow the Fourth Amendment; that the \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d already permissible by officers on the beat, <em>Terry, Sibron, Adams, Dunaway, </em>at the border, <em>United States v.

United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 272-73, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 2539-2540, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), will become a general search warrant putting, in the words of James Otis, \u201cthe liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\u201d <em>See </em>Amsterdam, <em>Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, </em>58 Minn.L.Rev. 349, 438 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">This regulatory approach, applicable where organized police conduct makes practicable the codification of procedures, would not render the law enforcement agencies of the United States powerless to interdict drug traffic and more particularly to stop \u201cmother ships.\u201d There is no reason that the United States Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Customs Service cannot devise \u201ca plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers,\u201d <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. at 51, 99 S.Ct. at 2640-2641. <em>See also Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1401, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 558, 562, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3083, 3085, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976). Evidently there are already Coast Guard boarding manuals, <em>see </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>93 Harv.L.Rev. at 725 n.5, and both the Coast Guard and the Customs Service have printed formal profiles of smuggling vessels, <em>id. </em>at 730 n.28. The EPIC computer system may also be taken into account though not, perhaps, given conclusive effect. <em>Cf. United States v. Sanders, </em>663 F.2d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 1981) (border search relying in part on Treasury Enforcement Computer Systems printout held reasonable); <em>United States v. Asbury, </em>586 F.2d 973, 976 (2d Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">As I read 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89, the statute under which the Coast Guard made the search and seizure in the instant case, Congress contemplated the adoption of rules and regulations by which the officers of the Coast Guard would act. Under subpara-graph (b) of section 89, printed in full in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Coast Guard officers enforcing the narcotics laws are agents of the particular executive department charged with the administration of those laws and are \u201csubject to all the rules and regulations promulgated by such department . . . with respect to the enforcement of that law.\u201d Just as Congress contemplated rules and regulations \u201cprescribed by the Attorney General\u201d relating to border searches conducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(3); <em>United States v. Barbera, </em>514 F.2d at 296-97, so too are regulations contemplated in the case of high-seas stops pursuant to section 89. Absent either a warrant, probable cause coupled with the usual exigencies, or conformity to reviewable rules and regulations, I do not believe that the Fourth Amendment permits the search of foreign vessels on the high seas. Accordingly, it being conceded that none of these was present here, I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">. Under Article 22 of the Convention on the High Seas, 450 U.N.T.S. 82, 13 U.S.T. 2313, T.l.A.S. No. 5200 (1958), to which the United States and Panama are signatories, a foreign merchant ship on the high seas may not be boarded unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting that the ship is engaged in piracy or slave trade, or, though flying a foreign flag, is actually of the same nationality as the boarding ship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-12\">.
