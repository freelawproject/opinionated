The issues presented have been accorded full consideration by the court; they occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Local Rule 13(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-10\">Charles J. Carney appeals from three different rulings of the District Court. In our view, the ruling of the District Court denying appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to exclude from use at trial certain evidence purportedly covered by the Speech or Debate Clause is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976), and it is therefore unappealable. <em>See Cogen v. United States, </em>278 U.S. 221, 49 S.Ct. 118, 73 L.Ed. 275 (1929); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949); <em>United States v. Mock, </em>604 F.2d 336, 340 (5th Cir. 1979). Similarly, the District Court\u2019s ruling denying appellant\u2019s motion to permit inspection of the grand jury minutes is unappealable at this juncture. <em>See In re Special March 1974 Grand Jury, </em>541 F.2d 166 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 929, 97 S.Ct. 1547, 51 L.Ed.2d 773 (1977); 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 110.13[11] at 193 (2d ed. 1980). The third ruling of the District Court, denying Carney\u2019s motion to dismiss the grand jury indictment on Speech or Debate Clause grounds, is immediately appealable. <em>See Helstoski v. Meanor, </em>442 U.S. 500, 99 S.Ct. 2445, 61 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979). We hold, however, that the District Court\u2019s denial of this motion was proper. Even if it is true, as appellant claims, that some of the evidence presented to the grand jury violated the Speech or Debate Clause, dismissal of the grand jury indictment was not appropriate. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>383 U.S. 169, 86 S.Ct. 749, 15 L.Ed.2d 681 (1966); <em>United States v. Myers, </em>635 F.2d 932, 941 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 956, 101 S.Ct. 364, 66 L.Ed.2d 221 (1980); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>419 F.2d 56, 58 (4th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1010, 90 S.Ct. 1235, 25 L.Ed.2d 423 (1970); <em>cf. United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); <em>Costello v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 62, 100 L.Ed. 755 (1956). <em>But see United States v. Helstoski, </em>635 F.2d 200 (3d Cir. 1980). Rather, we think that only those parts of an indictment which are facially invalid should be dismissed on Speech or Debate Clause grounds. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, supra, </em>383 U.S. 169, 86 S.Ct. 749, 15 L.Ed.2d 681. In the instant case, however, appellant does not challenge the facial validity of the one-count indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">On consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED by this court that the portions of this appeal which challenge the District Court\u2019s rulings on the motion to exclude certain evidence from use at appellant\u2019s trial and the motion to permit inspection of grand jury minutes, being unappealable at this juncture, are hereby dismissed. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-14\">FURTHER ORDERED and ADJUDGED by this court that the ruling of the District Court which denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the grand jury indictment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
