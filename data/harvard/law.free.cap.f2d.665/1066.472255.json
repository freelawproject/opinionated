Appellant, Mariner Water Renaturalizer of Washington, Inc., contends that the court erred in its handling of breach of warranty and misrepresentation claims against appellees Aqua Purification Systems, Inc., Ben Zino, president of Aqua, and George Dunbrook, vice-president, and abused its discretion by refusing to award punitive damages. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-22\">Mariner is a corporation organized primarily to market consumer treatment units designed to improve the quality of tap water. Its incorporators formed the company after extensive discussions with Aqua centering on the purchase and sale of various types of water regulators. This case arose as a consequence of a dispute between Mariner and Aqua concerning the purchase of 250 such regulators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-23\">Although there is some disagreement as to when the transaction was consummated, the District Court found that the units were shipped to Mariner by Aqua on July 9,1976. Fifty of the units were \u201cAP3\u201d models, and the rest were \u201cAP6\u201d or \u201cAP644\u201d regulators. At the time the shipment was made and accepted, the two companies were involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>in further negotiations contemplating the possibility that Mariner would become the exclusive distributor of Aqua products in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware areas. The District Court found, however, that no such agreement had been consummated either at the time of the shipment or at any time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Mariner\u2019s purchase of the water regulators was based principally on Aqua\u2019s representation that the units in suit were actually water purifiers \u2014 in other words, capable of eliminating all disease-carrying bacteria, as well as distasteful odors and colors, from water supplies. Aqua assured Mariner that these claims could be advertised, but shortly after Mariner began making sales of the regulators it was notified by a Pennsylvania distributor that questions as to the efficacy of the units had been raised by Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Following this, Mariner wrote to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeking further information about the units. The nature of the AP3 and AP6 regulators made them \u201cpesticides\u201d required to be registered with EPA pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenti-cide Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Aqua had unequivocally represented to Mariner that both types of units were properly registered as water purifiers. EPA, however, subsequently disclosed that only one model of the Mariner regulators, the AP6, was registered with EPA, and that none of the models completely eradicated or killed disease-carrying bacteria as advertised. Even the registered model was merely classified as \u201cbacteriostatic,\u201d the classification for units that inhibit but do not exterminate harmful bacteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">After receiving this information, Mariner sought reimbursement from Aqua for the purchase price- of the units. When this effort proved to be unsuccessful, Mariner filed suit against Aqua in the District Court, seeking rescission and damages on grounds of breach of contract, breach of warranty, and misrepresentation-fraud. The contract claim was dismissed, and the case went to trial on the breach-of-warranty and misrepresentation-fraud theories. The District Court denied all relief for the breach of warranty, and refused to grant rescission for the misrepresentations. The court did, however, award damages \u2014 actual but not punitive, and only with respect to the AP3 units \u2014 on the basis of the misrepresentations. The factual and legal determinations underlying this disposition are the subjects of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">In rejecting Mariner\u2019s breach of warranty theory, the District Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS3\">[t]he proof fails to show when, if ever, [Mariner] perfected its breach of warranty claim by notifying [Aqua] that the transaction was troublesome as required by U.C.C. \u00a7 2-607(3)(a), D.C.Code \u00a7 28:2-607(3)(a). In any event, it is clear that whatever notification was given, it was not made promptly. Accordingly, this count of [Mariner\u2019s] complaint must fail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">Mariner disputes the court\u2019s finding on this point, arguing that the time period was within acceptable bounds. The relevant section of the District of Columbia Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defines the limit applicable as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>Where a tender has been accepted (a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of the breach or be barred from any remedy.... <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHs\">The cases establish that what, under District of Columbia law, constitutes a \u201creasonable time\u201d in this context is a question of fact \u201cunless all the circumstances lead to but one conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">In the instant proceeding, the District Court found that in late May or early June, 1977, Mariner learned from EPA \u201cthat only one model of the Mariner Regulators \u2014 the AP6 \u2014 -was registered and that none of the models functioned in a manner that, according to EPA\u2019s view of the law and regulations, would justify an advertised claim that the model completely eradicated or killed disease-carrying bacteria.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The time interval elapsing between the discovery of this breach of warranty and Mariner\u2019s alleged notification of appellees on July 15,1977,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was thus in the neighborhood of five to eight weeks. Given these facts, we can hardly say that the District Court\u2019s finding that this time lapse exceeded the bounds of reasonableness was clearly erroneous,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> especially in light of the high standards by which transactions between merchants are measured under the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, Mariner has not alerted us to \u2014 nor have we discovered\u2014 any authority establishing that five to eight weeks is reasonable as a matter of law in situations such as this one. Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Mariner\u2019s breach of warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-14\">We reach the same result with respect to Mariner\u2019s efforts to obtain rescission as a remedy for the misrepresentations alleged. As the District Court correctly stated, \u201c[t]he law of the District of Columbia affords the victim of fraud or misrepresentation (in the context of a sale transaction) with an election between two mutually exclusive remedies, rescission of the sale or damages.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the local law also is that \u201cone who seeks to rescind a contract must act within a reasonable time after discovery of the facts justifying rescission. ... Determination of what constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the particular facts of the case and ordinarily is a question of fact, though, in extreme cases it may be one of law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unfortunately for Mariner, the District Court determined that it was precluded from pursuing a rescission remedy because the \u201celection to rescind the sales contract [was made], if at all, long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>after any reasonable notice period had passed.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">In this instance, discovery of the facts justifying rescission took place at the same time the breach of warranty was uncovered \u2014 late May or early June, 1977, when EPA disclosed the actual registration status of the water purification units sold to Mariner. Once again we perceive no reason to overturn the District Court\u2019s finding that the time interval in question was unreasonable. As was true with respect to the breach of warranty claim, Mariner has not presented us with \u2014 and we have not found \u2014 any authority in this jurisdiction establishing that a five-week to eight-week period is reasonable as a matter of law for purposes of an election to rescind. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that Mariner\u2019s claim of entitlement to rescission as a remedy for misrepresentation must fail.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">We are equally convinced that Mariner\u2019s objections to the District Court\u2019s treatment of its damage claims with respect to the alleged misrepresentations are without substance. We do not accept the contention that the court improperly imposed upon Mariner a duty to mitigate damages comparable to the obligations incumbent upon plaintiffs in breach of contract actions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is apparent to us that the District Court held against Mariner on this issue on the basis of the well-settled rule that claims sounding in misrepresentation or fraud require proof of damages as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>element of the cause of action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the measure of damages for misrepresentation of goods sold is the difference between the value of the goods as represented to the buyer and the worth of those he actually received.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this case, the District Court awarded damages for misrepresentation with respect to the AP3 units, but found itself unable to determine damages related to the AP6 units because Mariner had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbO\">made no effort to show, to any degree of reasonable certainty, the price at which the AP6\u2019s could have been sold under truthful advertising. Since the units were registered, they could have been lawfully marketed so long as consumers were told they were \u201cbacteriostats.\u201d As such, the units were highly efficacious and surely saleable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow damages where none had properly been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">We reach a similar conclusion with respect to Mariner\u2019s remaining damage claims. The District Court denied compensatory damages because of inadequate proof; for example, they were not particularized, or they were sustained by nonparties, or came about after Mariner\u2019s discovery that the AP6\u2019s were not properly registered.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Expenses which Mariner sought as consequential damages, the court found, were incurred as a result of a \u201cvain anticipation\u201d on Mariner\u2019s part \u201cthat it would consummate a long-term distribution dealership with [Aqua].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree with the District Court that these losses also are unrecoverable. Mariner has not demonstrated that Aqua made any misrepresentation with respect to a possible dealership arrangement, and \u201c[i]t is only where the fact misstated was of a nature calculated to bring about the result that damages for it can be recovered.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-15\">Finally, we turn to the issue of punitive damages.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The District Court found that \u201cthe proof unequivocally establishes that [appellees] knew that their statements were false, yet they nonetheless repeatedly and prominently made them knowing that they concerned a material fact and that [Mariner] was detrimentally placing reliance on them.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Still, we are not convinced that it would be appropriate for us to order the District Court to impose punitive damages. Under the law of the District of Columbia, such damages are disfavored, and their award is within the sound discretion of a trial court that is sitting without a jury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The conduct complained of must, for example, be \u201cwillful and outrageous,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> constitute \u201cgross fraud,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> or be \u201caggravated by \u2018evil motive, active malice, deliberate violence or oppression.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> While the instant misrepresentation seems willful, the record is not so strong as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>persuade us that the District Court abused its discretion in denying punitive damages.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">Mariner thus encounters insuperable obstacles at every critical point. We are sympathetic to its plight, but the outcome is clear. For the reasons stated, the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"AQZq\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136 <em>et seq. </em>(1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">. <em>Mariner Water Renaturalizer of Washington, Inc. v.

This case came before the District Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1976). The doctrine of <em>Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), does not extend to federal courts sitting in the District of Columbia, but we have held that the substantive law of the District, including its choice-of-law rules, is to be followed analogously. <em>Steorts v. American Airlines, </em>647 F.2d 194 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>Tuxedo Contractors v. Swindell-Dressler, </em>198 U.S.App. D.C. 426, 428-429, 613 F.2d 1159, 1161-1162 (1979); <em>Lee v.

In addition to its substantive objections to the District Court\u2019s decision, Mariner advances two procedural contentions. The first centers on the question whether the fact of actual notice was established by the pleadings, therefore obviating the need for proof of notice at trial. The genesis of this argument is an allegation in Mariner\u2019s amended complaint that \u201con or about July 15, 1977 [Mariner] requested in writing that [Aqua] make restitution for the cost involved in the purchase of Aqua\u2019s products .... \u201d Amended Complaint 8, J.App. 741c. This averment was admitted by appel-lees. Answer of Defendant Aqua Purification Systems, Inc. to Amended Complaint at j| 8, J.App. 34 [hereinafter cited as Aqua Answer]; Answer of Defendant Zino to Amended Complaint ]18, J.App. 60 [hereinafter cited as Zino Answer], Both defendants, however, denied that Mariner had offered to return the units, as also alleged in the amended complaint. Compare, Amended Complaint, <em>supra, </em>U 8, J.App. 741c with Aqua Answer, <em>supra, </em>8, J.App. 34, and Zino Answer, <em>supra, </em>8, J.App. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">Mariner correctly states that ordinarily an admission that notice was given would establish that as a fact, without the necessity of proof. At the trial of this case, however, evidence was admitted, without objection, in the form of testimony by Mariner\u2019s president, that arguably was in direct conflict with the allegation of notice in the amended complaint; Indeed, this testimony was given in the course of direct examination by Mariner\u2019s counsel. J.App. 776-777. In such circumstances, the trier of fact is free to consider the actual proof in addition to the pleadings, as the trial judge</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">clearly did here. See text <em>supra </em>at notes 2, 12. <em>Cf. </em>8 C. Wright <em>&amp; </em>A. Miller, Federal Practice 2264 (2d ed. 1979) (admissions are not binding on the party securing them).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">In any event, the District Court did not ultimately rest its holding with respect to either cause of action on lack of notice, but on a failure to provide <em>timely </em>notice. See text <em>supra </em>at notes 2, 12. Mariner argues, however, that litigation of the question of timeliness was likewise unnecessary because, it says, receipt of timely notice was not specifically denied by appellees in their responsive pleadings in accordance with the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(c) which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzB\">[i]n pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of performance shall be made specifically and with particularity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">Mariner appears to have overlooked the fact that Aqua specifically raised as a defense in its answer to the amended complaint the claim that \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] failed to timely revoke their acceptance of the goods purchased.\u201d Aqua Answer, <em>supra, </em>at 2, J.App. 20. Additionally, neither Mariner\u2019s original nor its amended complaint contained any allegation that all conditions precedent had been performed. In the absence of a general averment of this nature, a high level of prevision is mandatory for particular allegations of performance of conditions precedent, something that may well be lacking in this case.
