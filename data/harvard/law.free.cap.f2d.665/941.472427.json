This court has ruled that a non-appealing appellee may raise errors below in order to sustain the judgment below. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>293 F.2d 816 (9th Cir. 1961). Should this court conclude that Shepherd has a lessor\u2019s reversionaiy interest rather than a mere security interest in the equipment, it would have to sustain the judgment of the district court in favor of Shepherd. <em>See </em>4A Collier on Bankruptcy (14th ed.) \u00a7 70.18 at 230-231. Accordingly, it is appropriate to consider in this appeal Shepherd\u2019s challenge to the ruling of the courts below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1045-19\">MILTON L. SCHWARTZ, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1045-20\">Shepherd Machinery Company (\u201cShepherd\u201d), appellee herein, is a California corporation engaged in the business of selling and leasing heavy construction equipment in Southern California. J. A. Thompson &amp; Son, Inc. (\u201cThompson\u201d) was, at the time here in question, a California corporation engaged in construction work. On April 6, 1973 Thompson entered into two agreements with Shepherd, each entitled \u201cMachinery Lease,\u201d whereby Thompson leased two compactors and two bulldozers for a term of one year, the term being automatically renewed until termination of the lease either by Thompson by way of written notice to Shepherd or by Shepherd upon the default of Thompson. In conjunction with the leases Thompson acquired an option to purchase the compactors and bulldozers for a price determined pursuant to a formula whereby Thompson received full credit against the option purchase price for all rentals paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-21\">At the time the leases and option to purchase were executed, Thompson was engaged in construction activities in California and Hawaii and maintained offices in both states. Shepherd did not file financing statements covering the equipment in either state. However, about one year pri- or to the execution of the leases, Shepherd had filed a financing statement in California which named Thompson as debtor and which covered \u201cafter acquired\u201d property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-22\">Thompson utilized the construction equipment leased from Shepherd on two construction sites in Southern California. By January 24, 1974 Thompson was in serious default on its lease payments. On that date between 4:30 and 4:35 p. m., Pacific Standard Time, Shepherd attempted to repossess the compactors and bulldozers. However, because employees of Thompson had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>drained the fuel lines and removed the fuel regulators from the equipment and had barricaded the equipment with other heavy equipment, Shepherd was unable to remove the compactors and bulldozers from the two construction sites. Shepherd was, however, able to place several <em>&amp;h\" </em>X 6\" bright red stickers on the equipment. These stickers announced that the heavy equipment was the property of Shepherd and warned all unauthorized persons against tampering therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Approximately twenty minutes after Shepherd placed the stickers on the equipment, Thompson filed a petition for relief under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two days later, Shepherd removed the heavy equipment from the Thompson construction sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">In the subsequent Chapter XI proceedings, Shepherd filed a proof of claim for $55,807.20, the amount allegedly owed by Thompson to Shepherd under the equipment leases. Thompson\u2019s receiver, Ralph Aoki, appellant herein, responded by filing a \u201cComplaint re Objection to Claim and Counterclaim\u201d wherein he alleged . that Shepherd\u2019s repossession of the equipment was either a voidable preference or conversion of property belonging to the estate of the debtor. The receiver thereafter moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">The bankruptcy judge granted the motion in part, ruling that as a matter of law Shepherd had only a security interest, rather than a lessor\u2019s reversionary interest, in the heavy equipment. With respect to the issue of perfection of Shepherd\u2019s security interest, either by way of filing or possession, the bankruptcy judge ordered that the matter proceed to trial. At the close of trial the bankruptcy court ruled that pursuant to Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 9103, as in effect at the time of Thompson\u2019s Chapter XI filing (\u201c\u00a7 9103\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> perfection by filing required the filing of a financial statement in the State of Hawaii. Thus, Shepherd\u2019s previous filing in California was deemed inadequate. The bankruptcy court also ruled that Shepherd\u2019s placement of the red stickers on the construction equipment was insufficient to establish possession for purposes of perfection under Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 9305 (\u201c\u00a7 9305\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Shepherd appealed to the district court. The district court upheld the ruling of the bankruptcy court with respect to the nature of Shepherd\u2019s interest in the compactors and bulldozers. However, on the grounds that the bankruptcy court had misapplied both \u00a7 9103 and \u00a7 9305, the district court reversed the rulings of the bankruptcy court on the issues of perfection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Aoki now appeals from the rulings of the district court reversing the bankruptcy court on the issues of perfection. Shepherd challenges the conclusion of both the district court and the bankruptcy court that it has only a security interest, rather than a lessor\u2019s reversionary interest, in the construction equipment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">\n<em>Reversionary Interest or Security Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8d\">The threshold question in this appeal is whether Shepherd has a lessor\u2019s reversion-ary interest or merely a creditor\u2019s security interest in the construction equipment. Neither Shepherd nor Aoki disputes the fact that should the lease agreements be construed to be \u201ctrue\u201d leases, Shepherd would retain a lessor\u2019s reversionary interest in the heavy equipment and would be entitled to prevail. On the other hand, if the lease agreements are determined to be merely security devices, Shepherd can prevail only if it perfected its security interests. <em>See </em>Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 9301.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-9\">. . . whether a lease is intended as security is to be determined by the facts of each case; however, (a) the inclusion of an option to purchase does not of itself make the lease one intended for security, and (b) an agreement that upon compliance with the terms of the lease the lessee shall become or has the option to become the owner of the property for no additional consideration or for nominal consideration does make the lease one intended for security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">When the leases were executed, Shepherd granted Thompson a written option to purchase the compactors and bulldozers for the value specified in the option, and noted in the leases, with full credit of rental payments toward the purchase price. If rent payments covered the value of the equipment, the only additional charges would be certain taxes and an add-on charge of 5l/2% per annum from the date of the lease. Both the lower courts ruled that this purchase option transformed the leases, as a matter of law, into agreements \u201cintended as security\u201d pursuant to Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 1201(37).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Shepherd maintains that the lower courts erred in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">The lower courts interpreted subsection (b) of \u00a7 1201(37) as establishing conclusively that irrespective of any other facts concerning the transaction, a lease agreement is intended for security and, thus, subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, if it contains an option to purchase \u201cfor no additional consideration or for nominal consideration.\u201d Calif.Comm. Code \u00a7 1201(37)(b). A considerable number of courts are in accord.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>given \u00a7 1201(37) by these courts and by the lower courts in the instant case was aptly outlined by the Supreme Court of Oregon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIa\">At first glance the provisions of the above section [U.C.C. \u00a7 1201(37)] may be somewhat confusing, probably because they are stated in the inverse order of importance. However, upon a careful reading of the entire section it is clear that the first question to be answered is that posed by clause (b) \u2014 whether the lessee may obtain the property for no additional consideration or for a nominal consideration. If so, the lease is intended for security. If not, it is then necessary to determine \u201cby the facts of each case\u201d whether the lease is intended as security and, in making that determination, the fact that the lease contains an option to purchase \u201cdoes not [of itself] make the lease one intended for security.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-4\">The cases construing the above section have uniformly held that if the lessee, upon compliance with the lease, has the option to purchase the property for no additional consideration, or for a nominal consideration, the lease is a security interest as a matter of law. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\"><em>Peco, Inc. v. Hartbauer Tool &amp; Die Co., </em>262 Or. 573, 500 P.2d 708, 709-10 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">Shepherd argues that subsection (b) of \u00a7 1201(37) should not be so interpreted, and that in <em>every </em>case whether a lease is intended as a security device must be determined by considering <em>all </em>of the salient facts. A very few courts have adopted this approach. <em>See, e. g., In re Cedar Valley Bandag, Inc., </em>29 U.C.C.Rep. 984 (N.D.Ga.1980) (Bankruptcy Judge); <em>In re Samoset Associates, </em>24 U.C.C.Rep. 510 (D.Minn.1978) (Bankruptcy Judge); <em>Computer Sciences Corp. v. Sci-Tek, Inc., </em>21 U.C.C.Rep. 859 (Del.Super.Ct. 1976).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">We are not convinced by Shepherd\u2019s argument. Section 1201(37) makes it clear that the question whether a lease was \u201cintended as security\u201d is determined by reference to the intention of the parties at the time the transaction was consummated. In general, this intention is to be inferred from the facts of each case. In subsections (a) and (b), however, two plain rules of construction are set out. While a purchase option does not in itself make a lease one intended for security (\u00a7 1201(37)(a)), a purchase option exercisable for no or nominal additional consideration \u201cdoes make\u201d the lease one intended for security (\u00a7 1201(37)(b)). We conclude from this that subsection (b) provides an exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>general rule, whereby one fact in a given case takes on determinative significance. Thus, if a lease contains an option to purchase \u201cfor no additional consideration or for nominal consideration,\u201d it is conclusively presumed to be \u201cintended as security,\u201d without reference to other facts from which the opposite inference might be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">The written option granted to Thompson permitted it to purchase the compactors and bulldozers for little additional consideration. In fact, the add-on charge is really no more than a carrying or finance charge. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 1201(37) is clearly applicable, and the lower courts were correct in ruling, as a matter of law, that the equipment leases here in question were agreements intended for security. The fact that Thompson subsequently defaulted on the leases, thereby rendering the option subject to cancellation by Shepherd, is irrelevant. Whether a lease agreement is a true lease or one intended for security is determined by the intent of the parties at the time of execution of the agreement. To base such a determination on subsequent events, such as default of the lessee, is to permit, in the words of the district court of Maine, \u201cchameleon\u201d leases. <em>In re Vaillancourt, </em>7 U.C.C.Rep. 748, 763 (D.Maine 1979) (Bankruptcy Referee).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">\n<em>Perfection of the Security Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">In order to prevail against the receiver in the instant action, Shepherd must have perfected its security interest in the compactors and bulldozers prior to Thompson\u2019s Chapter XI filing. <em>See </em>Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 9301. Shepherd maintains that it did so both by filing, Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9401 <em>et seq., </em>and by taking possession of the equipment, Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 9305. The question of perfection in this case, however, cannot be resolved merely by examining Shepherd\u2019s actions in light of Calif.Comm. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9401 <em>et seq. </em>and 9305. The compactors and bulldozers in question are \u201cgoods of a type which are normally used in more than one jurisdiction.\u201d Calif.Comm. Code \u00a7 9103, as in effect on January 24, 1974. Thus, the initial question with respect to perfection in this case concerns the choice of law provisions of \u00a7 9103, which specify that California law is to govern the validity and perfection of a security interest if the debtor\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d is in California and that \u201c[ojtherwise, the law ... of the jurisdiction where such chief place of business is located shall govern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"awe-dedup-0\">The parties vigorously disagree as to the location of Thompson\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d during the relevant time period. The receiver maintains that it was in Hawaii. Shepherd insists that it was in California. The parties do agree, however, that if Thompson\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d was in California, Shepherd properly perfected its security interest in the equipment by filing, Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9401 <em>et seq., </em>and the issue of perfection by possession need not be reached. Likewise, the parties agree that if Thompson\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d was in Hawaii, Shepherd did not perfect its security interest by filing and the issue of perfection by possession becomes crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">The bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on the issue and, based on the following \u201cfindings of fact,\u201d concluded that during the relevant period of time Thompson\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d was in Hawaii:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-10\">(15) During the year 1973, the Debtor was engaged in the construction business and in construction projects in the States of Hawaii and California and maintained offices in each of those states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-11\">(16) During the year 1973, the Debtor\u2019s President, Richard Depweg, and two of its Vice-Presidents, Tom Frandsen and Brian Cook, were all located in, and operated out of, the Debtor\u2019s Hawaii office and were responsible for the Debtor\u2019s Hawaii construction projects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-12\">(17) During the year 1973, one of the Debtor\u2019s Vice-Presidents, Robert Powers, was located in and operated out of the Debtor\u2019s Los Angeles office and had responsibility for its California construction projects. Mr. Powers had no responsibilities in connection with the Debtor\u2019s Hawaii operations. Leone Senecal, the Debtor\u2019s Controller, was also located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>the Los Angeles office. Ms. Senecal had no responsibilities in connection with the Debtor\u2019s Hawaii operations, other than the consolidation of financial information which was prepared by the accounting staff of the Hawaii office regarding the Debtor\u2019s Hawaii operations, and forwarded to her, with information which the Los Angeles office prepared regarding the California operation and the preparation of consolidated payroll reports and tax returns for the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-4\">(18) During the year 1973, John Thompson, the Chairman of the Debtor\u2019s Board of Directors, spent in excess of 50% of the time which he devoted to the Debt- or\u2019s business affairs in the State of Hawaii and at the Debtor\u2019s Hawaii office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-5\">(19) During the years 1972 and 1973, the Debtor derived approximately two-thirds of its gross revenues from its operations in the State of Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-6\">(20) At all times during the year 1973, and, more particularly, at the time that the Agreements described in Paragraph 1 of these Findings were executed and entered into, the main part of the Debtor\u2019s business operations was located in the State of Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-7\">(21) During the year 1973, that portion of the Debtor\u2019s business operations which was conducted in Hawaii was managed and run by and from the Hawaii office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-8\">(22) During the year 1973, the majority of the Debtor\u2019s creditors were located in the State of Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-9\">(23) During the year 1973, the Debtor\u2019s Hawaii office handled negotiations with suppliers and vendors who supplied goods and services in connection with Hawaii construction projects. The Debtor\u2019s Hawaii office alone received invoices from creditors who supplied goods and services in connection with Hawaii construction projects, and that office was exclusively responsible for paying those creditors. Inquiries and invoices from creditors in Hawaii were received by the Hawaii office, and not by the Los Angeles office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-10\">(24) The Hawaii office maintained its own, separate accounting staff, which was responsible for maintaining the books and records of the company\u2019s Hawaii operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-12\">(25) During the year 1973, Richard Depweg, the President of the Debtor, was responsible for overall supervision of the company\u2019s operations. John Thompson did not participate in the majority of the operating decisions regarding the company and did not insist on taking part in the majority of those decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">Record on Appeal, pp. 32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">The district court reversed the bankruptcy court on the ground that the lower court had erred in not giving sufficient consideration to other relevant facts, such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-15\">(39) J. A. THOMPSON AND SON, INC. was at all times a California corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-16\">(40) At all times during its existence, J. A. THOMPSON AND SON, INC. maintained offices on Hindry Avenue in Los Angeles, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-17\">(41) Until the early 1970\u2019s, the Debtor [sic] gross receipts from California operations exceeded its gross receipts from its operations in Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-18\">(42) During 1972 and 1973, the Debtor held all of its Board of Directors meetings at either its Hindry Avenue offices or at the offices of its attorneys in Los Angeles, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-19\">(43) The Debtor\u2019s 1972 and 1973 Federal Income Tax returns were prepared by its accountants in Los Angeles, California and filed from Los Angeles, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-20\">(44) During 1972 and 1973, the Debt- or\u2019s payroll records were consolidated in Los Angeles, California and its payroll taxes were paid from Los Angeles, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-21\">(45) On May 22,1972, the Debtor designated its Hindry Avenue, Los Angeles, California address as its Chief Place of Business on a Financing Statement given to Shepherd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-22\">(46) During 1972 and 1973, the Debtor designated its Hindry Avenue address on twenty-one (21) other Financing Statements filed by creditors as its chief place of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>(47) During 1972, the Debtor realized $8,472,397.00 in sales from its California operations. During 1973, the Debtor realized $10,123,368.00 in sales from its California operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-5\">(48) During 1972 and 1973, the company\u2019s audited financial statements were prepared by its Los Angeles, California accounting firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-6\">(49) In the Statement of Affairs filed by the Debtor in these proceedings on May 23, 1974, it stated its address as 8330 Hindry Avenue, Los Angeles, California.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Record on Appeal, pp. 54-55.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court also considered it highly relevant that Thompson had refused to supply Dun &amp; Bradstreet with current credit information and that Dun &amp; Bradstreet listed Thompson\u2019s Los Angeles office as its headquarters and its Hawaiian office as a branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">Essentially, the two lower courts disagreed as to the nature of the inquiry required by \u00a7 9103(2). The bankruptcy court perceived the \u201cchief place of business\u201d inquiry as focusing first on business volume and second on the expectations of those creditors dealing with the operation or division producing the greatest business volume. On the other hand, the district court construed \u00a7 9103(2) as requiring an inquiry into the principal place of management of a debtor\u2019s entire multi-state operation and into the reasonable expectations of all creditors in light of available credit information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">There are surprisingly few cases interpreting \u00a7 9103(2). <em>See, e. g., In re Dobbins, </em>371 F.Supp. 141, 14 U.C.C.Rep. 796 (D.Kan. 1973); <em>In re Brown, </em>5 U.C.C.Rep. 401 (W.D. Mich.1968); <em>Associates Financial Services Co., Inc. v. First National Bank, </em>82 Mich. App. 495, 266 N.W.2d 490, 24 U.C.C.Rep. 420 (Mich.App.1978); <em>Moody Day Co. v. Westview National Bank, Waco, </em>7 U.C.C. Rep. 425 (Tex.Crt.App.1970). None is particularly instructive. <em>Associates Financial Services Co., Inc. v. First National Bank, supra, </em>suggests that business volume is highly relevant to the \u201cchief place of business\u201d inquiry. <em>In accord, Tatelbaum v. Commerce Investment Co., </em>7 U.C.C.Rep. 406 (Md.App.1970). On the other hand, <em>Moody Day Co. v. Westview National Bank, Waco, supra, </em>suggests that business volume is not of critical importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">The only real guidance to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 9103(2) appears in the Official Comment following the section and in the notes of the Review Committee and the Official Comment accompanying \u00a7 9103 as revised in 1972 (\u201crevised \u00a7 9103\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Official Comment following \u00a7 9103(2) provided in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-13\">\u201cChief place of business\u201d does not mean the place of incorporation; it means the place, from which in fact the debtor manages the main part of his business operations. That is the place where persons dealing with the debtor would normally look for credit information, and is appropriate for filing. The term \u201cchief place of business\u201d is not defined in this Section or elsewhere in this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">Clearly the drafters of \u00a7 9103(2) contemplated a two-fold inquiry focusing first on the \u201cplace from which . . . the debtor manages the main part of his business operations,\u201d and second, on the reasonable expectations of creditors. With respect to the debtor\u2019s \u201cplace of management\u201d the comment is somewhat confusing. On the one hand the comment could be read as referring to the location of the central or executive management of the debtor\u2019s multi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>state operation. On the other hand, the comment could easily be read as referring to the place from which the single largest plant or project of a multi-state operation is managed on a daily basis. If the latter location is intended, then business volume generated by any given plant or project is crucial to the \u201cchief place of business\u201d inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The subsequent revision of \u00a7 9103 greatly assists in clearing up this confusion over the proper interpretation of \u201cplace of management.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Revised \u00a7 9103 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-5\">(d) A debtor shall be deemed located at his place of business if he has one, at his <em>chief executive office </em>if he has more than one place of business, otherwise at his residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">(emphasis added). Thus, the inquiry with respect to \u201cplace of management\u201d focuses on the location which serves as executive headquarters for the debtor\u2019s multi-state operation, and not on the location which generates the largest business volume. <em>See </em>Preliminary Draft No. 2 at 38, Review Committee for Article 9 of the U.C.C. (1979).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is unquestionably a sound approach to the \u201cplace of business\u201d inquiry and an approach which fosters a certain degree of stability in the debtor-creditor relationship, as the location of the chief executive offices of a multi-state enterprise is far less likely to change than the relative business volume generated by its various plants or operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the district court, rather than the bankruptcy court, correctly construed \u00a7 9103(2). Specifically, the bankruptcy court erred in making the business volume of Thompson\u2019s Hawaiian operation its initial and paramount concern. No doubt business volume will be a relevant consideration in those cases wherein chief executive offices cannot readily be identified. Even in such cases, however, other factors must be considered, such as the location of Board of Directors\u2019 meetings, management offices, payroll and other business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">The bankruptcy court also erred in considering only the expectations of Hawaiian creditors in determining the place \u201cwhere persons dealing with the debtor would normally look for credit information.\u201d Official Comment to Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 9103(2). The Official Comment does not suggest that courts may consider only the expectations of creditors dealing with the plant or operation that happens to be generating the greatest business volume for the debtor at that time. The Comment refers without limitation to \u201cpersons dealing with the debtor.\u201d Thus, in determining where creditors \u201cnormally look for credit information,\u201d courts should consider the reasonable expectations of a representative number of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">While the reasonable expectation of creditors is an important consideration when determining the location of a debtor\u2019s \u201cchief place of business,\u201d it is by no means determinative. Section 9103 does not establish any sort of estoppel principle. A creditor is not entitled to prevail on the \u201cchief place of business\u201d issue merely because he relied upon representations of the debtor as to the latter\u2019s \u201cchief place of business.\u201d It has long been the rule that creditors have a duty to acquaint themselves with the facts necessary to enable them to file in accordance with the commercial codes. <em>See In re P. S. Products Corp., </em>7 U.C.C.Rep. 411 (E.D. N.Y.1970), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. P. S. Products Corp v. Equilease Corporation, </em>435 F.2d 781 (2d Cir. 1970); <em>In re Flynn, </em>6 U.C.C.Rep. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>1119 (E.D.Mich.1969), <em>citing In re Golden Kernal, Inc., </em>5 U.C.C.Rep. 43 (E.D.Pa.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">Since the bankruptcy court erroneously construed \u00a7 9103(2), the district court properly reversed its determination that Thompson\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d was Hawaii. Whether it was proper for the district court to examine the facts independently is another question. Aoki contends that the district court erred in not applying the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review, <em>see </em>Bankruptcy Rule 810, to the \u201cchief place of business\u201d issue. We disagree. The determination of Thompson\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d was, in this case, an issue of law. Where, as here, the underlying facts are not disputed, the issue is only what legal conclusion should be drawn from them. It is well-established that neither Bankruptcy Rule 810 nor FRCivP 52(a) preclude a reviewing court from independently examining a bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>In re Visiting Home Services, Inc., </em>643 F.2d 1356, 1358-59 (9th Cir. 1981) (under old bankruptcy rules); <em>In re Howell, </em>638 F.2d 81, 82 (9th Cir. 1980). The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review is applied where a trial court resolves disputed issues of fact by reference to the credibility of conflicting evidence. It has no application where the trial judge applies a legal standard to undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Upon review of the record before it, this court is of the opinion that the district court correctly concluded that during the time in question Thompson\u2019s \u201cchief place of business\u201d was located in California. This being so, \u00a7 9103(2) dictates that the law of California govern the perfection of Shepherd\u2019s security interest in the compactors and bulldozers. As the parties acknowledge, California Commercial Code \u00a7\u00a7 9401 <em>et seq. </em>permit perfection by way of a previously filed financing statement covering after acquired property, such as that filed by Shepherd with the Secretary of State of California in 1972. Shepherd thereby perfected its security interest in the heavy equipment prior to the time of Thompson\u2019s Chapter XI filing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">The judgment of the district court in favor of Shepherd is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">.

Otherwise, the law (including the conflict of laws rules) of the jurisdiction where such chief place of business is located shall govern.

For the purpose of determining the validity and perfection of a security interest in an airplane, the chief place of business of a debtor who is a foreign air carrier under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the designated office of the agent upon whom service of process may be made on behalf of the debtor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">.

The theory which apparently underlies the decisions in these cases and which serves as the basis for Shepherd\u2019s argument was articulated by Peter F. Coogan in <em>Leases of Equipment and Some Other Unconventional Security Devices: An Analysis of UCC Section 1-201(37) and Article 9, </em>5 Duke Law Journal 909 (1973). Coogan maintains that the Uniform Commercial Code must be interpreted in light of pre-code law, specifically the Uniform Conditional Sales Act (\u201cUCSA\u201d). Since the UCSA required that the purchaser be obligated to pay an amount substantially equal to the purchase price of the property before a transaction could be deemed a conditional sale, Coogan contends that before a lease can be subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the lessee must be obligated to pay in rent an amount substantially equivalent to the designated purchase price of the property. When a lessee has the right to terminate a lease before making such an equivalent payment, as does Thompson in the instant case, he has not really assumed an obligation that would satisfy the requirements of the UCSA. Thus, Coogan argues, a right to terminate by the lessee before an amount equivalent to the purchase price is paid should, for purposes of determining whether a lease is intended for security, outweigh the impact of an option to purchase for nominal consideration, leaving the agreement a \u201ctrue\u201d lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">Although Coogan\u2019s theory has some historical appeal, we remain unpersuaded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">. These facts were not included by the bankruptcy court in its formal findings of fact and conclusions of law. Rather, they appeared initially in Shepherd\u2019s request to the bankruptcy court that it amend its findings to include such facts. The bankruptcy court declined to amend its findings, apparently on the ground that additional findings were not necessary to support its ruling. It is unusual to say the least that reviewing courts are presented with \u201cfacts\u201d in addition to those set forth in the findings of the lower court. In the instant case these facts are crucial, see discussion <em>infra </em>at 950. Furthermore, they are undisputed. It was therefore not reversible error for the district court to consider them in resolving the issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">. Although \u00a7 9103 of the Uniform Commercial Code was formally revised in 1972, the revision did not become effective in California until 1976. <em>See </em>Calif.Comm.Code \u00a7 11101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">. The receiver objects to any consideration of revised \u00a7 9103 on the ground that it was not the law in effect on the relevant date of January 24, 1974.
