Davis filed an action in the district court to review the refusal of the Secretary of Health and Human Services <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to reopen Davis\u2019 application for disability benefits which the Secretary denied. Davis also sought review of the Secretary\u2019s denial of a later application on grounds of administrative res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-21\">The district court adopted the recommendation of the Magistrate and dismissed the action on both claims. Davis appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-22\">Davis is a married woman and has three children. She has a high school education; she worked as a bank teller and secretary before 1968. She last met the special earnings requirement for entitlement to disability benefits on December 31, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-23\">Davis first filed for disability benefits on November 6, 1973. She had surgery in 1960 and again in 1973 for spinal pain. Her application was denied because she had failed to prove that she was disabled in 1968, when her eligibility for disability benefits expired. She was told that she could seek reconsideration within six months. When she did not ask for reconsideration or a hearing, the decision denying her application became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-24\">In 1977, Davis filed a second application for disability benefits. This claim was denied initially and upon reconsideration Davis requested a hearing. The administrative law judge (AU) treated her 1977 application as a petition to reopen under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.957 and \u00a7 404.958 (1978)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>ALJ dismissed her request for hearing under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.937 (1978)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the grounds of administrative res judicata. Davis submitted medical reports which indicated that her recurrent back pain did not appear to be affected by conservative treat-, ment and noted the possibility of a third surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">In <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977), the Supreme Court rejected a claimant\u2019s argument that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1976)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (1976)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> confer jurisdiction on federal courts to review the Secretary\u2019s decision not to reopen a previously adjudicated claim for social security benefits. Once a decision becomes administratively final, the Secretary\u2019s decision to reopen a claim is purely discretionary. These discretionary decisions are not \u201cfinal\u201d decisions within the meaning of \u00a7 405(g) because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5c\">an interpretation that would allow a claimant judicial review simply by filing \u2014 and being denied \u2014 a petition to reopen his claim would frustrate the congressional purpose ... to impose a 60 day limitation upon judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision on the initial claim for benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax4\">The presiding officer may, on his own motion, dismiss a hearing request, either entirely or as to any stated issue, under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-13\">(a) Res Judicata. Where there has been a previous determination or decision by the Secretary with respect to the rights of the same party on the same facts pertinent to the same issue or issues which has become final either by judicial affirmance or without judicial consideration, upon the claimant\u2019s failure to timely request reconsideration, hearing, or review, or to commence a civil action with respect to such determination or decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\"><em>Sanders, </em>430 U.S. at 108, 97 S.Ct. at 986, 51 L.Ed.2d at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">In a case procedurally identical to this case, the First Circuit affirmed the district court stating \u201c[a] pur\u00e9ly discretionary hearing such as that held here for purposes of receiving allegedly new and material evidence is not a \u2018hearing\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 405(g).\u201d <em>Rios v. Secretary of HEW, </em>614 F.2d 25, 26 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">Other circuits have extended the reasoning of <em>Sanders </em>to preclude review of a dismissal on the basis of a denial of a motion to reopen. Such refusals to reopen and determinations that a claim is res judicata are not reviewable. <em>See Hensley v. Califa-no, </em>601 F.2d 216 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Carney v. Califano, </em>598 F.2d 472 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>Ma-tos v. Secretary of HEW, </em>581 F.2d 282 (1st Cir. 1978). <em>Cf. Peterson v. Califano, </em>631 F.2d 628 (9th Cir. 1980) (refusing to review order denying extension of filing period for appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">Davis asserts the failure of the ALJ to consider new evidence brings her claim within the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>administrative res judicata. <em>See Grose v. Cohen, </em>406 F.2d 823 (4th Cir. 1969). There is no merit in this contention. The only new evidence presented was one 1978 medical report which indicated that Davis might have been disabled ten years before but this observation was not supported by any clinical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Equally without merit is Davis\u2019 contention that her claim falls within the constitutional question exception to administrative res judicata. <em>See Sanders, </em>430 U.S. at 109, 97 S.Ct. at 986, 51 L.Ed.2d at 201-02. Her constitutional allegation was purely conclusory, unsupported by facts, and is insufficient to withstand summary judgment. <em>Guadalupe Organization Inc. v. Tempe Elementary School Dist., </em>587 F.2d 1022 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">In <em>Matos v. Secretary of HEW, </em>581 F.2d at 286, the court held, \u201cIn light of the rationale in <em>Sanders </em>we hold that this Court is without jurisdiction to examine appellant\u2019s claim which was denied as. res judica-ta.\u201d That holding is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-25\">.
