LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b752-22\">The appellant, John R. Adamson, III, and three others were indicted under 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 656 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, 1005<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, 1014<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, and 2<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (West 1976) in connection with several loans made by the First Augusta Bank and Trust Company. After a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of one count of willful misapplication of bank funds in violation of \u00a7 656, one count of making a false entry in the books, reports, and statements of the bank in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1005 and 2, and three counts of knowingly making false statements to the bank for the purpose of influencing loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>applications in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1014 and 2. The appellant was acquitted on one count each of willful misapplication under \u00a7 656 and of false entries under \u00a7 1005. Adam-son appeals to this court seeking.review of the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the admissibility of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">I. FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">During the times covered by the indictment, the appellant Adamson was the president and a director of the First Augusta Bank and Trust Company; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he also served as a lending officer and was a member of the bank\u2019s Loan and Investment Committee. While serving in these capacities, the appellant participated in the processing and approval of four substantial loans that formed the basis of the indictment. The first of these loans ostensibly was made to Island Summit, Inc., although the actual beneficiaries of this loan were co-defendants R. Eugene Holley and Glenn B. Hester.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The bank was to look to these beneficiaries for repayment of this loan. The appellant was convicted of willfully misapplying funds (\u00a7 656) and making false entries in the bank\u2019s books and records (\u00a7 1005) in connection with this loan. The second loan was made in the name of Augusta Summit, Inc., but the proceeds went to and repayment was expected from Holley. The named borrower in the third loan was Fairway Finance Co., yet again Holley received the loan proceeds and was responsible for repaying the loan. Similarly, the fourth loan was made to Poplar Finance Co., with Holley again being the actual beneficiary and source of repayment. The appellant was convicted of knowingly making a false statement to the bank (\u00a7 1014) in connection with these last three loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The government introduced evidence that the named borrowers were inactive corporations and that these corporations were not financially capable of repaying the loans. There was further testimony at trial that the making of these loans directly to Holley would have violated the bank\u2019s legal aggregate lending and unsecured loan limits. Making these loans directly to Holley through these corporations also violated the state law lending limitations, but structuring the loans in this fashion made detection of these violations difficult and tended to deceive the bank and the bank examiners about the true state of affairs. Thus, under the government\u2019s theory of the case, the appellant Adamson authorized a series of sham loans to nominal corporate borrowers to conceal an illegal and potentially unsafe concentration of bank loans to a single debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">II. THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS: SECTION 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">The appellant\u2019s primary focus on appeal has been the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury. The appellant contends that the court erred in defining for the jury the requisite mental state the accused must have to commit willful misapplication of bank funds under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 656 (West 1976). In particular, the appellant objects to the charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-13\">A reckless disregard of the interest of the bank is the equivalent of the intent to injure or defraud the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-14\">I charge you that the element of criminal intent necessary for conviction for a willful misapplication of bank funds is not fulfilled by a mere showing of indiscretion or foolhardiness on the part of the bank officer. His conduct must amount to reckless disregard of the bank\u2019s interests . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The word \u201cwillful\u201d is also employed to characterize a thing done without ground for believing it is lawful, or conduct marked by a reckless disregard, whether or not one has the right to so act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The appellant argues that \u00a7 656 is a \u201cspecific intent\u201d crime (or, alternatively, at least a \u201cgeneral intent\u201d crime) and to violate \u00a7 656 one must have the purpose (/. e., \u201cspecific intent\u201d), or at least knowledge (/. e., \u201cgeneral intent\u201d), of defrauding or injuring the bank. The district court\u2019s charge, the appellant argues, impermissibly lowered the government\u2019s burden of proof by equating the lesser mental state of \u201crecklessness\u201d with the required higher <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201cknowledge.\u201d The appellant contends that such a reduction in the government\u2019s burden of proof violates due process and jury trial rights and contravenes the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In <em>Sandstrom </em>the Court reversed a conviction for \u201cpurposefully or knowingly\u201d causing the death of another because the jury had been charged that \u201cthe law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\u201d The Court held that this instruction unconstitutionally created the possibility that a material issue <em>(i. e., </em>the accused\u2019s mental state) would be removed from the jury\u2019s consideration and that the prosecution would be relieved of having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a material element of the crime.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Here, as in <em>Sandstrom, </em>the challenge is that the instruction reduced the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving the requisite state of mind for the offense. In <em>Sandstrom, </em>the statutory <em>mens rea </em>the government was required to prove was not in dispute. Yet, in assessing whether a jury instruction improperly lowers the government\u2019s burden of proof, a threshold inquiry must be to determine the government\u2019s burden of <em>proof </em>\u2014 i. e., when an instruction concerning the accused\u2019s state of mind is the issue, what is the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for the crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Section 656 of Title 18 of the United States Code prescribes punishment for any bank official who \u201cwillfully misapplies\u201d bank funds, but the statute does not define \u201cwillfully.\u201d The courts have uniformly construed .the statute to include the \u201cintent to injure or defraud the bank\u201d as a material element of the crime. <em>E. g., United States </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>609 F.2d 816, 819 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Mann, </em>517 F.2d 259, 267 and n. 3 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1087, 96 S.Ct. 878, 47 L.Ed.2d 97 (1976); <em>Seals v. United States, </em>221 F.2d 243, 245 (8th Cir. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">The terms \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cintent,\u201d unfortunately, have a statutory and common law history that is less than unequivocal. In its various usages, \u201cintent\u201d may denote the mental state that the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code designates as \u201cpurpose,\u201d or the mental state that the Model Penal Code designates as \u201cknowledge,\u201d or a general notion of <em>mens rea, </em>or the particular <em>mens rea </em>required for a particular crime. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 403, 100 S.Ct. 624, 630, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980); W. LaFave and A. Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law, </em>195-203 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>(1972). Similarly, the term \u201cwillfully\u201d as employed in diverse statutes may correspond to any of the different levels of the Model Penal Code\u2019s hierarchy of culpable states of mind (i. e., purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence). <em>See </em>W. LaFave and A. Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 192-94, 212-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The appellant contends that \u00a7 656, the willful misapplication statute, requires as the necessary mental state that the accused have, in Model Penal Code terms, the <em>purpose </em>to defraud or injure the bank or, at the very least, the <em>knowledge </em>that his conduct will tend to produce this result.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Brief of Appellant at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The appellant\u2019s position on the state of mind requirement under \u00a7 656 is not without some support. The statutory predecessor to \u00a7 656, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 592 (Rev.Stat. \u00a7 5209), had been construed to import a <em>mens rea </em>requirement roughly equivalent to purpose or knowledge (and more than mere recklessness).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There are grounds for believing that the state of mind requirement under the old statute was meant to be applied to \u00a7 656. The Reviser\u2019s Note to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 656 asserts: \u201cThe original section, containing more than 500 words, was verbose, defuse, redundant, and complicated. .. . The revised section <em>without changing in any way the meaning or substance of existing law, </em>clarifies, condenses, and combines related provisions largely rewritten in manners of style.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The decisions of other circuits on the state of mind requirement under \u00a7 656 also tend to support the appellant\u2019s position, and are in accord with the case law under the previous statute. No other circuit has approved a jury instruction equating \u201crecklessness\u201d with \u201cintent to injure or defraud.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The circuits generally construe the misapplication provision of \u00a7 656 to require a mental state of either knowledge <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or purpose <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of defrauding or injuring the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Nevertheless, a careful examination of Fifth Circuit precedent, in particular <em>United States v. Welliver, </em>601 F.2d 203 (5th Cir. 1979), leads us to the conclusion that we are bound to reject the appellant\u2019s claim. The defendant in <em>Welliver </em>was a bank president who authorized on behalf of certain third parties the transfer of bank funds from one account to another, which in effect, by virtue of certain bank accounting procedures, made \u201cloans\u201d to these third parties. Although these \u201cloans\u201d were ultimately repaid with full market rate interest, the defendant was convicted of willful misapplication for allowing bank funds to be paid out without a written obligation for repayment. The defendant was also convicted of making false entries in the bank books in violation of \u00a7 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The defendant in <em>Welliver </em>objected to a jury instruction that is virtually identical to the pertinent part of the charge at issue <em>here </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the definition that \u201c[a] reckless disregard of the interest of the bank is the equivalent of intent to injure or defraud the bank.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court held that a recklessness instruction inadequately charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the requisite mental state for the \u00a7 1005 false entry offense, citing, <em>inter alia, Sand-strom v. Montana. United States v. Weiliver, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 210 and n. 14. For willful misapplication under \u00a7 656, however, the court upheld the charge. Acknowledging that the \u201cintent to injure or defraud\u201d is an essential element of both \u00a7\u00a7 1005 and 656, the court observed that for the former section this element is included in the statutory language while for the latter this element is judicially imposed. The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">As pertains to \u00a7 656, this court has held that \u201c \u2018reckless disregard of the interest of a bank is, for the purpose of \u201cwillful misapplication,\u201d the equivalent of intent to injure or defraud.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>573 F.2d 242, 244-45 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>quoting United States v. Wilson, </em>500 F.2d 715, 720 (5th Cir. 1974). Consequently, the trial judge\u2019s instruction was correct as to \u00a7 656.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\"><em>Id. Weiliver </em>thus has interpreted the \u201cintent to injure or defraud\u201d element of willful misapplication to import a <em>mens rea </em>of merely recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Appellant would have us construe <em>Weiliver </em>as holding that the requisite mental state under \u00a7 656 is knowledge or purpose and that such a mental state is adequately charged, for \u00a7 656 purposes but not for \u00a7 1005, by equating it to reckless disregard of the bank\u2019s interests. Appellant, of course, then argues that the jury instructions so sanctioned by <em>Weiliver </em>are unconstitutional, under <em>Sandstrom. </em>We decline to follow appellant\u2019s reasoning. Such a construction of <em>Weiliver </em>would indeed raise grave constitutional problems under <em>Sand-strom; </em><footnotemark>16</footnotemark> such a construction would require that we assume that Weiliver's holding with respect to \u00a7 656 is patently inconsistent with its holding with respect to \u00a7 1005. Under the appellant\u2019s view, <em>Weiliver, </em>while requiring a <em>mens rea </em>of more than recklessness for both statutes, on one hand would recognize the <em>Sandstrom </em>problems of equating recklessness with the higher degree of culpability required under \u00a7 1005, but on the other hand would approve of this same equivalence for \u00a7 656. We should hesitate to construe a decision by a panel of this court so as to render it constitutionally suspect and internally inconsistent. We interpret <em>Weiliver </em>to require a different state of mind, and hence different jury instructions, for \u00a7\u00a7 656 and 1005.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">The appellant argues that it was not logical to construe these related statutes <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as requiring a different <em>mens rea </em>standard. Appellant urges that \u201c[tjhis double standard is not logical and must not continue.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Reply Brief of Appellant at 3. This argument is best addressed to the court of appeals sitting <em>en banc; </em>as a panel of this court we lack the power to overrule a decision by a prior panel. <em>In re: Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, </em>647 F.2d 460, 461 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Ford </em>v. <em>United States, </em>618 F.2d 357 (5th Cir. 1980). A prior panel of this court has confronted the issue of whether a recklessness instruction adequately charges the mental state required under \u00a7 656 and has concluded that it does. <em>Welliver </em>binds this court. Other Fifth Circuit opinions that have used language suggestive of a knowledge or purpose <em>mens rea </em>for \u00a7 656 in the course of approving jury instructions, <em>United States v. Southers, </em>583 F.2d 1302, 1306-07 and n. 6 (5th Cir. 1978), affirming evidentiary rulings, <em>United States v. Tidwell, </em>559 F.2d 262, 266 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 942, 98 S.Ct. 1520, 55 L.Ed.2d 538 (1978), and finding the proof sufficient, <em>United States v. Farrell, </em>609 F.2d 816, 820 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Killian, </em>541 F.2d 1156 (5th Cir. 1976), do not vitiate the holding of <em>Welliver. </em>The ruling in each of these cases is consistent with holding that \u00a7 656 takes a <em>mens rea </em>of recklessness. Since each of these decisions rejected a contention raised by the defendant, the use of language suggesting a <em>mens rea </em>of purpose or knowledge only implies that the defendant was not entitled to prevail even if given the benefit of a more favorable mental state requirement than that to which the defendant was otherwise entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">We acknowledge a considerable unease with our holding that \u00a7 656 imposes only a <em>mens rea </em>standard of recklessness. Several factors contribute to our difficulty with this holding: the inconsistent <em>mens rea </em>requirement of the related statute \u00a7 1005, the clear holding of cases construing the predecessor to \u00a7 656 as requiring purpose and the legislative history suggesting that \u00a7 656 was not intended to change the substance of the law, the uniform holdings of the other circuits construing \u00a7 656 to require either purpose or knowledge, and the strong dictum to the same effect in Fifth Circuit cases. However, we are bound by the holding of <em>Welliver,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and such arguments can be entertained only by this court sitting en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">This conclusion would seem to dispose of two of the appellant\u2019s other objections to the jury instructions. The appellant claims that the district court erred in charging that \u201c[t]he requirement that the defendant intend to injure or defraud the bank may be shown by an unlawful act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>voluntarily done, the natural tendency of which may have been to injure the bank.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 32; Record on Appeal, Vol. VIII at 21. The appellant argues that this charge implies a <em>mens rea </em>for \u00a7 656 of only recklessness (Brief of Appellant at 14, 33-34), but assuming arguendo that this is true, <em>Welliver </em>sanctions charging such a mental state. Yet, even if the willful misapplication statute required a <em>mens rea </em>higher than recklessness, the district court did not err in giving this instruction. The phrase \u201cmay be shown by\u201d merely <em>permits, </em>and does not direct, the jury to draw an inference of the requisite <em>mens rea </em>from certain facts. Instructing the jury about such a permissive inference does not create any problems under <em>Sandstrom, </em>as the jury remains free to accept or reject the inference. <em>See </em>442 U.S. at 514 \u2014 15, 99 S.Ct. at 2454-55. The instruction removes no issue from the jury\u2019s consideration, nor does it relieve the government of the burden of proving every material element of the crime. Indeed, where a state of mind is an element of an offense, it is almost invariably proven by inferences from the facts and circumstances. A similar instruction has been sustained by this court in <em>United States v. Southers, </em>583 F.2d 1302, 1308 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On similar footing is the appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in failing to charge the jury that the defendant in this case could not be guilty of willfully misapplying bank funds unless he knew that the named borrowers lacked the ability or intent to repay the loans. The appellant did not object at trial to this omission, and thus our standard of review is plain error. <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>641 F.2d 330, 335 and n. 3 (5th Cir. 1981). Although the law in other circuits might entitle the appellant to such an instruction, <em>United States v. Gallagher, </em>576 F.2d 1028, 1046 (3rd Cir. 1978), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>444 U.S. 1040, 100 S.Ct. 713, 62 L.Ed.2d 674 (1980); <em>United States v. Gens, </em>493 F.2d 216, 221-22 (1st Cir. 1974), <em>Welliveds </em>holding on the mental state requirement of \u00a7 656 might render such an instruction inaccurate and inappropriate in this circuit. We need not, however, decide this point. The trial court gave an instruction<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that is equivalent to the charge appellant now seeks and that tracks the language of the cases of other circuits on which appellant relies. Any difference between the instruction given and that which the appellant now requests does not rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS: SECTION 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Appellant also challenges the recklessness instructions with respect to their effect on the jury\u2019s deliberations on the \u00a7 1005 offense. Here appellant\u2019s claim takes on a different posture. This court has held that an instruction on recklessness inadequately charges the mental state necessary to convict under \u00a7 1005 for making false entries into bank books, reports, or statements. <em>United States v. Welliver, </em>601 F.2d 201, 210 and n. 14 (5th Cir. 1979). In <em>Welliver </em>the trial court expressly instructed the jury that reckless disregard of the interests of the bank was the equivalent of the intent to injure or defraud element of \u00a7 1005. <em>Id. </em>at 209, n. 13. In the present case, the learned trial judge separated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>instructions he gave on \u00a7 1005 from those he gave on \u00a7 656. The instructions on recklessness were confined to the portion of the charge concerning the \u00a7 656 offense. The district court, however, did not define \u201cintent to injure or defraud\u201d as that language is used in \u00a7 1005. Nor was the jury cautioned that they should not apply the definition of intent to injure or defraud under \u00a7 656 to the \u00a7 1005 counts. The court did not instruct the jury that a mere finding of recklessness would not in itself suffice to establish the element of intent required for \u00a7 1005. The court\u2019s instructions on the state of mind for \u00a7 656 are far more elaborate and detailed than those for \u00a7 1005, and the court gave its instructions on \u00a7 1005 immediately following those given for \u00a7 656. Under these circumstances, the jury reasonably could have assumed that intent to defraud means the same thing under both statutes, and that they should apply the definitions of intent to defraud offered by the court for the \u00a7 656 counts to the \u00a7 1005 counts. A reasonable possibility exists that the appellant may have been convicted for only recklessly making a false entry in the bank books or records. This would be an impermissible result under <em>Welliver, </em>and the appellant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1005 must accordingly be reversed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">IV. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Appellant also claims that the proof was insufficient to support convictions on the three counts under \u00a7 1014 of knowingly making false statements to the bank for the purpose of influencing the action of the bank on the loan applications. This contention is without merit. The gist of appellant\u2019s argument is that the government failed to prove that the appellant made, or aided and abetted in making, a knowingly false statement. Appellant contends that the loans which form the basis of these counts \u201cwere basically loans for Mr. Holley\u201d and that the documents and other statements presented to the bank make no representations to the contrary.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Brief of Appellant at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing court must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>503 F.2d 831, 837 (5th Cir. 1974). The evidence here amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict. The loan applications and files listed as the named borrowers, respectively, the corporations Augusta Summit, Inc., Fairway Finance Co., and Poplar Finance Co., and not R. Eugene Holley. These documents at best reveal Holley as a guarantor and not the maker of these loans. The named borrowers were inactive corporations, and the loan files were devoid of financial statements, corporate resolutions, and other information from these companies. The proceeds from these loans went directly into the personal account of Holley. In one instance the appellant authorized the deposit of a loan check payable to Poplar Finance Co. directly into Holley\u2019s account notwithstanding the lack of a proper endorsement by the payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The jury heard testimony that Georgia state banking law restricted the loans a single person might obtain from the First Augusta Bank and Trust to a limit of $140,-000 for unsecured loans and $280,000 for total indebtedness. These restrictions applied regardless of whether the loans were made directly or indirectly to the actual borrower. The loans made in this case violated both of these limits. Moreover, bank examiners testified that designating these corporations in the bank\u2019s books and records as the named borrowers tended to conceal the identity of the true debtor and deceived bank examiners and the bank\u2019s Board of Directors. This thwarted discovery of the illegal and potentially unsafe concentration of bank funds loaned to a single debtor. These examiners stated that they consider such entries in bank books and records to be false. Indeed, this court has held that a \u201cfalse statement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1014 includes representing to a bank that a particular party is to be a borrower on a loan when in fact that party is never intended to receive the loan proceeds or have any liability on the loan. <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>589 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1979). The evidence more than sufficiently supported a jury finding that a false statement to the bank had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The record also reveals ample evidence for the conclusion that the appellant knew that false statements were being made to the bank and participated in, or aided and abetted in, the making of these false statements. The appellant constructed the loan files in question and presented them for approval to the Loan and Investment Committee. These files, as previously noted, were strikingly deficient in information on the named borrower. Banking experts testified that when a bank makes substantial loans to new corporate borrowers, such as was the case here, the bank customarily obtains detailed financial information and collateral in the form of corporate stock from the debtor. The bank, through the appellant acting as lending officer, took neither of these precautions for any of these loans. The appellant even ordered a teller to pay the proceeds of one loan check directly into Holley\u2019s personal account despite the absence of an endorsement by the payee. Given the appellant\u2019s position in the bank and the nature of these false statements, the jury justifiably could find that the appellant knew that the loan files he presented to the Loan and Investment Committee contained false statements. The evidence supports the appellant\u2019s convictions on the three \u00a7 1014 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">V. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Lastly, the appellant complains that the district court erred in permitting, over defense objection,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> testimony by the government\u2019s rebuttal witness about a certain cease and desist order. The testimony attacked by appellant is that of Arthur Lee Emerson and concerns, in pertinent part, a certain cease and desist order negotiated on behalf of the bank by co-defendant Hester. The cease and desist order limited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>bank\u2019s lending to $30,000 per week. The appellant\u2019s brief seems to suggest that the testimony was inadmissible as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The evidence at issue here, however, was highly relevant. Co-defendant Hester testified in his own behalf surveying his career, personal history, family and business ties, medical problems, personal philosophy, and civil contributions. By doing so, Hester attempted to attest to his own good character and negate any inference that he had the requisite criminal intent. Such testimony was proper under the Federal Rules of Evidence. By so testifying, however, Hester opened the way for the government to introduce evidence to rebut these claims of good character and lack of intent. See Fed.R.Evid. 404(a)(1) and (b).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We need not decide whether appellant may have been entitled to cautionary instructions limiting the use of this evidence, because appellant did not adequately make such a request to the trial court nor preserve the issue for appeal. Appellant merely joined in a most general and vague objection of his co-defendant, and requested no limiting instructions. Objections and the grounds therefor should be made with particularity. See <em>Wright v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>580 F.2d 809, 810 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Arteaga-Limones, </em>529 F.2d 1183, 1198-99 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 920, 97 S.Ct. 315, 50 L.Ed.2d 286 (1977); <em>Fed.R. Evid. </em>103(a)(1). <em>See also United States v. Benton, </em>637 F.2d 1052, 1057, n. 3 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Moreover, this testimony was not very prejudicial to the appellant. The witness never mentioned the appellant, and the transactions about which he testified do not involve the appellant. Indeed, on cross-examination the witness acknowledged that he did not know the appellant at all. The testimony implicated to a far greater degree co-defendant Fink, who was acquitted, than it did the appellant. Neither the appellant nor any other defendant raised any objection, despite an express invitation by the district court to do so, to the introduction into evidence of the minutes of a board meeting summarizing the discussion about and containing an outline of the cease and desist order. Record on Appeal, Vol. VII at 281-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">In sum, we find that the district court committed no reversible error in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">VI. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">In conclusion, we hold that the district court committed no reversible error in instructing the jury on the <em>mens rea </em>required under \u00a7 656 or on the meaning of \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d We also hold that the evidence sufficiently supports the convictions on the three counts under \u00a7 1014. The appellant has shown no reversible error by the district court in allowing testimony concerning the cease and desist order. We do, however, reverse the appellant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1005 and remand the case to the district court because the jury instructions as a whole may have created the erroneous impression that recklessness was a sufficient <em>mens rea </em>for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-12\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 656 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">Whoever, being an officer, director, agent or employee of ... any Federal Reserve Bank, member bank, national bank or insured bank, ... willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of such bank . . ., shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-14\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1005 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">Whoever makes any false entry in any book, report, or statement of such bank with intent to injure or defraud such bank, or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to deceive any officer of such bank, or the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any agent or examiner appointed to examine the affairs of such bank, or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-16\">Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-23\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1014 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-24\">Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report, . . . for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of . . . any bank the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . . . upon any application, advance, discount, . . . commitment, or loan, or any change or extension of any of the same, . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b752-25\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-26\">(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-27\">(b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">.

The instruction in this case would seem more forcefully than that in <em>Sandstrom </em>to <em>require </em>the jury to find intent once the prescribed facts were proven. The mere <em>possibility </em>that the jury might \u201cinterpret the instruction as automatically directing a finding of intent,\u201d 442 U.S. at 516, 99 S.Ct. at 2455, was at the heart of the objection in <em>Sandstrom. </em>442 U.S. at 515-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2454-56. <em>See U.

In this regard, a distinction must be drawn between cases where the issue on appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence and where it is the correctness of the jury instructions. Where the sufficiency of the evidence is at issue, a finding that the defendant acted recklessly may be enough to sustain a jury verdict because from this finding the jury <em>may infer </em>the requisite mental state of purpose or knowledge. The courts, in this context, have not held that recklessness is the requisite <em>mens rea </em>nor is it a substitute for this <em>mens rea; </em>rather, these decisions treat recklessness as a fact or circumstance from which a <em>jury may infer </em>the requisite element of knowledge or purpose. <em>See e. g., United States v.

One other possible interpretation of <em>Weiliver </em>that would harmonize that decision with the law in the other circuits does not survive careful examination. This interpretation begins with the premise that an offense can have a different state of mind requirement for different elements of the crime. <em>United States v. Bailey </em>444 U.S. 394, 405-06, 100 S.Ct. 624, 632, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980); <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975). The recklessness charge approved in <em>Weiliver </em>might be said to refer only to the ultimate consequences \u2014 whether the acts in question will tend to injure or defraud the bank \u2014 and not to the constituent parts of the offense. Under this analysis, the defendant in <em>Weiliver </em>would have violated the statute if he <em>knew </em>he was in effect arranging a loan without a written obligation for repayment but need only have been <em>reckless </em>with regard to whether such a loan would tend to injure or defraud the bank (i.e., the defendant need not <em>know </em>that the loan would tend to cause such harm). In the present case, under this analysis, to violate \u00a7 656 the defendant would have to <em>know </em>that the named borrower lacked the ability or intent to repay, but the defendant need only be <em>reckless </em>with regard to whether such a loan would tend to injure or defraud the bank. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>576 F.2d 1028, 1046 (3rd Cir. 1978), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>444 U.S. 1040, 100 S.Ct. 713, 62 L.Ed.2d 674 (1980) (Defendant bank official must know that named borrowers lack the ability or intent to repay the loans.)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">The charge approved by <em>Weiliver, </em>however, is not consistent with this analysis; the jury was not instructed on any knowledge requirements under \u00a7 656. The bald equation of reckless disregard of the interests of the bank with intent to injure or defraud the bank would permit, indeed seem to require, the jury to convict if the defendant merely recklessly allowed a loan without proper documentation to occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b757-14\">. See note 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b758-4\">. We note that the appellant in <em>Welliver </em>asserted on appeal several errors in the trial below. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the basis of two of the several challenges: first, finding that the trial judge had improperly interjected himself into the trial in such manner and to such an extent as to deny Welliver a fair trial; and second, finding that the recklessness charge was error with respect to \u00a7 1005. Although not necessary to its narrow decision to reverse, the court proceeded to address and reject the challenge to the recklessness instruction with respect to \u00a7 656. It is common practice for an appellate court to consider and decide issues which are fully presented and litigated and which will likely arise on retrial, even though such decision may not be necessary to support the narrow decision to reverse. <em>See Cross v. Harris, </em>418 F.2d 1095, 1105 n. 64 (D.C.Cir.1969). The practice serves an important interest in judicial economy. In this broader sense, we conclude that the <em>Welliver </em>panel\u2019s decision sustaining the \u00a7 656 recklessness instruction was necessary to the proper disposition of that case. Moreover, we note that had the <em>Welliver </em>panel reached the contrary result on the \u00a7 656 instruction, the decision would have been alternative holding supporting the reversal, and thus binding on subsequent panels. <em>McLellan v. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co., </em>545 F.2d 919, 925 n. 21 (5th Cir. 1977) (en banc). We would find it somewhat anomalous to say that a decision in one direction would be holding but a decision on the same issue and under the same circumstances in the other direction would be dictum. Thus, we conclude that Welliver\u2019s decision of the \u00a7 656 issue was holding, and not dictum, and is binding on this panel. <em>See Florida Central Railroad Co. v. Schutte, </em>103 U.S. 118, 143, 26 L.Ed. 327 (1881) (Although there the ruling of the prior case was an alternative holding, the Court broadly asserted: \u201cIt cannot be said that a case is not authority on one point because, although that point was properly presented and decided in the regular course of the consideration of the cause, something else was found in the end which disposed of the whole matter.\u201d); <em>Cold Metal Process Co. v.

Clayton, </em>643 F.2d 1071, 1074-75 (5th Cir. 1981), holds that this exact instruction is not plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b760-11\">. Appellant has asserted somewhat inconsistent positions in attacking the jury instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence. Appellant has argued with respect to the jury instructions that he was entitled to an instruction that he could not be convicted unless he knew that the named borrower lacked the ability or intent to repay the loans. Yet in contesting the sufficiency of the evidence, appellant takes the position that the loans to various named borrowers were really loans to Holley and that these named borrowers were never expected to receive the proceeds or repay the loans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\">. The record reveals in connection with this testimony only the most general objection raised by co-defendant Hester. Appellant asserts that he joined in this objection. Brief of Appellant at 29. Since the government does not contest this point and the district court at other times during trial stated that he would consider the objection of one defendant to be the objection of all, we will assume that the appellant did seasonably join in co-defendant Hester\u2019s objection. The objections of Hester to this testimony consisted of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">Your Honor, may I object on the grounds that I thought when we talked about this witness, he was going to testify to some statements I made, was the representation made to me. Now, this is again going beyond the scope of what Your Honor\u2019s order is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">And</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-13\">Your Honor, may I object, because I have just recalled to my memory that what the question was that Mr. Moore asked me, he asked me did 1 talk to Mr. Emerson about a $50,000 loan to Mr. Holley. My answer was, \u201cI don\u2019t recall any such conversation.\u201d I believe that was it. And he\u2019s opening up in violation of what I consider to be Your Hon- or\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">Record on Appeal, Vol. VII at 274, 275-76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">. The method by which this rebuttal was made may raise some questions under Fed.R. Evid. 405(b). The appellant made no specific objection based on this Rule at trial and has not argued the point before this court. Thus, this issue is not properly before this court, and we express no opinion on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b762-16\">ON REHEARING AND REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">Before GODBOLD, Chief Judge, RO-NEY, TJOFLAT, HILL, FAY, VANCE, KRAVITCH, FRANK M.
