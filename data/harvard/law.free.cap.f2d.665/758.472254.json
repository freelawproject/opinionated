L &amp; B challenges FERC\u2019s jurisdiction as well as its decision. We approve FERC\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction but reverse its order on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">In 1971, Webb Resources, a company unaffiliated with L &amp; B, drilled an exploratory well to a depth of 7,555 feet on land leased from the State of Colorado. Within two weeks of the commencement of the drilling, the well bore was plugged with cement and the venture was abandoned as a dry hole. Webb\u2019s lease expired sometime thereafter. In 1978, L &amp; B obtained from the state a lease on the land previously leased to Webb.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\">L &amp; B commenced its State No. 1 Well in 1979 by drilling out the thirty-foot cement surface plug left by Webb. The L &amp; B well followed the Webb well bore to a depth of 479 feet, whereupon the drill bit was devi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ated from the original hole and the well was drilled to a depth of 7,606 feet. The well now produces gas from formations between 7,402 and 7,463 feet below the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) permits state regulatory agencies to determine whether certain production qualifies for the price category established by section 103 of the NGPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this authority, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission determined that L &amp; B\u2019s State No. 1 Well was a \u201cnew, onshore production well\u201d entitled to prices established under the NGPA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The NGPA also provides a method by which a state agency determination may be reviewed and reversed by FERC and the method FERC must follow in giving notice of a decision to review and reverse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> L &amp; B argues that FERC\u2019s notice of its preliminary finding was untimely, thus depriving it of jurisdiction to reverse the Colorado agency, and that FERC\u2019s determination on the merits was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Before FERC may exercise its authority to review and reverse another agency\u2019s determination that a well is entitled to \u201cnew, onshore production\u201d status under the NGPA, FERC must comply with certain requirements which the parties concede to be jurisdictional. The particular requirement of concern in this case is that FERC make a preliminary finding to reverse the state or federal agency and so notify the agency and parties within 45 days of FERC\u2019s receipt of notice of the state or federal agency\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">Notice of the Colorado agency\u2019s determination was received by FERC on February 5, 1980, and assigned Docket No. GP 80-80. On March 21, 1980, 45 days later, FERC issued a Notice of Preliminary Finding that the Colorado agency\u2019s determination should be reversed, and publicly posted it under Docket No. GP 80-3 in its Office of Public Information in Washington, D.C. The Preliminary Finding was published in the Federal Register on March 28, 1980. 45 Fed. Reg. 20530. On March 31, 1980, FERC posted an erratum notice correcting the docket number to GP 80-80. On April 1, 1980, FERC mailed copies of the Preliminary Finding and the erratum notice to L &amp; B and the Colorado agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">L &amp; B submitted written comments to FERC staff on April 22 and June 18, 1980, and requested an informal conference with FERC staff. An informal conference was held at FERC\u2019s offices on June 19, 1980, at which time L &amp; B made the same arguments presented in the instant petition. L &amp; B filed supplemental comments on July 7, 1980. On July 18, 1980, FERC issued its Final Finding on Well Category Determination reversing the Colorado agency\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">L &amp; B alleges that by posting the notice in its Washington office under an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>incorrect docket number, the Commission provided notice to no one within the 45-day period. FERC responds that the proof does not show that L &amp; B or anyone else attempted to avail itself of the notice as posted. In the absence of such proof, there is nothing to contradict FERC\u2019s assertion that if anyone had attempted to discover whether a preliminary decision about the status of State Well No. 1 had been posted within the required time, they would have found the notice in question. FERC mailed copies of the posted notice to the Colorado agency and L &amp; B nearly two weeks later. No court has decided whether the public posting of a preliminary determination complies with the NGPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that FERC\u2019s posting practice met the absolute minimum statutory notice requirement of the NGPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">NGPA\u2019s section 503(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(b), requires only \u201cnotice\u201d to the state agency and parties within 45 days. The statutory language which we are required to interpret makes no particular form or class of notice mandatory. By construing that provision to require actual notice or personal notice by mail within 45 days, we would be adding to the words of the statute. Congress chose to leave to FERC the determination of an appropriate method of giving notice to the agency and parties within 45 days. FERC\u2019s public posting of its preliminary decision at its 'Washington office within 45 days, coupled with a subsequent mailing of copies to the parties, complied with the literal requirements of the statute. While this makes the 45-day notice requirement a device that does little more than compel FERC to complete its review of state agency determinations within the specified period, we cannot say it fails to comply with the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">FERC\u2019s regulations do not add to the statute\u2019s literal notice requirements with respect to the 45-day period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[W]ritten notice\u201d within the 45-day period is required. However, the portion of the regulation requiring that \u201c[c]opies of the written notice will be sent\u201d to the state agency and parties is worded in the future tense. FERC\u2019s construction of its regulation as requiring written notice by posting within the 45-day period to be followed by sending copies to the parties is a reasonable one. FERC complied by posting written notice .of its preliminary determination within the 45-day period, by subsequently publishing that notice in the Federal Register, and by later mailing copies to the Colorado agency and L &amp; B.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Despite the fact that FERC\u2019s notification methods could have been more meaningful with minimum additional administrative burden to it, we must observe that those procedures did not in any way prejudice L <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>&amp; B. The notice was intended to do no more than inform L &amp; B that the Colorado agency\u2019s determination was being subjected to serious FERC review. It was not notice that required L &amp; B immediately to change its pricing structure or otherwise alter its primary conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor did the delay in the date of receipt of actual notice cause loss to L &amp; B. L &amp; B does not contend that it was unable to present its case before FERC reached a final determination. On the contrary, pursuant to FERC regulations,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> L &amp; B filed written comments and informally conferred with FERC staff members before FERC\u2019s decision was made. Hence, the notification did not impair L &amp; B\u2019s right to be heard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Finding that the notice given was sufficient to confer jurisdiction to decide the merits, we determine that FERC erred in upsetting the Colorado agency\u2019s determination that L &amp; B State No. 1 Well was a new, onshore production well. FERC\u2019s standard of reviewing the agency\u2019s determination is whether it is supported by substantial evidence. NGPA \u00a7 503(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(b)(1). The NGPA explicitly requires this court to apply the same standard. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 503(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(b)(4)(B). By mandating identical review standards, the statute minimizes the degree of deference we are to pay FERC\u2019s intervening decision. The effect is to require us to determine for ourselves whether the Colorado agency\u2019s ruling was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">In reversing the Colorado agency\u2019s determination, FERC found that agency to be incorrect as a matter of law. FERC argues that we should defer to its interpretation of the NGPA. Since we find that FERC\u2019s legal interpretation is inconsistent with the NGPA's clear language and purpose, we need not consider the degree to which this court must defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute within its administrative ambit. <em>See Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, -, 102 S.Ct. 38, 42, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981); <em>Mid-Louisiana Gas Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>664 F.2d 530, 534 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">We first consider FERC\u2019s argument that the Colorado agency\u2019s determination is erroneous under the correct interpretation of the NGPA and then turn to the issue of whether the Colorado agency\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">A. <em>\u201cNew, Onshore Production Well\u201d under the NGPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-16\">In analyzing the meaning of \u201cnew, onshore production well,\u201d we turn first, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>all cases involving statutory construction, to the language of the statute itself. See <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1383, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <em>Ecee, Inc. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>611 F.2d 554, 561 (5th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The portion of the statute of concern defines a \u201cnew, onshore production well\u201d as \u201cany new well . . . the surface drilling of which began on or after February 19, 1977.\u201d NGPA \u00a7 103(c)(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3313(c)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The issue is whether, as a matter of law, L &amp; B\u2019s State No. 1 Well cannot be a \u201cnew, onshore production well\u201d within the plain meaning of section 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">FERC\u2019s position on the issue is simple. According to FERC\u2019s argument before this court and in its previous pronouncements,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the date on which surface drilling begins is the date of \u201cspudding in.\u201d Professors Williams and Meyers define \u201cspudding in\u201d as the initial boring of the hole, to a depth of approximately 100 feet, in drilling an oil or gas well. H. Williams &amp; C. Meyers, <em>Manual of Oil and Gas Terms </em>564 (4th ed. 1976). FERC contends that the surface drilling of L &amp; B\u2019s State No. 1 Well took place in 1971 when Webb spudded in the well, and that State No. 1 Well could not possibly be a \u201cnew, onshore production well\u201d because this spudding in can only occur once. FERC\u2019s bright-line rule equating spudding in with surface drilling and limiting this initiating event to a single time in any well bore ever drilled is too strict. While undoubtedly appropriate in certain factual contexts, it would lead to a result in this case entirely inconsistent with the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">The surface drilling of L &amp; B\u2019s State No. 1 Well commenced in 1979 when L &amp; B drilled out the thirty-foot cement surface plug left in the dry hole abandoned by Webb in 1971. L &amp; B was not merely reactivating Webb\u2019s dry hole or deepening a previously spudded well. We pretermit any guess at whether in those situations the prior spudding in may constitute the initiation of surface drilling. Different circumstances obtain in the case before us. A dry hole, such as the one abandoned by Webb, is not a well. <em>See Nafco Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. v. Tartan Resources Corp., </em>522 S.W.2d 703, 707 (Tex.Civ.App.1975); H. Williams &amp; C. Meyers, <em>supra </em>at 176.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, when L &amp; B drilled through the cement plug, it was initiating the surface drilling of a new well. The fact that it followed the uncollapsed bore of the dry hole for a few hundred feet before deviating adds no more to FERC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>position than if L &amp; B had drilled through the cement plug, but used none of the old well bore. Because L &amp; B\u2019s drilling venture took place in 1979, State No. 1 Well could qualify for pricing under NGPA \u00a7 103 as a new, onshore production well.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">A more thorough factual analysis shows this interpretation of the statute is consonant with the principles embodied in the NGPA. President Carter, in signing into law several of the bills (including the NGPA) comprising his National Energy Plan, noted that one of the three principles encompassed by those bills was to \u201cprovide adequate incentives ... to encourage additional production of available expendable energy supplies in our own. country.\u201d J. Carter, II <em>Pub. Papers </em>1978-79 (1978). The NGPA\u2019s passage was prompted by a serious natural gas shortage, and provided for various classes of economic incentives for new exploration and production. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Legislative History of the Natural Gas Policy Act: Title I, </em>59 Texas L.Rev. 101, 110-13 (1980). As we have previously noted, the NGPA \u201cadopted an incentive-based approach to rate-setting for gas production, providing substantially higher prices for \u2018new\u2019 gas than was currently available.\u201d <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>645 F.2d 360, 367 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The section at issue in this case is one of the many sections of the NGPA that effectuates the Act\u2019s purpose by providing specific price incentives for new production. That purpose would be thwarted by FERC\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnew, onshore production well.\u201d Almost the entirety of normal exploration costs were incurred and all of the production efforts were made by L &amp; B in 1979. It discovered and produced gas where there was none before. Such an enterprise is of the sort the NGPA sought to encourage through price incentives. To hold, as a matter of law, that the L &amp; B well could not qualify as a \u201cnew, onshore production well\u201d because it made minimal use of a dry hole bore would do violence to one of the obvious purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The foregoing discussion should not be interpreted as implying that the spud-ding in date is irrelevant to the determination of what is a \u201cnew, onshore production well.\u201d On the contrary, we merely hold that in certain circumstances a state agency can correctly grant \u201cnew, onshore production well\u201d status to a well that was not literally spudded in on or after February 19, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">B. <em>The Colorado Agency\u2019s Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The NGPA requires us to reverse FERC\u2019s decision if we find that the Colorado agency\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. NGPA \u00a7 503(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(b)(4)(B). Our standard of review is identical to that prescribed for FERC review of the state agency. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 503(b)(1)(A), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(b)(1)(A). The degree of deference to be granted a state agency determination was specifically addressed in the NGPA\u2019s legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ad3-dedup-0\">The conferees intend that the Commission\u2019s authority to review State or Federal agency determinations shall be limited to determining the narrow question of whether or not the agency determination is supported by substantial evidence. The conferees have followed the traditional definition of substantial evidence review; that is, there is no intention to allow the Commission to \u201csecond guess\u201d the agency by independently weighing the evidence and reversing the agency\u2019s determination as if the initial responsibility to make the determination were placed within the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference, P.L. 95-621, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 118, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 8800, 9035. FERC\u2019s quarrel with the Colorado agency was over a matter of statutory interpretation, and not the evidence itself. We have evaluated FERC\u2019s argument and rejected its niggardly reading of the statute. Thus, we are left to determine whether the Colorado agency\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence. We hold that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Prior to 1979, L &amp; B was in no way involved with the old Webb dry hole. During that year, L &amp; B committed its resources toward drilling a productive well. L &amp; B was successful, not because it relied on a portion of the Webb dry hole bore, but because of its dedication to its own 1979 venture. We conclude that these factors are substantial evidence to support the Colorado agency\u2019s determination that L &amp; B State No. 1 Well is a \u201cnew, onshore production well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">FERC correctly held that it had jurisdiction to reverse the Colorado determination.
