The appellant, Washington Association for Television and Children (WATCH), raises a variety of procedural and substantive objections to the manner in which the FCC performed. We hold that a number of these objections have become moot because of an intervening change in FCC policy with regard to the concentration of market power in the television broadcasting industry, and that the rest are without merit. We affirm the orders of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-15\">On July 25,1978, Taft, after having negotiated a transfer of control .of Channel 20 from Improvement Leasing Company (Improvement), filed an application to secure FCC approval. On August 17, 1978, the Commission issued a public notice that the application had been accepted for filing. This notice triggered the thirty-day period during which interested parties may file petitions asking the FCC to deny the application for transfer. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.-3584(a) (1980). WATCH did not file its petition to deny Taft\u2019s application until March 19, 1979, seven months after the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-16\">On April 3, 1979, Taft moved to dismiss WATCH\u2019s petition as untimely filed. This motion was followed by a number of other pleadings from both WATCH and Taft. The FCC refused to accord WATCH the full party status it had sought in tendering its petition to deny, <em>see </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (1976), but it decided to treat WATCH\u2019s contentions as \u201cinformal objections\u201d under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3587 (1980) when it met to consider Taft\u2019s application on August 1, 1979. The meeting, attended by six of the seven Commissioners, resulted in a tie vote and Taft\u2019s application was not approved. The Commission did vote, however, to allow Taft to amend its application for reconsideration at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>Taft responded on the next day with an amendment to its programming proposals. The amendment sought to strengthen the case for an exemption from the FCC\u2019s \u201cTop 50 Policy.\u201d This policy had been adopted by the FCC as a means to prevent a single entity from controlling a large number of television stations. The policy precluded a licensee from acquiring a fourth television station, either VHF or UHF, or a third VHF station, in the fifty largest television markets unless it could make a \u201ccompelling public interest showing\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to justify a waiver. On August 2, the FCC met, decided to consider the amended application on August 10, and gave WATCH until August 8 to file comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Public notice of the upcoming August 10 meeting was given on August 6 and again on August 8. WATCH objected to the short notice and sought a temporary restraining order in the district court to prevent the August 10 meeting from taking place. It alleged that the August 2 meeting, as well as the notices of the August 10 meeting, were deficient under the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(e)(l) (1976), and the Commission\u2019s own regulations, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.605(e) (1980). The FCC responded by issuing a notice on August 9 that the meeting to consider Taft\u2019s amended application would be held a full seven days later, on August 16. Consequently, WATCH withdrew its suit for a temporary restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">At the August 16 meeting Taft\u2019s application was approved by a vote of four to three. The Commission rejected all of WATCH\u2019s objections and found both that a waiver of the Top 50 Policy was justified <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that granting the application for transfer of control of Channel 20 would serve the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity,\u201d as required by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(a) (1976). Because their contract had a termination date of August 17,1979, Taft and Improvement immediately proceeded to consummate the transfer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">WATCH then moved the FCC to order the transfer rescinded because it could not legally take place before a written order had issued. Five days later, WATCH sought relief in this court through a mandamus proceeding. The court deferred action on WATCH\u2019s petition until the Commission\u2019 had an opportunity to act on the motion to rescind. On September 14, the FCC released an order denying the motion and holding that the transfer had not taken place illegally, <em>Improvement Leasing Co., </em>73 F.C.C.2d 676 (1979) <em>(\u201cPremature Transfer Order\u2019); </em>and on September 28 it released the order approving the transfer that it had adopted at its August 16 meeting, <em>Improvement Leasing Co., </em>73 F.C.C.2d 655 (1979) <em>(\u201cInitial Transfer Order\u201d). </em>Then this court dismissed WATCH\u2019s petition for mandamus as moot because the FCC\u2019s written order had issued. <em>See In Re Washington Association for Television and Children, </em>No. 79-1992 (D.C.Cir. Oct. 31, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">WATCH appealed, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)(6) (1976), from both the <em>Initial Transfer Order </em>and the <em>Premature Transfer Order. </em>It seeks reversal based on the allegations made in its petition to deny Taft\u2019s application, in its supplemental pleadings and communications with the Commission prior to the approval of the application, and in its attempts to have the transfer of the license rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"avq-dedup-1\">A. <em>Top 50 Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-14\">Prior to its acquisition of Channel 20, Taft already owned five VHF stations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>one UHF station in the top fifty television markets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order for it to obtain an exemption from the Top 50 Policy, Taft had to make a \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d showing of \u201cthe benefits in detail that are relied upon to overcome the detriment with respect to the policy of diversifying the sources of mass media communications to the public.\u201d <em>Multiple Ownership of TV Broadcast Stations, </em>22 F.C.C.2d 696, 700 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">At its August 16 meeting, the Commission found that Taft had made such a showing. <em>See Initial Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d at 656-64. WATCH continues to object strenuously to that finding, and the three dissenting Commissioners objected as well, <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>It is clear that the adequacy of Taft\u2019s case for an exemption from the Top 50 Policy is the central substantive issue on this appeal. Were it not equally clear that the issue is moot, we should have to determine whether the Commission\u2019s approval of the application was unreasonable, and whether any \u201csubstantial and material questionfs] of fact\u201d existed so as to require a formal hearing pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">Before the proceedings with respect to Taft\u2019s transfer application began, the FCC had announced its intention to reconsider the Top 50 Policy. <em>See Multiple Ownership</em>\u2014Television <em>B/C Stations, </em>68 F.C. C.2d 837 (1978). Subsequently it decided to repeal the policy. <em>Top 50 Ownership Policy, </em>75 F.C.C.2d 585 (1979), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>82 F.C.C.2d 329 (1980), <em>appeal pending sub nom. NAACP v. FCC, </em>No. 2416 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 20, 1980). Given this development, we are led to conclude that it would be \u201can idle and useless formality,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 766-67 n.6, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 1430 n.6, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969), to remand this case to the Commission if we were to find that it had not applied its Top 50 Policy properly. The reason is simple: there is no more Top 50 Policy to apply. No matter how many errors the Commission may have committed in applying the policy this time around, on remand, other things being equal, it would merely approve once again an otherwise acceptable application. It would not correct its mistakes because it would not have to do so; it would not have to pay any further attention to the Top 50 Policy at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">We believe that a finding of mootness is the only proper one here. The Commission, in an intervening proceeding, has determined that the policy previously applied in cases like this one no longer serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, and therefore will not be applied henceforth. We hold that in such circumstances an agency cannot be required to apply a policy it has rejected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a requirement would amount to a command to the agency to disregard its statutory mandate: it would have to employ a policy that, by its own determination, did not serve the public interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That the FCC\u2019s repeal of its policy currently is being appealed before this court does not disturb our conclusion. To hold that a repealed policy must be applied pending judicial review would tie an agency\u2019s hands for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>frequently long periods during which appeals await disposition in the courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">B. <em>Misrepresentations</em></p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">In its application for transfer of the Channel 20 license, Taft made a number of somewhat equivocal statements that perhaps could be read to suggest that it was relying in part on the ailing financial status of the station to justify a waiver of the Top 50 Policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That in any event is the way in which WATCH has read the application. Proceeding from that interpretation, it maintains that Taft attempted to deceive the Commission, or at the very least did not conform to the applicable regulations,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by not amending its application to indicate that Channel 20 had begun to show a profit from June 1978 on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">In a statement filed with the Commission on May 17, 1979, <em>see </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) 202, Taft disclaimed any intention to rely on the imminent financial failure of Channel 20 under the current licensee. It asserted instead that it had merely described the station as \u201cmarginal.\u201d This term, according to Taft, meant that Channel 20 was in a weak competitive position typical of independent UHF stations, and could be strengthened by an infusion of broadcasting expertise and financial resources. The station\u2019s profitability since mid-1978, Taft claimed, did not affect the characterization of it as marginal. Short swings between periods of profit and loss had occurred before, and the latest oscillation did not alter the picture of financial volatility that Taft had presented with respect to Channel 20. The Commission accepted this explanation of why Taft had not supplied additional information about Channel 20\u2019s performance. <em>Initial Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">The issue here is not whether the Commission\u2019s decision to approve Taft\u2019s application was based on inaccurate or incomplete information about the financial status of Channel 20. As we have indicated, the correct application of the Top 50 Policy is now moot. The relevant inquiry is whether this case involves any \u201cfalse statements, misrepresentation or lack of candor\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>would raise serious doubts about whether Taft\u2019s character justified a grant of a license under the public interest standard of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">The Communications Act requires the Commission to hold hearings in license proceedings \u201cif a substantial and material question of fact is presented.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1976). In applying the statute, we proceed from the principle that \u201c[a] hearing is not required when facts are undisputed or when the case turns on only the \u2018inferences to be drawn from facts already known and the legal conclusions to be derived from these facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alianza Federal de Mercedes v. FCC, </em>539 F.2d 732, 736 (D.C. Cir.1976) (quoting <em>Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, </em>505 F.2d 320, 324 (D.C.Cir. 1974)). We conclude, first, that no hearing was required on the misrepresentation issue. There were no significant factual issues in dispute; it was clear that Taft had not updated its application, and the question involved the legal inferences to be derived from that fact in the context of the transfer proceedings. There was nothing to be gained from holding formal hearings on this issue. The Commission was capable of applying its expertise on the basis of the record before it, including Taft\u2019s explanation for not having considered it necessary to supplement its application with more financial data.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">After determining that no hearing was necessary, the Commission concluded that Taft\u2019s explanation was reasonable. <em>Initial Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d at 665. The standard applied by the Commission in cases involving possible misrepresentations on the part of applicants for licenses is one of intent. <em>See, e.g., Bluegrass Broadcasting Co., </em>43 F.C.C.2d 990, 992 (1973). It can be argued that the better course for Taft would have been to apprise the FCC of <em>all </em>developments with regard to Channel 20, irrespective of whether Taft itself considered them significant. We cannot say, however, that the record demands the conclusion that Taft\u2019s failure to do so sinks to the level of an intentional effort to deceive the Commission. To the contrary, the FCC\u2019s conclusion that it should not be so regarded is based on the record before it, namely, the explanation offered by Taft.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s action cannot be termed arbitrary and capricious, and we uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">C. <em>Party Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">1. <em>Untimeliness of WATCH\u2019s Petition to Deny</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">WATCH contends that it should have been accorded the status of a full party<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to the transfer proceedings. Even though its petition to deny concededly was filed long after the expiration of the thirty-day period during which such petitions are accepted as timely, WATCH asserts that it lacked actual notice of the filing of Taft\u2019s application and that the thirty-day period therefore should have been tolled. This lack of notice is traced to the \u201cunderstanding\u201d of WATCH\u2019s president, from an interview with a Taft employee, that Taft would not file its transfer petition prior to December 1978 or January 1979.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">The FCC declined to accept WATCH\u2019s petition to deny Taft\u2019s application; it termed the petition \u201cprocedurally defective in that it does not meet the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>with respect to timeliness,\u201d <em>Initial Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d at 657.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with that conclusion insofar as it relates to the long period between the public notice of Taft\u2019s application on August 17, 1978 and WATCH\u2019s petition of March 19, 1979. WATCH, as an organization represented by counsel intimately familiar with the notice procedures employed by the FCC, cannot be heard to say that its failure to learn of the application was justified.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, we note that WATCH indicated that it first learned of the application in mid-February of 1979, <em>see </em>Affidavit of Nancy Forbord (President of WATCH), J.A. 151,152. Why it then waited more than thirty days before filing its petition is unexplained and perhaps inexplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">2. <em>Major Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-J\">We are of a different opinion with regard to the timeliness of WATCH\u2019s petition at a later stage of the proceedings. On August 2, 1979, with the FCC\u2019s permission, Taft submitted an amendment to its original application. This amendment augmented Taft\u2019s proposed programming changes for Channel 20. It was designed to improve the applicant\u2019s public interest showing as a justification for a waiver of the Top 50 Policy. Because the only different information before the Commission at its August 16 meeting was this amendment, WATCH contends<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that the amendment swung the vote from a 3-3 tie to 4-3 in favor of Taft. Consequently, WATCH argues, it was by definition a major amendment triggering a new thirty-day filing period for petitions to deny. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(b), (c) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">We agree. The statute gives the Commission the authority to \u201cadopt reasonable classifications of applications and amendments,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(g) (1976). The regulations in which it has done so classify changes in programming plans as major amendments with regard to applications for license renewals, <em>see </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3578(a) (1980), but not with regard to applications for transfer of control, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 73.3578(b). We hold that whatever the merits of this distinction in the typical case, it was not \u201creasonable\u201d in this case to style Taft\u2019s amendment as minor. Its obvious decisional significance renders such a possibility inconceivable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If we saw any real sense in doing so, therefore, we would remand Taft\u2019s application to the Commission and order it to grant WATCH full party status. The mootness of the Top 50 Policy issue, however, together with our finding that no other issues would require a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>ing,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> indicates that a remand would afford WATCH no meaningful relief.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">D. <em>Sunshine Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">WATCH alleges that notices of the Commission\u2019s August 2 meeting \u2014 the meeting at which it did no more than set a date to consider Taft\u2019s amended application \u2014 were inadequate in terms of the Sunshine Act and the agency\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are unable to conclude that the FCC\u2019s action should be set aside as \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976). We do, however, find fault with the regulations under which the Commission was operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">The Sunshine Act exempts from its definition of \u201cmeeting,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(aX2) (1976), deliberations required or permitted by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552b(e). That subsection deals with a seven-day notice requirement and refers to deliberations about whether to schedule future meetings with shorter notice. We conclude from this that the August 2 meeting was not embraced by the statutory definition. As a result, it was not subject to the <em>statutory </em>notice provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">The FCC\u2019s regulations implementing the statute are stricter than the statute demands. The Commission\u2019s own definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d does not contain an exception regarding deliberations about short notice like that found in \u00a7 552b(a)(2) of the statute. Apart from one exception that is not relevant here, it includes deliberations that \u201cresult in the joint conduct of [sic] disposition of official agency business.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.601 (1980). And the following provision regarding short notice, again stricter than the statutory requirement,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> applies to FCC practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-11\">If the prompt and orderly conduct of agency business requires that a meeting be held less than one week after the announcement of the meeting, or before that announcement, the agency will issue the announcement at the earliest practicable time. In addition to other information, the announcement will contain the vote of each member of the agency who participated in the decision to give less than seven days\u2019 notice and will specify the nature of the emergency situation if it is not clear from the subject matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APb\">47 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.605(e) (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-12\">The record shows that whether the August 2 meeting was noticed promptly enough, and whether there really was an \u201cemergency\u201d situation, are questions that certainly are open to debate. We decline to enter the debate, however, for we conclude that a precondition for it is lacking. The agency\u2019s definition of a meeting at 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.601 is impermissibly broad; like the statute it is supposed to track, it should not include meetings such as the one that took place on August 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-13\">The Commission\u2019s regulation requires it to give seven days\u2019 notice of meetings whose only order of business is to decide whether to call a future meeting with shorter notice. The statute itself, of course, demands no such absurd, wasteful result. The regulation increases the agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>cy\u2019s administrative burden significantly with no conceivable corresponding public benefits. Indeed, we are unable to discern any reason for the breadth of the agency\u2019s definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d \u2014 apart from shoddy draftsmanship, perhaps. While we recognize that an agency generally is free to shoulder burdens more onerous than those specifically imposed by statute, the regulation at issue here is in excess of the Commission\u2019s rulemaking discretion under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(i) (1976). Consequently, we set it aside to the extent that its definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d is more inclusive than the one contained in the Sunshine Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\">E. <em>Prematurity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Finally, WATCH maintains that it was improper for Improvement and Taft to consummate the transfer of Channel 20 immediately after the Commission's meeting on August 16, 1979. Instead, WATCH argues, they should have awaited the issuance of a written order approving the transfer and denying the petition to deny pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d)(2) (1976). This issue is now moot with regard to the transfer of Channel 20.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s written order has in fact issued, <em>see Initial Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d 655 (released Sept. 28, 1979); an order to rescind the transfer to await a written order, while it would have been possible between August 16 and September 28, is now an impossibility.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">A further point concerning prematurity should be mentioned. The statute requires that once a \u201csubstantial\u201d amendment to an application has been filed, a period of at least thirty days must be allowed for the filing of petitions to deny. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d)(1) (1976). WATCH\u2019s petition was already before the Commission, but our holding that the August 2 amendment was major requires the conclusion that others should have had until September 2 to file petitions to deny. The FCC should not have taken action with regard to the application at its August 16 meeting.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Once again, however, the issue is mooted by the repeal of the Top 50 Policy. There is no point now in vacating the transfer and requiring a thirty-day period for possible further comment on an amendment that is no longer of any relevance to the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">The FCC has by no means served as an exemplar of proper agency procedure in this case. Were the issues related to the Top 50 Policy and the effective date' of agency action not moot, we would remand the proceedings to the Commission and require it to accord WATCH full party status, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>as well as to wait thirty days before acting on Taft\u2019s amended application. We would also be required to determine, on this appeal, whether the Commission\u2019s finding of adequate justification for a waiver of the Top 50 Policy was warranted. However, our finding of mootness strips such action of all practical purpose. The orders appealed from are</p>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">. <em>Multiple Ownership of TV Broadcast Stations, </em>22 F.C.C.2d 696, 700 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">. Three Commissioners dissented on this point; they maintained that Taft had not made the requisite showing of \u201ccompelling public interest.\u201d <em>See Improvement Leasing Co., </em>73 F.C. C.2d 655, 670 (1979) <em>(\u201cInitial Transfer Order\u201d) </em>(dissenting statement of Chairman Ferris &amp; Commissioner Fogarty); <em>id. </em>at 675 (dissenting statement of Commissioner Brown).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1369-16\">. WATCH sought to prevent the transfer by a motion for a stay of the August 16 decision. Taft and Improvement went ahead with the transfer, however, and the FCC denied the motion on August 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">. Taft had owned the five VHF stations prior to the adoption of the Top 50 Policy; the policy had been waived for its acquisition of the sixth station, <em>see WIBF Broadcasting Co., </em>17 F.C.C.2d 876 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">. A different result might well be suggested if we could accept WATCH\u2019S intimation that the repeal of the Top 50 Policy was motivated solely by litigation strategy on the part of the FCC. The facts of this case warrant no such conclusion. Reconsideration of the Top 50 Policy was well under way before WATCH challenged Taft\u2019s application. While a consequence of our holding may indeed be to \u201ceviscerate through rulemaking the substantive grounds for appeal,\u201d Reply Brief of Appellant at 21, we cannot say that the Commission repealed the Top 50 Policy in order to achieve that result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1370-12\">. Furthermore, applying the Top 50 Policy on remand in this case, while not applying it in similar cases that arise after the repeal of the policy, could well engender inconsistent results with regard to similarly situated applicants. This inconsistency would contravene the cardinal principle that like cases should be decided alike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">. The logic that demands continued application of defunct policies before the <em>first </em>stage of appellate review is completed also would seem to require the agency to await action by the Supreme Court. An agency could be prevented for years from implementing its policy judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">. <em>See </em>Taft Application, Exhibit No. I \u2014 1, Joint Appendix (J.A.) 38-40, 42, 52-55. The chief factors that, \u201cin varying degrees and either by themselves or in combination,\u201d <em>Initial Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d at 657, have in the past been considered sufficient to justify an exception to the Top 50 Policy, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-9\">\u2014The sale would increase diversity of. media by breaking up \u201cgrandfathered\u201d combinations not in compliance with the multiple ownership rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-10\">\u2014The sale would revitalize a financially ailing station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-11\">\u2014The sale would allow the resumption of construction of a community\u2019s first UHF station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auv-dedup-1\">\u2014The sale would preserve the vitality of a UHF group by preserving experienced management, sales personnel, and syndicated programming. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-12\">\u2014The buyer\u2019s stations are not geographically concentrated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-13\">\u2014The buyer\u2019s stations do not dominate their respective markets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-16\">\u2014The buyer will improve public affairs programming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-17\">\u2014The buyer\u2019s increase in potential households is minimal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-18\">\u2014The buyer faces substantial competition in each market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-19\">\u2014The acquisition will not improve the buyer\u2019s competitive position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-20\">\u2014The sale will diversify commonly owned television and nonbroadcast media.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-21\"><em>Multiple Ownership </em>\u2014 Television <em>B/C Stations, </em>68 F.C.C.2d at 840 (citations and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1371-24\">. The relevant regulation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-25\">Whenever there has been a substantial change as to any ... matter which may be of decisional significance in a Commission proceeding involving a pending application, the applicant shall as promptly as possible ... unless good cause is shown, submit a statement furnishing such additional or corrected information as may be appropriate ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-26\">47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.65 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1371-27\">. <em>Radio Carrolton, </em>52 F.C.C.2d 1173, 1182 (1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Faulkner Radio, Inc. v. FCC, </em>557 F.2d 886 (D.C.Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">. In so deciding we are mindful of the conclusion of this court that \u201cCongress intended to vest in the FCC a large discretion to avoid time-consuming hearings whenever possible.\u201d <em>Southwestern Operating Co. v. FCC, </em>351 F.2d 834, 835 (D.C.Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">. The Commission\u2019s finding that Taft\u2019s explanation was reasonable on its face amounts to a determination that, in the context of the transfer application, it also was credible. Thus, the Commission found in effect that there was no substantial issue of Taft\u2019s credibility involved here, and that a hearing was not warranted on that score. We agree that when the issue is viewed from this perspective, there is no necessity for a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1372-14\">. The chief advantage WATCH would have derived from party status would have been full participation in any hearings the Commission might have held. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1372-15\">. <em>See </em>Affidavit of Nancy Forbord (President of WATCH), J.A. 151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">. We reject' WATCH\u2019s contention that the FCC, even if its decision to refuse to accept the petition was correct, nevertheless should have provided a more complete statement of its reasons. Particularly in view of this court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]n applicant for waiver faces a high hurdle even at the starting gate,\u201d <em>WAIT Radio v. FCC, </em>418 F.2d 1153, 1157 (D.C.Cir. 1969), we find it sufficient that the FCC stated its reason for its action \u2014 the untimeliness of the WATCH petition. It did not have to undertake a detailed refutation of WATCH\u2019s proffered justifications for a waiver of the thirty-day rule. This is not, we hasten to add, the same as saying that an agency, when presented with reasons why a waiver should be granted, may simply <em>ignore </em>them and apply a rule woodenly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">. This conclusion might well stand even if we could conclude from the record that Taft clearly misinformed WATCH about its intentions. <em>Cf. 220 Television, Inc., </em>48 P&amp;F Rad.Reg.2d 537 (Oct. 14, 1980) (FCC refused to waive filing period even though petitioner had. alleged it had been misled about cutoff date by FCC staff member). The record warrants no such conclusion, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">. The dissenting Commissioners made the same claim, <em>see Initial Transfer Order, </em>63 F.C. C.2d at 672-73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">. Nor are we persuaded to conclude otherwise by the statement of Commissioner Lee (who was absent from the August 1 meeting but participated in the August 16 meeting by means of a transatlantic conference hookup from West Germany) that he would have approved the application on August 1 without the amendment. <em>See Initial Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d at 673 (Separate Statement of Commissioner Lee). Had Commissioner Lee been present on August 1, it is at least possible that he would have been won over by his three colleagues who voted down Taft\u2019s application. By the same token, the three who voted <em>for </em>Taft on August 1 might have been convinced to change their minds by August 16 if Taft had not offered its amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">. WATCH also contends that a hearing should have been held on the question of whether the proceedings were tainted because an FCC attorney with some involvement, in the case was a relative of the Taft family. This contention is without merit and was disposed of adequately by the Commission, <em>see Initial Transfer Order, F.C.C.2d </em>at 669.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">. We note in this regard that granting a petitioner party status under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(d) (1976) does not require that hearings be held. The statute merely allows a party to participate in hearings <em>if, </em>pursuant to \u00a7 309(e), they are necessary because a substantial and material question of fact is presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1374-14\">. Originally WATCH had also objected to the Commission, and sought relief in the district court, with regard to the notices of the meeting at which Taft\u2019s amended application would be considered. By then scheduling this meeting for August 16 and issuing notice of it seven days earlier, the FCC mooted these objections, and they are not now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1374-15\">. The statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(e)(2) (1976), does not require a specification of the nature of an \u201cemergency situation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">. We pause to note, for the sake of clarity, that we are not questioning the propriety of requiring the specification of an emergency situation as justification for calling meetings on short notice. It must be remarked, however, that 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.605(e) (1980) contains an apparent inconsistency: it begins with a calm reference to the prompt and orderly conduct of agency business as grounds for calling meetings on less than a week\u2019s notice, but ends with talk of emergencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">. In addition, we see no point in delving into WATCH\u2019s attacks on the propriety of the FCC\u2019s allowing parties to consummate transfers at their own risk pending the issuance of written orders, <em>see Premature Transfer Order, </em>73 F.C.C.2d 676 (1979). We are unconvinced that the statute requires a written order before FCC action becomes effective, and in any event the issue of the effective dates of orders has now been clarified. The FCC has recently adopted regulations providing that absent a specific statement to the contrary by the Corn-mission, the effective date of an order is- the date on which public notice of the action is provided. <em>See </em>FCC Docket No. 80-488 (March 10, 1981) (to be codified at 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.4(b), 1.103).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1375-13\">. That this impossibility arose on September 28 explains why this court then dismissed WATCH\u2019s petition for mandamus as moot, <em>see In Re Washington Association for Television and Children, </em>No. 79-1992 (D.C.Cir. Oct. 31, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">. The FCC pointed out that, except for WATCH, no one had ever shown interest in objecting to Taft\u2019s application. See <em>Initial Transfer Order, </em>23 F.C.C.2d at 668. This is of course irrelevant to our decision. The Commission was obligated to wait the required thirty days before acting on the amended application, regardless of its prediction of the level of public interest in the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
