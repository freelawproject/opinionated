It is to be noted that it was only after appellant insisted, over court appointed counsels objection and attempts to withdraw, that the trial court permitted retained counsel to participate in the defense. It would be anomalous if a defendant could predicate a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel on a conflict of his own making if, in fact, such a situation arose. We find it did not. We have carefully reviewed the record and the memorandum opinion filed by Judge Vietor and find no need to further discuss either the facts or the law. We thus affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s memorandum and its order entered pursuant thereto. 528 F.Supp. 62. <em>See </em>Rule 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-29\">.
