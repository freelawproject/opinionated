The agreement provided that ap-</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">pellant \u201cwould continue as administrator for as long as he performed ... to the satisfaction of the owners.\u201d Following a declaration by the Governor of Massachusetts in September of 1976' that there was a public health emergency at Woodland, the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Public Health (\u201cDPH\u201d) supplanted Woodland\u2019s private owners and took responsibility for the care of its patients.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant continued to serve as administrator. He was required to report to officials in DPH, and to clear major transactions with them much as he had done previously with Woodland\u2019s private owners, but the terms and conditions of his employment were otherwise unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-19\">In April of 1978, DPH assigned one of its assistant commissioners to manage Woodland. After visiting Woodland, meeting with appellant and examining certain- documents relating to Woodland\u2019s operations, the assistant commissioner determined that Woodland was being managed improperly and that appellant should be replaced. At a second meeting between the two, the assistant commissioner told this to appellant and offered him the opportunity to resign. Appellant refused and was subsequently discharged with five weeks\u2019 salary in lieu of two weeks\u2019 notice and three weeks\u2019 accrued vacation. Appellant did not challenge the authority of DPH to fire him, and did not request a chance to improve his performance. He claims he was told he had no right to a hearing or to seek review of the discharge decision, and in fact sought neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-20\">Appellant subsequently brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that various state officials<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deprived him of rights secured by the contract and due process clauses of the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>tion. The district court granted motions for summary judgment dismissing Bleeker\u2019s claims. Bleeker then appealed, but only on the due process clause question.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bleeker\u2019s due process claim for the simple reason that, under controlling decisions of the Supreme Court and of this court, Bleeker\u2019s interest in employment at Woodland did not constitute \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 343-47, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2076-79, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 576-78, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2708-10, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Beitzell v. Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d 870, 873-77 (1st Cir. 1981). Bleeker characterizes his interest as a \u201clegal entitlement to continued employment\u201d but concedes that the private owners of Woodland (and hence the state officials in DPH) could dismiss him if, <em>in their judgment, </em>he did not perform satisfactorily. This criterion for dismissal is sufficiently broad and subjective to warrant characterizing Bleeker\u2019s employment contract as one that did not provide for removal only \u201cfor cause\u201d but rather allowed for removal \u201cat will.\u201d An interest in mere \u201cat will\u201d employment, of course, is not constitutionally protected \u201cproperty.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. at 344-47, 96 S.Ct. at 2077-79; <em>Beitzell v. Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Bleeker, to be sure, does not concede that his employment at Woodland was entirely \u201cat will.\u201d He claims that his oral contract of employment incorporated certain written \u201cPersonnel Policies\u201d that in effect converted his job into something of a tenured, or tenure-like, position. According to Bleeker, the Personnel Policies provided him with a right to a \u201cwarning and an opportunity to correct\u201d before being discharged for unsatisfactory performance. Yet even if the Personnel Policies applied to Bleeker and provided him with the right he claims, both matters on which there is considerable doubt, the Policies are insufficient to convert his employment interest into constitutionally protected \u201cproperty.\u201d The wide discretion that the oral contract of employment gave Woodland\u2019s owners (and hence the government) to dismiss Bleeker was not \u201cseriously circumscribed,\u201d <em>see Beitzell v. Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d at 874, by the alleged right to a \u201cwarning and an opportunity to correct.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Bleeker\u2019s contract of employment, even as modified by Woodland\u2019s Personnel Policies, did not provide Bleeker with any basis for \u201crelypng] reasonably on remaining employed,\u201d <em>id., </em>when faced with an employer wishing to fire him. This lack of any reasonable expectation of continued employment suffices to establish the lack of \u201cproperty\u201d in the constitutional sense, and hence the lack of a viable due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">This, of course, is not to say that the state could violate the terms of Bleeker\u2019s employment contract with impunity. But where state officials violate the terms of an employment contract that does not create a constitutional \u201cproperty\u201d interest in the job itself, the proper remedy lies in a suit for breach of contract, not a \u00a7 1983 action. As we said in <em>Medina Jimenez v. Almodovar, </em>650 F.2d 363, 370 (1st Cir. 1981), \u201c[a] mere breach of contractual right is not a deprivation of property without <em>constitutional </em>due process of law. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 349-50, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2079-80, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). Otherwise, virtually every controversy involving an alleged breach of contract by a government or a governmental institution or agency or instrumentality would be a constitutional case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-16\">. The state\u2019s takeover of Woodland occurred pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 17, \u00a7 2A, which provides that, upon the declaration of a public health emergency by the Governor, the Commissioner of Public Health may \u201ctake such action and incur such liabilities as he may deem necessary to assure the maintenance of public health and the prevention of disease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-22\">. Appellant sued the Governor of Massachusetts, the Commissioner of the Department of Public Welfare, the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health, and the Secretary of the Executive Office of Human Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\">. By \u201cconstitutionally protected,\u201d we mean protected against discharge without appropriate procedural safeguards. Bleeker\u2019s employment interest might well be protected against action \u201cbased upon some constitutionally impermissible ground, such as racial, religious or sexual discrimination, or retaliation for assertion of rights guaranteed by . . . the Constitution.\u201d <em>Beitzell v. Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d at 876 n.13 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\">. <em>Cf. Bishop v.
