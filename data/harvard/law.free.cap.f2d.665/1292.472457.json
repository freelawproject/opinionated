ROBINSON, III, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1395-27\">Maurice C. Dreicer appeals from a decision of the United States Tax Court disallowing deductions, in computation of two years\u2019 federal income taxes, for losses incurred assertedly in professional endeavors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>as a multimedia personality. The Tax Court found that the particular pursuits in which Dreicer sustained the reported losses were writing and lecturing, and concluded that he had not engaged in those activities for profit, as defined by Section 183 of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and regulations promulgated thereunder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the stated reason that he had no bona fide expectation of realizing a profit from them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">We perceive no basis for disturbing the Tax Court\u2019s finding on the nature of the undertakings generating the losses for which deductions are sought. We do not accept, however, the legal test that the court employed in ruling on deductibility. We hold that a taxpayer engages in an activity for profit, within the meaning of Section 183 and the implementing regulations, when profit is actually and honestly his objective though the prospect of achieving it may seem dim. Because the Tax Court applied a different standard, we reverse and remand for redetermination of Dreicer\u2019s deduction claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">By virtue of Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code, a taxpayer may deduct from gross income all ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in a business,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, under Section 212, in the production or collection of income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A corollary rule, embodied in Section 165, permits deduction of losses sustained in a trade or business, or in a transaction entered into for profit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 183 qualifies these provisions by specifically disallowing, with limited exceptions not relevant here, deductions attributable to activities \u201cnot engaged in for profit.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, a taxpayer claiming a deduction under Sections 162 or 212 for an expense, or under Section 165 for a loss, must be prepared to demonstrate an associated profit motive in order to avoid the ban of Section 183.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appraising the facts salient in Dreicer\u2019s instance, which we need only summarize,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Tax Court held that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-20\">Dreicer, a citizen of the United States, maintains his residence in the Canary Islands, Spain, and engages heavily in global travel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He derives a substantial income as beneficiary of a family trust,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and in the early 1950\u2019s, Dreicer began to focus his professional attention on the fields of tourism and dining.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In 1955, he published <em>The Diner\u2019s Companion, </em>a compilation of his opinions on dining and on various restau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>rants throughout the world,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but the book was a commercial failure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Undaunted, Dreicer conceived the idea of some day writing another book, this one to enshrine his reminiscence on a life dedicated to epi-curism and travel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In preparation for this sybaritic swan song, he spent the next twenty years traveling about the world,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> staying in some of the finest hotels and dining in some of the best restaurants.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The material he gathered was also to be utilized in lectures before travel organizations and public appearances on radio and television.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> By the mid-1970s, Dreicer had completed a rough draft of the second book \u2014 parts of which originally had appeared in <em>The Diner\u2019s Companion</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 and titled it <em>My 27 Year Search for the Perfect Steak </em>\u2014 Still Looking.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Two publishing houses to which he submitted the manuscript, however, returned it,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and seemingly he abandoned all hope of publishing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">When Dreicer filed his federal income tax returns for 1972 and 1973, he claimed deductible losses of $21,795.76 and $28,022.05, respectively, for travel and other related business expenses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Commissioner of Internal Revenue thereafter issued a notice of deficiency, disallowing the deductions on the ground that the losses arose from activities not pursued for profit,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the Tax Court agreed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court disputed Drei-cer\u2019s characterization of his professional self as a multi-media personality, finding instead that he was a writer-lecturer on tourism and dining.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Having so defined his activity for Section 183 analysis, the court concluded that he had not entertained a bona fide expectation of profit from writing and lecturing, and on that account denied the deductions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-13\">Dreicer challenges the Tax Court\u2019s decision on two grounds. First, he contends that the court went amiss in finding that for purposes of Section 183 his professional activity was writing-lecturing rather than development as a public personality.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He also argues that the court erred as a matter of law in confining the concept of a for-profit activity to one from which the taxpayer actually expects to make a profit.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We consider each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-15\">The Tax Court discounted several of Dreicer\u2019s diverse professional undertakings when it defined the activity in which he sustained his reported losses. Contesting the court\u2019s classification of that activity as writer-lecturer on tourism and dining, Dreicer points to other pursuits \u2014 such as consulting, endorsing consumer products, and participation in radio and television programs \u2014 as evidence that his ultimate goal was to become a multi-media personality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>and reap huge financial returns once he became famous.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">A Treasury regulation sets forth the considerations relevant in gauging the scope of a taxpayer\u2019s activity for purposes of ascertaining whether and to what extent Section 188 applies. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-5\">Generally, the most significant facts and circumstances in making this determination are the degree of organizational and economic interrelationship of the various undertakings, the business purpose which is (or might be) served by carrying on the various undertakings separately or together in a trade or business or in an investment setting, and the similarity of various undertakings.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"APn\">The regulation additionally provides that although \u201cthe Commissioner will accept the characterization by the taxpayer of several undertakings either as a single activity or as separate activities,\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s designation will be rejected \u201cwhen it appears that [it] is artificial and cannot be reasonably supported under the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYEG\">The Tax Court agreed with the Commissioner that the activity pertinent to Section 183 analysis consisted in Dreicer\u2019s endeavors as a writer-lecturer on tourism and dining.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Contrary to Dreicer\u2019s present contention, however, the court made clear that this activity encompassed the bulk of the other undertakings he associated with the asserted effort to promote his personality except his work in originating radio and television programs unconnected with his travel.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Excluding the latter, the Court found that \u201cany such activity . .. would be wholly unrelated to [Dreicer\u2019s] writing and lecturing on travel and dining.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1398-13\">We decline the invitation to overturn the court\u2019s findings as clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> True it is that the court recognized that Dreicer continued to revise old ideas and develop new ones for radio and television programs during the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> But the record does not establish either an organizational or economic relationship of those activities to his writing and lecturing on tourism and dining.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> As the governing regulation makes clear, a taxpayer\u2019s description of his activities need not be accepted by the Commissioner \u2014 and surely not by the Tax Court \u2014 when in light of all other circumstances it appears artificial or lacking in reasonable support.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Absent specific evidence that all of Dreicer\u2019s pursuits were merely parts of a larger integrated professional enterprise, the court cannot be faulted for the classification it gave them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-15\">Dreicer also argues that even if the activity for which he claims deductions was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>more than writing and lecturing, the Tax Court applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether he engaged in it for profit, as defined by Section 183, because the court predicated its result on his profit <em>expectation </em>rather than to his profit <em>objective. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-4\">Addressing the losses that Dreicer deducted for the two tax years in question, the Tax Court made a searching inquiry into Dreicer\u2019s writing and lecturing pursuits in light of various factors set forth in the Treasury regulations pertinent.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court noted Dreicer\u2019s lengthy history of substantial losses in those endeavors;<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> his sizable independent income, which enabled him to continue writing and lecturing notwithstanding those losses;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> the tax benefits he had obtained from deduction of such losses in earlier years;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the unbusinesslike manner in which he had conducted his operations, including abandonment of efforts to get his second book published;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> his apparent lack of expertise on the subjects of tourism and dining;<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the pleasure he took in traveling and dining;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and his failure to achieve commercial success as a writer-lecturer.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">We applaud the Tax Court for the thoroughness of its factual inquiry, but we cannot place the stamp of approval upon its eventual legal outcome. The court concluded that Dreicer\u2019s losses were nondeductible on the sole ground that he did not have a \u201cbona fide expectation of profit\u201d from writing and lecturing.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The language of Section 183, its legislative history and the applicable Treasury regulation combine to demonstrate that the court\u2019s standard is erroneous as a matter of law.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">Section 183 was adopted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1969<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> to replace for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the so-called \u201chobby loss\u201d provision of former Section 270.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The preexisting hobby loss feature was a limitation on deductible losses incurred in an individual\u2019s trade or business to $50,000 per year if the losses therefrom had exceeded $50,000 for five or more consecutive years<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> \u2014 a restriction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>many taxpayers had proven creative enough to avoid.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Both Houses of Congress however, were aware of judicial disal-lowances of such losses when \u201cthe activity carried on by the taxpayer from which the loss results is not a business but is merely a hobby.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Each agreed, moreover, \u201cthat this basic principle provides a more effective and reasonable basis for distinguishing situations where taxpayers were not carrying on a business to realize a profit but rather were merely attempting to utilize the losses from the operation to offset their other income.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The two Houses disagreed, however, over one element critical to application of this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">The House bill would have replaced the old hobby loss provision with rules specifying that a taxpayer could not deduct losses arising from an activity carried on without \u201ca reasonable expectation of realizing a profit from it.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Determinations on whether the activity was conducted \u201cwith the expectation of realizing a profit\u201d would be made on the basis of all facts and circumstances; <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and losses exceeding $25,000 in three out of five years would give rise to a rebuttable presumption \u201cthat the taxpayer was not operating the activity with a reasonable expectation of realizing a profit from it.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">In the Senate, however, there was concern \u201cthat requiring a taxpayer to have a \u2018reasonable expectation\u2019 of profit may cause losses to be disallowed in situations where an activity is being carried on as a business rather than as a hobby.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Senate Committee on Finance accordingly \u201cmodified the House bill to provide that in determining whether losses from an activity are to be allowed, the focus is to be on whether the activity is engaged in for profit rather than whether it is carried on with a reasonable expectation of profit.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The Committee explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-11\">This will prevent the rule from being applicable to situations where many would consider that it is not reasonable to expect an activity to result in a profit even though the evidence available indicates that the activity actually is engaged in for profit. For example, it might be argued that there was not a \u201creasonable\u201d expectation of profit in the ease of a bona fide inventor or a person who invests in a wildcat oil well. A similar argument might be made in the case of a poor person engaged in what appears to be an inefficient farming operation. The committee does not believe that this provision should apply to these situations or that the House intended it to so apply, if the activity actually is engaged in for profit.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-12\">In the end, the Senate prevailed. The Conference Committee, noting that \u201c[i]n lieu of the test of \u2018a reasonable expectation of profit\u2019 the Senate amendment substitutes the test of \u2018not engaged in for profit,\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>62</footnotemark> adopted the Senate version,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> and in that form the legislation ultimately passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>both Houses.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Section 183 thus emerged as the product of a congressional purpose to pivot its operation, not on whether the taxpayer <em>expected </em>a profit, but instead on whether the taxpayer engaged in the activity with the <em>objective </em>of making a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">The language of both Section 183 and the Treasury regulations implementing it is faithful to this legislative intent. The statutory text bars deductibility of losses emanating from \u201cactivities not engaged in for profit,\u201d not activities lacking an expectation of profit.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The regulation provides relevantly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-6\">The determination whether an activity is engaged in for profit is to be made by reference to objective standards, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances of each case. Although <em>a reasonable expectation of profit is not required, </em>the facts and circumstances must indicate that the taxpayer entered into the activity or continued the activity <em>with the objective of making a profit </em>....<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">In the case at bar, the Tax Court conceded that a taxpayer need not show an expectation of profit that could be deemed reasonable.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> It ruled that Dreicer could not deduct the losses in question because, it said, he did not have \u201ca bona fide expectation\u201d of profit from the action from which those losses arose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-8\">[T]he record in this case shows beyond a doubt that there was no possibility of [Dreicer] realizing sufficient profit from his writing and lecturing activities to recoup the very large losses sustained in the preceding years, and therefore, we are convinced that, during the years in issue, [Dreicer] could not have had a <em>bona fide expectation </em>of realizing a profit from such activities.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1401-12\">Indeed, the notion that such an expectation was a precondition to deductibility pervades the court\u2019s treatment of Dreicer\u2019s claim thereto<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and became the decisive factor in its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-13\">In conclusion, after a careful review of all the facts and circumstances of this case, we hold that [Dreicer\u2019s] activity of traveling around the world allegedly to obtain material for a transcript was an \u201cactivity ... not engaged in for profit\u201d within the meaning of section 183(a), since he did not have a <em>bona fide expectation </em>of profit. Accordingly, the losses incurred by him during 1972 and 1973 are not deductible.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1401-14\">By thus hinging its decision on Dreicer\u2019s profit expectations instead of his profit objectives, the Tax Court utilized the wrong test. The statute, its legislative history and the implementing Treasury regulation make explicit that the objective, not the expectation, of making a profit is to govern determinations on whether a taxpayer is engaged in a business or a hobby, and the two criteria are not the same. One may embark upon a venture for the sincere purpose of eventually reaping a profit but in the belief that the probability of financial success is small or even remote. He therefore does not really expect a profit, but nonetheless is willing to take the gamble.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Under the Tax Court\u2019s test of \u201cbona fide expectation of profit,\u201d losses incurred in the enterprise could not be deducted. Yet it cannot be gainsaid that \u201cthe activity actually is engaged in for profit\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> \u2014 that it was undertaken \u201cwith the objective of mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>ing a profit.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> We do not say that Drei-cer\u2019s case is equivalent; that is for the Tax Court in the first instance, and we intimate no view on the merits. We do say that Dreicer\u2019s claims of deductibility are to be evaluated by proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">The decision appealed from is accordingly reversed and the case is remanded to the Tax Court for further consideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">.

It is not clear as to whether [Dreicer] claims that he also was working on the origination and creation of shows not related to his traveling, but any such activity produced no income during the years at issue and would be wholly unrelated to his writing and lecturing on travel and dining. Accordingly, we consider only his activities relating to writing and lecturing on dining and traveling as the \u201cactivity\u201d to be tested under Section 183.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-17\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1398-18\"><em>.
