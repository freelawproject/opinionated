In Docket No. 79-1352, WU seeks reversal of the Commission\u2019s authorization of Graphnet Systems, Inc., as a competitor of WU in the domestic telegraph service market. In Docket Nos. 79-2495, <em>et al, </em>WU challenges the Commission\u2019s decision not to apply to Graphnet the current international formula for outbound traffic distribution while continuing to apply that formula to WU. In those same cases the IRCs challenge the Commission\u2019s determination that the current formula is no longer in the public interest. We believe that the IRCs\u2019 claims in Docket Nos. 79-2495, <em>et al., </em>are premature and find WU\u2019s contentions, in both Docket Nos. 79-2495, <em>et al., </em>and Docket No. 79-1352, without merit. Accordingly, we dismiss the petitions of the IRCs and affirm as reasonable the Commission\u2019s actions regarding WU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-18\">A. <em>The Origin: PMS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-19\">On June 23,1977, Graphnet Systems, Inc., filed a section 214 application, requesting Commission approval of its proposal to convey inbound international messages from the gateway locations of the IRCs to recipients located in the hinterland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s initial consideration of Graphnet\u2019s application did not address the merits of that proposal. Instead, noting that the application \u201craises a significant number of policy issues,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Graphnet Systems, Inc., </em>67 F.C.C.2d 1059, 1061 (1978) (Memorandum Opinion and Order and Notice of Inquiry and Proposed Rulemaking) <em>(PMS </em>Notice), the Commission set for investigation and resolution four questions, including whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>the domestic telegraph market should be opened to competition and what regulatory changes, if any, should follow the adoption of such a policy. <em>Id. </em>at 1070. The Commission also designated Graphnet\u2019s application for hearing but decided that its further consideration must await the Commission\u2019s conclusions in its proposed inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">At the termination of this proceeding, the Commission issued its order of March 28, 1979. <em>Graphnet Systems, Inc., </em>71 F.C.C.2d 471 (1979) (hereinafter <em>PMS). </em>In that order the Commission determined that the public interest did not require the retention of WU as the sole source supplier of public message telegraph service (PMTS or PMS).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It recognized, however, that the operation of a competitive market would necessitate concomitant adjustment in the regulatory requirements imposed upon potential entrants in the PMTS market and in the regulation of those entrants subsequent to entry. Since its finding that multiple entry was in the public interest obviated any need for information pertaining to the public\u2019s need for new service, the Commission indicated that for PMTS applicants it would waive compliance with those portions of section 63.01 of its rules requiring the carrier\u2019s demonstration of public need for its facility, economic justification, and inadequacy of existing facilities. <em>Id. </em>at 522. Similarly, because competition might well eliminate the potential for cross-subsidization, the Commission found \u201cno compelling reason to discriminate against Western Union in its ability to provide service or to modify existing service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524. Instead, it concluded, WU \u201cshould be relieved of the requirements which were especially imposed upon it solely by virtue of its offering of PMTS.\u201d Accordingly, it promised to address \u201cthese and similar questions\u201d in the \u201cnear future.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">Following its adoption of an open-entry policy in the PMTS market, the Commission renewed its consideration of Graphnet\u2019s application. The Commission first determined that its new policy eliminated previously perceived policy barriers to Graphnet\u2019s entry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It then determined that Graphnet\u2019s proposed service would enhance \u201cthe nature and quality of international telegrams and telegraph message service,\u201d and that Graph-net\u2019s entry \u201ccould help check (through competitive pressure and cost saving innovation) the rising costs of inbound message delivery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. For these reasons, the Commission concluded that an immediate grant of Graphnet\u2019s section 214 application was in the public interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">B. <em>Subsequent Events</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUG-\">Thereafter, WU filed in this court a petition for review and a motion for partial stay of Graphnet\u2019s authorization. Noting that \u201cWestern Union has what is prima facie a meritorious claim to be protected from new competition to operate under more advantageous conditions than Western Union,\u201d the court granted WU\u2019s motion. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. FCC, </em>No. 79-1352 (D.C.Cir. June 18, 1978) (order granting partial stay). Upon that grant, however, the court imposed two conditions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>First, the stay was to be suspended when the FCC issued a \u201cnotice proposing for consideration . . . action that will modify or terminate the burden under the 1943 order of which Western Union complains.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Second, that suspension would remain effective only for 120 days. As the court explained: \u201cthe Court anticipates that the FCC will made [sic] a determination of the matter one way or another within the one-hundred twenty day period.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Pursuant to this order, the Commission adopted on July 19,1979, a notice of inquiry and proposed rulemaking, <em>Regulation of Domestic Public Message Service </em>(Notice of Inquiry and Proposed Rulemaking) FCC 79-442 (July 23, 1979) (hereinafter <em>Formula </em>Notice), in which it proposed and submitted for comment certain rule changes designed to provide WU its requested regulatory relief. <em>Formula </em>Notice at 1. <em>See </em>note 12 <em>infra. </em>The Commission also invited comment on its proposed substitution of \u201ca system that will allow the domestic and international carriers to negotiate agreements for the handling of inbound and outbound international traffic and file tariffs based on such agreements\u201d for the present \u201crigid\u201d international formula. <em>Id. </em>at ll.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It believed that this system would permit the carriers \u201cto negotiate the best possible prices\u201d and to keep the hinterland rates as low as possible, thus \u201cbenefiting the public by [reducing] the costs of . . . international service. . . . \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">C. <em>The Formula Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdqJ\">After reviewing the comments generated by its Notice, the Commission issued its order of January 7, 1980. <em>Regulation of Domestic Public Message Service, </em>75 F.C. C.2d 345 (1980) (hereinafter <em>Formula). </em>In that portion pertinent to this appeal, the Commission first reiterated its belief that <em>PMS </em>and other, subsequent, FCC decisions had significantly affected the nature of the working relationship between WU and the IRCs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the previously static nature of that relationship had been the primary premise underlying the Commission\u2019s prescription of the 1976 formula, the Commission concluded that a reexamination of that formula in light of changing market conditions was warranted. <em>Formula, </em>75 F.C.C.2d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">In this reexamination the Commission determined, at the outset, that the current formula had not accomplished its established objectives. The FCC had expected that the formula would stimulate price and service quality competition among the IRCs. <em>Id. </em>at 365. Instead, the Commission found that the formula had had little positive impact on the IRCs\u2019 actions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, in fact, had acted as a barrier to price competition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commission conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>ed that whatever the impact of the present formula, the significance of its role would be diminished by the new market conditions. Id. at 366. For these reasons the Commission declared the current formula not in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">In spite of this declaration, the Commission declined to prescribe a new formula. It explained that there was simply \u201cnot enough information to allow the Commission to prescribe a replacement ... formula at this time because of the vastly changed circumstances which the industry will face after our actions today and in the wake of our <em>Domestic PMS decision.\u201d Id. </em>at 370. Moreover, the Commission refused as well to apply the current formula to Graphnet. Neither the statute <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> nor the public interest, it concluded, required such action. Instead, citing the need for a transitional period, the Commission ordered that the current formula remain in effect pending its further order, and designated a nine-month period in which the affected carriers were to negotiate new agreements for the distribution of unrouted outbound international message traffic. Agreements reached would be subject to Commission evaluation and approval under the \u201cjust, reasonable, equitable and in the public interest\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 370-71; 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(e)(3) (1976). If no agreements were reached at the end of the designated period, the Commission would itself take appropriate steps to revise the formula. Accordingly, the Commission directed the staff of the Common Carrier Bureau to prepare and submit its proposed method of distribution as soon as possible after the close of that same nine-month period. <em>Id. </em>at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AW1\">A. <em>Western Union's Petitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"ami-dedup-0\">WU asserts in this court no objection to the interjection of competition into telecommunications markets. It does, however, object strongly to the Commission\u2019s failure to equalize the regulatory burdens to which it and Graphnet are subject, and urges reversal of both <em>PMS </em>and <em>Formula </em>on that basis. WU further claims that <em>PMS </em>may be reversed because the Commission failed to explain its inconsistent analysis of the applicability of its <em>Free Direct Access </em>decision to Graphnet\u2019s application, and because the Commission based Graphnet\u2019s PMS authorization on controverted factual assertions without benefit of a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">WU\u2019s latter claims may be briefly considered. WU argues that the Commission\u2019s grant of Graphnet\u2019s application rests on unsupported pleading allegations and that the Commission simply ignored WU\u2019s attempts \u201cto apprise the Commission (1) that Graph-net\u2019s proposed service would be far inferior to the existing service provided by Western Union and (2) that diversion of traffic to Graphnet would cause <em>upward </em>pressure on Western Union\u2019s unit costs (and hence rates).\u201d Brief for Petitioner WU at 33. WU also contends that these \u201cfactual disputes\u201d could have been resolved at the designated hearing which the FCC, \u201c[f]or some unexplained and inexplicable reason,\u201d cancelled. <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">We agree with the Commission that these allegations miss the mark. The Commission was not required to address the \u201cfactual disputes\u201d which WU raises here because Graphnet\u2019s certification did not rest on their resolution. Instead, that authorization was granted pursuant to the Commission\u2019s adoption of an open-entry policy. As the Commission recognized, a rulemaking of this nature may dispose of any need to address the issues of the need for new service, the adequacy of existing service, and the desirability of competitive entry, on a case-by-case basis. <em>PMS, </em>71 F.C.C.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>520-21. <em>See American Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. FCC, </em>539 F.2d 767, 774-75 (D.C.Cir.1976); <em>Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>513 F.2d 1142 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 836, 96 S.Ct. 62, 46 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975). Because the allegations which WU claims the Commission ignored are primarily relevant to the issue of whether multiple entry is desirable, and the Commission has determined that issue in its rulemaking, the Commission is not required to redetermine the issue in the context of Graphnet\u2019s application. If WU wishes to press its allegations further, it must challenge the Commission\u2019s conclusion that a competitive PMTS market is in the public interest, a course it specifically disavows in this proceeding. Brief for Petitioner WU at 21-22. Additionally, because controverted facts did not form the predicate for Graphnet\u2019s certification, the Commission\u2019s cancellation of the hearing previously designated was reasonable. <em>See AT&amp;T, </em>539 F.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">WU also challenges as arbitrary and capricious the Commission\u2019s failure to explain its \u201cinconsistent\u201d action regarding the applicability of the <em>FDA </em>decision to Gra-phnet\u2019s application. In support of this challenge, WU argues that to the extent the Commission\u2019s discussion in <em>PMS </em>implies that a grant of section 214 authority itself renders <em>FDA </em>policies inapplicable, that discussion conflicts with the Commission\u2019s previous statement that <em>FDA </em>provided a separate basis for rejecting Graphnet\u2019s proposal. WU further claims that the Commission\u2019s reliance on the proposition that, if so authorized, Graphnet would operate as a participating carrier with the IRCs on a bona fide division of revenues basis, is inconsistent with its earlier rejection of that arrangement as contrary to <em>FDA.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">In <em>Graphnet Systems, Inc., </em>64 F.C.C.2d 1021 (1977), the Commission cited two reasons for its rejection of Graphnet\u2019s tariff revisions. First, the service proposed therein was a public message service and thus outside the scope of Graphnet\u2019s section 214 authority. <em>Id. </em>at 1023. Second, the offering was apparently contrary to the Commission\u2019s <em>FDA </em>decision. In that decision, the Commission stated, it had held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A768\">that where hinterland delivery was performed by any party other than Western Union, the customer would have to pay the charges for service from the gateway to the hinterland location and that the alternative delivery mode could not be the agent of the IRC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\"><em>Id. </em>Under Graphnet\u2019s proposal the IRC could select either Graphnet or WU for hinterland delivery and, because Graphnet (like WU) would be compensated for its delivery on a division of revenues basis, the charges to the consumer would be unaffected by the IRC\u2019s selection. Thus, \u201cthe IRC would be absorbing the landhaul charge and . . . Graphnet would be the agent of the IRC\u201d \u2014 a result contrary to the Commission\u2019s <em>FDA </em>policies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>In <em>PMS, </em>the Commission recognized that these policies had constituted an independent ground for rejection. <em>PMS, </em>71 F.C. C.2d at 525. It explained, however, that the authorization of multiple entry changed \u201can essential premise\u201d in its analysis of FDA\u2019s applicability. Under an appropriate grant of section 214 authority, Graphnet could, like WU, \u201cpick up, carry and deliver telegrams and telegraph messages ... between the hinterland points and the gateway locations of the IRCs as a <em>domestic telegram carrier.\u201d Id. </em>at 526 (emphasis added). Moreover, unlike the carriers in <em>FDA </em>whose offering and responsibility therefor ran only to the IRC with whom they contracted, Graphnet proposed to \u201caccept responsibility for hinterland pickup and delivery . .. and to offer international service as a participating carrier with the IRCs on a <em>bona fide </em>division of revenue basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527. Since in this context Graphnet would not be an IRC agent, but a domestic telegraph carrier responsible to the hinterland customer, the Commission concluded that its <em>FDA </em>policies were inapplicable to Graphnet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">We find the Commission\u2019s course of action neither arbitrary nor capricious. Although, as indicated above, the Commission did change its position regarding FDA\u2019s applicability to Graphnet\u2019s situation, the basis for that change was carefully stated in the Commission\u2019s <em>PMS </em>discussion. We believe that reference to that discussion readily explains the specific \u201cinconsistencies\u201d of which WU complains, and for that reason find no basis on which to require the Commission to explain each of its previous statements on the issue. We therefore decline WU\u2019s invitation to reverse Graphnet\u2019s certification on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">WU\u2019s final claim encompasses both the <em>PMS </em>and the <em>Formula </em>orders. In that claim, WU argues that this court\u2019s stay order of June 18, 1979, establishes that the Commission\u2019s certification of Graphnet, absent contemporaneous changes in its regulatory scheme, was arbitrary and capricious. WU further contends that the <em>Formula </em>order did not cure the defects of <em>PMS </em>and urges reversal of both orders until regulatory parity is achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">In assessing this claim, we note initially that in its stay order this court observed that WU had a <em>prima facie </em>meritorious claim and directed that the Commission propose for consideration action modifying or terminating certain regulatory requirements imposed on WU. It did <em>not </em>dictate the result the Commission was to reach in that further consideration. We also note that the Commission has in fact provided much of WU\u2019s requested regulatory relief.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> WU contends, however, that the more significant burdens remain. For this reason it challenges the Commission\u2019s deferred consideration and ultimate disposition of WU\u2019s request for exemption from the requirements of section 61.38 of the FCC rules, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.38 (1980), and its refusal either to amend the formula or to make it applicable to Graphnet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">Section 61.38 requires all common carriers to file with proposed tariff changes extensive financial information and market data supporting those changes. In the <em>Formula </em>Notice, the Commission noted the suggestion that these support requirements be simplified or eliminated. It declined, however, to evaluate the merits of that sugges<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>tion in the context of the <em>Formula </em>proceeding. Instead, because tariff support requirements applied to all carriers\u2019 tariff changes, the Commission deferred consideration of the issue to an inquiry \u201cwhich shall properly review the burdens placed on all competitive carriers in the context of their peculiar market situation.\u201d <em>Formula </em>Notice at 2, n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">As promised, the Commission instituted a rulemaking proceeding in which it proposed, <em>inter alia, </em>to relieve \u201cnon-dominant\u201d carriers of some of their section 61.38 obligations. <em>Competitive Common Carrier Services, </em>77 F.C.C.2d 308 (1979). In that proceeding, however, it determined that WU was a \u201cdominant\u201d carrier for purposes of applying the revised regulatory standards, and on that basis denied WU its requested relief. WU claims that this refusal to grant it relief subjects WU to a regulatory burden which others, similarly situated, do not bear. WU\u2019s injury, however, did not arise from the Commission\u2019s decision in <em>Formula; </em>the Commission\u2019s denial of WU\u2019s request for exemption was encompassed in its <em>Competitive Carriers </em>order \u2014 a decision not presently before us. In its <em>Formula </em>decision, the Commission\u2019s only action with respect to the applicability of section 61.38 requirements was a reiteration of its decision to address the issue in another, ongoing proceeding. <em>Formula, </em>75 F.C. C.2d at 373 n.15. Because that issue was in fact addressed, WU cannot claim injury from a failure to <em>act </em>on this petition for relief. The Commission has broad authority to order its own docket.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, WU can only complain of the Commission\u2019s disposition of that petition. As we have stated, such a complaint must be lodged in a petition for review of the <em>Competitive Carriers </em>order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">WU contends that as a result of the Commission\u2019s failure to abolish the formula or, in the alternative, to apply the formula to Graphnet, it remains \u201cexposed to competition from virtually unregulated new entrants\u201d while subject to \u201csignificant regulatory burdens that inhibit its ability to compete.\u201d Brief for Petitioner WU at 23 (footnote omitted). WU further contends that the duration of its injury is indeterminate, claiming that absent some court-provided incentive, the present formula \u201cis likely to remain in effect for an extended period . . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">We find these contentions without merit. WU would have this court assess the reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s action solely in terms of the relief afforded WU. Any action taken with respect to the formula, however, necessarily implicates the relationship of WU with the IRCs and must be assessed in light of <em>industry </em>conditions rather than in the narrow context of the relative competitive positions of WU and Graphnet. When so assessed, the Commission\u2019s actions here must be upheld as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">The Commission\u2019s several deci<em>sions </em>\u2014 Formula, the other orders released that same day, and <em>PMS </em>\u2014 were expected to alter significantly the industry\u2019s market structure and to necessitate concomitant adjustment of the carriers\u2019 interrelationships. As the Commission realized, however, expectations such as these do not provide a sufficiently specific basis upon which to premise the prescription of a new formula. The Commission therefore properly declined to abolish the current formula, providing instead a transition period in which the carriers could initiate the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>market adjustments and thus supply some concrete information upon which the Commission could reasonably act. <em>Formula, </em>75 F.C.C.2d at 370. We do not believe WU suffered unduly from this deferral. Although the Commission did not actually abolish the formula, it did find the present formula not in the public interest. Moreover, it indicated clearly its determination to obtain a formula more responsive to a competitive market structure. If the parties did not provide a sufficient basis for prescription within nine months, the Commission stated, it would \u201ctake appropriate steps to revise the current formula.\u201d 75 F.C.C.2d at 370.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">The Commission\u2019s refusal to apply the formula to Graphnet was also clearly reasonable. Although, as WU contends, that application might have provided the regulatory parity it seeks, equalization of competition is not itself a sufficient basis for Commission action. Instead, as the Commission recognized, it must evaluate that action in terms of the public benefits, as provided by <em>Hawaiian Telephone Co. v. FCC, </em>498 F.2d 771, 775-76 (D.C.Cir.1974). In this instance, the Commission found no public benefits to be derived from an application of the current formula to Graphnet. Since Graphnet, so recently authorized to compete in the PMS market, had as yet shown no capability for exercising the kind of monopoly power the formula was designed to control, <em>id. </em>at 372, application of the formula would have been premature. Moreover, the Commission had found the current formula no longer in the public interest; therefore, its application to a new carrier would only compound the problems purportedly created by the formula\u2019s operation. Finally, although the Commission refused to subject Graphnet to the formula, the Commission stated that it would \u201cnot allow Graphnet to use its possibly greater flexibility to obtain an unfair competitive advantage over Western Union,\u201d <em>id., </em>and indicated as proof of its position its invalidation of portions of contracts between Graphnet and the three largest IRCs. The deleted portions would have allowed distribution of outbound unrouted traffic to those IRCs in proportion to the amount of inbound traffic directed by those IRCs to Graphnet.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 75 F.C.C.2d at 372. <em>See Domestic Public Message Services, </em>73 F.C.C.2d 151, 157-64 (1979), <em>on reconsideration of Graphnet Systems, Inc., </em>71 F.C.C.2d 471 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">In sum, we believe that the Commission\u2019s order in <em>Formula </em>offers WU little ground for complaint. We realize that the Commission refused to \u201cequalize\u201d the competitive situations of WU and Graphnet, either by relieving WU of the burden of the formula or by imposing that burden upon Graphnet. The Commission was necessarily obliged to consider other interests, however, particularly the public\u2019s, and we cannot require their disregard for the sake of immediate regulatory parity. Moreover, the Commission was not unresponsive to WU\u2019s claims. Although it did not abolish the formula, the Commission did find it no longer in the public interest and established a defined transition period preparatory to its expected revision. Similarly, although the Commission did not mandate the formula\u2019s application to Graphnet, it clearly indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>cated that Graphnet would not be permitted to take undue advantage of its relative regulatory freedom. For these reasons we affirm as reasonable the Commission\u2019s actions with regard to WU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">B. <em>The IRC Petitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">In general, the IRCs contend that the FCC\u2019s abandonment of the existing international formula and its proposed substitution of negotiated agreements are unsupported by the record and inconsistent with the congressional intent underlying section 222(e) of the Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We cannot evaluate the merits of these contentions, however, without determining preliminarily that they are ripe for judicial resolution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For this reason we turn first to the parties\u2019 arguments on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">The Commission claims that the IRCs\u2019 complaint is not with its finding that the current formula is not in the public interest, but with its proposal for the replacement of the statutory formula with negotiated contracts. Such a complaint is premature, the Commission argues, because it has not yet finally determined the appropriate mode for distributing outbound traffic. Instead, it explicitly reserved for a further proceeding the prescription of a new formula. In that proceeding the IRCs will have an opportunity to present their arguments regarding the proposal\u2019s lawfulness under section 222(e). If they are aggrieved by the formula actually prescribed, they may then appeal. Until that time, however, the IRCs can claim no injury; the current formula continues to govern the distribution of international outbound traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">The IRCs respond that their challenge is in fact directed to the Commission\u2019s final determination that the current formula is not in the public interest. They argue that the Commission has said \u201call that it will ever say\u201d on the issue and that there is no benefit to be derived from a delay of judicial review. Reply Brief for Petitioner Western Union International at 7. Moreover, the IRCs claim injury from <em>this </em>FCC decision. They allege a substantial interest in the operation of the current formula, asserting that the Commission\u2019s invalidation of that formula creates uncertainty in their business planning. Reply Brief for Petitioner/Intervenor RCA Global Communications, Inc., at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">An accurate assessment of the merits of these contentions necessarily requires reference to that body of principles and policies which constitute the ripeness doctrine. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-12\">[The doctrine\u2019s] basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>a concrete way by the challenging parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">To promote this rationale, the Court articulated a methodology requiring evaluation of \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As both the Supreme Court and this court have recognized, these evaluations are informed, essentially, by pragmatic considerations. <em>See, e.g., FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>449 U.S. 232, 239, 101 S.Ct. 488, 493, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980); <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 43 L.Ed.2d 328 (1975); <em>Papago Tribal Utility Authority v. FERC, </em>628 F.2d 235, 239 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1061, 101 S.Ct. 784, 66 L.Ed.2d 604 (1980); <em>Conway Corp. v. FPC, </em>510 F.2d 1264, 1267 (D.C.Cir. 1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>426 U.S. 271, 96 S.Ct. 1999, 48 L.Ed.2d 626 (1976). Accordingly, they have looked to the order\u2019s \u201cpractical function and consequences in the relevant statutory scheme,\u201d <em>Papago, </em>628 F.2d at 239, and its impact on the \u201cday-to-day business\u201d of the complaining parties. <em>Abbott Laboratories, </em>387 U.S. at 152, 87 S.Ct. at 1517.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">A pragmatic appraisal of the Commission\u2019s finding that the current formula is not in the public interest requires the conclusion that it lacks the requisite characteristics of finality. Under section 222(e)(3), the Commission shall prescribe a new formula for the distribution of outbound traffic whenever it finds, after a full hearing, that the present distribution is \u201cunjust, unreasonable, or inequitable, or not in the public interest.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(e)(3) (1976). Whatever importance normally attaches to this statutory finding, it lacks, in the present circumstances, practical significance. The Commission did not, on the basis of its finding, prescribe a new formula or implement an interim formula. Instead, it established a \u201ctransitional\u201d period. During this period the IRCs and WU will continue to operate under the current formula until the Commission\u2019s \u201cfurther order.\u201d <em>Formula, </em>75 F.C.C-2d at 370-71. The Commission\u2019s finding that that formula is not in the public interest does not, therefore, presently affect the IRCs\u2019 conduct of their day-to-day business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">In light of this appraisal, we believe that immediate review of the Commission\u2019s finding would serve neither underlying interest of the finality requirement. The Commission has indicated that it will soon institute proceedings to provide a mode of distribution consistent with its new policy in this area. Thus, \u201c[o]ur review of the challenged action would interfere with an ongoing administrative process.\u201d <em>Bethlehem Steel Corporation v. EPA, </em>536 F.2d 156, 161 (7th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We find no justification for this interference. As we have noted, they presently enjoy the protection of the current formula and will continue to enjoy that protection until the Commission has finally determined the appropriate mode of traffic distribution. We have no reason to believe that the IRCs will suffer from a prolonged state of uncertainty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instead, the Commission, has clearly indicated its determination to reach a speedy resolution of the formula issues. <em>See Formula, </em>75 F.C.C.2d at 371. Review at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>juncture would, therefore, fail to \u201caccord[] proper deference to the role of the agency in the administrative scheme. ...\u201d <em>Western Union International, Inc. v. FCC, </em>652 F.2d 136 at 143 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Similarly, immediate review would dis-serve the interest in \u201cthe efficient utilization of judicial resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its contemplated proceedings, the Commission will establish a formula on the basis of its assessment of the relative interests involved and the information developed in the actual operation of new market conditions. This determination of the appropriate method of distribution will necessarily require the Commission to resolve the issue of its authority under section 222(e) to replace a \u201cprescribed\u201d formula with one premised on intercarrier contracts. The IRCs will thus have another opportunity to offer the interpretations of the restrictions imposed by section 222(e) which they presently urge in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">It may well be that these proceedings will afford the IRCs the relief they seek. The Commission could determine that section 222(e) does not authorize the contractual arrangements the Commission now contemplates. Similarly, the Commission may prescribe a new formula with which the IRCs are satisfied. The IRCs might then determine that they no longer desire further action by this court. On the other hand, if the IRCs obtain no relief from the Commission\u2019s ultimate prescription, they may then seek judicial review. Moreover, review at that time would be aided by a full record developed in the Commission\u2019s proceeding. The court would have before it the market data and further comments upon which the Commission bases its prescription, the Commission\u2019s interpretation and discussion of the relevant limitations imposed by section 222(e), and, if the Commission finally rejects the current formula, a more detailed explanation of that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Our review of the Commission\u2019s finding at this time would advance neither of the interests underlying the finality requirement. Moreover, deferral of that review imposes no injury upon the IRCs. We therefore conclude that the petitions of the IRCs are presently premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">In an attempt to promote its statutory goals, the Commission has recently taken several steps to create a market structure more nearly reflecting current market realities. While we recognize that these steps have necessarily introduced further uncertainty and awkwardness into the carriers\u2019 interrelationships, we find nothing in the petitions before us which requires our present intervention. The Commission has expressly acknowledged that WU\u2019s altered status necessitates concomitant regulatory change. It has, therefore, taken action to remove many of WU\u2019s unique regulatory burdens, and promises further action in that direction. Similarly, while the Commission has determined that the current formula and the formula\u2019s role require redefinition, it has made no final disposition of the matter. As we stated in Part II B, we find no present justification for interfering with the Commission\u2019s completion of its task. The petitions filed by the international record carriers are therefore dismissed as premature. The Commission\u2019s actions regarding Western Union Telegraph Company on review in these cases are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1217-15\">. Inbound international messages are those communications transmitted from a foreign telecommunications point to a destination in the continental United States. Prior to a recent Commission decision, International Record Carriers\u2019 Scope of Operations in the Continental United States, 76 F.C.C.2d 115 (1980) (hereinafter <em>Gateways), appeal docketed, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. FCC, </em>No. 79-2494 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 14, 1979), if that point was one of five \u201cgateway\u201d cities, the IRCs could deliver that communication directly. If, however, that point was located without the gateways, <em>i.e., </em>in the \u201chinterland,\u201d transmission required, in addition, the services of a domestic carrier. That carrier was always Western Union (WU). <em>See Western Union Int'l, Inc. v. FCC, </em>652 F.2d 136 at 138-139 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1217-21\">.

C.2d at 510, to a moribund market and the need to provide the public with a last-resort service. It noted that the existence of potential entrants . and the availability of services and networks permitting transmission prices well below current WU telegraph rates indicated at least the possibility of profit in the market. <em>Id. </em>at 509, 514. The Commission also observed that the public had clearly manifested its ability to utilize more efficient substitute services and pointed out that traditional public message telegraph service (PMTS) has no intrinsic value. <em>Id. </em>at 515.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">. The Commission stated that by authorizing multiple entry it was removing a \u201csubstantial legal barrier\u201d to Graphnet\u2019s application and explained in some detail why this authorization rendered inapplicable its previous objections to Graphnet\u2019s application under the \u201cFree Direct Access\u201d policies. 71 F.C.C.2d at 525-27. See Int\u2019l Record Carriers\u2019 Scope of Operations in the Continental United States, 40 F.C.C.2d 1082 (1973) (hereinafter Free <em>Direct Access </em>or FDA) and text at 1118-1120 <em>infra. </em>The Commission then observed that because these policy issues had been resolved there was no further reason to hold the hearing previously designated in the <em>PMS </em>Notice. 71 F.C.C.2d at 525 n.53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">.

In making this observation, the Commission referred specifically to its decision in <em>Gateways. Formula, </em>75 F.C.C.2d at 362. The Commission also noted, however, that it had on that same day adopted seven other decisions \u201cwhich affect in differing degrees the provision of international services by communications common carriers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355. These decisions, it stated, \u201cdecrease the monetary importance of the formula and as major structural changes in the industry occur, they will affect the business relationships that have existed in the past between Western Union and the IRCs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">. The Commission found that the percentage of routed messages had actually declined in the years following the implementation of the 1976 formula. 75 F.C.C.2d at 365.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">. The Commission observed that under the current formula a carrier which lowers its prices will not benefit from a proportionate increase in its share of unrouted traffic for at least six months because distribution percentages are recalculated at six-month intervals. <em>Id. </em>at 366. In addition, this lag period might, in some circumstances, extend beyond six months. The Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-15\">If \u201crouting\u201d customers habitually use the same IRC (for reasons of loyalty or ignorance of lower rates from other carriers), these \u201crouting\u201d customers will force the distribution of unrouted traffic in an inefficient manner. Therefore, should any non-price or quality consideration lead some customers to route their message to an IRC which is not offering PMS service at the lowest price, a similar percentage of unrouted traffic will necessarily be awarded to that carrier. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>is, some customers who do not route their messages will be forced to pay an unnecessarily high price because of the operation of the formula.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">.

WU also appears to challenge as inconsistent the Commission\u2019s consideration of FDA\u2019s applicability to Graphnet\u2019s situation. It observes that, in the Commission\u2019s rejection of Graphnet\u2019s tariff revisions, it declared the free direct access issue too important to be decided \u201cas an ancillary matter,\u201d Graphnet Systems, Inc., On Petition for Reconsideration, 67 F.C. C.2d 1043, 1045 (1978), and notes the Commission\u2019s statement in its <em>PMS </em>Notice that the \u201cfull context and implication of that [FDA] issue will be resolved in another proceeding ____\u201d <em>PMS </em>Notice, 67 F.C.C.2d at 1070-71. We believe WU attaches undue importance to these alleged inconsistencies. What the Commission actually stated in Graphnet Systems, Inc., <em>supra, </em>was that the free direct access issue should be addressed directly, \u201cand not as an ancillary matter in a <em>tariff proceeding.\u201d </em>67 F.C.C.2d at 1045 (emphasis added). While the Commission did discuss FDA\u2019s applicability to Graphnet in <em>PMS, </em>it did not undertake to revisit the free direct access issue in that decision. Moreover, it explained that its discussion was required by its public interest findings regarding multiple entry. The Commission stated that it would be inconsistent with these findings \u201cto preserve a Western Union monopoly over one segment of PMTS, hinterland pickup and delivery of messages from the IRC\u2019s gateways ____\u201d <em>PMS, </em>71 F.C.C.2d at 526.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">. In FDA, the Commission rejected tariff filings by the IRCs proposing a free direct access service for hinterland customers.

Under the IRCs\u2019 proposal, however, payment for this cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>tomer usage of these media would be made by the IRCs rather than by the customers. Consequently, the Commission concluded, \u201cacceptance and delivery of international messages will no longer occur at the IRC\u2019s gateway offices, but will shift to the point in the hinterland where the customer is located.\u201d 40 F.C. C.2d at 1086. This elimination of the distinction between gateway and hinterland could not be achieved, as the IRCs proposed, through tariff filings.

In its order the Commission stated its belief that the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>ITT World Communications, Inc. v.
