The state also argues that the district court\u2019s holding is wrong as a matter of public policy. In response the United States argues generally that the evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that the housing project is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>dependent Indian community. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The law underlying the concept of \u201cdependent Indian community\u201d was discussed by this court last year in <em>Weddell v. Meierhenry, </em>636 F.2d 211 (8th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2024, 68 L.Ed.2d 329 (1981), and need not be repeated at length here. In <em>Weddell </em>we concluded that whether a particular geographical area is a dependent Indian community depends on a consideration of several factors. These include: (1) whether the United States has retained \u201ctitle to the lands which it permits the Indians to occupy\u201d and \u201cauthority to enact regulations and protective laws respecting this territory,\u201d 636 F.2d at 212, <em>citing United States v. McGowan, </em>302 U.S. 535, 539, 58 S.Ct. 286, 288, 82 L.Ed. 410 (1938); (2) \u201cthe nature of the area in question, the relationship of the inhabitants of the area to Indian tribes and to the federal government, and the established practice of government agencies toward the area,\u201d 636 F.2d at 212, <em>citing United States v. Martine, </em>442 F.2d 1022, 1023 (10th Cir. 1971); (3) whether there is \u201can element of cohesiveness . . . manifested either by economic pursuits in the area, common interests, or needs of the inhabitants as supplied by that locality,\u201d 636 F.2d at 212-13, <em>citing United States v. Morgan, </em>614 F.2d 166, 170 (8th Cir. 1980); and (4) \u201cwhether such lands have been set apart for the use, occupancy and protection of dependent Indian peoples,\u201d 636 F.2d at 213, <em>citing United States v. Mound, </em>477 F.Supp. 156, 158 (D.S.D.1979), <em>citing Youngbear v. Brewer, </em>415 F.Supp. 807, 809 (N.D.Iowa 1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>549 F.2d 74 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">In the present case the district court applied the above principles in examining the evidence relating to the housing project. Because the facts are not in dispute, our statement of facts is based in substantial part on the district court\u2019s well-reasoned memorandum opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">\n<em>Title to the Land</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">The land where the housing project is located is within the original boundaries of the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation. The Reservation was terminated in 1891, and non-Indian lands were returned to the public domain. <em>DeCoteau v. District County Court, </em>402 U.S. 425, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 43 L.Ed.2d 300 (1975). This parcel was never an Indian allotment, but was instead sold by the United States. The land eventually came into the possession of Saint Peter\u2019s Church of Sisseton, South Dakota, which transferred it to the United States in trust for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe by warranty deed dated July 5, 1969. The deed contained the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-16\">2. The land so transferred by this Corporation will be used exclusively for a Low Rent Housing Project and will not be used for any other purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-17\">3. Any and all land or portion thereof transferred in this deed that is not used within five years from date of deed for said Low Rent Housing Project will revert to Grantor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">The project was constructed within the five-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">\n<em>Purpose of the Community</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8g4\">The housing project originated under a Tribal Ordinance enacted pursuant to the Tribe\u2019s authority to provide for the health, safety, morals and welfare of the Tribe. By this Act, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe established a subordinate body, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Housing Authority (Housing Authority). The stated purpose of the Housing Authority was to remedy the reservation problems of unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and to alleviate the acute shortage of decent, safe and sanitary dwellings for families of low income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Memorandum opinion at 4. The land in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>volved here was leased by the Tribe to the Housing Authority for the purpose of constructing and operating a low rent housing project. The project was built with federal funds obtained through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). <em>Relationship of the Community to the Tribe</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Members of the Board of Commissioners of the Housing Authority are appointed by the Tribal Council, may be removed by the Council for cause and must periodically report to the Council. Further, any future housing planned by the Housing Authority must be planned in consultation with the Tribal government, the Housing Authority must provide minutes of its meeting to the Council, and the Housing Director is considered part of the Tribal staff. In addition, in Article VIII of the Tribal Ordinance, the Tribe agreed that it would not levy taxes on the Housing Authority\u2019s projects, that it would furnish all Tribal services to the Housing Authority and its tenants, and that Tribal codes would be modified to help the Housing Authority\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The Tribe provides a broad range of social services to the project including a senior citizens program, a maternal and child health program, a canning program, buss-ing for Indian students in the project to Sisseton schools, and a Tribal food stamp and commodities program.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Evictions from the project are handled through Tribal court. Until shortly before trial, the Tribe provided police protection for the project.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">\n<em>Relationship of the Community to the Federal Government</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Many of the Tribal programs mentioned in the foregoing section are administered in cooperation with the federal government, through the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Indian Health Service (IHS). Federal concern for the project is shown by other action, such as an agreement entered into by the Tribe, the Housing Authority, IHS, and the City of Sisseton in 1970, under which IHS provided water and sewage facilities to the City of Sisseton for the housing project. IHS also undertook to provide a garbage truck to be used in collecting garbage from the project as well as the rest of Sisseton. IHS maintains a hospital in Sisseton which provides treatment to Tribal members, including those in the project, and all BIA programs on the Sisseton-Wahpeton Reservation are open to Tribal members in the project. The BIA has done road work in the project, in cooperation with the City of Sisseton.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Construction of the housing project was initially financed with money borrowed through HUD pending the sale of notes sold by the-Housing Authority in its own name through HUD. The HUD Office of Indian Programs makes an annual contribution payment to the Housing Authority for debt service and overhead, to make up for the inability of the Housing Authority to collect enough rent to exist on its own. These contribution funds are specifically earmarked for Indian housing. In addition, the Office of Indian Housing makes engineering and architectural services available to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">\n<em>Relationship between the Federal Government and State Government</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">Federal law requires that HUD projects reach cooperation agreements with local governments to obtain the basic governmental services to maintain the project. Reimbursement for these services are made through payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT), and such payments have been made by the Housing Authority for this project. Services provided by the City of Sisseton include snow removal for the streets in the project as well as some street and sidewalk repair. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>The stop signs in the project belong to the City, although the speed signs appear to belong to the Housing Authority itself. While no city street connects with the project, the one road into the project is maintained by Roberts County. The project\u2019s sewer and water services are attached to the City\u2019s service, and maintenance on sewer and water lines at the project is done by the City. Finally, the City provides fire protection, charging the Housing Authority a separate fee for each visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">It is also clear that the residents of the project have some social and economic connections with the City of Sisseton. Shopping is generally done in Sisseton, the Sisse-ton newspaper is delivered to the project, and the telephones in the project and Sisse-ton share the same prefix. Some of the tenants work in Sisseton and all tenants can vote in city elections if they are registered. The children in the project attend the Sisse-ton schools, and the tenants attend school functions. It should be pointed out, however, that the Sisseton schools have received federal funds under the Johnson-O\u2019Malley Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 452-454, to assist the education of the large number of Indian students in the school system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"amy-dedup-0\">\n<em>Composition of the Community</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">The members of the Housing Authority Board, though appointed by the Tribe, are not required to be members of the Tribe. At the time of trial all Board members were members of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Similarly, the Housing Authority does not discriminate in the selection of tenants on the basis of race.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court found that, at the time of trial, four of the eighty-</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">9. three units were inhabited by non-Indians. The court noted that the percentage of non-Indian residents had declined since the project first opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">The district court concluded that, based on the evidence as a whole, the housing project was a dependent Indian community within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">On appeal the state first argues that the entire City of Sisseton, rather than the housing project, is the proper community of reference for determining whether a dependent Indian community exists. In support the state reasons that the project lacks the cohesiveness that is essential to a community because it relies on the city, either directly or through cooperation agreements with the Housing Authority, for all vital services.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">The state further argues that the effect of the district court\u2019s decision is to sanction de facto reestablishment of disestablished reservations which will result in \u201ccheckerboard jurisdiction.\u201d The state argues that this \u201ccheckerboard jurisdiction\u201d will undermine law enforcement efforts and create a potential haven for criminals seeking to avoid apprehension by local and state authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">In response the United States argues that the state did not raise this argument at trial and further that the cohesiveness of the Sisseton-Wahpeton housing project and its residents is clearly demonstrated by the facts established at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">We note that the state did not raise either of these arguments at trial. It is well settled that issues not raised in the trial court cannot be considered by this court as a basis of a reversal. <em>Singleton v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number><em>Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2877, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976), <em>citing Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 556, 61 S.Ct. 719, 721, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1941); <em>Morrow v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>541 F.2d 713, 724 (8th Cir. 1976). In <em>Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. at 556, 61 S.Ct. at 721, the Court explained that the rule is \u201cessential in order that parties may have the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues . . . [and] in order that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence.\u201d The rule is adhered to save in exceptional cases where the obvious result \u201cwould be a plain miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 558, 61 S.Ct. at 722, or \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. This is not such a case. Therefore we decline to consider the state\u2019s community of reference or checkerboard jurisdiction arguments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The state next argues that even if the project is a community, it is not a dependent Indian community for the following reasons: the Housing Authority does not restrict membership in the project to Indians; the continued existence of the project is contingent upon continued HUD financing; the federal government\u2019s only action toward the project was the acceptance of the trust; and state agencies have consistently asserted state jurisdiction over the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The fact that a small number of non-Indians reside at the project does not defeat a finding of a dependent Indian community. \u201cThe test for determining what is a dependent Indian community must be a flexible one, not tied to any single technical standard such as percentage of Indian occupants.\u201d <em>United States v. Mound, supra, </em>447 F.Supp. at 160; <em>see Youngbear v. Brewer, supra, </em>415 F.Supp. 807. Moreover, this court has stated that \u201c[c]ohesiveness or common interests can be more necessary to the existence of a community [within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b)] than can mere density of population.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, supra, </em>614 F.2d at 170. In the present case the district court found that, while the few non-Indians living at the project might be eligible for its services, the main beneficiaries of the project were the members of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe. <em>See United States v. Mound, supra, </em>477 F.Supp. 160. This court does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding and can see no reason why the project\u2019s obligation to accept non-Indians in order to obtain HUD financing would defeat federal jurisdiction over the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\"> The fact that the existence of the project is contingent upon continued HUD financing is irrelevant. As the district court properly noted, all Indian country may ultimately lose that status but that does not mean that while land is within a reservation boundary, or while it is held in trust by the United States, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151 does not apply. The important consideration is what the land in question is now, not what it may become in the future. <em>See United States v. Pelican, </em>232 U.S. 442, 449-50, 34 S.Ct. 396, 399, 58 L.Ed. 676 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">The state\u2019s contention that the only federal government action was the acceptance of the trust is erroneous. The district court specifically found that many of the Tribal programs provided to the project residents are provided under contract with the federal government, through the BIA and the IHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Finally, the fact that the state has asserted jurisdiction over the project does not necessarily defeat a finding of a dependent Indian community. <em>E.g., United States v. John, </em>437 U.S. 634, 653, 98 S.Ct. 2541, 2551, 57 L.Ed.2d 489 (1978). Also, we note that the district court found that the Tribe had provided police protection for the project until the Roberts County Sheriff threatened to arrest Tribal policemen who attempted to enforce laws in the project. Memorandum opinion at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>The district court followed the proper approach in determining whether the Sisseton-Wahpeton housing project was a dependent Indian community under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b). It received evidence as to the nature of the area in question, the relationship of the inhabitants of the project to the Tribe and to the federal government, the established practice of government agencies toward the area, and the cohesiveness of the community. The testimonies of the Tribal Chairman, the legal advisor for the Office of Indian Programs, and the Director of the Office of Indian Programs support the district court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">In affirming the district court we are not expanding the definition of a dependent Indian community to include a particular locale merely because a small segment of the population consists of Indians receiving various forms of federal assistance. <em>See Weddell v. Meierhenry, supra, </em>636 F.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-13\">.

From late 1970, when the project was first occupied, until the state court decision in <em>Man-dan v.
