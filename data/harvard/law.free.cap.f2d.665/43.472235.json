(Ol-lag). Karl Goldman, trustee of the bankrupt, has consistently maintained that the security is a voidable preference under \u00a7 60 of the Bankruptcy Act. At the time of the first appeal, the trustee had so persuaded Bankruptcy Judge Beryl E. McGuire and District Judge John T. Elfvin. This court, however, reversed and remanded the case for further consideration and additional findings. <em>Matter of Ollag Construction Equipment Corp., </em>578 F.2d 904 (2d Cir. 1978). This direction has been fully fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>lowed and the trustee has again been successful, resulting in the appeal now before us. We affirm the judgment of the district court for reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Since familiarity with our prior opinion is assumed, we will not once again describe the facts in detail. It is enough for present purposes to note the following: Ollag, an equipment firm, was one of three corporations controlled by four brothers. The other two corporations were Ollag\u2019s parent, Deplan Contracting Inc. (Deplan), a construction firm and Ollag\u2019s principal source of income, and Sheldon Builders Supply Corp. (Sheldon), which owned the real estate on which Deplan and Ollag were located. In the winter of 1972-73, Deplan encountered financial difficulties, causing-concern to its creditors, principally the Bank and The Travelers Indemnity Company (Travelers). Our prior opinion succinctly described both their interest and what then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Meetings were held to discuss refinancing the stricken business. The principal creditor participants were the Bank and the Traveler\u2019s Indemnity Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d). The Bank held Deplan\u2019s note in the sum of $200,000, collateralized by a security interest in equipment Deplan owned separately from Ollag. It had also obtained a mortgage on Sheldon\u2019s real estate, and payment guaranties from Ol-lag and the Gallos and their wives. Travelers had written performance and payment bonds for Deplan\u2019s projects, and Ollag, Sheldon, and the Gallos had also agreed to indemnify Travelers against liability on these bonds, a fact of which the Bank claims ignorance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">While the discussions continued, the security interest at issue in this case came into being. In February 1973, Leopold Gallo, Ollag\u2019s president, executed at the Bank\u2019s request a chattel mortgage on Ol-lag\u2019s inventory and equipment to serve as security for Ollag\u2019s guaranty of Deplan\u2019s note. The proposed refinancing never occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">578 F.2d at 906 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Thereafter, despite Deplan\u2019s efforts, it was adjudicated a bankrupt in early May 1973. Later that month, Travelers filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against Ollag, which was adjudicated a bankrupt in June 1973. In the prior appeal, we disposed of the trustee\u2019s attack on the Bank\u2019s security interest based upon state law grounds, but we were unable to rule definitively on the trustee\u2019s claim of voidable preference under \u00a7 60. The Bank argued that the trustee had not proved two of the prerequisites of his claim: that Ollag was insolvent when the security interest was given and that the Bank had \u201creasonable cause\u201d so to believe. Concluding that \u201cthere were important factors weighing on the question of Ollag\u2019s insolvency\u201d that had not been considered, we reversed the judgment for the trustee and remanded for specific findings of the value, at the relevant date, of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">(1) Ollag\u2019s physical assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">(2) Ollag\u2019s right of subrogation to the Bank\u2019s secured claim against Deplan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">(3) Ollag\u2019s rights of contribution against Sheldon and the Gallos as co-guarantors of Deplan\u2019s note to the Bank and co-indemnitors on Travelers\u2019s performance and payment bonds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">(4) Ollag\u2019s expected liability to Travelers under the indemnity agreement covering the performance and payment bonds, assuming that liability is established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">Id. at 909. We also instructed that: [i]f the bankruptcy court determines on remand that Ollag had a negative net worth in February 1973, it should then consider whether, with knowledge of all information available upon diligent inquiry into the Gallo enterprise\u2019s affairs, the Bank would have had reasonable cause to conclude that Ollag was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">Thereafter, the bankruptcy judge dutifully complied with this directive, and again found that Ollag was insolvent in February 1973 and that the Bank had reasonable cause to so conclude. The district judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>again affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On appeal, the Bank argues that the lower courts improperly considered certain financial statements of three Gallo brothers, of which more later, and attacks in a number of other respects the findings that Ollag was insolvent and that the Bank should have been aware of it. Were the latter group of issues the only ones before us, we would simply affirm at this point. We pointed out in our prior opinion that \u201cvaluation of contingent assets and liabilities is an arduous task, and on occasions only approximations can be made.\u201d Id. The opinions of the bankruptcy judge and the district judge were careful, thorough and sensible. For example, the bankruptcy judge\u2019s use of liquidation value to measure Ollag\u2019s physical assets was reasonable in view of Deplan\u2019s financial downslide in early 1973, since Ollag\u2019s economic well-being was inextricably linked to Deplan\u2019s. See <em>Mitchell v. Investment Securities Corp., </em>67 F.2d 669, 671-72 (5th Cir. 1933); cf. <em>Kra-vetz v. Joange Building Corp., </em>341 F.2d 561, 563 (2d Cir. 1965). Similarly, the valuation of Sheldon\u2019s potential contribution on the Travelers bonds at $7,500 was also justified due to the outstanding liens on Sheldon\u2019s properties. The Bank offered no evidence to suggest that it had been \u201cduped\u201d into settling for approximately $7,500 to release its lien, nor did it present credible evidence that the liquidation sale of Sheldon\u2019s properties was anything but bona fide. Nor was the bankruptcy court\u2019s assessment of Ollag\u2019s potential liability to Travelers at $274,000 clearly erroneous under the circumstances. And on the issue whether the Bank had reasonable cause to know of Ol-lag\u2019s insolvency, Ollag received ninety percent of its business from Deplan; this should have indicated that Ollag would be in dire financial condition upon its parent\u2019s collapse. A further examination of Ollag\u2019s balance sheet would have revealed the Travelers bonds. This finding, like the others, was not clearly erroneous, especially considering that the Bank is in the business of assessing credit. In short, despite the Bank\u2019s claims to the contrary, we find sufficient evidence to justify the findings of the two lower courts on the issues that were the subject of the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The Bank\u2019s arguments regarding the bankruptcy court\u2019s evidentiary use of certain financial statements require more extended discussion. The dispute concerns statements of three Gallo brothers, which were furnished to the Bank at its request when it was clear that Deplan was in financial trouble. The parties, including the Bank, were then considering a refinancing \u201cpackage\u201d that would include new funds to be loaned by the Bank. In accordance with its usual practice, the Bank required the Gallos to submit current financial statements for themselves and their wives and for the three corporations. At the hearing before the bankruptcy judge, the Bank offered the statements in evidence, presumably to show that Ollag could have obtained contributions from the Gallos on Ollag\u2019s guaranty of Deplan\u2019s note to the Bank. The trustee objected on the ground that the statements were inadmissible hearsay because they were not business records prepared by the Bank itself. The Bank then reworded its offer, introducing the statements not for the truth of their contents but rather on the limited issue whether the Bank had reason to believe that Ollag was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The record remained in this form until this court reversed the judgment of the district court on the prior appeal. When the case then came before the bankruptcy judge on remand, he held no further eviden-tiary hearing, but after argument and briefing made further findings in accordance with this court\u2019s direction. In the course of his supplemental decision, and despite his \u201cembarrassment\u201d at doing so, the bankruptcy judge reversed his earlier evi-dentiary ruling and considered the contents of the financial statements on the issue of the Gallos\u2019 net worth rather than simply on the issue of the Bank\u2019s knowledge. The district court affirmed this ruling. The Bank now argues to us that the changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>evidentiary ruling was unfair and improper and that, in any event, the financial statements were inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">These issues are presented in a rather peculiar procedural posture. The Bank apparently first offered these statements for the truth of their contents. It therefore seems somewhat paradoxical for the Bank to impugn their reliability now. The bankruptcy judge ultimately concluded that he had improperly limited the scope of the statements\u2019 relevance. If evidence is improperly excluded, this court can consider it on appeal. <em>F.H. McGraw &amp; Co. v. Milcor Steel Co., </em>149 F.2d 301, 305-06 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 326 U.S. 753, 66 S.Ct. 92, 90 L.Ed. 452 (1945). Similarly, under the circumstances here, the bankruptcy judge could change his mind about the relevance of the evidence. The Bank claims, however, that widening the scope of the statements\u2019 relevance without affording the Bank an opportunity to rebut their accuracy was unfair and denied it due process. Yet, during oral argument before the district court, the Bank stated that it did not want to reopen the case to contest the statements\u2019 accuracy. The Bank simply wanted the use of these statements to be limited. Having expressly disclaimed any desire to reopen the case, the Bank can not now claim that failure to do so was unfair or denied it due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The Bank also argues that these statements were inadmissible hearsay because they did not qualify as business records under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). This argument must be rejected. Rule 803(6) \u201cfavor[s] the admission of evidence rather than its exclusion if it has any probative value at all.\u201d <em>United States v. Carranco, </em>551 F.2d 1197, 1200 (10th Cir. 1977). Other circuits have recognized that under Rule 803(6) business records are admissible if witnesses testify that the records are integrated into a company\u2019s records and relied upon in its day-today operations. <em>United States v. Ullrich, </em>580 F.2d 765, 771-72 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Carranco, </em>supra, 551 F.2d at 1200; cf. <em>Braunstein v. Massachusetts Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>443 F.2d 1281,1284 (1st Cir. 1971) (pre-Rule 803(6) decision). Testimony here established that the financial statements were on the Bank\u2019s own form, were completed at its request, and were of a type regularly used by the Bank in making decisions whether or not to extend credit. They therefore satisfied the primary requirements of the business records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The Bank nevertheless asserts that this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lieberman, </em>637 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. 1980), requires that the financial statements be excluded because the Bank did not check their accuracy. <em>Lieberman </em>held that a guest registration card could not be admitted for the truth of its contents when the hotel had not verified the guest\u2019s identity. The guaranties of trustworthiness surrounding hotel guest registration are not as great as those surrounding submission of a financial statement. Moreover, verification of a hotel guest\u2019s identity can be quite easily accomplished by checking his personal identification. Here, by contrast, the furnishing to a bank of false information in financial statements is far more unusual and subject to severe criminal sanctions under federal law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (felony punishable by fine of not more than $5,000 or two years in prison or both). Moreover, because verification of financial statements is far more time-consuming, it is essential to ensure their accuracy and reliability through such sanctions. <em>Lieberman </em>is therefore clearly distinguishable, and the absence of verification by the Bank did not render the statements inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">For similar reasons, we reject the Bank\u2019s claim that even if the statements satisfied the primary requirements of Rule 803(6), they were inadmissible because the circumstances of their preparation indicated un-trustworthiness. As previously noted, the Gallos were subject to criminal sanctions if their statements were false. Moreover, the Bank\u2019s theories about the Gallos\u2019 motives to understate their assets as a means of minimizing personal liability seem highly tenuous. Instead, as the district court properly found, the Gallos were, if anything, likely to overstate their assets in order to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>refinancing from the Bank. Any overstatement would favor the Bank\u2019s position in this proceeding. Under the circumstances, the district court correctly held that the statements were not inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
