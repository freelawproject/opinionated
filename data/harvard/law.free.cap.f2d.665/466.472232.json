LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">In a Memorandum and Order of June 11, 1980, the district court found Kenneth and Linda Ambrose individually liable and the corporation, Kenneth R. Ambrose, Inc., liable to the Carpenters Health and Welfare Fund of Philadelphia and Vicinity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter the \u201cFund\u201d) for delinquent fringe benefit contributions due under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Jurisdiction was invoked under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (LMRA)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the district court assumed pendent jurisdiction to consider liability under Pennsylvania\u2019s Wage Payment and Collection Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>noted that due to the close relationship of the Ambroses\u2019 to the corporation they would \u201cmost likely\u201d be considered employers for \u00a7 301 purposes, it is clear that the district court\u2019s grounds for imposing liability, including a 25% liquidated damage award, was the Pennsylvania statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On appeal, the appellants have argued strenuously that the Pennsylvania statute is preempted. We cannot, however, reach the merits of this case because the order appealed from is not final under our recent <em>en banc </em>opinion in <em>Croker v. The Boeing Co. (Vertol Division), </em>662 F.2d 975 (3d Cir. 1981). Therefore, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The facts in this case are not contested and were heard in a one day trial conducted on January 9, 1980. Kenneth and Linda Ambrose are the sole officers and majority shareholders of the corporation, Kenneth R. Ambrose, Inc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The corporation is engaged in the construction business and, apparently, at the behest of the Carpenters Union undertook a job for which it was never compensated. The failure to receive compensation resulted in an inability by the corporation to make contributions to the Fund as required by the collective bargaining agreement. At the January 9th hearing, the corporation stipulated to the entry of judgment against it in the amount of $17,944.75 plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees. This sum represented the total amount owing the Fund. The corporation did not concede liability as to the liquidated damage claim under Pennsylvania law. Similarly, Kenneth and Linda Ambrose denied all <em>individual </em>liability for the contributions owing and the liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Trial was held on the issues of liquidated damages and the individual liability of Kenneth and Linda Ambrose. As noted above, the district court found that, because of the close relationship between the Ambroses\u2019 and the corporation, the Ambroses\u2019 were individually liable for the delinquent contributions. The district court then applied the Pennsylvania liquidated damage clause to both the corporation and the individual defendants. Judgment was entered against the corporation in the amount of $17,944.75 plus $4,486.19 in liquidated damages. The Ambroses\u2019 were assessed $14,747.82 plus $3,686.95 liquidated damages. Liability for the amount of judgment was determined to be joint and several. Finally, the district court awarded the Fund costs, \u201cincluding reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, . . ., to be determined at a later date.\u201d App. at 22. The corporation has appealed insofar as the judgment provides for liquidated damages and the Ambroses have appealed the entire judgment as it pertains to them individually-</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">\n<em>Appealability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">A threshold issue in this case is whether we have appellate jurisdiction to hear this matter. Though neither party has challenged this court\u2019s jurisdiction, we must conduct an independent review as appellate jurisdiction cannot be conferred by the consent of the parties. <em>Richerson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>551 F.2d 918 (3d Cir. 1977). At the time the instant Notice of Appeal was filed on August 12, 1980, for those cases where the trial court had rendered a liability verdict on the main issue but had not awarded a specific amount on counsel fees, there was either confusion or conflict in this circuit as to when an order becomes final and appeal-able under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The gist of the issue is whether a district court order which disposes of the merits of a case is final if it decides entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees but does not fix the <em>amount </em>of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>fees. In <em>Richerson, </em>the district court had entered three orders in the course of the litigation. The first was entered on December 18, 1975, and made findings of fact and conclusions of law resulting in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. It did not reach the issue of entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees nor did it decide the amount, if any, of the fees. Clearly, the December 18th order was not final under \u00a7 1291. 551 F.2d at 921, <em>citing Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wet-zel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976). The second order was entered on March 12, 1976 and it granted the plaintiff\u2019s requested relief \u201cbut did not include provisions respecting attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The defendant filed a timely Notice of Appeal from this order. Finally, on April 29, 1976, the district court ordered counsel fees and expenses to the plaintiff. Both the plaintiff and defendant appealed from the April 29th order. Our court had to decide whether the March 12th order, which decided the merits and relief issues, or the April 29th order which left nothing \u201cto be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined,\u201d was the final order. 551 F.2d at 922, <em>quoting St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Ry. Co. v. Southern Express Co., </em>108 U.S. 24, 28-29, 2 S.Ct. 6, 8, 27 L.Ed. 638 (1883). The court decided that, \u201cthe order of March 12, which left the issue of attorney\u2019s fees unresolved, did not terminate the litigation between [the plaintiff] and the [defendant] and, thus, was not a final order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later in <em>DeLong Corp. v. Raymond International, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 1135 (3d Cir. 1980), at 1139 n.3, our court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aux\">When the district court has determined that a party is entitled to an award of attorney fees but has not yet calculated the amount of the award, the court\u2019s order disposing of the merits of the case is, nevertheless, final and appealable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In the present case, the order appealed from establishes entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees but, as in <em>DeLong, </em>leaves open the calculation of a final amount. Under <em>Rich-erson, </em>the Notice of Appeal would be premature. The advantage with the approach taken in the <em>Richerson </em>case is that it presents the appellate court with a truly final order. The conflict between <em>DeLong </em>and <em>Richerson </em>has been resolved by our court\u2019s <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Croker v. The Boeing Co. (Vertol Division), </em>662 F.2d 975 (3d Cir. 1981) which specifically overrules <em>DeLong. </em>In <em>Croker, </em>Chief Judge Seitz wrote for the court that \u201c[u]ntil the amount of attorney\u2019s fees is set, or a fund from which they are to be awarded is established, litigation over the extent of parties\u2019 liabilities has not been terminated.\u201d At 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Under our court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Croker, </em>the appeal filed in this case was premature and, consequently, we do not have appellate jurisdiction. In accordance with the <em>Croker </em>decision, we will dismiss the appeal. After the district court fixes the amount of attorney\u2019s fees, if any, an appeal will be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Though we can not reach the merits of this case, our decision probably exemplifies the \u201ctroubling result\u201d which Judge Adams recently noted in his concurring opinion in <em>deMouy v. Ingvoldstad, </em>664 F.2d 21 (3d Cir. 1981), when he stated that though \u201cjudicial tidiness has considerable virtues, . . . when applied inexorably it loses much of its attractiveness.\u201d As in <em>deMouy, </em>no 54(b) certification was sought, and the result here may be even more troublesome because on appeal the appellants\u2019 major argument has been that the Pennsylvania statute is preempted by federal law. If appellants are correct, the district court\u2019s future findings on counsel fees may have to again be redone if ultimately it is determined that the liquidated damages awarded pursuant to the Pennsylvania statute would be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">We note that in a rambling answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the defendants raised 25 affirmative defenses. Not a single mention was made of whether the Pennsylvania statute is preempted by federal law. Nor did the defendants brief or argue preemption before the district court judge. Thus, the trial judge was not alerted to the issue of preemption which the appellants have pressed so aggressively before us on appeal. We are mindful of the difficult and busy schedule of a district court judge and of the parties\u2019 duty to bring the relevant issues to the trial court\u2019s attention. Indeed, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>issue of preemption were not jurisdictional, a strong case for waiver could be made on these facts. Because it is jurisdictional, the district court may want to decide the preemption issue and, if there is federal preemption, consider whether the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law can be subsumed within the federal common law of \u00a7 301. We are bound by the rule enunciated in <em>Croker </em>and conclude that the appellants\u2019 appeal must be dismissed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981); <em>de-Mouy v. Ingvoldstad, </em>664 F.2d 21 (3d Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Since the appeal is premature, it will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">ADAMS, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">.

The district court extended \u00a7 301 jurisdiction over the Ambroses\u2019 as employers because of \u201c[tjhe close relationship between the individuals and the corporation....\u201d App. at 20. It did not, however, conclusively decide their liability under federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-23\">.

The oral argument of this case was a week after the <em>en banc </em>oral argument in <em>Croker </em>and of course after oral argument in <em>Croker </em>all of the judges knew what our tentative disposition was on the appealability issue. This case was marked CAV on June 17, 1981 because of the pending disposition of <em>Croker. </em>The <em>Croker </em>opinion was filed on September 30, 1981. The filing of this decision was purposely delayed until <em>Croker </em>was filed so that there would not be even further confusion caused by a possible conflict between a panel decision and an <em>en banc </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
