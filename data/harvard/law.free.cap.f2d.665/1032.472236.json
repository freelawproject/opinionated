We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-12\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-13\">\n<em>The Counts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-14\">The subject matter in interference concerns a particular class of ethylene-carbox-ylic acid copolymers and a process for their synthesis. There are nine phantom counts involved, but the following three are illustrative:</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-18\">\n<em>Count 1</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-19\">A homogeneous, compositionally uniform, random copolymer of ethylene and from about 0.1 to about 35 percent by weight based on the copolymer of an (X, jj-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and crotonic acid, which copolymer has a standard melt flow rate value by ASTM D-123857T in the range from about 0.01 gram per ten minutes at Condition E to about 20 grams per 10 minutes at Condition D. <em>Count 5</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-20\">A copolymer according to Count 3 [wherein the carboxylic acid is acrylic acid] in the form of a thin sheet consisting essentially thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1135-21\"><em>Count </em>7</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-22\">Process of making homogeneous, com-positionally uniform, random copolymers of ethylene and an acid comonomer as hereinafter defined, said copolymers containing from about 0.1 to about 35 percent by weight based on the copolymer of the said acid and having a standard melt flow value by ASTM D-1238-57T of from about 0.01 gram per ten minutes at Condition E to about 20 grams per ten minutes at Condition D by continuously feeding, to a homogeneous reaction mixture in a reaction zone maintained in a steady state at a pressure of at least 1000 atmospheres and a temperature in the range from about 90\u00b0 to about 300\u00b0C., feed materials comprising ethylene, a free radical initiator, and an acid comonomer selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and crotonic acid, said acid comonomer being fed in a ratio of one part thereof to an amount of ethylene in the range from about 10 to about 10,000 parts by weight, copolymerizing ethylene and the acid comonomer in the reaction mixture while thoroughly admixing the reaction mixture in the reaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>zone and maintaining therein the concentrations of ethylene, acid comonomer and resulting copolymer product substantially constant and polymerizing only part of the ethylene and acid comonomer present in the reaction zone, and continuously withdrawing an amount of the whole resulting reaction mixture containing un-reacted ethylene, unreacted acid como-nomer, and the resulting copolymer product from the reaction zone at a rate equivalent to the rate of feeding the feed materials to the reaction zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">Certain terms used to describe the copo-lymers of the counts are highly significant to the present case. According to the record, a copolymer chain characterized as \u201crandom\u201d consists of monomeric units joined together without a set order, i. e., the occurrence of a particular type of monomer (here, either ethylene or a carboxylic acid) is strictly a matter of chance. The record also indicates that in a \u201ccompositionally uniform\u201d copolymer substantially all of the constituent macromolecules have substantially the same chemical composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Unfortunately, the record is not entirely clear on the meaning of \u201chomogeneous.\u201d The Thomson specification states that a \u201chomogeneous\u201d copolymer \u201cis discerned as a single physical phase in solid state.\u201d Yet according to uncontradicted expert testimony,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> copolymers of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids are semi-crystalline, i. e., consist of at least two phases (crystalline and amorphous), and, therefore, cannot be \u201chomogeneous\u201d if Thomson\u2019s definition of that term is strictly applied. Therefore, to avoid an internal inconsistency in the language of the counts, we will interpret \u201chomogeneous\u201d here as denoting polymeric material that does not separate when extruded into phases which are discernable to the unaided eye. We believe this construction is reasonable in light of the expert testimony quoted above in note 3, and is consistent with the ordinary meaning one skilled in the relevant art would lend to the language of the counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"amd-dedup-0\">\n<em>The Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">Thomson, as the junior party, introduced testimony and related exhibits to show an actual reduction to practice of the subject matter of the counts before June 26, 1961, the filing date of the grandparent of Armi-tage\u2019s involved application. To substantiate a prior actual reduction to practice, Thomson submitted pages from various notebooks wherein were recorded the results of test runs made before 1961 with the miniplant (2-liter) and semiplant (50-liter) reactors, in addition to memoranda and progress reports from the same period referring to these runs. The recorded data include the results of physical analyses conducted by an independent laboratory to ascertain, among other properties, the tensile strength, melt index, elongation, low-temperature brittle point, rigidity, hardness and density of the end products obtained from the test runs. However, Thomson present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>ed no evidence of testing prior to 1961 for the composition or homogeneity of the copo-lymeric material produced in either type of reactor. Instead, Thomson relied primarily on testimony by himself and his coinventor Waples, and by two Dow research supervisors, Klumb and Landry, to show that adequate stirring of the polymerization mixture, reflected in the absence of a runaway reaction or a temperature gradient within the reactor, assured the production of random copolymers that were both composi-tionally uniform and homogeneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">The board ruled that Thomson could not sustain his burden of proving that the copo-lymers were \u201cinherently homogeneous and compositionally uniform\u201d without presenting data from contemporaneous tests for these physical properties. In addition, the board gleaned from the testimony of Thomson, Waples, and others evidence that the copolymers in fact did not come within the counts. Specifically, the board looked to three principal areas for support of its conclusion that Thomson had not reduced the invention of the counts to practice before 1961:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-7\">(1) observations that some of the films produced from the copolymer materials contained gels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-8\">(2) reports by Waples that the stirring mechanism in the mini-plant autoclave reactor did not achieve proper back mixing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-9\">(3) a report by Waples describing an extraction test of an ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) copolymer which separated into two fractions with substantially different acrylic acid contents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">\n<em>Evidentiary Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">Before reaching the merits of Thomson\u2019s priority case, we must dispel the apparent confusion over the standard of proof applicable to evidence of an alleged actual reduction to practice. In its opinion, the board stated initially that Thomson had to rely on \u201cthe doctrine of inherency,\u201d since \u201cthe copo-lymers were not tested for homogeneity or compositional uniformity at the time they were made.\u201d Yet the board concluded thereafter that \u201csuch testing is necessary to clearly establish that these properties would inevitably result from the process for making these copolymers,\u201d as required (according to the board) by the \u201cdoctrine of inher-ency.\u201d The board thus presented Thomson with a dilemma: he must invoke the \u201cdoctrine of inherency\u201d since he has no direct evidence of the properties at issue, but he cannot satisfy the requirements for \u201cinher-ency\u201d without such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-15\">A basic error in the board\u2019s approach stems from its premise that the so-called inherency doctrine is applicable here at all. This is not a case where the junior party must demonstrate that the limitation is \u201cinherent\u201d in the explicit teachings of his specification, so that one of average skill would necessarily be led to the invention of the counts by those teachings. <em>See, e. g., Reed v. Tornqvist, </em>58 C.C.P.A. 864, 436 F.2d 501, 168 U.S.P.Q. 462 (1971); <em>Dreyfus v. Sternau, </em>53 C.C.P.A. 1050, 357 F.2d 411, 149 U.S.P.Q. 63 (1966); <em>Brand v. Thomas, </em>25 C.C.P.A. 1053, 96 F.2d 301, 37 U.S.P.Q. 505 (1938). Rather, Thomson must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he <em>actually </em>reduced the invention of the counts to practice, since Thomson\u2019s application was copending with the application which matured into the Armitage patent. <em>Frilette v. Kimberlin, </em>56 C.C.P.A. 1242, 412 F.2d 1390, 162 U.S.P.Q. 148 (1969). A prerequisite element of Thomson\u2019s proofs in this context is a showing by a preponderance of all the evidence, direct and circumstantial alike, that copolymers produced under his direction prior to Armitage\u2019s 1961 filing date satisfied all the limitations of the counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>\n<em>Thomson\u2019s Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Thomson argues that Klumb corroborated testimony by Waples to the effect that adequate stirring was reflected in the \u201creasonably close\u201d temperature uniformity achieved throughout the reactors, indicative of a uniform concentration of catalyst (and hence, a uniformity of reaction rate) conducive to the formation of compositionally uniform, homogeneous copolymers. Thomson also relies on testimony by Landry concerning the absence of decomposition, which would be expected to occur if localized concentrations of catalyst due to inadequate stirring had resulted in a runaway reaction, and consequent pressure build-up, in portions of the reactor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">However, the board emphasized several reports authored by Waples between 1961 and 1963 that contained, in the board\u2019s opinion, admissions of continued problems with mixing in the miniplant reactor. While the statements cited by the board arguably are open to other interpretations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we cannot say that the board\u2019s reading of them is in error. At the very least, the contemporaneous reports weaken the credibility of present testimony on Thomson\u2019s behalf that inadequate stirring was no longer a problem in Thomson\u2019s EAA polymerization system by the time Armitage filed his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">As evidence that the copolymers synthesized under his direction before 1961 met the limitations of the counts, Thomson calls attention to test data in the Thomson patent indicating that the EAA copolymers disclosed therein displayed lower plastic recovery (PR) values<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> than control samples of known, heterogeneous resin blends. Thomson argues that such \u201clow\u201d PR values are the hallmark of homogeneous, composition-ally uniform EAA copolymers generally, and he offers an affidavit by Tandy, a duPont research chemist, in support of this contention. However, in a 1965 report Wa-ples considered whether certain test data indicated that \u201cplastic recovery measurements tell us anything other than molecular weight distribution estimates.\u201d Under \u201cConclusions,\u201d the report states that \u201cplastic recovery * * * <em>may </em>be a key measurement in determining homogeneity of copo-lymer samples.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Apparently, even six or more years after the alleged reduction to practice, the validity of PR measurements as indicators of homogeneity was still a topic of discussion at Dow. This interpretation of the 1965 report finds support in the uncontradicted testimony by Dr. Wunderlich, Armitage\u2019s expert witness, which casts serious doubt on any correlation drawn from the data in the Thomson patent between comparatively low PR values and either copolymeric homogeneity or compositional uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">A similar lack of solid scientific grounding undermines Thomson\u2019s attempt to explain away statements by Klumb and others that films and sheets drawn from Thomson\u2019s copolymers contained gels, evidence interpreted by the board to indicate nonhomogeneity. Referring to other testimony that films drawn from his copolymers were \u201cvery clear,\u201d Thomson urges that this absence of \u201cmilkiness\u201d from the films evidences homogeneity, and that the observed gel particles could have been caused by contamination or oxidative crosslinking in the copolymer product. However, there is no question that the presence of gel particles is associated with nonhomogeneity, and we are not convinced by speculation on alternative explanations for gel formation that the board erred in finding that Thomson\u2019s copolymers lacked homogeneity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>Finally, Thomson characterizes as misplaced the board\u2019s reliance on extraction-test data contained in a 1963 Waples report. These data show that an EAA co-polymer extracted with hexane separated into two fractions, the denser of which comprised some 92% of the charged copolymer. The plastic-rich, denser layer had a substantially higher acrylic acid content (11.2%) than the lighter fraction (4.7%), which included the remaining 8% of the charged resin. Thomson takes issue with the board\u2019s conclusion that the extracted \u201ccopolymer material can [not] be said to be com-positionally uniform * * * since both fractions do not have \u2018substantially the same chemical composition.\u2019 \u201d However, in arguing that extraction of over 90% of the copolymer into a single layer is itself evidence of compositional uniformity, Thomson makes no reference to what one skilled in the art would consider \u201csubstantially uniform.\u201d In this regard, we note Dr. Wunderlich\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that the extraction results summarized above do not correspond to those predicted for a random, composi-tionally uniform EAA copolymer having the same acrylic acid content as the plastic actually tested.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we are not convinced that the board\u2019s finding of substantial nonuniformity, based on the difference between acrylic acid content of the two extraction fractions, is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">We hold that Thomson has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or his co-workers synthesized copolymers of the counts before 1961. Therefore, the decision of the board is affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-15\">.

Dr. Bernard Wunderlich, an authority on polymers who was called by Armitage as an expert witness, testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-7\">A 30 It says here [in the Thomson patent], \u201cBy \u2018homogeneous\u2019 is meant that the copo-lymer material is discerned as a single physical phase in the solid state,\u201d that this I think is a poor definition because the copolymers which are described in the patent are partially crystalline, and partially crystalline means that they consist at least of two phases, one phase being the crystalline, the other phase being the amorphous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-8\">So any of these materials could in the strict sense not be called homogeneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-9\">\u2666 * * sH * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-10\">Q 33 Well, as you understand from reading this patent, the use of \u201chomogeneous\u201d in the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-13\">patent, do you believe that the definition that you have given was what was intended here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-14\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-15\">Q 34 Did you reach an understanding of what you thought was intended?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-16\">A What was intended here is probably that the material is something which will not macroscopically fall apart. It is not quite clear \u2014 this is why I picked on this particular term \u201chomogeneous.\u201d It probably meant that when you put it through an extruder or so, it will still be a mass * * *.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1136-17\">. For example, our interpretation effectively obviates the issue of whether \u201chomogeneous\u201d must be read as <em>\u201csubstantially homogeneous,\" </em>as Thomson contends, since a polymer either separates into discernable phases upon extrusion or it does not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1137-13\">. Since we agree with the board that Thomson did not sustain his burden of proof in this regard, we do not consider whether the record evidences contemporaneous recognition by Thomson of the invention. <em>See Langer v. Kaufman, </em>59 C.C.P.A. 1261, 465 F.2d 915, 175 U.S. P.Q. 172 (1972); <em>Heard v. Burton, </em>51 C.C.P.A. 1502, 333 F.2d 239, 142 U.S.P.Q. 97 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">. For example, in an August 6, 1962 report, Waples stated that an \u201cundesirable flow pattern [in the miniplant] was particularly noticeable when making ethylene copolymers with highly reactive monomers, such <em>as styrene and methyl methacrylate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It is not clear from the report whether Waples was referring to mixing problems encountered with the denoted monomers, rather than with the miniplant generally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">. According to the Thomson specification, the PR value of a polymer is directly related to the increase in diameter of an extruded rod of the polymer as it emerges from a \u201cplastometer\u201d orifice of standard size.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">. Waples testified that the difference in composition between the two fractions could be attributed to the \u201cheat ageing\u201d of the lighter, solvent-rich fraction, which remained in the settling tank of the extraction apparatus longer than the plastic-rich fraction. Since no mention of this possibility appears in the 1963 report of the extraction results, we feel that Wa-ples\u2019 testimony is illuminated by hindsight and cannot be used <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as support for an actual reduction to practice. <em>See, e. g., Clauss v. Foulke, </em>54 C.C.P.A. 1514, 379 F.2d 586, 154 U.S.P.Q. 85 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1139-10\">. Before the PTO, Thomson was denied the benefit of his 1963 application\u2019s filing date. However, the board did not consider the issue of support for the counts in the 1963 application, noting that Armitage\u2019s effective filing date was earlier still and that Thomson, therefore, had to prove a prior actual reduction to practice. Accordingly, the question of benefit is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
