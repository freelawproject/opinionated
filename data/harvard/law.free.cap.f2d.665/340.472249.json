On the facts presented, the Court of International Trade concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the routine ship repairs on board appellant\u2019s oil tanker while it was on the high seas by employees of a Swedish corporation hired for the task were \u201cmade in a foreign country\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1466(a) and that the costs of such repairs were subject to the 50% duty imposed by statute. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">There is no dispute between the parties over the pertinent facts, which can be summarized briefly. Appellant operates the oil tanker T/S MOUNT WASHINGTON, a vessel of U.S. registry. In 1968 the MOUNT WASHINGTON was under charter to deliver oil between various Pacific Ocean ports. During this period, the MOUNT WASHINGTON required certain routine repairs, primarily to the tanker\u2019s electrical generator. Pursuant to a preexisting agreement between appellant and Ni-coverken, AB (Nicoverken), a Swedish corporation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> electricians and fitters employed by Nicoverken were flown from Gothen-burg, Sweden, to the Philippines, to make the repairs on board the MOUNT WASHINGTON. After signing on as crewmen, the Swedish workers began the repairs on March 30, 1968, completing them on May 12, 1968, at a total cost, including labor, transportation, and material, of $11,122.61. In the meantime, appellant\u2019s tanker was within the borders of a foreign country (either the Philippines, Singapore, or Bah-rein) for a total of approximately nine days, the rest of the time being spent at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">When the MOUNT WASHINGTON returned to the United States, docking in Honolulu, the Customs Service assessed duties on the expenses of the repairs made by the Nicoverken employees, including in its computation of duties the expenses incurred by appellant for repairs performed both in foreign port and at sea. When its petition for remission of the duty was denied, appellant brought the present action, alleging primarily that the Customs Service had improperly included in the dutiable amount the cost of repairs performed in international waters and not \u201cin a foreign country,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1466(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">After considering the legislative history of \u00a7 1466, the trial court held that the dutiable amount must include the costs of repairs made both in foreign port and on the high seas. Before us, appellant advances thre\u00e9 grounds for reversing the trial court\u2019s decision. First, as a matter of law, ships at sea and the property on them remain within the country of registry; consequently, on-board repairs to a U.S. registered vessel in international waters are technically performed in the United States rather than \u201cin a foreign country.\u201d Second, well-recognized tenets of a statutory construction and the applicable case law alike require that \u201cforeign country\u201d be given its \u201ccommon meaning,\u201d said to connote a sovereign territory. Third, even if reference to the legislative history is deemed necessary (and appellant does not concede this) the background material on \u00a7 1466(a) indicates only that Congress intended the protection afforded by \u00a7 1466(a) to extend solely to direct competition from foreign shipyards <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">As a preliminary issue, we must decide whether it is appropriate for us now, in construing \u201crepairs made in a foreign country,\u201d to look behind the language of \u00a7 1466(a) to ascertain the underlying congressional intent. In their briefs, the parties have cited case law as authority both for and against the proposition that the phrase \u201cforeign country\u201d has some \u201ccommon meaning\u201d which is more or less divorced from the particular statutory context in which it appears. However, we agree with the trial court that no common meaning for \u201cforeign country\u201d can be abstracted from these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">Moreover, we are not persuaded that <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>60 Treas.Dec. 356, T.D. 45099 (1931), 19 CCPA 415, T.D. 45578, <em>cert. denied, </em>287 U.S. 629, 53 S.Ct. 82, 77 L.Ed. 546 (1932), and its progeny<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> compel the conclusion that a meaning for \u201cforeign country\u201d in \u00a7 1466(a) must be adopted from admiralty law, as appellant contends. In <em>Procter &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>Gamble, </em>the Customs Court (now the U.S. Court of International Trade) had denied a protest of a duty on the value of imported, oil obtained from whales caught in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, and processed on board a Norwegian vessel in international waters. In disallowing protestor\u2019s claim that the whale oil was not imported from a \u201cforeign country,\u201d and therefore was not dutiable under applicable tariff provisions, the Customs Court looked first to legislative purpose, concluding that Congress\u2019 intention to raise revenue on whale oil produced within foreign territorial limits was logically inconsistent with exempting from taxation oil produced on the high seas in a foreign vessel. In support of its decision, the Customs Court in <em>Procter &amp; Gamble </em>cited, among others, authority dating from the previous century to the effect that vessels on the high seas are subject to the jurisdiction of the state to which they belong, i. e., they are in a sense extensions of that state\u2019s sovereignty.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Appellant argues that this latter rationale of the trial court in <em>Procter &amp; Gamble </em>provides a definitive interpretation of \u201cforeign country,\u201d as applied in cases, including the present one, generally concerned with the legal disposition of conduct in international waters. However, appellant has read <em>Procter &amp; Gamble </em>too broadly, and in so doing, loses sight of the trial court\u2019s basic point of reference, congressional intent. Analogies to admiralty law, however appropriate an aid to interpreting another statute under a completely unrelated fact pattern in order to implement a different legislative policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are not necessarily relevant to, let alone binding upon, our deliberations here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In line with the foregoing, we note the statement of Chief Justice Hughes, made in a somewhat different context, that \u201c[t]he term \u2018foreign country\u2019 is not a technical or artificial one, and the sense in which it is used in a statute must be determined by reference to the purpose of the particular legislation.\u201d <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>Chicago Portrait Co., </em>285 U.S. 1, 6, 52 S.Ct. 275, 277, 76 L.Ed. 587 (1932) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must look to the legislative history of \u00a7 1466(a) to discern the nature of the protection which Congress intended to provide, and which we are obliged to effect. <em>See, e. g., Sandoz Chemical Works v. United States, </em>43 CCPA 152, C.A.D. 623 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">The statutory background to Section 466 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (now 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466) was considered in <em>United States v. Gissel, </em>353 F.Supp. 768, 772 (S.D.Tex.1973), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>493 F.2d 27 (5th Cir. 1974). The federal district court in <em>Gissei </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">The Tariff Act of 1930 included within its formal title the following purpose: \u201cAn Act to provide revenue, to regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage the industries of the United . States, to protect American labor, and for other purposes.\u201d 46 Stat. 590 (1930). This statute provides for the imposition and collection of customs duties upon entry of various foreign merchandise into the United States. Since foreign repair parts on vessels were generally thought of and classified as dutiable merchandise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>and since it was Congressional policy to encourage the obtaining of American flag vessel repairs in American shipyards, such repairs were expressly included as dutiable merchandise within a provision of the Tariff Act. The tariff law has contained such a provision in substantially the same form since the enactment of section 23 of the Tariff Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 183 (1866).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The predecessor to the United States Court of International Trade subsequently elaborated the analysis of the <em>Gissel </em>court, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">It is clear that the purpose of section 1466(a) was to protect the American shipbuilding and repairing industry. <em>United States v. Gissel, </em>353 F.Supp. 768, 772 (S.D.Tex.1973), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>493 F.2d 27 (5th Cir. 1974). In addition to noting the Congressional purpose of the statute, in <em>Suwan-nee Steamship Company v. United States, </em>435 F.Supp. 389, 394, 79 Cust.Ct. 19, 26, C.D. 4708 (1977), this court stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ait-dedup-0\">\u201cBoth the hearings of the Senate Committee, and the committee\u2019s final report on section 466, evidence the concern of the committee members that the House amendment would have provided insufficient protection for American shipyards, the class for whose benefit the section was originally formulated. <em>See </em>Senate <em>Hearings on H.R. 2667. </em>71st Cong., 1st Sess., Vol. XVII at 537-46 (1929). S.Rep.No. 37, 71st Cong., 1st Sess. 72 (1929).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>Erie Navigation Co. v. United States, </em>83 Cust.Ct. 47, C.D. 4820, 475 F.Supp. 160, 163 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The trial court, taking its lead from the <em>Gissel, Erie </em>and <em>Suwannee </em>opinions, stated (slip opinion at 17-18):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">That labor was also included in the protection afforded the domestic shipbuilding and repair industries is fully supported by the legislative history of section 1466 and its predecessor provisions. During Congressional hearings on H.R. 2667, which became the Tariff Act of 1930, the report of the House Ways and Means Committee stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">\u201cThe <em>labor cost </em>in production <em>is an essential factor. </em>The average rate of wages abroad is 40 percent or less than that in the United States. While the effectiveness of foreign labor is increasing, their wage scales have not increased in proportion. This creates a serious situation not only for the manufacturer <em>but for the laborer.\u201d </em>H.R. Rep.No. 7, 71st Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1929). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-10\"><em>See also Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, Tariff </em>Readjustment\u2014 <em>1929, </em>70th Cong., 2d Sess. (1929), Vol. XVI, p. 10290. It should also be noted that one of the expressly stated purposes of H.R. 2667 was \u201cto protect American labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Appellant seeks to qualify the trial court\u2019s characterization of the congressional purpose of \u00a7 1466(a), citing \u201cevidence in the legislative history that the Congress intended to protect American labor, but only as a component of the United States shipyard industry.\u201d Accordingly, appellant concludes \u201cthe Congress was concerned with <em>shipyard </em>labor when it enacted the statute. Since the physical facilities of a shipyard are obviously located ashore, the Congress chose physical site of the repairs as the criterion for determining dutiability.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">We find appellant\u2019s argument too narrowly drawn in light of Congress\u2019 clear intention to equalize, by imposition of the prescribed duty, the relative costs of repairs performed by foreign versus domestic labor, in order to encourage U.S. shipowners to employ U.S.' labor whenever possible. It may be true, as appellant asserts, that in \u00a7 1466(a) Congress has struck a balance between competing groups (U.S. shipowners and shipyards, respectively) which represents \u201ca limited circumscribing of the interests of * * * shipowners in favor of * * * shipyards,\u201d and that we should not so construe \u00a7 1466(a) as to upset this balance by unduly burdening U.S. shipowners. Nevertheless, we fail to see how an interpretation of \u00a7 1466(a) that encourages shipowners, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Congress intended, to employ U.S. labor to effect repairs, save in certain well-defined circumstances,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a <em>priori </em>imposes a heavier burden on shipowners than can be justified by reference to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Appellant has urged that the trial court improperly substituted worker nationality for the situs criterion Congress intended should be the touchstone for dutiability. However, we do not read the trial court\u2019s opinion as enunciating so mechanical a test. Rather, the trial court concluded that the legislative purpose of \u00a7 1466(a) would be frustrated if those costs incurred when appellant chose to forego available U.S. labor <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to have routine repairs performed on board by workers hired as a special repair crew from a foreign country were declared non-dutiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">We fully concur in the judgment of the trial court on this point. Appellant availed itself of foreign labor to the detriment of the U.S. workers that Congress sought to protect. Therefore, \u201crepairs made in a foreign country\u201d in \u00a7 1466(a) must be interpreted to comprehend the repairs made to appellant\u2019s vessel in international waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The judgment of the United States Court of International Trade is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\">. <em>Mount Washington Tanker Co. v.

The relevant portion of \u00a7 1466(a) is abstracted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">\u00a7 <em>1466.

More specifically, the Swedish repair team was provided by Nicoverken through its U.S. agent, Wilson Walton International, Inc. of New Jersey, with whom appellant contracted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-15\">. See <em>William Camp Co. v. United States, </em>70 Treas.Dec. 611, T.D. 48623 (1936); <em>Doremus Fisheries v. United States, </em>61 Treas.Dec. 960, T.D. 45642 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b445-5\">. The purpose behind the tariff provision construed in <em>Procter &amp; Gamble </em>wa\u00e1 the raising of revenue. In contrast, the predominant legislative goal underlying \u00a7 1466(a) is to encourage U.S. shipowners to have their repair work done by U.S. labor. See note 8 infra, and associated text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\">. Notably, in upholding the trial court\u2019s judgment in <em>Procter &amp; Gamble, </em>this court strongly emphasized the need to interpret \u201cforeign country\u201d in light of legislative intent; no mention of analogies to other legal principles was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. The issue considered by the <em>Burnet </em>Court was whether taxes levied by the State of New South Wales, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Australia, were paid \u201cto any foreign country\u201d within the meaning of the 1921 Revenue Act\u2019s foreign tax credit provision. Appellant attempts to dismiss <em>Burnet, </em>as well as the other decisions cited by appellee, on the ground that \u201cforeign country\u201d was not considered in any context similar to that presented in this case. Appellant thus overlooks the significance of <em>Burnet </em>and the other decisions as indicators of judicial willingness to adapt the interpretation of \u201cforeign country\u201d to the circumstances and legislative concerns extant in a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">. Congress has indicated quite clearly the circumstances under which duties paid on repair costs may be remitted. For example, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to refund duties paid if the repairs are compelled by stress of weather or other casualty and are prerequisite to the vessel\u2019s seaworthiness, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466(d)(1), or are performed by U.S. residents or regular crewmembers, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\">. Appellant has conceded that American shipyards can perform onboard repairs, in competition with foreign ship-building and repair corporations like Nicoverken.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
