Austin University (SFA) and Dr. Creighton Delaney, appeal the district court\u2019s decision, 486 F.Supp. 663 (E.D. Tex.1980), concerning the non-renewal of employment of Richard Hillis, a nontenured art professor. The district court found that Hillis\u2019 nonrenewal was constitutionally impermissible and ordered reinstatement with backpay against SFA and Delaney jointly and severally. Because the court was clearly erroneous in its factual first amendment findings under <em>Mt. Healthy City School District v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 285-87, 97 S.Ct. 568, 575-76, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Dr. Hillis began teaching at SFA in the fall of 1974. Shortly after the term began he received a note from the head of the Art Department, Dr. Creighton Delaney, instructing him to carry a student, Kelly Perkins, for advanced placement on his class roll in Art 300, and to give her a \u201cB\u201d for the course. Despite Hillis\u2019 reservations concerning this matter there was no discussion of it between him and Delaney until sometime in December. <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">SFA had no specific written policy which authorized Delaney to give an advance placement grade for Art 300. Delaney insists he was acting pursuant to established SFA policy in acting as he did. Hillis states he knew of no such policy and thought it a violation of his academic freedom for Delaney to insist he give a grade to a student whose work he had not reviewed. Our resolution of this case does not hinge on resolving the parties\u2019 dispute over whether an advanced placement policy existed at SFA, because the record demonstrates Hillis\u2019 claim of academic freedom based on the grading incident lacks merit. The district court found that the December discussion became a heated debate, which solidified a rift between the two educators. Whatever might have been the true substance of this meeting, in its aftermath Hillis gave Ms. Perkins a \u201cgrade withheld,\u201d and not a \u201cB\u201d. Several weeks later, Hillis returned from a conference in Washington to find that Delaney had reassigned him for the spring semester from a graduate research course to a freshman design course. Hillis protested the reassignment in a February 4, 1975 meeting with Delaney at which Dr. Rode-wald, an American Association of University Professors (AAUP) member was present. At this meeting, Delaney cited the earlier grading incident as an example of Hillis\u2019 lack of cooperation. The mention of the grade incident prompted Hillis to discover at the registrar\u2019s office that Delaney had changed the \u201cgrade withheld\u201d to a \u201cB\u201d. The next day, Hillis received a letter informing him his contract would not be renewed. Various forms of further protests by Hillis ensued, but are irrelevant in the sense that they could not have formed the basis for Hillis\u2019 nonrenewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">The district court found that Hillis engaged in a number of protected activities, first and foremost being his meeting with Delaney concerning the Perkins grade, and his criticism of the directive. Also found to be among his protected activities was an appeal to the AAUP for representation and relief in the matter of the reassignment, the grading incident, and his protests about these matters. The district court correctly stated the pertinent law: a teacher does not surrender constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression as a condition of public employment, <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). It is also correct that Hillis\u2019 alleged criticism of Delaney did not <em>per se </em>lose its protection merely because it was private expression directed at his superior. <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated Independent School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 415-16, 99 S.Ct. 693, 696-97, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979). However, the record does not support the court\u2019s findings of fact under <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>429 U.S. at 285-87, 97 S.Ct. at 575-76, concerning whether, when, and how Hillis engaged in these \u201cprotected activities,\u201d whether this motivated his non-renewal, and whether he would not have been renewed regardless of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The district court found that Hillis\u2019 non-renewal was substantially motivated by his exercise of first amendment rights. According to the court, this finding was based largely on \u201cDelaney\u2019s testimony\u201d that the \u201cPerkins incident was not \u2018insubstantial\u2019 in his decision to recommend nonrenewal.\u201d In fact, Delaney did not testify to that effect, rather, the statement was attributed to him by Dean Turner. More significantly, testimony that the <em>\u201cincident\u201d </em>was a factor was translated by the court into a finding that Hillis\u2019 <em>criticism </em>of Delaney\u2019s action and SFA policy was a substantial factor in his nonrenewal. This mistake in assessing the proof led to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The Perkins incident unquestionably involved plain insubordination as one component, and arguably included Hillis\u2019 first amendment-protected criticism as another. However, the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony undercuts the court\u2019s finding that the Perkins incident involved the type of criticism which could have been a substantial factor in his nonrenewal. Neither Hillis nor Delaney testified that the December discussion of the grading matter became a heated debate. Rather, Hillis testified that the discussion culminated in an agreement on how to resolve the situation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Hillis testified that he did not protest the grading incident until after the February 4th meeting concerning his reassignment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and therefore the only fair reading of his testimony is that he did not engage in substantial first amendment activity until the February protests. Thus, the testimony by Delaney and Turner that the Perkins \u201cincident\u201d played a substantial part in Hillis\u2019 nonrenewal discussion could refer only to the lack of cooperation displayed by Hillis with regard to Delaney\u2019s instructions and what Delaney thought was a violation of SFA policy. The timing of relevant events as well as their content demonstrate the testimony could not have referred to Hillis\u2019 exercise of any constitutionally protected right to protest or criticize. This did not occur until later.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">The district court rejected Delaney\u2019s testimony that the decision to not renew Hillis had been made in December, and had been based only on Hillis\u2019 lack of cooperation and abrasiveness. The court rejected the testimony as uncorroborated, and possibly fabricated. However, Delaney\u2019s testimony about the timing of the decision to not renew Hillis and the reasons therefor, was corroborated in full by the Dean of the Fine Arts School, Dr. Turner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake in finding that any exercise of Hillis\u2019 first amendment rights was a substantial motivating factor in the nonrenewal decision. <em>In re Multiponics, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 709, 723 (5th Cir. 1980). The trial court\u2019s findings, based on statements attributed to the wrong persons and on obvious oversights of important corroborating testimony, are not supported by the record. This is not a case where the reviewing court would have found otherwise. Rather, it is a case where the trial court could not permissibly have found as it did. <em>Movible Offshore, Inc. v. The M/V Wilken A. Falgout, </em>471 F.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Even if we were to assume that Hillis did exercise his first amendment rights and that his nonrenewal was predicated on that activity, the district court was clearly erroneous in its factual findings under the second prong of <em>ML Healthy. </em>The defendants did show by a clear preponderance of the evidence that Hillis would not have been renewed in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The district court stated that other than the grading incident the only evidence with respect to Dr. Hillis\u2019 conduct concerned his acquisition of a projector light bulb in a manner contrary to university procedures. The court found that nonrenewal would not have occurred as a result of this one incident. Hillis brought a projector bulb from a local store for use in his own projector, and presented the bill to the secretary of the art department. Delaney testified that Hillis had been instructed to follow normal university requisition procedures, and that this method was not in accord with those procedures. Assuming this to be so, Hillis\u2019 actions in flaunting proper procedures furnished another example of his lack of cooperation. More important, however, is the related testimony of Ann Turner, art department secretary, that Hillis flew into a rage as she attempted to explain proper requisition procedures to him. Ms. Turner testified that Hillis\u2019 manner was abusive and that he used filthy language in her presence. Moreover, Ms. Turner stated that Hillis behaved toward her in this manner not just during the \u201clight bulb\u201d incident, but several other times as well. Hil-lis\u2019 abusive, ill-mannered behavior towards a staff member was made known to Dr. Delaney and Dean Turner. This record simply will not permit a facile conclusion that the \u201clight bulb\u201d incident with its explanatory testimony could not establish that Hillis\u2019 employment would not have been renewed regardless of his alleged first amendment activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The district court was also clearly erroneous in finding this to be the only other proof of Hillis\u2019 unsatisfactory conduct. Delaney testified that on one occasion, Hil-lis refused to fill out Government W \u2014 2 forms saying it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to have to do so. On another occasion Hillis complained about not being able to locate blueprint paper in Nacogdoches. Delaney found a source for the paper in Lufkin, and Hillis agreed to pick it up during a trip there. Hillis neglected, however, to pick it up, and thereafter persisted in complaining to Delaney\u2019s secretary about not having it. Finally, Delaney himself drove to Lufkin and picked up the paper. He then noticed that Hillis did not use it for several weeks thereafter. Another example of uncooperative, abusive conduct by Hillis was given by Diane Ford, a library staff person, who testified that Hillis shouted criticism of the graduate program and its students at her in the presence of several students. In Hillis\u2019 supplemental reply brief he seeks to belittle Ms. Ford\u2019s testimony because of her lack of knowledge in art. But, it was completely permissible for the officials at SFA to conclude that the state of Ms. Ford\u2019s erudition should not insulate Hillis from the consequences of his rudeness to her. Delaney also testified that even after being notified of his reassignment Hillis persisted in at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>tending the class from which he had been transferred. Delaney, who had himself taken over the class, was thus put in the awkward position of having to ask Hillis to leave in the presence of the students assembled. A January 20 memorandum from Delaney to Dean Turner describing Hillis\u2019 lack of cooperation, abrasiveness and abusiveness offers further corroboration. It shows that in the context of what was known to Delaney and Dean Turner when the decision was made not to renew Hillis\u2019 employment, the Perkins grading incident was just one other example of unsatisfactory demeanor and attitude on the part of a probationary employee. The preponderance of the evidence showed clearly that Hillis would not have been renewed regardless of his later first amendment activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In sum, the facts of this case and their misapplication by the district court, reflect the concerns voiced by Justice R'ehnquist in <em>Mt. Healthy:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">A borderline or marginal candidate should not have the employment question resolved against him because of constitutionally protected conduct. But that same candidate ought not to be able, by engaging in such conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire on the basis of that record, simply because the protected conduct makes the employer more certain of the correctness of its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">429 U.S. at 286, 97 S.Ct. at 575. Hillis\u2019 nonrenewal was clearly based on his continual lack of cooperation and unacceptable conduct, of which the grading incident was just one example. Hillis\u2019 subsequent protests did not prevent his employer from implementing the decision not to renew his employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The district court\u2019s decision was grounded solely on the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>first amendment analysis. Little mention was made of Hil-lis\u2019 fourteenth amendment due process claims or his asserted rights of academic freedom based in part on the first and ninth amendments. Although Hillis did not specifically assign these omissions by the district court as error, he urges this court to consider them on appeal. We do and find both lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">As a nontenured teacher Hillis\u2019 continued employment was expressly contingent on satisfactory professional performance. He had no legitimate claim of entitlement to or property right in continued employment. <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). His unsatisfactory professional performance and abrasive personality vitiate any possible contractual claim which would form the basis for a claimed deprivation of a fourteenth amendment property right.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\"> Hillis\u2019 procedural due process theory is similarly untenable. A nontenured professor has no constitutional right to a hearing absent a protected property inter-est or liberty interest. <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 576-77, 92 S.Ct. at 2708-09, and Hillis has proven neither. Moreover, under SFA procedures set out in Faculty Handbook No. 7, which governed Hillis\u2019 term at SFA, a hearing before the Faculty Senate for nontenured professors is left to the discretion of a faculty committee. This procedure was followed in Hillis\u2019 case. Hillis\u2019 claims of academic freedom violations received a preliminary review by a faculty committee, the Fine Arts Council. The Council found no violation and therefore a full hearing before the Faculty Senate was not held. Subsequently, the AAUP concurred in the finding that Hillis\u2019 academic freedom had not been violated. The procedural rights Hillis received were constitutionally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">Finally, Hillis alleges that his refusal to assign the grade of <em>\u201cB\u201d </em>to Ms. Perkins was protected by the \u201cfull panoply of constitutional and judicial recognition of the broad principle of academic freedom.\u201d More specifically, he claims academic freedom to be an intellectual right implied by the first and reserved by the ninth amendments. <em>See Keyishian v. Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967). Hillis\u2019 attorneys, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>support of their claim for additional attorney\u2019s fees, claim: \u201cAcademic freedom is an amorphous field about which a great deal has been said in esoteric law journal articles and academic publications, but little determined in explicit, concrete judicial opinions.\u201d This is nearer the mark. While academic freedom is well recognized, e. <em>g. Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 180-81, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972), <em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. at 603, 87 S.Ct. at 683 (1967), its perimeters are ill-defined and the ease law defining it is inconsistent. Its roots have been found in the first amendment insofar as it protects against infringements on a teacher\u2019s freedom concerning classroom content and method. <em>E. g. Regents of University of California v. Bakke, </em>438 U.S. 265, 311-314, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2759-60, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978); <em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. at 603, 87 S.Ct. at 683; <em>NAACP v. Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 338, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963). <em>See also Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 580-82, 92 S.Ct. at 2710-11 (Douglas, J. dissenting); <em>In re Dinnan, </em>661 F.2d 426 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Sterzing v. Fort Bend Independent School District, </em>496 F.2d 92, 93 (5th Cir. 1974). However, the record here fails to establish that the defendants sought to \u201ccast a pall of orthodoxy,\u201d over Hillis\u2019 classes. <em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. at 603, 87 S.Ct. at 683. Hillis\u2019 claim that the refusal to assign a grade to Kelly Perkins constituted a \u201cteaching method\u201d is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">A nontenured teacher may be fired for any reason or for no reason at all but not for the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. <em>Perry v. Sinderman, </em>408 U.S. 593, 597-98, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2697-98, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). Hillis\u2019 only credible first amendment claims related to his criticism of Delaney which the record shows played no part in SFA\u2019s decision to terminate him. He failed to establish any censorship of the content or method of his teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\">. Our determination that the district court erred in its findings of fact makes unnecessary any analysis of the eleventh amendment contention raised by plaintiff. The district court\u2019s eleventh amendment analysis is discussed, however, in <em>United Carolina Bank v. Board of Regents, Stephen F. </em>Austin State <em>University, </em>665 F.2d 553 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\">. Hillis testified that Delaney agreed to have Ms. Perkins submit her portfolio to Hillis for review, prior to entry by Hillis of the \u201cB\u201d grade. If this was Hillis\u2019 understanding of their discussion, it is logical that he made no protest over Delaney\u2019s actions until February when he discovered that Delaney breached this \u201cagreement.\u201d Whether Hillis\u2019 recollection of the December conversation is accurate is unimportant. At the least, in his own mind there was an agreement with Delaney, and therefore no protest was made until weeks later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">. His testimony was: \u201cWhen I went to talk to Dr. Delaney [in February 1975] about being removed from this class ... I don\u2019t think I was protesting the grade business to him at that time, because I don\u2019t think 1 knew that he had changed the grade yet. When he cited the grade as an example of my lack of cooperation .. . that\u2019s when I went to the Registrar\u2019s Office and checked on the grade and found out it had been changed to a B. So, <em>initially, I only protested the removal from the class to Dr. Delaney, </em>but I protested the removal from the class and the grade change to Dr. Turner, Dr. Lewis and Dr. Steen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b652-13\">. Indeed, Dr. Turner responding to a question by the court affirmed that the primary reason Delaney gave in recommending Hillis\u2019 nonre-newal was general lack of cooperation based on several listed specific instances of conduct in addition to the advanced placement incident. Yet, the trial judge apparently discredited most, if not all of Delaney\u2019s testimony. The court found it \u201cironic\u201d that Delaney, who offered so much testimony about Hillis\u2019 misconduct was the person who recommended his nonrenewal. It is not ironic that Delaney recommended nonrenewal \u2014 it is logical. Delaney was Hillis\u2019 immediate superior, the man re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>quired to be aware of Hillis\u2019 performance, and the man responsible for evaluating it. This is the case in most if not all institutional organizations. Moreover, the record contains much probative testimony by witnesses other than Delaney which the trial court for all practical purposes ignored.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
