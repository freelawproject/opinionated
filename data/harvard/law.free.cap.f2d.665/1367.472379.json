JOHNSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1471-18\">The Maxeys<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this action against Freightliner Corporation to recover actual and exemplary damages resulting from the deaths of Billy and Dee Maxey, who were killed when a fuel tank on a truck tractor manufactured by Freightliner ruptured and ignited. Following a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for $150,000 in favor of the Maxey children on the jury\u2019s finding that the fuel system manufactured by Freightliner was defectively designed, but set aside the jury\u2019s verdict for $10,000,-000 in exemplary damages, which was based on the jury\u2019s finding of Freightliner\u2019s gross negligence in designing the fuel system. The district court also set aside the jury\u2019s finding that, by using Freightliner\u2019s product, Billy Maxey had assumed the risk of personal injury. The Maxeys appeal the district court\u2019s order setting aside the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence, and Freightliner appeals the award of $150,000 in actual damages. A divided panel of this Court affirmed the judgment of the district court. <em>Maxey v. Freightliner Corporation, </em>623 F.2d 395 (5th Cir. 1980). Finding that, in light of a recent decision of the Texas Supreme Court, which we are <em>Erie </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark>-bound to acknowledge, it is appropriate to allow the district court to reconsider its decision to set aside the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence on the part of Freightliner, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">On November 21, 1974, Billy and Dee Maxey were en route to Michigan when, while rounding a curve outside of Comanche, Texas, their tractor trailer rig tipped over and skidded to a stop on its right side. The right fuel tank, which was attached to the outside of the truck frame rails, ruptured, spilled its fuel, and ignited. Both Billy and Dee Maxey died as a result of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-5\">Plaintiffs brought this suit, based on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, alleging that the design of the fuel system was unreasonably dangerous, that Freight-liner failed to warn users of the product of this danger, and that Freightliner\u2019s conduct in the design, testing, and sale of trucks with this fuel system amounted to gross indifference, entitling plaintiffs to an award of both actual and exemplary damages under Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-6\">The case was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories, which found in favor of the Maxeys on their claim that the fuel system and tank were defectively designed, and accordingly awarded the Maxey children $150,000 in actual damages. The jury also found that Freightliner was guilty of gross indifference to the rights and welfare . of others in its design of the fuel system and tank, and awarded $10,000,000 in punitive damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury also found, however, that by use of the Freightliner product, Billy Maxey had assumed the risk of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-7\">In a subsequent Order and Opinion, <em>Max-ey v. Freightliner Corporation, </em>450 F.Supp. 955 (N.D.Tex.1978), the district court set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on the issues of gross indifference and assumption of the risk, and entered judgment on the verdict for actual damages. Relying upon <em>Sheffield Division, Armco Steel v. Jones, </em>376 S.W.2d 825 (Tex.1964), and <em>Woolard v. Mobil Pipe Line Co., </em>479 F.2d 557, 565 (5th Cir. 1973), the district court set aside the jury\u2019s verdict for exemplary damages on the ground that Freightliner\u2019s compliance with industry custom failed to evince \u201can entire want of care,\u201d and therefore negated a finding of \u201ca degree of \u2018gross negligence\u2019 which approximates a fixed purpose to bring about the injury of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d 450 F.Supp. at 963, <em>quoting Sheffield Division, Armco Steel Corporation v. Jones, </em>376 S.W.2d at 828. Finding that neither decedent possessed subjective awareness of the defects inherent in the fuel system, the district court set aside the jury\u2019s finding of assumption of the risk. Finally, recognizing that this Court might disagree with its decision to set aside the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence, the district court found that, if exemplary damages were appropriate in this case, the jury\u2019s award of $10,000,000 was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-10\">On appeal, a divided panel of this Court affirmed. 623 F.2d at 395. Relying upon this Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Hernandez v. Smith, </em>552 F.2d 142 (5th Cir. 1977), as well as <em>Sheffield Division, Armco Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>a majority of the panel determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-11\">Under Texas law, there cannot be that \u201cconscious indifference\u201d to the welfare of others constituting gross negligence for purposes of exemplary damages if it is shown that defendant exercised even \u201cslight\u201d care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1472-12\">623 F.2d at 399, <em>quoting Hernandez v. Smith, </em>552 F.2d at 143. Concluding that it was \u201cunable to discern from [a] reading of the record evidence of appellee\u2019s failure to use even \u2018slight\u2019 care,\u201d the panel majority affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to set aside the award of exemplary damages. 623 F.2d at 399. The panel majority also affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that Freightliner\u2019s compliance with industry custom precluded a finding of gross negligence. With respect to Freightliner\u2019s cross-appeal, however, the panel affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to set aside the jury\u2019s finding of assumption of the risk, as well as its entry of judgment on the award of actual damages. This Court voted to rehear this case en banc, <em>Maxey v. Freight-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number><em>liner Corporation, </em>634 F.2d 1008 (5th Cir. 1980), thereby vacating the panel opinion. <em>See </em>Fifth Circuit Local Rule 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-5\">II. <em>The Maxeys\u2019 Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1473-6\">In <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc), this Court established the standard by which both this Court and district courts in this Circuit determine whether there is sufficient evidence to submit a case to the jury in connection with motions for directed verdict and for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto. </em>Under the standard established in <em>Boeing, </em>a motion for directed verdict or for judgment n. o. v. should be granted only when the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that reasonable persons could not arrive at a contrary verdict. The court should consider all of the evidence \u2014 not just that evidence which supports the nonmovant\u2019s case \u2014 but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion. If there is substantial evidence opposed to the motion, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fairminded persons in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motion should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury. A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury. A motion for directed verdict or judgment n. o. v. should not be decided by which side has the better of the case, nor should the motion be granted only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support a jury verdict. There must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question. However, it is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of fact, and not the court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and to determine the credibility of witnesses. 411 F.2d at 374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-10\">As noted in the panel opinion of this case, \u201c[t]he problem, however, lies not with merely stating the rules, but with applying them to a particular set of facts.\u201d 623 F.2d at 398. Moreover, cases brought under federal diversity jurisdiction present the additional task of attempting to correctly interpret and apply state law. Following the issuance on August 8, 1980, of the panel opinion in the present case, the Texas Supreme Court decided <em>Burk Royalty Company v. Walls, </em>616 S.W.2d 911 (Tex.1981), in which that court established a uniform Texas definition of gross negligence, and rejected the \u201csome care\u201d test theretofore often applied by Texas courts in gross negligence cases, as well as by the district court and the panel majority in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1473-11\">\n<em>A. The Texas Standard Governing Gross Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-12\">The availability of exemplary damages for wrongful death is guaranteed by article 16, section 26 of the Constitution of the State of Texas:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Every person, corporation, or company, that may commit a homicide, through a wilful act, or omission, or gross neglect, shall be responsible, in exemplary damages, to the surviving husband, widow, heirs of his or her body, or such of them as there may be ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1474-4\">Almost one hundred years ago, Chief Justice Stayton of the Texas Supreme Court announced the definition of gross negligence that is still controlling today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1474-5\">Gross negligence, to be the ground for exemplary damages, should be <em>that entire want of care </em>which would raise the belief that the act or omission complained of was a result of a <em>conscious indifference </em>to the right or welfare of the person or persons to be affected by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1474-6\"><em>Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Shuford, </em>72 Tex. 165, 10 S.W. 408, 411 (1888) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-7\">Texas courts historically have articulated a number of tests for applying the <em>Shuford </em>definition of gross negligence to the facts of a particular case. Among these is the so-called \u201csome care\u201d test exemplified by the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sheffield Division, Armeo Steel Corp. v. Jones, </em>376 S.W.2d 825 (Tex.1964), in which the court interpreted its earlier decision in <em>Shu-ford </em>to require, as a prerequisite to a finding of gross negligence, that there be \u201can entire want of care\u201d by the defendant, and that defendant\u2019s conduct be such as to approximate \u201ca fixed purpose to bring about the injury of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d 376 S.W.2d at 828. In so holding, the court rejected the notion that \u201cnegligence may be gross, not only when it is evidenced by an entire want of care, but even when the exercise of so slight a degree of care as to justify the conclusion that the party was indifferent to the welfare of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, under the <em>Sheffield </em>rationale, evidence of \u201csome care\u201d by the defendant necessarily precluded a finding of \u201cthat entire want of care\u201d described in <em>Shuford, </em>and likewise prohibited a finding of gross negligence. For this reason, the <em>Sheffield </em>rule is referred to by Texas courts as the \u201csome care\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-9\">In <em>Burk Royalty Company v. Walls, </em>616 S.W.2d 911 (Tex.1981), the Texas Supreme Court recently had occasion to reassess the principles governing gross negligence in Texas, including the \u201csome care\u201d test theretofore often used by Texas courts. In that case, plaintiff brought suit individually and as next friend and guardian of her minor son, against the employer of her deceased husband, seeking exemplary damages for the gross negligence of defendant in failing to follow certain safety procedures while \u201cpulling\u201d wet tubing from an oil well. During the \u201cpulling\u201d process, plaintiff\u2019s decedent became covered with oil that spewed out of the tubing, and the oil ignited, causing his death. The jury found that the failure of Kenneth Swetnam, a supervisor employed by defendant, to follow approved safety procedures was gross negligence, and accordingly awarded exemplary damages. Finding that there was some evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed on this issue. <em>Burk Royalty Co. v. Walls, </em>596 S.W.2d 932 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Fort Worth 1980). On appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, the issue presented was \u201cwhether there [was] some evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Kenneth Swet-nam was grossly negligent on the occasion in question.\u201d 616 S.W.2d at 914. The Texas Supreme Court characterized defendant\u2019s argument as asserting \u201cthat there [was] no evidence of such an entire want of care on the part of Swetnam as would amount to conscious indifference and support an award of exemplary damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 915. Defendant\u2019s argument was based on \u201ca number of cases which hold that if there is \u2018some care\u2019 exercised, there necessarily cannot be \u2018an entire want of care,\u2019 and thus, exemplary damages are improper,\u201d <em>Id., citing, inter alia, Sheffield Division, Armco Steel Corp. v. Jones, </em>376 S.W.2d 825 (Tex. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-10\">The Texas Supreme Court began its analysis in <em>Burk Royalty </em>with both an expansive review of the historical development of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>gross negligence in Texas, and a thorough examination of the Texas decisions defining gross negligence in a variety of ways. With regard to cases arising under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, the court identified three stages of development: an \u201cearly\u201d period, a so-called \u201cactive/passive\u201d period, and the \u201csome care\u201d period. 616 S.W.2d at 917-18. The court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOqS\">It was ... during [the] early period that the first hint of a \u201csome care\u201d test surfaced. In <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Ford, </em>14 S.W.2d 97, 101 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Eastland 1929), <em>writ ref\u2019d, per curiam, </em>118 Tex. 461, 17 S.W.2d 36 (1929), the court said, \u201cThis very act evidencing <em>some care </em>takes the transaction out of the definition of gross negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1475-4\">616 S.W.2d at 918 (emphasis in original). The court noted in <em>Burk Royalty </em>that subsequent cases also used the \u201csome care\u201d test as a method for reviewing challenges to jury verdicts of gross negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1475-5\">The last of the cases applying the active/passive test to gross negligence also introduced the \u201csome care\u201d test into the review of gross negligence findings. In <em>Sheffield Division, Armco Steel Corp. v. Jones, </em>376 S.W.2d 825 (Tex.1964) the court embracefd] the \u201csome care\u201d test while extending the active/passive distinction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1475-6\">616 S.W.2d at 918. Based upon its examination of the Texas cases employing the \u201csome care\u201d test, the Texas Supreme Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1475-7\">[t]he rationale of the \u201csome care\u201d cases is that there cannot be degrees of entire want of care; there is either an entire want of care or there is not. If there is <em>any </em>care, i.e., \u201csome\u201d care, then there cannot be an <em>entire </em>want of care. A thorough search of the appellate decisions of this state has failed to produce a single case in which the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence against an employer has been upheld on appeal under the \u201csome care\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1475-9\">616 S.W.2d at 918-19 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-10\">After examining the Texas cases defining gross negligence in a variety of ways, the Texas Supreme Court held in <em>Burk Royalty </em>that the original definition of gross negligence as stated in <em>Shu ford </em>is the definition to be used in all gross negligence cases. Relying in part upon prior decisions in which the court had declined to apply the \u201csome care\u201d test, <em>Atlas Chemical Industries, Inc. v. Anderson, </em>524 S.W.2d 681, 688-89 (Tex.1975); <em>McPhearson v. Sullivan, </em>463 S.W.2d 174, 176 (Tex.1971); <em>Harbin v. Seale, </em>461 S.W.2d 591, 593 (Tex.1970), the court also expressly rejected the \u201csome care\u201d test, and specifically overruled its pri- or decisions, including <em>Sheffield, </em>which had applied that test. 616 S.W.2d at 921-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-11\">The Texas Supreme Court advanced several reasons in support of its decision to overrule <em>Sheffield. </em>First, the court noted that the \u201csome care\u201d test, by allowing a defendant to overturn a jury verdict of gross negligence by a simple showing that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d that did not support the jury\u2019s finding, improperly reversed the traditional burden under Texas law that a party may overturn a verdict only by showing that there is <em>no </em>evidence in support of that finding. 616 S.W.2d at 921. The court emphasized that, contrary to the long-established principle in Texas that a court ruling on a motion for judgment n. o. v. looks only at the evidence <em>in support </em>of the verdict, the \u201csome care\u201d test required a court to set aside a jury verdict if, looking only at the evidence <em>in derogation </em>of the verdict, <em>i.e., </em>evidence of \u201csome care,\u201d an inference of conscious indifference was negated. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-12\">Second, the court emphasized that \u201c[i]n testing the jury finding of gross negligence, the phrase \u2018entire want of care\u2019 must be understood in the context of the whole sentence. The jury is not simplistically instructed that it must find an \u2018entire want of care,\u2019 but \u2018.. . <em>such </em>an entire want of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>as . . . shows the act or omission was the result of conscious indifference 616 S.W.2d at 922. In so holding, the Texas Supreme Court repudiated the rationale of <em>Sheffield, </em>noted <em>supra, </em>that \u201cthere cannot be degrees of entire want of care; there is either an entire want of care or there is not. If there is <em>any </em>care, i.e., \u2018some\u2019 care, then there cannot be an <em>entire </em>want of care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918. Relying upon its earlier decisions in <em>Atlas Chemical, McPhearson, </em>and <em>Ha rbin, </em>the court emphasized that the essential inquiry is not the degree of neglect, <em>i.e., </em>whether the defendant exercised <em>\u201can </em>entire want of care,\u201d but rather is whether an inference of conscious indifference is raised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-5\">The essence of gross negligence is not the neglect which must, of course, exist. What lifts <em>ordinary </em>negligence into <em>gross </em>negligence is the mental attitude of the defendant; that is what justifies the penal nature of the imposition of exemplary damages. The plaintiff must show that the defendant was consciously, i.e., knowingly, indifferent to his rights, welfare, and safety. In other words, the plaintiff must show that the defendant knew about the peril, but his acts or omissions demonstrated that he didn\u2019t care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1476-6\">616 S.W.2d at 922 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-7\">From the foregoing, it is readily apparent that the court in <em>Burk Royalty </em>did not undertake to establish a \u201cbright line\u201d test for determining whether or not a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes gross negligence. Indeed, it appears that the Texas Supreme Court has rejected just such a \u201cbright line\u201d <em>test </em>\u2014 i.e. the <em>Sheffield </em>test \u2014 for one that demands more rigorous analysis: rather than simply inquiring whether the defendant exercised some care, the proper focus is on the question whether, in light of all of the surrounding circumstances, the requisite mental state is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-10\">As noted <em>supra, </em>the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burk Royalty </em>was announced after the decisions of both the district court and the panel in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Relying upon <em>Sheffield </em>and decisions of this Court interpreting <em>Sheffield, </em>both the district court and the panel majority determined that the Maxeys\u2019 failure to prove an \u201centire want of care\u201d by Freight-liner was fatal to the Maxeys\u2019 claim for exemplary damages. Similarly, the district court also relied upon <em>Sheffield </em>for the proposition that gross negligence, to justify an award of exemplary damages, must approximate a \u201cfixed purpose to injure.\u201d 450 F.Supp. at 963-64. In light of the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent readoption in <em>Burk Royalty </em>of the <em>Shuford </em>definition of gross negligence as the definition to be used in all gross negligence cases, and its determination that \u201cconscious indifference\u201d is the standard by which claims of gross negligence should be measured, we must conclude that the district court\u2019s reliance in the present case on <em>Sheffield </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-11\">This determination, however, does not settle the issue because it remains necessary to decide whether, under the standard of review established by this Court in <em>Boeing, </em>as informed by the substantive principles articulated in <em>Burk Royalty, </em>the jury\u2019s finding of gross negligence may be sustained. Because the parties have not yet been afforded an opportunity to argue the present case in light of <em>Burk Royalty,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and for the added reason that the district court, with its superior familiarity with the case, is in a better position to decide this issue in the first instance, we remand the case to the district court for reconsideration of Freightliner\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. in light of <em>Burk </em>Royalty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>B. <em>Industry Custom</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1477-4\">Because we hold that it is necessary to remand this case to the district court for reconsideration in light of <em>Burk Royalty, </em>it is appropriate to briefly address the Max-eys\u2019 argument that, in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict of gross negligence, the district court improperly relied upon its finding of Freightliner\u2019s compliance with industry custom. Although apparently not holding that compliance with industry custom is an absolute defense under Texas law to claims of gross negligence in all cases, the district court nonetheless quite clearly was of the opinion that Freightliner\u2019s compliance with industry custom negated any such finding in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-5\">The critical circumstance is that to sustain this award one must be prepared to hold that the entire automotive and trucking industry in the United States has ... \u201cacted intentionally or wilfully or with that degree of \u2018gross negligence\u2019 which approximates a fixed purpose to bring about ... injury .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-6\">[Ajdopting a design common to all manufacturers and millions of vehicles for over thirty years is a sufficient effort at safety to preclude a finding that Freightliner acted with an intent which approximates a fixed purpose to bring about this injury-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1477-9\">450 F.Supp. at 964; <em>quoting Woolard v. Mobil Pipe Line Company, </em>479 F.2d 557, 565 (5th Cir. 1973). In light of the fact that no evidence of other manufacturers\u2019 designs was presented to the jury, the district court\u2019s observation is somewhat curious. Similarly, it is not clear how the district court reached the conclusion that the fuel system on the Maxey truck was common to that of \u201cthe entire automotive and trucking industry in the United States.\u201d Although Freightliner elicited testimony at trial indicating that, like Freightliner, no other commercial tractor truck manufacturer located its fuel tanks between the truck rails, or used fuel bladders or fuel cut-off devices\u2014 features incorporated in the Maxeys\u2019 proposed alternative designs \u2014 the district court\u2019s reasoning overlooks the fact that the Maxeys complain of the defective nature of <em>Freightliner\u2019s </em>design, not Freightliner\u2019s failure to adopt the design alternatives proposed by the Maxeys\u2019 expert. Moreover, examination of the pleadings and trial transcript clearly reveals that the Maxeys complain of Freightliner\u2019s design <em>as a whole, </em>including, <em>inter alia, </em>its location of large lightweight aluminum tanks, which were likely to rupture upon impact, within one or two inches of the outermost portions of the truck <em>body, </em>and in close proximity to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>exhaust stack.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Maxeys correctly note that, even assuming that compliance with industry custom could automatically preclude a finding of gross indifference \u2014 a proposition without support in Texas law, <em>see, e.g., Turner v. General Motors Corporation, </em>514 S.W.2d 497 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Houston [14th Dist.] 1974, <em>writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.), </em>and also assuming that the district court could make a finding on this issue, the fact remains that, notwithstanding the district court\u2019s \u201cfinding,\u201d Freightliner did not attempt to prove at trial that the overall design of the Maxey truck was common to that used\u2019 by the \u201centire automotive and trucking industry.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1478-4\">Of course, this Court fully agrees with the premise \u2014 implicit in the district court\u2019s reasoning \u2014 that compliance with industry custom can be relevant evidence tending to negate an inference of gross indifference. Consequently, to the extent that a defendant establishes that certain aspects of its design are common to an entire industry, such evidence may, under <em>Boeing, </em>be considered by the district court when ruling on a motion for judgment n. o. v. as tending to negate a jury issue of gross indifference. In making the inquiry, however, a district court must limit its consideration to evidence actually presented at trial, and must be careful not to preempt the jury\u2019s role under the seventh amendment as the sole finder of fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, absent an indication by the Texas courts that compliance with industry custom constitutes a complete defense to a claim of gross negligence, such proof must, under <em>Boeing, </em>be considered together with <em>all </em>of the evidence when determining whether a jury issue of conscious indifference is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-10\">III. <em>Freightliner\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1478-11\">Freightliner cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s entry of judgment on the jury\u2019s award of actual damages in the amount of $150,000 for the defective design of the fuel system on decedents\u2019 truck. In support thereof, Freightliner argues that the district court erred in setting aside the jury\u2019s finding that, by using Freightliner\u2019s product, Billy Maxey voluntarily assumed the risk of injury. With respect to exemplary damages, Freightliner argues that if the jury\u2019s finding of Freightliner\u2019s gross negligence is reinstated, the jury\u2019s verdict of $10,000,000 is clearly excessive, and should be reduced.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>A. <em>Assumption of the Risk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-5\">With respect to Freightliner\u2019s argument that Billy Maxey voluntarily assumed the risk of injury by using Freight-liner\u2019s product, this Court agrees with the district court\u2019s determination that, under the relevant Texas standard as applied by the <em>Boeing </em>test, the jury\u2019s <em>volenti </em>finding is not supported by the evidence. In <em>Henderson v. Ford Motor Company, </em>519 S.W.2d 87 (Tex.1975), the Texas Supreme Court emphasized that, under Texas law, \u201cthe inquiry is whether [decedent] voluntarily exposed [himself] to the risk with knowledge and appreciation of the danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91. It is not enough that the plaintiff be aware of the defect; \u201c[t]here must be knowledge and appreciation of the particular danger involved so that the plaintiff proceeds to encounter the risk as the result of an intelligent choice.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Moore, </em>401 S.W.2d 789, 793 (Tex.1966). As the panel stated in the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u201c[c]ases in Texas on <em>volenti </em>or assumption of the risk are clear in requiring subjective knowledge and intelligent appreciation of the specific danger involved.\u201d 623 F.2d at 399. Accord: <em>Green v. Edmands Co., </em>639 F.2d 286, 289 (5th Cir. 1981). In the present case, Freightliner made no attempt to prove that Billy or Dee Maxey possessed subjective awareness of the extent of the fire hazard that was presented by Freightliner\u2019s design. In this regard, we agree with the panel\u2019s observation that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-6\">[T]he contention that Freightliner as a national manufacturer of truck/tractors was unaware of post-crash hazards relating to side-mounted fuel tanks, but that Billy Maxey, a truck driver and mechanic with a high school education should be charged with knowledge and appreciation of the nature and extent of the risk is unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1479-7\">623 F.2d at 395. Consequently, we hold that the district court did not err in setting aside the jury\u2019s finding on the issue of assumption of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-8\">B. <em>The Exemplary Damage Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"AgAe\">With respect to its second point, Freightliner argues that if the jury\u2019s finding of gross indifference is reinstated, the jury\u2019s award of $10,000,000, which is approximately 67 times the size of the $150,-000 award of actual damages to the Maxey children, is clearly excessive, and should be reduced. If anything is clear in the Texas law concerning exemplary damages, it is that exemplary damages must be \u201cproportional,\u201d even though this does not mean there must be an exact ratio. <em>Tynberg v. Cohen, </em>76 Tex. 409, 13 S.W. 315, 316-17 (Tex.1890). The court in <em>Tynberg, </em>in language never abandoned, continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-11\">[a] power such as may be exercised by juries in awarding exemplary damages is liable to great abuse, \u2014 may often lead to great oppression; and there is no class of cases in which the conservatism of the judge should more frequently find field for action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1479-12\">13 S.W. at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-13\">The rule has been unwavering. The most frequently cited Texas Supreme Court case of recent years on this issue is <em>Southwestern Investment Co. v. Neeley, </em>452 S.W.2d 705 (Tex.1970), in which the court said \u201cthe amount of exemplary damages should be reasonably proportioned to the actual damages found.\u201d Further, the case of <em>First Security Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Roach, </em>493 S.W.2d 612, 619 (Tex.Civ.App. 1973) <em>writ ref\u2019d n. r. e., </em>shows five factors, in addition to the reasonable proportionality requirement, have been distilled from prior cases to be used in evaluating whether a punitive damage award is excessive: (1) the nature of the wrong, (2) the character of the conduct involved, (3) the degree of culpability of the wrongdoer, (4) the situation and sensibilities of the parties, and (5) the extent to which defendant\u2019s conduct offends a public sense of justice and propriety-</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-14\">This Court has spoken just recently on the reasonable proportional relationship of punitive damages to actual damages under Texas law. In <em>Miley v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., </em>637 F.2d 318 (5th Cir. 1981), we upheld an exemplary damage award that was approximately three times the award of compensatory damages. In doing so, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>Despite the lack of guidance provided by the cited Texas case law, we are by no means forced to apply the four-part Texas test for assessing the fairness of punitive damage awards to churning cases in a vacuum. Although we do not decide what amount of punitive damages, if any, should be awarded in every intentional, business tort case, we feel that a formula of punitive damages equal to three times compensatory damages is a fairly good standard against which to assess whether a jury abused its discretion. While there is nothing magical about the three-times-compensatory-damages formula, many courts which have weighed the kind of factors which comprise the Texas four-part test in awarding punitive damages for intentional, big business torts have selected that figure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">It might be argued that a three to one relationship between punitive and actual damages in an intentional business fraud is not at all related to the proportionality required when the case involves a wrongful death. But the relationship analogy is valuable because it is well established that the purpose of punitive damages is not to compensate those who have felt the loss, but it is instead to create a deterrence to the wrongdoer. <em>Cotton v. Cooper, </em>209 S.W. 135 (Tex.Cr.App.1919); <em>Lubbock Bail Bond v. Joshua, </em>416 S.W.2d 523, 530 (Tex.Civ.App. 1967) <em>no writ. </em>Thus, the amount of money damages is relevant in virtually the same way in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-6\">There is no intention to assert here that three to one is the correct proportion. The Texas Supreme Court has recently upheld a wrongful death exemplary damage award of $500,000 in a case where actual damages of approximately $25,000 were assessed. This is a 20 to 1 ratio. But this was a case of low actual damages and high culpability. In addition, it is highly relevant to the overall posture of the case that the plaintiffs son, seriously injured in the same accident, received $500,000 punitive damages on an actual damage award of $226,000, a ratio of only 2.2 to 1. <em>Alamo National Bank v. Kraus, </em>616 S.W.2d 908 (Tex.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-9\">It is unnecessary to evaluate this case upon all the five factors set out above. But a critical factor in evaluating the punitive damage award in this case is the showing that no other commercial tractor truck manufacturer utilized the asserted safety features incorporated in the design alternatives proposed by the Maxeys\u2019 experts. The degree of culpability of the defendant wrongdoer is one of the specific factors that is to be taken into account under the Texas law governing punitive damage awards. As a result, the wrongdoer\u2019s degree of culpability must be considered on two levels. It must be considered in order to determine whether the wrongdoer was grossly negligent. In addition, and as part of a separate consideration, it must be evaluated in order to determine the appropriate amount of the punitive damage award. While the degree of culpability of the wrongdoer in this case is perhaps sufficient to establish gross negligence under Texas law, it falls far short of justifying an award of $10 million, since the Maxeys\u2019 alternative designs were not employed by any other manufacturers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1480-10\">A particular defendant may not be required under Texas law to bear the burden of a punitive damage award aimed at punishing an entire industry. The proportionality requirement obviously is intended in part to stop this very kind of broad punitive motive of a single jury in a single case. As a result, the district court should circumvent a jury\u2019s attempt to discipline an entire industry by way of the industry\u2019s lone representative in a solitary lawsuit. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the punitive damage award was so excessive as to warrant reversal and reduction under any conceivable interpretation of the Texas law of proportionality and culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-11\">This Court, however, should not suggest the exact proportion or the exact amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>punitive damages because under Texas law this is the responsibility of the trial court. But the district court is entitled to directions from this Court that include a strong and firm disapproval of the amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury, and a reminder of the reasonable \u2019 proportionality and degree of culpability requirements. Inasmuch as the Court is vacating the district court\u2019s entry of judgment n. o. v., and remanding the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Burk Royalty, </em>it is also appropriate to remand this issue for the district court\u2019s reconsideration in light of these directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court awarding actual damages to the Maxey children is affirmed. The district court\u2019s order granting Freight-liner\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. on the jury\u2019s finding of gross indifference is vacated and remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1471-19\">.

The jury awarded no damages to Billy Max-<em>ers </em>parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1473-7\">. The district court in the present case rejected Freightliner\u2019s argument that, as a matter of law, exemplary damages are not available in products liability cases in Texas. The court noted that Freightliner failed to offer any authority, decisional or otherwise, in support of such a rule and noted that \u201c[a]t the least, the availability of exemplary damages in strict liability cases is an open question.\u201d 450 F.Supp. at 961. Moreover, the court noted that the only Texas case to squarely address the issue, <em>Heil Co. v. Grant, </em>534 S.W.2d 916, 926 (Tex. Civ.App. \u2014 Tyler 1976), writ ref\u2019d n. r. e., expressly stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1473-8\">We believe that exemplary damages may be recovered under [Tex.Const. art. 16, section 26] in a strict liability action for the death of the user of a defective product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1473-13\">Although opining that the above-quoted statement in <em>Heil </em>was dicta, and therefore not binding under the rule of <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), the district court in the case <em>sub judice </em>concluded that nothing in Texas law would justify recognition of an automatic bar to awards of exemplary damages in all products liability cases. Absent some reason to believe that the Texas courts, when presented with the question, will erect such a bar to the recovery of exemplary damages, which otherwise are guaranteed by the Texas Constitution, this Court is reluctant to do so. Consequently, we find no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[i]n sum, simultaneous pursuit of actual damages bottomed on principles of strict liability and exemplary damages bottomed on fault concepts are essentially matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>of trial efficiency and presents no true substantive issues.\u201d 450 F.Supp. at 962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1475-8\">. The court noted that, under this approach [t]he burden is thus shifted to the plaintiff to negate the existence of some care.

The Court voted to decide this case en banc without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1476-9\">. Of course, to the extent that the principles announced by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Burk Royalty </em>conflict with the principles announced in <em>Boeing </em>governing directed verdicts and judgments n. o. v. in federal diversity trials, they are binding on neither this Court nor the district court. Federal courts in this Circuit sitting under diversity jurisdiction do not look to state rules governing the standard of review of jury findings, but rather are bound by the principles established in <em>Boeing. See Boeing, </em>411 F.2d at 368. The .extent to which such a conflict may be present in the case <em>sub judice </em>is a matter upon which the district court on remand may wish to hear argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>Freightliner, however, strenuously argues that the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burk Royalty </em>is of no relevance to the case <em>sub judice, </em>because it is clear from that opinion that the court addressed therein only the rules applicable to reviewing directed verdicts and judgment n. o. v. in Texas courts, an issue which, under <em>Boeing, </em>is of no concern to this Court. Consequently, Freightliner argues that this Court should affirm the decision of the district court on this issue. This Court, however, does not see the issue as so simply decided. Freightliner\u2019s argument fails to recognize that if the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s rejection in <em>Burk Royalty </em>of the \u201csome care\u201d test is strictly and solely a matter of Texas procedural law, which is not binding on this Court, then, a <em>fortiori, </em>the \u201csome care\u201d test itself is a principle that this Court is not, and never was, <em>Erie </em>bound to apply. Although this conclusion may be correct, we simply note that numerous decisions of this Court, as well as those of district courts (including both the panel and the district court in the present case) have relied upon the <em>Sheffield </em>rule as the controlling statement of the Texas law of gross negligence. For example, the district court in the present case manifested its understanding of the applicable principles as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-11\">The inquiry is whether there is that complete absence of care as required by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Sheffield Division, Armco Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>376 S.W.2d 825, 828 (Tex. 1964) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1477-12\">450 F.Supp. at 963. Similarly, this Court stated in <em>Hernandez v. Smith, </em>552 F.2d 142, 145 (5th Cir. 1977): \u201cUnder Texas law, there cannot be that \u2018conscious indifference\u2019 to the welfare of others constituting gross negligence for purposes of exemplary damages if it is shown that defendant exercised even \u2018slight\u2019 care,\u201d <em>citing Ballenger v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>488 F.2d 707 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 986, 94 S.Ct. 2390, 40 L.Ed.2d 763. <em>See also Woolard v.

For example, the Maxeys\u2019 design expert testified that if it were impractical to locate the fuel tanks in a place other than outside of the frame rails, which was an \u201canticipated impact area,\u201d the lightweight aluminum used in the tanks on the Maxey truck was \u201cinadequate,\u201d and a stronger material should have been used. T. 359, 362.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1478-6\">. Indeed, Freightliner\u2019s Corporate Service Manager testified that Freightliner itself had once manufactured a truck with the fuel tank mounted directly <em>above </em>the frame rails \u2014 a feature similar to one of the Maxeys\u2019 proposed designs. T. 236. Similarly, Freightliner\u2019s witnesses testified that Freightliner manufactured and marketed both aluminum <em>and </em>steel fuel tanks in its trucks, T. 248, and that a variety of tank sizes were offered. T. 665-67. As noted <em>supra, </em>a principal criticism by the Maxeys\u2019 expert of the Freightliner design was the use of large lightweight aluminum tanks. <em>See </em>note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1478-8\">With respect to the district court\u2019s reference to the <em>automobile </em>industry, we simply note that it requires no special knowledge of automobile construction to recognize that the use of large, unshielded, side-mounted fuel tanks is not a design common to the domestic automobile industry. Indeed, particularly noteworthy is the fact that the only evidence of industry custom promulgated by an established industrial organization \u2014 an industry standard adopted by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in 1955, and by the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety \u2014 requiring a gasoline tank to be capable of withstanding a 30-foot drop onto concrete without spillage, was excluded by the district court.

Freightliner also argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the Maxeys\u2019 recovery on the theory of strict products liability. Without repeating the evidence presented by plaintiffs in support of their claim that the fuel system on the Maxey truck was defectively designed, we note our agreement with the district court and panel that the evidence was sufficient to take this issue to the jury. See 623 F.2d at 399-400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1480-7\">. As has been noted, Freightliner did not attempt to prove at trial that the overall design of the Maxey truck was common to that used by the entire automotive and trucking industry. No evidence of other manufacturers\u2019 designs was presented to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1481-6\">GARWOOD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ajh-dedup-0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-7\">I join in all of the majority opinion except part II. Respecting part II, I concur in the result reached, namely a remand for reconsideration in the light of <em>Burk Royalty Company v. Walls, </em>616 S.W.2d 911 (Tex. 1981), but differ with the majority in that in my view it reads too much into <em>Burk Royalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1481-8\">As Judge Gee\u2019s forceful dissent points out, and as the majority recognizes, although in a diversity case the controlling substantive law is that of the forum state, federal law nevertheless establishes the standard, scope and method of review employed by this court and the district courts in determining whether the evidence is legally sufficient to submit a case or issue to the jury. So, our proper concern with <em>Burk Royalty </em>is whether, and if so how, it changed the <em>substantive </em>law of Texas concerning gross negligence, as distinguished from its rulings respecting the proper standard, scope or method of review of the evidence to determine its legal sufficiency to support a jury finding of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-11\">While I agree with Judge Gee that <em>Burk Royalty </em>makes no express holdings repudiating prior decisions on the substantive law of gross negligence (except as regards the here-immaterial active/passive distinction), I nevertheless believe the opinion in that case does imply some clarification and qualification of the \u201csome care\u201d doctrine as a substantive test for determining whether a given act or course of conduct constitutes gross negligence. Hence I concur in the remand for reconsideration in the light of <em>Burk Royalty. </em>But I disagree with the majority in that, unlike it, I find nothing in <em>Burk Royalty </em>to justify the inference that the Texas Supreme Court <em>totally </em>repudiated or rejected the \u201csome care\u201d test as a matter of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-12\">The substantive law implications of <em>Burk Royalty </em>are a clarification of the \u201csome care\u201d rule and a limitation of its literalistic or mechanical application in two interrelated respects. First, the opinion emphasizes that the \u201ccare\u201d whose presence or total absence we are concerned with is that which reflects on the state of mind of the defendant \u2014 whether knowing the peril he had no, or had some, concern for plaintiff\u2019s safety. [616 S.W.2d at 922: \u201c... that the defendant knew about the peril, but his acts or omissions demonstrated that he didn\u2019t care.\u201d] Second, it indicates that the presence or total absence of such care at any particular relevant time is to be judged from \u201call of the surrounding facts .. . not just individual elements or facts . .. gross negligence need not rest upon a single act or omission, but may result from a combination of negligent acts or omissions, and many circumstances and elements may be considered.... \u201d [616 S.W.2d at 922].</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-13\">In other words, <em>Burk Royalty </em>impliedly rejects a mechanical, compartmentalized application of the \u201csome care\u201d rule in which the controlling legal significance of a particular element of conduct is determined without regard to the entire context of the event and as if the particular conduct occurred in isolation. For example, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>would infer from <em>Burk Royalty </em>that a \u201chot-rodder\u201d driving at night in a manner so consciously dangerous as to constitute gross negligence even if it were daytime is not to be deemed free of gross negligence merely because he has his lights on so that roadside friends can better observe his daredevil heroics. However, one would also infer that if, in the overall context of the event, the defendant does exercise some care with the intent of thereby avoiding injury to persons situated similarly to plaintiff, then he is not guilty of gross negligence notwithstanding the care is but slight and should have been far greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\"><em>Burk Royalty\u2019s </em>only express rejection of the \u201csome care\u201d rule, or of <em>Sheffield Division, Armco Steel Corp. v. Jones, </em>376 S.W.2d 825 (Tex.1964), and other similar cases (apart from their approval of the active/passive distinction), is contained in the statement: \u201c... we disapprove the use of the \u2018some care\u2019 test in determining legal sufficiency points and overrule those cases applying it.\u201d 916 S.W.2d at 922. This reflects a limited, not a complete, rejection of the \u201csome care\u201d rule and the <em>Sheffield </em>decision, especially when read in the context of the earlier statements in this section (entitled \u201cReview of Gross Negligence Findings\u201d) of the <em>Burk Royalty </em>opinion, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aif-dedup-0\">\u201cThe problem in the present case, however, is not so much the definition [of gross negligence] as it is the application of it. We now turn to an examination of our standard of review in cases involving jury findings of gross negligence. Burk Royalty contends here that there is no evidence of gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1482-5\">\u201c... If the jury finds gross negligence, the defendant has the burden of establishing that there is <em>no evidence </em>to support this finding. The \u2018some care\u2019 test utilized in prior workers\u2019 compensation cases improperly reverses that burden. Under the \u2018some care\u2019 test the defendant, instead of proving there is <em>no evidence </em>to support the verdict, would show there is <em>some </em>evidence that does not support the jury finding of gross negligence, i.e. entire want of care. ... Moreover, the \u2018some care\u2019 test does violence to the rule for testing the legal insufficiency of the evidence which requires that only the evidence viewed in its most favorable light and tending to support the jury\u2019s finding may be considered. The jury, .after all, does not have to believe that \u2018some care\u2019 was exercised. When there is <em>some </em>evidence of defendant\u2019s entire want of care and also <em>some </em>evidence of \u2018some care\u2019 by the defendant, the jury finding of gross negligence through entire want of care resolves the issue, and the appellate court is bound by the finding in testing for legal insufficiency.\u201d [616 S.W.2d at 920, 921; emphasis in original; footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1482-8\">Certainly the inference from this language is that the principal deficiency in the \u201csome care\u201d test is its <em>misuse </em>by appellate courts to invade the broad province which Texas law gives to the jury. Moreover, the quoted language strongly suggests that <em>if </em>the <em>jury does </em>believe \u201csome care\u201d was exercised there would be <em>nothing </em>for it to \u201cresolve,\u201d and it should find for the defendant, as then the requisite \u201centire want of care\u201d would be missing. This tends to approve, not repudiate, the substantive proposition that if there is \u201csome care\u201d (properly understood) there cannot be an entire want of care as required for gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-9\">The foregoing is confirmed by <em>Burk Royalty\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Shuford, </em>72 Tex. 165, 10 S.W. 408 (1888), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1482-10\">\u201cIn <em>Shuford, </em>the court again, Stayton writing, defines.gross negligence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1482-11\">\u2018While, in a given case, \u201cordinary care\u201d may not exist, yet there may exist at least slight care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gross negligence, to be the ground for exemplary damages, should be that <em>entire want of care </em>which would raise the belief that the act or omission complained of was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>the result of a conscious indifference to the right or welfare of the person or persons to be affected by it.\u2019 [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1483-5\">\u201cOf the definitions from this period, the <em>Shuford </em>definition is the most cited by \u00abthe Texas courts down through the years and has never been repudiated.\u201d [616 S.W.2d at 917.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1483-6\">\u201cWe have determined that the correct definition of gross negligence is that set out in the <em>Shuford </em>case.\u201d [616 S.W.2d at 920.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1483-7\">The foregoing language from <em>Shuford </em>quoted with approval in <em>Burk Royalty </em>plainly means to contrast the existence of even \u201cslight care\u201d with \u201centire want of care\u201d which is required for gross negligence, and by the clearest of inferences constitutes an affirmation of the inescapably logical proposition that if there is \u201csome care\u201d there cannot be an \u201centire want of care.\u201d That such proposition is more expressly advanced in <em>Sheffield </em>does not mean it is rejected in <em>Burk Royalty; </em>after all, <em>Sheffield </em>relies heavily (and properly) on <em>Shuford, </em>and <em>Shuford </em>is expressly approved, and <em>none </em>of <em>Shuford </em>is questioned, in <em>Burk Royalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1483-8\">The emphasis in <em>Burk Royalty </em>on the state of mind of the defendant is fully consistent with the foregoing. A defendant who, intending to thereby avoid injury to others, takes \u201csome\u201d precaution is not \u201cindifferent\u201d to the welfare of others; perhaps his concern is only slight and nowhere near as great as it should be, but it is not indifference. <em>Burk Royalty </em>states it must be shown \u201cthat the defendant knew about the peril, but his acts or omissions demonstrated that he didn\u2019t care.\u201d [616 S.W.2d at 922.] If the defendant\u2019s acts demonstrated that he had <em>some </em>concern, that he cared <em>some, </em>it cannot logically be said that \u201che didn\u2019t care,\u201d notwithstanding that he should have cared much <em>more.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1483-9\">Accordingly, I cannot agree with the statement in the majority opinion that <em>Burk Royalty </em>\u201crepudiated the rationale of <em>Sheffield ... </em>that there cannot be degrees of entire want of care; there is either an entire want of care or there is not. If there is any care, i.e., \u2018some\u2019 care, then there cannot be an <em>entire </em>want of care.\u201d <em>Nothing </em>in <em>Burk Royalty </em>says that a defendant, who <em>in fact </em>at the relevant time exercises some care, in light of all the circumstances, intending to thereby avoid injury to others, can nevertheless be guilty of gross negligence. Similarly, the majority speaks too broadly when it says that <em>Burk Royalty </em>\u201cexpressly rejected the \u2018some care\u2019 test.\u201d The only express rejection was as to the use of that test \u201cin determining legal sufficiency points,\u201d where the <em>Burk Royalty </em>majority felt it previously had been improperly used to afford a broader scope of review of jury findings in certain gross negligence cases than in other cases. Insofar as- <em>Burk Royalty </em>implies changes in the substantive law of gross negligence, these certainly do not amount to a complete rejection or abandonment of the \u201csome care\u201d test, as such would clearly be inconsistent with <em>Shuford </em>on which <em>Burk Royalty </em>so heavily relies. Rather, what <em>Burk Royalty </em>implies as to substantive law is a clarification and qualification of the \u201csome care\u201d rule to avoid its application in a mechanical, compartmentalized fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-11\">I also find myself in disagreement with that portion of the majority opinion which suggests <em>Burk Royalty </em>has inferentially disapproved the proposition, based on <em>Sheffield, </em>\u201cthat gross negligence, to justify an award of exemplary damages, must approximate a \u2018fixed purpose to injure.\u2019 \u201d I find <em>nothing </em>in <em>Burk Royalty </em>which indicates the slightest intention to make any change in the prior law insofar as concerns the degree or character of wrongfulness of state of mind required for gross negligence. To the contrary, <em>Burk Royalty\u2019s </em>emphasis is on wrongful state of mind as being the thing which \u201cjustifies the <em>penal </em>nature of the imposition of exemplary damages.\u201d [616 S.W.2d at 922; emphasis added.] Certainly <em>Burk Royalty </em>does not disapprove <em>everything </em>in <em>Sheffield, </em>for <em>Sheffield </em>largely relies on and quotes from <em>Shuford, </em>which <em>Burk Royalty </em>expressly approves. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>it must be noted that the <em>only </em>authority cited by <em>Shuford </em>[10 S.W. 408 at 411] for its gross negligence holding (and its much quoted definition) is <em>Cotton Press v. Bradley, </em>52 Tex. 587 (1880). <em>Cotton Press </em>is cited and quoted from, with no hint of disapproval in any respect, in <em>Burk Royalty </em>[616 S.W.2d at 916]; and the <em>Cotton Press </em>language so quoted includes that describing the required \u201cconscious indifference\u201d as being that which \u201cis morally criminal\u201d and \u201cshould reach the borderline of a quasi-criminal act.\u201d Had the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Bdrk Royalty </em>intended to change the substantive law of gross negligence by watering down the required wrongfulness of the defendant\u2019s state of mind the opinion would surely have said so. It does not. This court should not do so in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-4\">Finally, the majority opinion, citing only <em>Turner v. General Motors Corporation, </em>514 S.W.2d 497 (Tex.Civ.App.1974, n. r. e.), implies that Texas courts have held that compliance with industry custom in respect to the complained of conduct does not necessarily preclude a finding that the industry member is grossly negligent in such regard. As the majority opinion holds there is no evidence, nor any jury finding, that the defendant here complied with industry custom, it would not appear necessary to address the issue. If it is to be addressed, I believe it should be pointed out that in <em>Turner </em>the suit was on simple negligence (and strict liability), and the opinion does not even mention gross negligence. For its industry custom holding [514 S.W.2d at 506, 507], <em>Turner </em>relies solely on <em>Brown v. Lundell, </em>162 Tex. 84, 344 S.W.2d 863 (Tex.1961). <em>Brown, </em>like <em>Turner, </em>deals only with ordinary negligence and makes no mention of gross negligence. Since gross negligence, unlike simple negligence, requires an entire want of care and a consciously wrongful state of mind, holdings in ordinary negligence cases are not necessarily controlling. I am aware of no Texas case which holds that an industry member may be found grossly negligent on account of conduct which is taken in knowing compliance with industry custom. Certainly nothing in <em>Burk Royalty </em>touches on this point. The more accurate statement would be that Texas courts have not authoritatively spoken to the effect in gross negligence cases of an industry member\u2019s compliance with industry custom in respect to the complained of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-6\">While I was privileged to sit on the Texas Supreme Court when the writ of error was granted in <em>Burk Royalty </em>and thereafter when the case was argued, though not when the opinion was handed down, I plead no special competence on such account. I believe a fair reading of the opinions in <em>Burk Royalty </em>does not justify certain of the interpretations which the majority has given to that decision. The majority finds more in it than is either expressly supported by or reasonably inferable from the text.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1482-6\">.

Our panel affirmed. In order for today\u2019s <em>en banc </em>majority to achieve its reversal of both, therefore, it was necessary for it to find an authority altering these precedents. In my view, it mistakenly believes that it has done so in <em>Burk Royalty Co. v. Walls, </em>616 S.W.2d 911 (Tex.1981), a decision handed down after the panel decision. As I shall attempt to demonstrate, that opinion endorsed and reaffirmed the Texas substantive law upon which our trial court proceeded and furnishes no occasion for reversing its judgment. The sole innovation of <em>Burk Royalty </em>is one immaterial to this appeal: an alteration in state appellate procedures that does not and could not affect ours in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-9\">For all purposes relevant here, Texas courts are the masters of Texas substantive law: where they lay it down we must follow. State courts \u2014 even those of Texas\u2014 are not, however, at liberty to alter federal appellate procedures or to overrule our <em>en </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number><em>banc </em>decision in <em>Boeing v.

That a showing of \u201csome care\u201d is a complete defense to a claim of gross negligence was and is thought by Texas courts to be necessarily implied by the <em>Shuford </em>definition of gross negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1485-7\">While, in a given case, \u201cordinary care\u201d may not exist, yet there may exist at least slight care. Gross negligence, to be the ground for exemplary damages, should be that <em>entire want of care </em>which would raise the belief that the act or omission complained of was the result of a conscious indifference to the right or welfare of the person or persons to be affected by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1485-8\"><em>Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Shuford, </em>72 Tex. 165, 10 S.W. 408, 411 (1888) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Under this definition, where the <em>trier of fact </em>finds slight or \u201csome care,\u201d the requisite \u201centire want of care\u201d is necessarily lacking, and a corollary finding of gross negligence \u2014 defined as an <em>entire </em>want of care \u2014 is logically impossible. Such was and is the substantive law of Texas: \u201cWe have determined that the correct definition of gross negligence is that set out in the <em>Shuford </em>case.\u201d <em>Burk Royalty Co. v. Walls, </em>616 S.W.2d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-13\">A cognate procedural rule developed in Texas as to appellate review of verdicts in gross negligence cases. In time past, Texas appellate courts, finding record evidence of \u201csome care,\u201d refused to sustain verdicts of gross negligence. <em>See, e.g., Loyd Electric Co. </em>v. <em>DeHoyos, </em>409 S.W.2d 893, 896 (Tex. Civ.App. \u2014 San Antonio 1966, writ ref\u2019d). Logically, this mode of review was an anomaly in Texas appellate procedure, since it long has been and now is the general Texas rule that in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to support, as a matter of law, a jury verdict \u2014 the so-called \u201cno evidence\u201d issue \u2014 Texas appellate courts consider \u201conly the evidence viewed in its most favorable light and tending to support the jury\u2019s finding . .. . \u201d <em>Burk Royalty Co. v. Walls, </em>616 S.W.2d at 921.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was this anomaly, and it only, that the Texas Supreme Court disposed of in <em>Burk Royalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1485-14\">II. <em>The Holdings of Burk Royalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1485-15\"><em>Burk Royalty </em>reaffirmed the substantive definition of <em>Shuford, id. </em>at 920, but struck down the \u201csome care\u201d procedural rule, substituting the standard Texas \u201cno evidence\u201d mode of review, <em>id. </em>at 922 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so doing, it simply held that in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to support a jury verdict of gross negligence Texas courts should look only to evidence indicating \u201cdefendant\u2019s en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>tire want of care\u201d and disregard all evidence showing \u201csome care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1486-4\">The majority opinion therefore sweeps too broadly when it declares that <em>Burk Royalty </em>\u201crejected the \u2018some care\u2019 test theretofore often applied by Texas courts in gross negligence eases,\u201d maj. op. at 1371, implying that both the substantive \u201csome care\u201d defense and the cognate procedural rule were disavowed in <em>Burk Royalty. </em>The <em>Burk Royalty </em>court carefully held that \u201cwe disapprove the use of the \u2018some care\u2019 test <em>in determining legal sufficiency points.\u201d </em>616 S.W.2d at 922 (emphasis added). \u201cSome care\u201d was, however, necessarily preserved as a substantive defense to gross negligence by the Texas definition of gross negligence reaffirmed in <em>Burk Royalty. See id. </em>at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-5\">The test that the majority opinion embraces as the \u201cnew\u201d substantive test for gross negligence in Texas, maj. op. at 1374, is not new at all. A century old, it is to be found both in <em>Shuford </em>and in <em>Sheffield. Compare </em>616 S.W.2d at 922 <em>with </em>376 S.W.2d at 828-29 <em>and </em>10 S.W. at 410-11. In addition, the majority opinion erroneously asserts that <em>Burk Royalty </em>\u201crepudiated the rationale of <em>Sheffield ... </em>that \u2018there cannot be degrees of entire want of care; there is either an entire want of care, or there is not. If there is <em>any </em>care, i.e., \u201csome care,\u201d then there cannot be an <em>entire want </em>of care.\u2019 [616 S.W.2d] at 918.\u201d Maj. op. at 1374 (original emphasis). Here the majority is clearly mistaken, for this is <em>not </em>merely \u201cthe rationale of <em>Sheffield\u2019; </em>instead, it is the rationale of <em>Shuford </em>as well, the decision explicitly reaffirmed by the Texas court in <em>Burk Royalty. </em>The sole passage to this effect in <em>Sheffield </em>is a quotation from <em>Shuford:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1486-6\">As said in <em>Shuford, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1486-7\">\u201c * * * There can be no partial exercise of \u2018ordinary care.\u2019 It exists, as a degree, in completeness, or it is totally wanting in any given case. While in a given case, \u2018ordinary care\u2019 may not exist, yet there may exist at least slight care. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1486-10\"><em>Sheffield, </em>376 S.W.2d at 829. And here again, it seems plain, the majority opinion overstates the holdings of <em>Burk Royalty. Burk Royalty </em>repudiates that rationale only insofar as it is to be applied as a standard of review by Texas appellate courts. We are not such a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-11\">Where the majority becomes confused is in its attempt to reconcile the action of the <em>Burk Royalty </em>court in reaffirming <em>Shuford </em>while overruling <em>Sheffield, </em>despite the fact that <em>Sheffield </em>cited and relied on <em>Shuford </em>\u2014announcing that its treatment of gross negligence was correct substantive law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ash-dedup-1\">There is no question here as to the rule of law applicable to cases of this character where exemplary damages are sought. In one of the later expressions by this court, <em>Bennett v. Howard, </em>141 Tex. 101, 170 S.W.2d 709, we reaffirmed the definition stated in <em>Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Shu-ford, </em>72 Tex. 165, 10 S.W. 408, namely that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1486-12\">\u201cGross negligence, to be the ground for exemplary damages, should be that <em>entire want of care </em>which would raise the belief that the act or omission complained of was the result of a <em>conscious indifference </em>to the right or welfare of the person or persons to be affected by it.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1486-13\"><em>Sheffield, </em>376 S.W.2d at 828. Struggling to find somewhere in <em>Burk Royalty </em>a change in Texas substantive law upon which to base its reversal of the trial court, the majority writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1486-14\">[I]t is readily apparent that the court in <em>Burk Royalty </em>did not undertake to establish a \u201cbright line\u201d test for determining whether or not a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes gross negligence. Indeed, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>appears that the Texas Supreme Court has rejected just such a \u201cbright line\u201d test \u2014 i.e. the <em>Sheffield </em>test \u2014 for one that demands more rigorous analysis: rather than simply inquiring whether the defendant exercised some care, the proper focus is on the question whether, in light of all of the surrounding circumstances, the requisite mental state is shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1487-5\">Maj. op. at 1374. There is, however, nothing new at all in this ultimate focus on the defendant\u2019s state of mind; it and the inquiry whether some care at least was exercised by defendant for the plaintiff\u2019s safety are merely two ways of saying the same thing, and both are as old as <em>Shuford. </em>Immediately following the definition of gross negligence quoted above, the <em>Sheffield </em>court quoted from <em>Bennett v. Howard, </em>itself quoting a standard Texas text, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1487-6\">\u201c \u2018In order that a recovery of exemplary damages may be sustained, the plaintiff must show, not merely that the defendant could have or ought to have foreseen and prevented the loss or injury of which the plaintiff complains, but that he acted intentionally or wilfully, or with a degree of \u201cgross negligence\u201d which approximates a fixed purpose to bring about the injury of which the plaintiff complains. The mental factor is also described in the reports by the terms \u201cmalice,\u201d \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201coppression,\u201d \u201crecklessness,\u201d and the like. Regardless of the expression which is used to describe it, <em>the purpose or intention of the defendant is determinative of his liability for exemplary damages.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1487-9\"><em>Sheffield, </em>376 S.W.2d at 828, <em>quoting Bennett v. Howard, </em>170 S.W.2d at 712, <em>quoting </em>13 Tex.Jur. \u00a7 113 at 241 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-10\">It is thus plain beyond peradventure that both the district court and our panel correctly relied upon the substantive \u201csome care\u201d rule of <em>Sheffield, </em>reaffirmed in <em>Burk Royalty, see </em>616 S.W.2d at 920. <em>Sheffield </em>replicated its definition of gross negligence directly from <em>Shuford. See </em>376 S.W.2d at 828-29. <em>Burk Royalty </em>reaffirms Shuford: every element in the definition of gross negligence found in <em>Burk Royalty </em>is present in <em>Shuford\u2019s </em>and <em>Sheffield\u2019s </em>definition as well. <em>Compare </em>616 S.W.2d at 920 <em>with </em>10 S.W. at 410-11 <em>and </em>376 S.W.2d at 828-29, 32. For all purposes of this case, the <em>Shu-ford-Sheffield </em>and <em>Burk Royalty </em>definitions are identical;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the majority\u2019s attempt to divide their unitary position as to substantive law entirely fails. The plain and simple explanation, that they differ as to state appellate procedure and that it is this aspect of <em>Sheffield </em>only that is disapproved by <em>Burk Royalty, </em>will not serve the majority\u2019s purposes and so is cast aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-11\">The district court therefore correctly relied on <em>Sheffield </em>for its definition of gross negligence, taking a quote from <em>Sheffield </em>that comes directly from <em>Bennett v. Howard, </em>141 Tex. 101, 170 S.W.2d 709 (1943) (cited with approval in <em>Burk Royalty, </em>616 S.W.2d at 920). <em>See </em>450 F.Supp. at 963, <em>quoting </em>376 S.W.2d at 828, <em>quoting </em>170 S.W.2d at 712. The panel opinion, in turn, correctly followed <em>Boeing </em>on procedure, <em>see </em>623 F.2d at 397-99, and <em>Shuford-Sheffield </em>on substantive Texas law, <em>see id. </em>at 398.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>Since <em>Sheffield </em>is still good law for the points relied on by the district court and our panel, there is no occasion for a remand in light of <em>Burk Royalty. </em>Indeed, one can only wonder what it is that the majority expects the district court to do on the remand that it mandates. That able court has already once applied the correct Texas substantive law \u2014 the 100-year-old <em>Shuford-Sheffield </em>test explicitly reaffirmed in <em>Burk Royalty. </em>450 F.Supp. at 963. Does the majority mean to hold, in defiance of <em>Burk Royalty, </em>that a different test should now obtain? The district court has likewise already once applied the correct federal procedural law, that of <em>Boeing v. Shipman. </em>So doing, and looking to all of the evidence, it concluded \u2014 unimpeachably, in my view\u2014 that \u201cadopting a design common to all manufacturers and millions of vehicles for over thirty years [as Freightliner undisputedly did] is a sufficient effort at safety to preclude a finding that Freightliner acted with an intent which approximates a fixed purpose to bring about this injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 964. Would the majority adopt the Texas rule of appellate review, expressed in <em>Burk Royalty, </em>and abandon sub silentio our landmark precedent of <em>Boeing v. Shipman </em>? I doubt that the majority would answer \u201cyes\u201d to either rhetorical question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\">Thus, the majority simply directs the district court to do again what it has already done, in the same manner and by the same standards. The majority has prevailed as to the result and will have its way; unfortunately, it has been unable to enunciate a course of reasoning which supports that result. Its treatment of Texas authority reflects more conviction than analysis; and its mandate floats in the air, supported by the power of numbers only. Proceedings on remand should be short and simple.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1485-9\">. The rule of <em>Boeing </em>is that, in passing on the sufficiency of evidence to support a factfinding, we look to and balance all of the record evidence.

[But i]t is held that the reviewing court should apply the \u2018no evidence\u2019 test.\u201d 616 S.W.2d at 927 (McGee, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1486-8\">. It thus appears that now in Texas, since all evidence of care will be disregarded by the reviewing court and only that of its want considered, factfindings of \u201cgross\u201d negligence will be tested there by the same standards as those of \u201cordinary\u201d negligence. Perhaps the matter will be clarified by the Texas courts; but as things now stand, under <em>Burk Royalty </em>it seems that only evidence tending to show \u201cno care\u201d at all will there be considered on review of such factfindings. Thus <em>Burk Royalty\u2019s </em>innovation, though seemingly a minor one, may have large consequences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1487-7\">. One minor difference does exist but is not at issue today. <em>Burk Royalty </em>disapproved the arcane distinction between passive and active conduct of the tortfeasor, an element of the <em>Sheffield </em>definition of gross negligence. <em>See </em>616 S.W.2d at 922. But this divergence is irrelevant here, since the district court did not charge this element of the <em>Sheffield </em>definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1487-8\">. The majority opinion at n.7 claims that some of our prior panel decisions have used the procedural \u201csome care\u201d test despite <em>Boeing. </em>If so, that usage was erroneous, as contravening an en banc decision of our court. A closer examination of those cases reveals, however, that this is not so. <em>Hernandez </em>relied on <em>Ballenger </em>for its definition of Texas substantive law. <em>See </em>552 F.2d at 145. In turn, <em>Ballenger </em>consulted <em>Sheffield, </em>and its quotation of <em>Sheffield </em>is derived from <em>Shuford. See </em>488 F.2d at 710, <em>quoting </em>376 S.W.2d at 829, <em>quoting </em>10 S.W. at 410-11. Procedurally, <em>Hernandez </em>reviewed all the evidence, as <em>Boeing </em>requires, <em>see </em>552 F.2d at 146, as did <em>Ballenger, see </em>488 F.2d at 711-13. <em>Woolard </em>correctly applied <em>Boeing </em>in reviewing all the evidence, <em>see </em>479 F.2d at 566, and quoted <em>Sheffield </em>quoting <em>Shuford </em>on substantive Texas law, <em>see id. </em>at 564, <em>quoting </em>376 S.W.2d at 828, <em>quoting </em>10 S.W. at 411.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1488-7\">. I do agree with the majority\u2019s treatment of the exemplary damages point and, to that extent only, concur.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1488-5\">JAMES C. HILL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AGk\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-6\">I concur fully in the dissenting opinion authored by Judge Gee. I offer the following additional comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-9\">We have been misled into a tunnel vision concentration on how the Texas appellate courts have treated evidence of \u201csome care,\u201d and have been diverted from the facts necessary to a finding of gross negligence sufficient to an award of punitive damages. Whatever Burk <em>Royalty Co. v. Walls, </em>616 S.W.2d 911 (Tex.1981) did to the \u201csome care\u201d rule, it did not alter standards long set for determining the nature of conduct which authorizes punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-10\">Before we determine whether or not evidence of \u201csome care\u201d <em>removes </em>proven conduct from supporting punitive damages, we ought to decide whether or not the conduct, with \u201csome care\u201d present or absent, fit the Texas definition of gross negligence. The district court found that the proven conduct of the defendant did not measure up. It did not \u201craise the belief that the act or omission complained of was the result of a conscious indifference to the right or welfare of the person or persons to be affected by it.\u201d <em>Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Shuford, </em>72 Tex. 165, 10 S.W. 408. I agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-11\">Our majority, having authoritatively disputed the district court\u2019s judgment that punitive damages were not authorized gives evidence of some misgivings. It remands the cross-appeal issue \u2014 excessiveness of the punitive damage award \u2014 also. The district court has already considered this issue and decided it. If punitive damages were authorized, the district court would find $10,-000,000 not to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-12\">Punitive damages are designed to deter the wrongdoer from repeating the wrong. Our majority <em>says </em>that there may be sufficient evidence of gross misconduct here to authorize the court to take action sufficient to bring it to an end. That is, an entire industry must be persuaded to quit making commercial trailer-hauling tractors as they have made them heretofore. Accepting the seriousness of our majority\u2019s view of the proven conduct, I find it impossible to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>elude, as a matter of law, that any lesser sum would suffice. Perhaps we are creating a new level of conduct which might be called \u201cslight gross negligence\u201d which authorizes \u201csomewhat punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
