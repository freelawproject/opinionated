On the morning of October 14, 1980, Charles Jenkins, wearing glasses, a beret, and a leather coat, entered a branch of Chemical Bank located in the Bronx, New York. He approached a teller and announced that \u201cthis is a hold-up.\u201d She reacted by dropping to the floor. He then brandished a knife and demanded money from another teller. After obtaining $821.00 in small bills, Jenkins fled from the bank. Jenkins delayed his flight from the vicinity of the bank momentarily to purchase a sheepskin coat at a nearby clothing store. He hailed a cab after making his purchase. Notified by bank employees who had followed Jenkins, the police stopped the cab and arrested Jenkins approximately six blocks from the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">On October 24, 1980, the grand jury returned an indictment charging Jenkins with armed bank robbery of the Chemical Bank in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) (Count One) and with bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (Count Two). After a two-day trial, the jury returned a verdict convicting Jenkins on both counts of the indictment. Subsequently, Judge Pollack entered a judgment of conviction on both counts. The court sentenced Jenkins to concurrent terms of imprisonment of fifteen years on Count One (armed bank robbery) and ten years on Count Two (bank robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We are of the view that a judgment may not be entered on simultaneous convictions pursuant to both \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 2113(d) on an identical set of facts. We stated in <em>Grimes v. United States, </em>607 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1979), that a conviction of the lesser included offense of unarmed bank robbery, \u00a7 2113(a), must be deemed merged into a conviction of armed bank robbery, \u00a7 2113(d), when both convictions arise from a single criminal act, as they do here. <em>See also United States v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d 483, 489 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1086, 101 S.Ct. 875, 66 L.Ed.2d 812 (1981); <em>United States v. Garris, </em>616 F.2d 626, 633-34 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 3021, 65 L.Ed.2d 1119 (1980). The Government so concedes. Indeed, the phrasing of \u00a7 2113(d) indicates that it proscribes aggravated forms of offenses already defined in \u00a7 2113(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">In short, to commit an offense under \u00a7 2113(d), it follows that an individual must violate either subsection (a) or (b). Accordingly, as we reasoned in <em>Grimes, </em>only one conviction may stand when a defendant is found guilty of violating both \u00a7 2113(d) and either \u00a7 2113(a) or (b). <em>Grimes v. United States, supra, </em>607 F.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">In light of the mandate of <em>Grimes, </em>we reverse and remand to the district court with directions to vacate the conviction of unarmed bank robbery pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and the sentence imposed thereon. Jenkins\u2019s conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2113(d) and the sentence thereon stand. Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-16\">Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-17\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-18\">Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-28\">management, or possession of, any bank, or any savings and loan association; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">Whoever enters or attempts to enter any bank, or any savings and loan association, or any building used in whole or in part as a bank, or as a savings and loan association, with intent to commit in such bank, or in such savings and loan association, or building, or part thereof, so used, any felony affecting such bank or such savings and loan association and in violation of any statute of the United States, or any larceny\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-29\">Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years; or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
