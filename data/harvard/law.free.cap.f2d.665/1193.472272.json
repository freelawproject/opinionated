EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Aja\">In this, case, appellants challenge the constitutionality of 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k, which declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-18\">It shall be unlawful to parade, stand, or move in processions or assemblages in the Supreme Court Building or grounds, or to display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization, or movement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-19\">40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As interpreted and applied by the Marshal of the Supreme Court, the individual responsible for the enforcement of the statute, section 13k prohibits all expressive conduct, including all picketing and leafletting, on the Supreme Court grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-20\">For the reasons set forth below, we find that this statute is repugnant to the First Amendment of the Constitution. While public expression that has an intent to influence the administration of justice may be restricted, <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965), Congress has accomplished that result with a more narrowly drawn statute, 18' U.S.C. \u00a7 1507, that is fully applicable to the Supreme Court grounds. Since we are unable to find any other significant governmental interest to justify the <em>absolute </em>prohibition of <em>all </em>expressive conduct contained in section 13k, we hold that the statute is unconstitutional and void. As a result, appellants are entitled to the declaratory and injunc-tive relief that they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-22\">The facts of this case are not in dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In May 1978, appellant Thaddeus Zywicki, an elderly Catholic missionary, went by himself to the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court to distribute a leaflet to passersby. Standing near a coin-operated vending machine selling the <em>Washington Star, </em>appellant attempted to distribute a reprint of a \u201cletter to the editor\u201d published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>in the <em>Washington Post </em>concerning the removal of unfit judges from the federal bench. After distributing a few leaflets, appellant was approached by a member of the Supreme Court police, who advised appellant that Title 40 of the United States Code prohibited leafletting anywhere on the Supreme Court grounds. Fearing arrest, appellant departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">On January 8, 1980, appellant Zywicki returned to the Supreme Court sidewalk to distribute pamphlets that contained an invitation to, and information about, several religious meetings concerning oppressed peoples of Central America. As before, appellant was told that he would be arrested if he continued to distribute the leaflets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">On February 4, 1980, appellant again returned to leaflet. On this occasion, however, Zywicki informed the police officer that a decision of the District of Columbia Superior Court had narrowed the application of 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k to prohibit only conduct engaged in \u201cwith the intent to disrupt or interfere with or impede the administration of justice or with the intent of influencing the administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The officer radioed a person inside the Supreme Court building for clarification, and a Mr. White emerged and stated that the statute had not been changed and that appellant was subject to arrest for leaf letting on the sidewalk. Appellant protested that newspapers were permitted to be sold while he was denied the right to distribute printed matter of his choosing, but peacefully left the grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Upon learning of these events, appellant Mary Grace appeared on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court on March 17, 1980, and stood there alone with a sign that recited verbatim the words of the First Amendment. Shortly after her arrival, a Supreme Court police officer approached appellant and told her that her conduct violated Title 40 of the United States Code. The officer advised appellant that, unless she left the grounds, she would have to accompany the officer into the building. Fearing arrest, appellant Grace left.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">On May 13, 1980, appellants Zywicki and Grace filed a complaint in the District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k is unconstitutional on its face, and a permanent injunction prohibiting the Supreme Court police from enforcing the statute. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the merits of this controversy. On August 7, 1980, however, the District Court dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint for failure to exhaust ad-, ministrative remedies. R. 8 (Memorandum Opinion). This ground for dismissal had not been briefed or argued by either party in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">In this appeal, appellants contend that the dismissal of the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was improper. Appellants also seek a judgment from this court declaring 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k void on its face, and an injunction prohibiting further enforcement of section 13k.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, although seeking an affirmance, the Government does not advance the exhaustion of administrative remedies reasoning relied upon by the District Court. Rather, the Government contends that the complaint was properly dismissed because section 13k is a proper limitation of expressive conduct on the grounds of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-15\">II. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-16\">The District Court dismissed this action on the ground that appellants failed to apply to the Supreme Court Marshal for a permit to engage in the conduct for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>they now seek judicial protection. Given the circumstances of this case, the judgment of the District Court was plainly erroneous. We hold that appellants\u2019 complaint should not have been dismissed for failure to secure a permit or for failure to otherwise pursue some ill-defined administrative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The statutory scheme at issue here makes no provision for obtaining a permit to leaflet or picket on the Supreme Court grounds. Section 13k flatly prohibits all expressive conduct on the Court grounds, not merely expressive conduct engaged in without a permit or license. <em>Compare, e.g., Cox v. New Hampshire, </em>312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941); <em>Poulos v. New Hampshire, </em>345 U.S. 395, 73 S.Ct. 760, 97 L.Ed. 1105 (1953). Furthermore, no administrative procedures have been established by which persons may obtain permission to-leaflet or picket on Supreme Court grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Most importantly, the Government has conceded in this case that all expressive conduct \u2014 without exception \u2014 is forbidden on Court grounds. The Supreme Court police officers who approached appellants did not indicate that appellants\u2019 conduct might be permitted if prior approval from the Marshal were obtained. In addition, the Marshal\u2019s affidavit to the District Court makes it absolutely plain that <em>no </em>expressive conduct will be permitted on the grounds of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, so far as the Government is concerned, section 13k does not contemplate or require any permit or licensing procedure for expressive conduct on Court grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">In these circumstances, dismissal of the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was without justification. No administrative remedies existed for appellants to exhaust. While appellants conceivably could have sought formal permission from the Supreme Court Marshal, such action would have been an empty \u2014 and thus unnecessary \u2014 ritual. As stated by Chief Judge Robinson in <em>Lodge 1858, American Federation of Government Employees v. Paine, </em>436 F.2d 882 (D.C.Cir.1970), \u201cthe exhaustion requirement contemplates an efficacious administrative remedy, and does not obtain when it is plain that any effort to meet it would come to no more than an exercise in futility.\u201d 436 F.2d at 896 (separate opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">The mere fact that the position of Marshal exists, and that the person in that position may possess the power to withhold enforcement of section 13k, does not mean that an \u201cefficacious administrative remedy\u201d was available to appellants. The statute sets forth no criteria under which the Marshal could determine whether to grant or deny an application for permission to leaflet or picket. This alone would call into question the judgment of the District Court. As. the Supreme Court has held, \u201ca law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional,\u201d <em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 150-51, 89 S.Ct. 935, 938-39, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969); moreover, the Court also noted that \u201ca person faced with such an unconstitutional licensing law may ignore it and engage with impunity in the exercise of the right of free expression for which the law purports to require a license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 89 S.Ct. at 939. <em>See also Lovell v. City of Griffin, </em>303 U.S. 444, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reject the decision of the District Court dismissing appellants\u2019 complaint for failure to secure a permit or otherwise to exhaust an administrative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">III. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The Government contends that the District Court was correct in dismissing appellants\u2019 complaint, since the prohibition of expressive conduct contained in section 13k does not unduly interfere with First Amendment rights of free speech. Appellants strongly dispute this contention, and assert that section 13k is unconstitutional on its face. We turn to consider this significant question of constitutional law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">A. <em>Freedom of Expression in Public Places</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">Cases concerning the rights of individuals to express opinions or air grievances on public property are among the most important in our jurisprudence. In countless cases heard over the years, the Supreme Court has strived to reconcile the clear directive of the First Amendment that \u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> with legitimate needs of the Government to limit expression on certain public property so that governmental functions may be conducted safely and properly. In certain of these cases the Court has recognized a broad right of access to public property for purposes of free expression, while in others the Court has been more restrictive of First Amendment freedoms. We first address these divergent groups of cases and set forth an overall method of analysis that may be gleaned from the decisions of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">1. <em>Cases Establishing Broad Rights of Access</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">The Supreme Court has long recognized the importance of access to public places for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>purposes of free speech. In <em>Hague v. CIO, </em>307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939), the Court declared unconstitutional a local ordinance that prohibited \u201cpublic parades or public assembly in or upon the public streets, highways, public parks or public buildings\u201d without a permit from a local official, which permit could be refused \u201cfor the purpose of preventing riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage.\u201d 307 U.S. at 502 n.l, 59 S.Ct. at 958 n.l. In words at times considered the cornerstone for determining the rights of individuals to use public streets and parks for the expression of political or religious views,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Justice Roberts stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-4\">Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 515, 59 S.Ct. at 963 (plurality opinion). Since the ordinance could be used as \u201cthe instrument of arbitrary suppression of free expression of views on national affairs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 516, 59 S.Ct. at 964, the Court declared the law \u201cvoid upon its face.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">The right to use public property for free expression has been expanded beyond public sidewalks and parks. In <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 83 S.Ct. 680, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963), the Supreme Court reversed breach of peace convictions of 187 Black high school and college students who had conducted an orderly demonstration on the South Carolina State House grounds. During their demonstration, the students had walked \u2014 single file or two abreast\u2014 carrying placards with messages such as \u201cI am proud to be a Negro\u201d and \u201cDown with segregation.\u201d 372 U.S. at 231, 83 S.Ct. at 681. The students had assembled on the State House grounds, which housed the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of the South Carolina Government, to express their grievances \u201cto the citizens of South Carolina, along with the Legislative Bodies of South Carolina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 83 S.Ct. at 683. The Supreme Court held that, in arresting, convicting, and sentencing the students, the State had infringed constitutionally protected rights of free speech, free assembly, and freedom to petition the Government for the redress of grievances. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he circumstances in this case reflect an exercise of these basic constitutional rights in their most pristine and classic form.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">Following <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, </em>other cases of the Court have reenforced and further established rights of expression on public property. In <em>Brown v. Louisiana, </em>383 U.S. 131, 86 S.Ct. 719, 15 L.Ed.2d 637 (1966), the Supreme Court vacated the convictions of five individuals found to have violated a breach of peace statute by conducting a peaceful and silent \u201csit-in\u201d in the reading room of a public library.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the Court held that the evidence did not support a violation of the breach of peace statute, four Justices of the majority also stated that the protestors\u2019 actions were protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), the Supreme Court declared that the First Amendment protected the right of school children to wear black armbands in school in protest against the Vietnam War. Subsequently, in <em>Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police, </em>342 F.Supp. 575 (D.D.C.), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>409 U.S. 972, 93 S.Ct. 311, 34 L.Ed.2d 236 (1972), the Court affirmed, without opinion, a decision of a three-judge District Court declaring uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>stitutional an Act of Congress that prohibited processions or assemblages on the United States Capitol grounds.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Thus, First Amendment rights of expression have been found to exist in public streets and parks, on State House and the United States Capitol grounds, on the sidewalk in front of the White House, in public schools, and, by four Justices of the majority in <em>Brown v. Louisiana, </em>in the reading room of a public library. In these diverse situations, it has been held that the State may not impose a complete prohibition on the use of public property as a forum in which individuals may share ideas or express grievances against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">2. <em>Cases Restricting First Amendment Activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">The Supreme Court also has held that rights of expression on public property are not absolute. In the landmark decision of <em>Cox v. New Hampshire, </em>312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941), the Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of a statute that prohibited a parade or procession on public streets without a license, since the statute, as construed, conveyed authority only to take into account \u201cconsiderations of time, place and manner so as to conserve the public convenience.\u201d 312 U.S. at 575-76, 61 S.Ct. at 765-66. The Court noted that this limited control over the time and place of expression served to afford the opportunity for proper policing, and to prevent the confusion that could result from overlapping parades or processions. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 61 S.Ct. at 765.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The legacy of <em>Cox v. New Hampshire </em>has remained. Indeed, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that activities protected by the First Amendment \u201care subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.\u201d <em>Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., </em>452 U.S. 640, 647, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">In certain situations, the Supreme Court has upheld relatively substantial restrictions on the right to use public property for expressive activity. In <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965), the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a state statute that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the State of Louisiana .. . shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">379 U.S. at 560, 85 S.Ct. at 478. Although the Supreme Court ruled that the State was \u201cestopped\u201d from invoking the statute, <em>id. </em>at 571, 85 S.Ct. at 484, the Court also held \u201cthat this statute on its face is a valid law dealing with conduct subject to regulation so as to vindicate important interests of society and that the fact that free speech is intermingled with such conduct does not bring with it constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 85 S.Ct. at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">At issue in <em>Cox v. Louisiana </em>was a demonstration of 2,000 persons, gathered across the street from the courthouse, 101 feet from its steps. A major purpose of the demonstration was to protest what was considered to be an illegal arrest of 23 students who were detained in the courthouse build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>ing. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 85 S.Ct. at 481. The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]here can be no question that a State has a legitimate interest in protecting its judicial system from the pressures which picketing near a courthouse might create,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 562, 85 S.Ct. at 479; and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-4\">A State may adopt safeguards necessary and appropriate to assure that the administration of justice at all stages is free from outside control and influence. A narrowly drawn statute such as the one under review is obviously a safeguard both necessary and appropriate to vindicate the State\u2019s interest in assuring justice under law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\"><em>Id. </em>The Court made clear, however, that critical to its decision was the fact that the statute was drawn narrowly to apply only to picketing with an intent to interfere with the administration of justice. As stated by the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-6\">Absent an appropriately drawn and applicable statute, entirely different considerations would apply if, for example, the demonstrators were picketing to protest the actions of a mayor or other official of a city completely unrelated to any judicial proceedings, who just happened to have an office located in the courthouse building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 567, 85 S.Ct. at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Soon after the decision in <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>the Court handed down <em>Adderley v. Florida, </em>385 U.S. 39, 87 S.Ct. 242, 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966), affirming the convictions of 32 persons found to have violated a state trespass statute by conducting a demonstration on jailhouse grounds. The demonstrators in <em>Adderley </em>had entered the jail grounds through a driveway used only for purposes related to jailhouse business, without warning to, or permission from, the sheriff. In reviewing the case, the Court noted that jails, built for security purposes, are not traditionally open to the public, and emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-9\">This particular jail entrance and driveway were not normally used by the public, but by the sheriff\u2019s department for transporting prisoners to and from the courts several blocks away and by commercial concerns for servicing the jail. Even after their partial retreat, the demonstrators continued to block vehicular passage over this driveway up to the entrance of the jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 45, 87 S.Ct. at 246. Noting that the sheriff objected only to the presence of the demonstrators \u201con that part of the jail grounds reserved for jail uses,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 47, 87 S.Ct. at 247, the Court affirmed the convictions. In these circumstances, the Court held that the State \u201chas power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">Relying in part on <em>Adderley, </em>a recent line of cases have held that, on public property not properly designated as a \u201cpublic forum,\u201d the State may significantly restrict free expression. In <em>Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, </em>418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974), the Court upheld a municipal decision not to accept paid political advertising for its mass transit system advertising space, noting that the decision was made \u201cin order to minimize chances of abuse, the appearance of favoritism, and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience.\u201d 418 U.S. at 304, 94 S.Ct. at 2717. Similarly, in <em>Greer v. Spock, </em>424 U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976), relying on both \u201cthe historically unquestioned power of [a military] commanding officer summarily to exclude civilians from the area of his command,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 838, 96 S.Ct. at 1217 <em>(quoting Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 893, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1747, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961)), and \u201cthe American constitutional tradition of a politically neutral military establishment under civilian control,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 839, 96 S.Ct. at 1218, the Supreme Court held that a regulation prohibiting all political speeches on a federal military base did not violate the First Amendment. Most recently, relying on \u201c[t]he interest in preserving order and authority in the prisons,\u201d the Court, in <em>Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 132, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 2541, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977), upheld regulations promulgated by the North Carolina Department of Correction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>that prohibited inmates from soliciting other inmates to join a prisoners\u2019 union, barred all meetings of the union, and denied bulk mailing privileges to union publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">3. <em>Analyzing Cases Concerning Freedom Of Expression On Public Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">Unfortunately, even upon careful and extended review, it is difficult to discern a unifying thread of analysis that binds the Supreme Court decisions concerning freedom of expression on public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">In at least a handful of cases, the Court has determined that certain public facilities were not \u201cpublic forums;\u201d in these cases, it appears that the challenged restrictions on freedom of expression have been subjected to a low level of scrutiny by the Court. For example, in <em>Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977), the Court stated that, since a prison is not a public forum, prison authorities \u201cneed only demonstrate a rational basis for their distinctions between organizational groups.\u201d 433 U.S. at 134, 97 S.Ct. at 2542. Similarly, in <em>Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, </em>418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974), a plurality of the Court stated that \u201cthe policies and practices governing access to the transit system\u2019s advertising space must not be arbitrary, capricious, or invidious.\u201d 418 U.S. at 303, 94 S.Ct. at 2717.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">These judicial statements seem at odds with the general principle that governmental restrictions of free speech will be upheld only upon a showing that the restriction is essential to the furtherance of a substantial governmental interest. As stated in <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), a governmental restriction of free speech</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A26\">is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"av8-dedup-0\">391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. at 1679. Very recently, in <em>Heffron v. International Society of Krishna Consciousness, Inc., </em>452 U.S. 640, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981), the Supreme Court reaffirmed, without qualification, that \u201c[a] valid time, place, and manner regulation [of First Amendment activities] must also \u2018serve a significant governmental interest.\u2019 \u201d 101 S.Ct. at 2563 <em>(quoting Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 771, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">Although some aberrations seemingly do appear, upon close examination we do not find these various opinions of the Supreme Court to be essentially inconsistent. It is true that the Supreme Court has suggested in the so-called \u201cnon-public forum\u201d cases that a lesser degree of scrutiny may be applicable; however, the determination that a public facility is not a \u201cpublic forum\u201d has been accompanied in each of these cases by an expression of important governmental interests justifying the State to preserve the property for the use to which it was lawfully dedicated. Military bases, for instance, are established solely to train soldiers and defend the nation, and require, for the successful accomplishment of those objectives, a large degree of discipline, order and restrictions on civilian access. Prisons are established solely to house and rehabilitate those convicted of crime, and require, in order to maintain security and order, extensive restrictions on individual freedom and autonomy. These facilities possess, by their very nature, peculiar characteristics that entitle the State to impose greater restrictions on expression than would be allowed for public sidewalks or parks. Even in cases involving these facilities, however, the Supreme Court has noted that First Amendment privileges remain that are not inconsistent with the State\u2019s legitimate use of the property. As recognized in <em>Jones, </em>\u201ca prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>of the corrections system.\u201d 433 U.S. at 125, 97 S.Ct. at 2537 <em>(quoting Pell v. Procunier, </em>417 U.S. 817, 822, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Thus, we believe that the decisions of the Supreme Court dictate that whenever the Government denies freedom of expression on property generally open to the public, the restriction must be justified by a significant governmental interest \u2014 whether that interest derives from the very nature of the property itself, or from some other source. Moreover, the restriction on freedom of expression can be no greater \u201cthan is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). Certainly, even peaceful expression may be prohibited \u201cwhen it interferes with the operation of vital governmental facilities,\u201d <em>Carey v. Brown, </em>447 U.S. 455, 470,100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980); the State retains the power \u201cto preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\u201d <em>Adderley v. Florida, </em>385 U.S. 39, 47, 87 S.Ct. 242, 247, 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966). As perhaps best stated in <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104,116,92 S.Ct. 2294,2303,33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), \u201c[t]he crucial question is whether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">B. <em>Freedom of Expression and the Supreme Court Grounds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">In this case, we are concerned with a statute that, as construed, prohibits all expressive conduct in the Supreme Court building and on the Supreme Court grounds. The statutory prohibition applies whether or not the message conveyed concerns any matter pending before the Court; public expression is also banned no matter what effect is intended or produced by the message. The statute applies whether or not the Court is in session, and extends to the broad sidewalks that surround the Supreme Court building, which are at all times of the day and night open to the public. Indeed, the statute, on its face, conceivably prohibits the wearing of an expressive T-shirt or button declaring \u201cI love America\u201d on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court building at 10 o\u2019clock at night. Thus, we are not concerned with a narrow regulation that governs the time, place and manner of expression, or solely protects the efficient functioning of the physical structure. The statute, as construed, flatly prohibits all expressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">Substantial governmental interests certainly exist to justify restrictions on picketing and other forms of expression in and near courthouses. The constitutional safeguards of due process that attend judicial proceedings in this country leave no room for influence or domination of the judiciary by public pressure; arguments to courts properly are presented in official pleadings, briefs and memoranda, not on placards. Although \u201c[j]udges are supposed to be men [and women] of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate,\u201d <em>Craig v. Harney, </em>331 U.S. 367, 376, 67 S.Ct. 1249, 1255, 91 L.Ed. 1546 (1947), the Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cjudges are human; and the legislature has the right to recognize the danger that some judges ... will be consciously or unconsciously influenced by demonstrations in or near their courtrooms.\u201d <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 565, 85 S.Ct. 476, 481, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-10\">Along with these considerations, \u201c[a] State may also properly protect the judicial process from being misjudged in the minds of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Due to the possibility that a court may adopt, coincidentally, a position forcefully urged by courthouse demonstrators, \u201c[a] State may protect against the possibility of a conclusion by the public ... that the judge\u2019s action was in part a product of intimidation and did not flow only from the fair and orderly working of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">We need not determine the extent to which these concerns are applicable to proceedings before the United States Supreme Court. As described above, the statute at issue is in no way limited to expression that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>may risk influencing a Supreme Court Justice, or, probably more realistically, that may distort public perceptions of Supreme Court decisionmaking.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, the legislative history of section 13k demonstrates no particularized congressional concerns with either the fair administration of justice or public confidence in the judicial process.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">More importantly, however, these legitimate concerns are fully addressed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-6\">Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the United States, or in or near a building or residence occupied or use by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A54\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507 (1976). The constitutionality of a state statute modeled on section 1507 was upheld by the Supreme Court in <em>Cox v. </em>Louisiana, supra. Section 1507 prohibits expressive conduct on the Supreme Court grounds designed to influence Supreme Court Justices or to interfere with the administration of justice; therefore, we can find no justification for the <em>absolute </em>prohibition of all expressive conduct contained in 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-11\">The Government argues, however, that the absolute ban on expressive conduct contained in section 13k is necessary and appropriate to maintain the dignity and decorum of the Supreme Court. Indeed, it would appear that this is the sole justification of the statute advanced in the legislative history.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although this interest admittedly is not protected in explicit terms by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we do not believe that this concern alone is sufficient to justify the absolute prohibition of free expression contained in this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">In <em>Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police, </em>342 F.Supp. 575 (D.D.C.), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>409 U.S. 972, 93 S.Ct. 311, 34 L.Ed.2d 236 (1972), a three-judge District Court considered a similarly worded statute prohibiting all parading or picketing on the United States Capitol grounds. In declaring the law unconstitutional on its face, the court explicitly rejected an argument that \u201cthe \u2018peace,\u2019 \u2018serenity,\u2019 \u2018majesty,\u2019 maintenance of a \u2018park-like setting,\u2019 and the \u2018glorification of a form of government through visual enhancement of its public buildings,\u2019 \u201d justified an exclusion of all public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>expression on the Capitol grounds. 342 F.Supp. at 585. The court unequivocally stated, \u201c[t]he desire of Congress, if such there be, to function in the \u2018serenity\u2019 of a \u2018park-like setting\u2019 is fundamentally at odds with the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Unquestionably, the majesty of the Supreme Court building can and does instill public confidence in the important governmental functions conducted inside. However, while the Capitol and Supreme Court buildings house different governmental entities, justifying different restrictions on free expression, we believe that an interest in \u201cthe glorification of a form of government through visual enhancement of its public buildings\u201d can no more justify an <em>absolute prohibition </em>of free expression on the Supreme Court grounds than on the grounds of the United States Capitol. The sight of a sole picketer may indeed mar an otherwise pristine morning or perfectly centered snapshot. However, it is just that annoyance \u2014 if such be the case \u2014 that may cause bystanders or passersby to stop and take notice, to become aware of an issue, to formulate a response to a companion. This awareness and interchange is, in part, precisely what the First Amendment is designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">An interest in the \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cdecorum\u201d of the Supreme Court cannot alone justify the absolute abridgement of expressive conduct of section 13k. Indeed, the Government cannot fairly assert that <em>all </em>expressive conduct outside the Supreme Court will adversely affect the peace and decorum of the Court. Thus, even if the asserted interest is legitimate by itself, it cannot justify the total ban at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">We simply do not believe that all expressive conduct \u201cinterferes with the operation of [this] vital governmental facility].\u201d <em>Carey v. Brown, </em>447 U.S. 455, 470, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980). Unlike the situation presented in <em>Adderley v. Florida, </em>385 U.S. 39, 87 S.Ct. 242, 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966), where over 100 demonstrators blocked vehicular passage over a jail driveway \u201cnot normally used by the public, but by the sheriff\u2019s department for transporting prisoners to and from the courts several blocks away and by commercial concerns for servicing the jail,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 45, 87 S.Ct. at 246, the prohibition at issue here is not necessary for the Government \u201cto preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 87 S.Ct. at 247. The Government has offered nothing to suggest that all expressive conduct on the sidewalk of the Supreme Court \u201cis basically incompatible with the normal activity of [that] particular' place at [that] particular time.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 116, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2303, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">Nor is it sufficient, as the Government suggests, that other nearby locations exist where freedom of expression is not abridged. As the Supreme Court flatly declared in <em>Schneider v. State, </em>308 U.S. 147, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-10\">[O]ne is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-11\">308 U.S. at 163, 60 S.Ct. at 151. Indeed, \u201c[f]reedom of expression would not truly exist if the right could be exercised only in an area that a benevolent government has provided as a safe haven for crackpots.\u201d <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 513, 89 S.Ct. 733, 740, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>In short, we find no interest to justify the absolute prohibition of expression contained in section 13k. Indeed, we believe that it would be tragic if the grounds of the Supreme Court, unquestionably the greatest protector of First Amendment rights, stood as an island of silence in which those rights could never be exercised in any form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">We emphasize that expressive conduct designed to disrupt the Supreme Court or to in any way influence the administration of justice is not protected by our opinion today. Such conduct is properly prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507. Nor do we suggest that any individual may picket or leaflet in the Supreme Court building itself. The statute at issue, however, prohibits expressive conduct unrelated to any business of the Supreme Court, throughout the Supreme Court grounds. Since such a blanket prohibition is inconsistent with the principles of the First Amendment, the statute is void on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">In so holding, we need not examine the facts of the present case to determine whether the particular conduct engaged in by appellants is protected by the First Amendment. As the Supreme Court recently stated in <em>Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>444 U.S. 620, 100 S.Ct. 826, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afkd-dedup-0\">Given a case or controversy, a litigant whose own activities are unprotected may nevertheless challenge a statute by showing that it substantially abridges the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"av3-dedup-0\">444 U.S. at 634,100 S.Ct. at 834.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We have held that the absolute prohibition of section 13k, which prohibits expressive conduct unrelated to any business of the Supreme Court throughout the Supreme Court grounds, unduly abridges First Amendment rights. Thus, while on the record before us appellants\u2019 conduct would appear to be unrelated to any business of the Court and protected by the First Amendment, we need not so determine. Since the statute is not narrowly drawn to further a legitimate State interest, appellants are entitled to the relief that they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-12\">In an effort to save section 13k with a narrowing construction, the dissenting opinion suggests that \u201cthe section should be limited ... to prevent expressive conduct aimed at promoting and propagandizing political parties and the various causes that are supported by the many movements extant in our pluralistic society.\u201d Dissenting op. at 1209. It is unclear, however, to what extent, if any, that construction would operate as less than an absolute prohibition. The dissenting opinion ultimately construes \u201cpolitical parties,\u201d \u201corganizations,\u201d \u201cmovements,\u201d and \u201ccauses\u201d in such a way as to encompass virtually all expressive conduct. Thus, we cannot discern in the dissent\u2019s view of section 13k any comprehensible departure from the Government\u2019s construction of the statute, <em>i.e., </em>it would ban all expressive conduct at all times and on all of the public grounds surrounding the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-13\">While we would prefer to adopt a narrowing construction of the statute in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>to avoid a holding that section 13k is unconstitutional, <em>Crowell v. Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 296, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932), a validating construction is simply impossible here. Section 13k\u2019s slim legislative history suggests only the desire on the part of Congress to surround the Court with the same cordon of silence that Congress attempted to place around the Capitol, <em>see </em>notes 17 and 18 <em>supra, </em>a measure struck down on First Amendment grounds in <em>Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police, </em>342 F.Supp. 575 (D.D.C.) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>409 U.S. 972, 93 S.Ct. 311, 34 L.Ed.2d 236 (1972). Combined with the statute\u2019s all-encompassing terms and with decades of consistently broad enforcement, this legislative history precludes a limiting interpretation. G. Endlich, a Commentary on the Interpretation of Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 178-180 (1888). Indeed, the Government concedes that section 13k is a <em>total ban </em>of all expressive conduct on the grounds surrounding the Supreme Court. Congress, of course, may legislate to narrowly restrict expressive conduct on the Supreme Court grounds that threatens significant governmental interests, but the creation of new statutes must be left to that body. <em>Aptheker v. Secretary of State, </em>378 U.S. 500, 515-17, 84 S.Ct. 1659, 1668-69, 12 L.Ed.2d 992 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">In the end analysis, we simply cannot agree with our dissenting colleague that the interests in order and decorum can, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a total prohibition of all expressive conduct at all times and on all of the Supreme Court grounds.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">IV. RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">As a result of our holding in this case, appellants are entitled to a declaratory judgment that 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13k is unconstitutional on its face, and to a permanent injunction prohibiting the Government from enforcing section 13k. We remand this case to the District Court to enter the appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1296-15\">.

This authorization is clearly designed to supplement the requirements contained in the statute challenged here.

This provision is separable into two discrete parts. The first part prohibits parading, standing, and moving in processions and assemblages. The second part prohibits the display of any flag, banner, or device that is designed or adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization or movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>The inapplicability of the first part to the three occurrences here in issue <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is plain. It applies to group activity only, and each incident upon which appellants base their complaint involved solitary conduct alone. The meaning of the second part of the section requires closer scrutiny of the statutory language. Although \u201cflag\u201d and \u201cbanner\u201d may describe a readily identifiable group of objects, the inclusion of the word \u201cdevice\u201d makes difficult the task of limiting these three terms to a particular class of objects. It would appear that the reach of \u201cdevice\u201d would include any object that is capable of display, including Grace\u2019s sign and Zywicki\u2019s various handbills or leaflets. A search for a reasonable limit on the second part of section 13k, then, leads to the final clause of the section^ \u2014 \u201cdesigned or adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization, or movement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">I would interpret this portion of the statute to prohibit the promotion of political parties and of organizations and movements for various causes. In my opinion this part of the statute prohibits publicizing or propagandizing political parties and causal movements in the Supreme Court building and grounds. If permitted, such activity would create the impression to some extent in the public\u2019s mind that the Supreme Court is embroiled in or affected by such street pressures and picketing. Our tripartite government has a strong interest in sheltering its judicial branch from the appearance of influence by political forces and all outside pressures. The government\u2019s interest in order and decorum surrounding its public buildings takes, on a completely different tenor when those buildings house the courts and more so with respect to the Supreme Court Building that is devoted <em>solely </em>to the business of that court. Pleas to judges from members of the public are properly confined to the avenues of <em>due process. </em>Due process does not permit public pressure or the appearance of public pressure on the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">When Congress enacted the disqualification statute for federal judges, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), it provided in effect that even the <em>appearance </em>of outside pressures was to be eliminated from the judicial process. This followed earlier decisions of the Supreme Court, requiring that \u201cjustice must satisfy the <em>appearance </em>of justice.\u201d <em>Offutt v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14, 75 S.Ct. 11, 13, 99 L.Ed. 11 (1954) (emphasis added). This principle has been applied in numerous cases. <em>Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465, 91 S.Ct. 499, 504, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971); <em>In re International Business Machines Corp., </em>618 F.2d 923, 929 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>Bercheny v.

Van Dusen, </em>350 F.2d 806, 812 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">It would be antithetical to require justices in their judicial role to adhere to the appearance of justice by due process and then permit picketing, bannering and other activity on the Supreme Court grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>would create the impression in the public mind that justice can be obtained by street pressures outside the courtroom. While public urging, beseeching, and even cajoling are part and parcel of legislative and executive activities, wholly different considerations weigh heavily against the propriety of such importunings in the judicial arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">With the second part of section 13k so construed the question then becomes whether it covers any or all of the conduct now before the court. Zywicki\u2019s leaflet that contained an open invitation to attend several religious meetings concerning \u201cthe political and human rights problems\u201d of Central America, <em>i.e., </em>Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, was designed to bring into notice a movement essentially political in nature, seeking to involve our citizens in alleged governmental affairs in Central America. The meetings were billed as a \u201cReligious Reflection in Solidarity with the Oppressed Peoples of Central America.\u201d Given the political turmoil that existed in Central America during the time, this pamphlet can only be described as a political leaflet. What one person may view as relieving oppression, others may consider as a communist-inspired attempt at a totalitarian takeover of a nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">The letter to the editor that appeared in Zywicki\u2019s first handbill, which called attention to the necessity for \u201cRemoving Unfit Judges,\u201d urged public support for the then-pending Judicial Tenure Act, and was designed to attract political support to the substantial movement behind that proposed legislation. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over cases that seek the removal of unfit judges. <em>See generally Chandler v. Judicial Council, </em>398 U.S. 74, 90 S.Ct. 1648, 26 L.Ed.2d 100 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">Grace\u2019s display of her \u201cfree speech\u201d banner also was designed to attract support for the very substantial but amorphous movement in the nation that is constantly agitating for expanded rights under the First Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">After construing section 13k to prohibit all expressive conduct, the majority finds it facially unconstitutional in toto.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>opinion even such a broad ban on expressive conduct at the Supreme Court may be valid. I believe, however, that section 13k should be given a reasonable construction that puts it on solid constitutional footing. The second part of the section should be limited, as the statute provides, to prevent expressive conduct aimed at promoting and propagandizing political parties and the various causes that are supported by the many movements extant in our pluralistic society. So limited, I believe that the weighty interest in maintaining the order and decorum of the Supreme Court and the appearance of justice easily suffices to permit Congress to disallow such activity within the Supreme Court Building and grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">My disagreement also extends to the majority\u2019s apparent view that, in light of section 1507, section 13k is superfluous. In my judgment the two provisions are complementary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1507 applies to any building housing a court of the United States and prevents picketing and parading \u201cwith the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty.\u201d Section 13k prevents other kinds of activity and applies only to the small area within the Supreme Court Building and grounds. It prevents processions and assemblages on the Supreme Court Building and grounds, unless the Marshal has suspended the law \u201cto permit the observance of authorized ceremonies\u201d pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13o. In addition, as I would interpret the second part of section 13k, it precludes the display of objects that are designed to publicize or. propagandize political parties, or organizations or movements advocating various causes. It is reasonable to permit greater limitations on expression at the Supreme Court than at buildings housing courts generally since the Supreme Court Building houses only the Supreme Court and is perhaps the only building housing a federal court that does not also contain offices of either the executive or legislative branches of the federal government. Its building and grounds are dedicated solely to the work of the Supreme Court. In enacting sections 13k. and 1507 it appears that Congress sought to create an immunized area within the Supreme Court Building and grounds. In tandem, sections 13k and 1507 prohibit (1) parading or picketing that attempts to influence the court, (2) assemblages and processions, and (3) the display of signs involving political parties or other organizations or movements. Two statutes prohibiting closely related conduct with varying penalties may' stand together. <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">Sections 13k and 1507 implement the valid congressional purpose of ensuring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>the \u201corder and decorum\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that is an essential element of due process of law is preserved at the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">In upholding a Louisiana statute prohibiting picketing, \u201cin or near a courthouse,\u201d designed to influence the court, Justice Goldberg in <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965) <em>(\u201cCox IF) </em>enunciated some of the considerations that distinguish areas around courts from other public areas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-5\">It is, of course, true that most judges will be influenced only by what they see and hear in court. However, judges are human; and the legislature has the right to recognize the danger that some judges, jurors, and other court officials, will be consciously or unconsciously influenced by demonstrations in or near their courtrooms both prior to and at the time of the trial. A State may also properly protect the judicial process from being misjudged in the minds of the public. Suppose demonstrators paraded and picketed for weeks with signs asking that indictments be dismissed, and that a judge, completely uninfluenced by these demonstrations, dismissed the indictments. A State may protect against the possibility of a conclusion by the public under these circumstances that the judge\u2019s action was in part a product of intimidation and did not flow only from the fair and orderly working of the judicial process. See S.Rep.No. 732, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">379 U.S. at 565, 85 S.Ct. at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\"><em>Cox II </em>describes some of the subtle pressures against which courts should be protected. In the public mind picketing at a public building will be seen as intended to influence the performance of a governmental function carried on within the building by some public officer. With respect to the Supreme Court Building and grounds, a single purpose area, there is one principal target \u2014 the members of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-8\">In the earlier case of <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965) <em>(\u201cCox I\u201d), </em>while the Court set aside overbroad statutes relating to peace disturbance and obstructing public traffic that were being discriminatorily enforced, it recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-11\">The rights of free speech and assembly, while fundamental in our democratic society, still do not mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may address a group at any public place and at any time. The constitutional guarantee of liberty implies the existence of an organized society maintaining public order, without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of anarchy. The control of travel on the streets is a clear example of governmental responsibility to insure this necessary order. A restriction in that relation, designed to promote the public convenience in the interest of all, and not susceptible to abuses of discriminatory application, cannot be disregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right which, in other circumstances, would be entitled to protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">379 U.S. 554, 85 S.Ct. 464. The present statute is not being abused because it is <em>uniformly </em>applied to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">Later, Justice Black, one of the great defenders of First Amendment freedoms, in upholding a Florida statute that provided trespass on the grounds of a jail, remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa13\"><em>The State, no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated. </em>For this reason there is no merit to the petitioners\u2019 argument that they had a constitutional right to stay on the property, over the jail custodian\u2019s objections, because this \u201carea chosen for the peaceful civil rights demonstration was not only \u2018reasonable\u2019 but also particularly appropriate .... \u201d Such an argument has as its major unarticulat-ed premise the assumption that people who want to propagandize protests or views have a constitutional right to do so whenever and however and wherever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>they please. That concept of constitutional law was vigorously and forthrightly rejected in two of the cases petitioners rely on, <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>[379 U.S. 536] at 554-555 and 563-564, 85 S.Ct. at 464 and 480. We reject it again. <em>The United States Constitution does not forbid a State to control the use of its own property for its own lawful nondiscriminatory purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\"><em>Adderley v. Florida, </em>385 U.S. 39, 47-48, 87 S.Ct. 242, 247-248, 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">The same basic rationale found expression in an opinion by Justice Stewart sustaining the prohibition of all demonstrations and political activity on the Fort Dix Military Reservation, including the public thoroughfares within the post that traditionally were open to all:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-6\"><em>The Court of Appeals was mistaken </em>... <em>in thinking . . . that whenever members of the public are permitted freely to visit a place owned or operated by the Government, then that place becomes a \u201cpublic forum\u201d for purposes of the First Amendment. </em>Such a principle of constitutional law has never existed, and does not exist now. The guarantees of the First Amendment have never meant \u201cthat people who want to propagandize protests or views have a constitutional right to do so whenever and however and wherever they please.\u201d <em>Adderley v. Florida, </em>385 U.S. 39, 48, 87 S.Ct. 242, 247, 17 L.Ed.2d 149, 156. \u201cThe State, no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 47, 87 S.Ct., at 247,17 L.Ed.2d, at 156.

Congress has done just that in sections 1507 and 13k for the Supreme Court Building and the narrow fringe of grounds that surround it. The principles announced in the <em>Cox </em>decisions, and particularly in <em>Adderley </em>and <em>Greer v. Spock, </em>sustain the constitutional validity of such statutes when uniformly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">Plaintiffs argue that the decision in <em>Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police, </em>342 F.Supp. 575 (D.D.C.) (three-judge court) <em>(\u201cJeannette Rankin II\u201d), aff\u2019d mem., </em>409 U.S. 972, 93 S.Ct. 311, 34 L.Ed.2d 236 (1972), is contrary authority. Not so. The court in that case held a statute similar to section 13k that applied to the Capitol Building and grounds to be facially unconstitutional. But Congress occupies the Capitol, and its function, the extent of its \u201cgrounds\u201d and their historical use differ substantially from the purpose to which the Supreme Court Building and its narrow grounds are dedicated and used. Congress and the Supreme Court also differ substantially in structure, operation and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">In the first place the comparative areas of the respective \u201cgrounds\u201d of the Capitol and the Supreme Court are greatly disproportionate. The Supreme Court grounds comprise slightly less than two and one-half normal city blocks, most of which are occupied by the Supreme Court Building.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Capitol grounds, on the other hand, extend from the Union Station approximately ten blocks South to D Street, S.W. (about a mile), and, at its widest point, from Second Street, S.E., seven blocks to Third Street, S.W., comprising an irregular area of at least 60 square blocks.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This immense area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>covers the environs of the Capitol, the Senate Office Buildings, the House Office Buildings, the congressional garages, and extends to all the surrounding streets and the very extensive park-like grounds and walks. The area even includes the detached area surrounding the Capitol Power Plant, several blocks to the south of the Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">Judge McGowan\u2019s decision in <em>Jeannette Rankin II </em>recognized that \u201c[w]hether the Capitol Grounds is an area to which access cannot be denied broadly or absolutely depends ... on whether it has been ordinarily open to the public ... or whether ... the uses for which it has traditionally been put are inconsistent with demonstrations and mass assemblies.\u201d 342 F.Supp. at 583-84. In referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cox II </em>the <em>Rankin II </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE\">In <em>Cox II </em>... the Supreme Court upheld a state statute which banned parades and picketing \u201cin or near courthouses\u201d which have the \u201cintent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or ... the intent of influencing any judge [or] juror.... \u201d The Court felt that the integrity of the judicial process could not survive in an atmosphere of mob excitement. But while, as Judge Bazelon said (dissenting in <em>Jeannette Rankin [I], </em>[421 F.2d 1090 (D.C.Cir. 1969)]), <em>\u201ctraditionally, the judiciary does not decide cases by reference to popular opinion,\u201d the fundamental function of a legislature in a democratic society assumes accessibility to such opinion. </em>Moreover, the Capitol Grounds defined in this statute are so extensive that demonstrations which may take place upon them might not be \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cin the immediate vicinity of\u201d the Capitol itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACx\">342 F.Supp. at 584 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">The area of the Supreme Court thus differs from the Capitol grounds in three particulars: (1) the traditional use of the Supreme Court grounds has been inconsistent with demonstrations, mass assemblies, and picketing \u2014 and it has never become a public forum; (2) the fundamental function of the Supreme Court does not assume accessibility to street opinion conveyed by parading mass assemblages and individual picketing; and (3) the Supreme Court grounds are so small that demonstrations and picketing upon them would be \u201cnear\u201d and \u201cin the immediate vicinity of\u201d the Supreme Court Building itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">The applicable statutes serve the important and substantial governmental interest of maintaining \u201corder and decorum\u201d for the entire Court area and preserving the \u201cappearance of justice.\u201d Judges, lawyers, litigants and the general public are able to enter and leave the Court and go about their business or activity free from the importuning that necessarily follows having pamphlets pressed upon them and signs and banners confront them for every conceivable political, judicial and personal cause. The statutes are necessary to preserve the ideal of \u201cEqual Justice Under Law\u201d and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>avoid the existence or appearance of outside pressure or influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">In contrast to the purpose of the Capitol, the declared purpose of the Supreme Court Building is to furnish the citizens of this nation a <em>due process </em>environment in which the nation\u2019s most important judicial issues may be presented, heard and decided without even the semblance of influence by street pressures. Order and decorum within the building and its surroundings are required if this necessary objective is to be guaranteed. The Supreme Court is the center of an area where the rule of law is intended to prevail and extraneous pressures are not permitted. The Supreme Court decides cases based upon the rule of law, not upon the level of public pressure that might be generated by mass assemblages and other public activities within the Supreme Court Building or on the adjacent grounds and walkways. The Court should not be subjected even to the subtle pressures of allegedly innocuous picketing and leafleting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">The governmental interest in the order and decorum surrounding the Supreme Court, as reflected in the questioned statute, is unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The proper application of this statute is demonstrated by the fact that the Supreme Court Marshal follows a uniform rule of prohibiting activity without reference to expressive content. The Marshal thus does not suppress any particular views or just views that he or the court does not wish to hear. There is no prior restraint of any particular viewpoint. All are treated equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">Appellants\u2019 real objective here is to establish a <em>public forum </em>on the narrow grounds surrounding the Supreme Court. It appears that their plan was carefully devised and followed legal advice. Complaint H 16. But the areas within the Supreme Court Building and grounds have never been dedicated to that purpose. To permit such conduct now would subvert the Supreme Court in its effort to provide due process and \u201cEqual Justice Under Law.\u201d What would start as two lonely peaceful pickets today would eventually lead to the hordes of tomorrow,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> bannering and distributing leaflets (in a peaceful manner) on abortion, school busing, prayers in public schools, civil rights, greater rights for the press and media* free speech, <em>Miranda, </em>the exclusionary rule, search and seizure, obscenity, and a host of other issues. That appellants seek to establish a public forum to picket, etc., on <em>past </em>decisions and possible <em>future </em>cases is apparent from their suggestion for limiting the reach of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507. They argue that it should only apply to cases <em>currently pending in the Supreme Court </em>There are so many potential judicial issues that are the subject of on-going public campaigns and movements that even though a specific case involving the precise issue may not at a particular moment be <em>sub judice </em>in the Supreme Court, there is a strong likelihood that the issue will sometime come before the Court. In view of such fact and the wide range that would be open for seeking reversal of past decisions, it would be unreasonable and unrealistic to limit the statute only to pending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">For all of the above reasons, I dissent from the majority\u2019s effort to establish a public forum within the Supreme Court Building and grounds.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-18\">. The Marshal stated he was acting under \u201cTitle 40, United States Code,\u201d and that includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>authority to apply 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507. See note 5 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">. Although Zywicki went to the Supreme Court three different times, the purpose on his February 4, 1980 visit is not clear. The record indicates only that he sought \u201cto distribute leaflets concerning political and human oppression in Guatemala.\u201d For purposes of adjudging the constitutional question presented, 1 will not distinguish this incident from the one that occurred on January 8, 1980, when Zywicki distributed pamphlets containing an invitation to religious meetings concerning political and human rights problems in Central America.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">. Grace\u2019s conduct also appears to fall within the prohibitions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507, the constitutionality of which is not here challenged. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-6\">Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or <em>with the intent of influencing any judge, </em>juror, witness, or <em>court officer, in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the United States, </em>or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence, <em>shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqd-dedup-0\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507 (emphasis added). Grace alleged that, after learning that some expressive conduct was not permitted at the Supreme Court, she carried her sign containing the First Amendment at the Court because she was \u201calarmed that a statute could prohibit peaceful freedom of expression on the grounds of the Supreme Court.\u201d Complaint j[ 9. A reasonable inference could be drawn from Grace\u2019s behavior that she came to the Court intending to influence a \u201cjudge ... or court officer\u201d to rule that the law concerning public demonstrations at the Court was in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">The majority finds it unnecessary to determine whether appellants\u2019 conduct was related to the business of the court, and hence a possible violation of \u00a7 1507. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"acu-dedup-0\">This is anomalous since appellants sought to enjoin defendants, their agents, employees or persons acting on their behalf from enforcing in any manner against any person the provisions of 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(k) or <em>any other law or regulation which is applied to prohibit activity akin to that involved in the instant case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-12\">Complaint 1J 31C (emphasis added). Since the majority has treated this case as raising the issue only of the facial construction of \u00a7 13k, I will limit my remarks similarly. It would appear, however, that in determining what relief should be granted it might be concluded that appellants are not entitled to an injunction to prohibit the Supreme Court police from prohibiting \u201cactivity akin to that involved in the instant case\u201d since it is arguably prohibited by \u00a7 1507. It should be added that further inquiry might show that Zywicki intended to influence the court on either or both of the occasions when he distributed handbills at the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1310-13\">. The majority states that it is not \u201csuggesting] that any individual may picket or leaflet in the Supreme Court building itself.\u201d Maj. op. at 1205. It is unusual that the majority would make such a statement, since it today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>holds unconstitutional the only statute that would prohibit such conduct not aimed at influencing the court. The statement is apparently a recognition of the strong governmental interest in order and decorum within the Supreme Court Building. I do not think this strong interest in order and decorum diminishes materially when the conduct takes place on the narrow grounds that surround the building, rather than in the building itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">. They are both enforceable by the Marshal under 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 13n.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">. In my view the statute should be construed in line with <em>Lambert v. California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957) to insure that innocent people who did not have knowledge of the statute would not be arrested. From appellants\u2019 complaint it appears that the statute has been applied in such manner. In <em>Lambert </em>the court reversed a conviction under a Los Ange-les ordinance that prohibited a convicted felon from remaining in the city for more than 5 days without registering with the Chief of Police because there was no evidence that the defendant knew of the registration requirement. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-14\">[T]his appellant on first becoming aware of her duty to register was given no opportunity to comply with the law and avoid its penalty, even though her default was entirely innocent. . .. We believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">355 U.S. at 229, 78 S.Ct. at 243.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">.
