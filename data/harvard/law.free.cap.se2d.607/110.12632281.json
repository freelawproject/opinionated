Also at issue is Code \u00a7 18.2-282, which makes it a Class 1 misdemeanor to point, hold, or brandish a firearm in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a two-count indictment, Donovan Payne Morris (Morris) was charged with possession of a firearm, to-wit, a flare pistol, after having been convicted of a felony, and with brandishing a firearm. In a bench trial, Morris was convicted of both offenses and sentenced to five years' imprisonment with three years suspended on the possession charge and to twelve months on the brandishing charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One of the judges of the Court of Appeals denied Morris's petition for appeal.\n   <em>\n    Morris v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 3395-02-4 (August 5, 2003). For the reasons assigned in that order, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals also denied Morris an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Morris v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 3395-02-4 (October 30, 2003). We awarded Morris this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The record establishes that Morris has a string of nine felony convictions dating back to 1977. With respect to the present offenses, the evidence shows that on June 20, 2002, Peter Molina, an engraver of tombstones, was working in an Alexandria cemetery accompanied by his wife, who was his business partner. Morris appeared on the scene, dragging a bicycle and smelling of\n   alcohol. He sat on a tombstone, staring at Molina and his wife, cursing and mumbling. After about five minutes, Morris looked at Molina's wife and said, \"I'd like that.\" When Molina asked Morris what he had said, Morris stood up, \"raised up his shirt,\" and \"showed [Molina] this gun he had in his waistband.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because Molina did not know \"what the situation was or what the situation could be,\" he became \"worried about\" his wife's safety and decided he \"needed to get her out of there.\" They got into their truck and, as they were leaving the cemetery, they encountered Officer Vincent Omundson of the Alexandria Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Molina told Officer Omundson \"there was a man back there with a gun in his waistband.\" Omundson, armed with a shotgun, found Morris sitting on \"a stump or a bucket,\" drinking beer. When Omundson told Morris to put down his drink and raise his hands, Morris responded by reaching under his shirt, pulling out the flare gun, and throwing it into some grass about twenty-five feet away. After some resistance from Morris, Omundson arrested him and retrieved the flare gun. One \"fired round\" of ammunition was found in the flare gun and three \"loaded rounds\" were found on Morris's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In keeping with familiar principles, we will consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below.\n   <em>\n    Dowden v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"516233\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/260/459/#p461\">\n    260 Va. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20S.E.2d%20437\">\n    536 S.E.2d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438 (2000). However, since the statutes at issue here are penal in nature, they must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth, and any ambiguity or reasonable doubt as to their meaning must be resolved in Morris's favor.\n   <em>\n    See Ansell v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2133447\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/219/759/#p761\">\n    219 Va. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=250%20S.E.2d%20760\">\n    250 S.E.2d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (1979). But this does not mean that Morris is entitled to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=250%20S.E.2d%20760\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Possession of a Firearm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As noted previously, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 proscribes the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. While this Code section does not define the term \"firearm,\" we held in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205169\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/263/573/\">\n    263 Va. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20S.E.2d%20139\">\n    562 S.E.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), that \"in order to sustain a conviction for possessing a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the evidence need show only that a person subject to the provisions of that statute possessed an instrument which was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205169\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/263/573/\">\n    263 Va. at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20S.E.2d%20139\">\n    562 S.E.2d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Morris was certainly a person subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. He contends, however, that the Commonwealth did not prove that a flare gun is a firearm as the latter term is defined in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong, i.e.,\n   </em>\n   an instrument which was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We disagree with Morris. Detective William Bunney of the Alexandria Police Department was recognized by the trial court as \"an expert in the field of firearms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Bunney examined Morris's flare gun and test-fired it, using two of the three rounds of ammunition recovered from Morris's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Detective Bunney testified that the flare gun operated \"the way it was intended to by the manufacturer, meaning [the] hammer comes back, stays in the locked position until the trigger is pulled and the hammer falls forward, and when it falls forward, the firing pin falls forward of the breech plate so that it will strike the primer of the shell to ignite\n   the primer, to ignite the propellant, to send a projectile downrange.\" Detective Bunney explained that the primer is \"sort of like a dynamite cap. It's an initiator of ... a larger explosion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Detective Bunney also testified that a round of ammunition identical to that found on Morris's person contains a projectile made up of a metal cap holding a mixture of black powder and paraffin. The detective said that black powder is an explosive and that it was the cause of \"a burnt residue\" found inside the empty cartridges of the two rounds of ammunition used in the test-firing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the test-firing, Detective Bunney set up a paper target \"at the approximately 25 yard line\" of the firing range. When he pulled the trigger on the flare gun, he \"felt a decidable recoil within the firearm\" and \"[s]moke appeared at the muzzle end.\" He saw \"an object leave the barrel,\" saw \"an object... hit the paper [target],\" and heard a \"metallic object strike a metallic object further downrange.\" A metal deflection guard was in place \"at the further end of the range.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first time Detective Bunney fired the flare gun, he used only a paper target. The shot traveled through the paper and produced two holes. On the second shot, the detective backed up the paper target with a cardboard target. The shot traveled through the paper and the cardboard and produced two holes. Detective Bunney likened his test-firing of the flare gun with his experience in firing a 12-gauge shotgun \"at medium to short distances,\" where one hole is created in a target by the projectile and one is created by wadding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Detective Bunney was asked whether the trigger, hammer, barrel or breech, and firing pin of the flare gun were \"consistent or inconsistent with other firearms with which [the detective was] familiar.\" He answered, \"[c]onsistent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth proved that Morris possessed an instrument that was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Morris argues, however, that under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that he \"knowingly and intentionally\" possessed a firearm. Citing\n   <em>\n    Staples v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/\">\n    511 U.S. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), Morris states that \"[a]n essential element of the crime that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is mens rea, scienter, or criminal intent,\" yet the Commonwealth did not show that he \"knew that [his] flare gun was a firearm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Morris cites a stipulation entered into below stating that flare pistols and flares are sold at a retail store in Alexandria; that these items are not kept under lock and key; that the store has no minimum age of purchase for the items, does not require registration of the items or a waiting period for their purchase, observes no restriction on the sale of the items, and does not require a potential purchaser to produce identification. Morris then says that \"[t]here is apparently little to no regulation of who may purchase or possess flare guns in Virginia\" and that \"[n]o average, reasonable person would ever consider that possession of [a] plastic safety device that can be purchased with no restrictions and is not otherwise regulated would subject them to criminal liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We reject Morris's argument that he did not know a flare gun is a firearm. He admitted\n   in his testimony that he had seen flare guns fired before, and when asked whether he had \"any idea that the flare gun was capable of expelling a projectile by means of an explosion,\" he evaded the question, saying that \"to me it's a safety device, you know, of somebody being on a boat, of somebody in trouble ... to me it ain't no gun.\" Morris also testified that he had never fired the flare gun, that he had bought it for $10.00 from \"this guy on the street\" and planned to sell it to \"the owner of the graveyard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Morris has not explained, however, why, if he thought the flare device \"ain't no gun,\" he felt it necessary to try to dispose of the device when Officer Omundson arrived on the scene. Nor has Morris explained how, if he had never fired the flare gun, it just so happened that a fired round of ammunition was found in its chamber. In any event, the trial court was not bound to credit the testimony of Morris, a convicted felon. Indeed, the trial judge said he found Morris's testimony \"questionable at the least for a variety of reasons.\" And, upon finding Morris's testimony unworthy of belief, the trial judge could draw the reasonable inference that Morris testified falsely \"in an effort to conceal his guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Covil v.

He used [the flare gun] for essentially a criminal purpose.\" We agree with the trial judge and conclude that the evidence was sufficient to show that Morris knowingly and intentionally possessed a firearm within the intendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brandishing a Firearm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   Morris was charged with pointing, holding, or brandishing a firearm in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-282. Morris argues \"[t]here was insufficient evidence that [he] pointed, held or brandished the firearm, and there was insufficient evidence that there was reasonable fear in the mind of Peter Molina.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Morris says that although Peter Molina saw the flare gun in Morris's waistband, he never testified that he was in fear of the gun. Morris asserts that Molina, solely out of concern for his wife, insisted that they should leave the area where Morris was sitting. Indeed, Morris states, Molina indicated in his testimony that he \"may have stayed where he was had his wife not been there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Morris says further that he \"never touched the gun in the presence\" of Molina or his wife and there is no evidence that \"he pointed the flare gun.\" Hence, Morris concludes, the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction for brandishing a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We disagree with Morris. \"Brandish\" means \"to exhibit or expose in an ostentatious, shameless, or aggressive manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary,\n   </em>\n   268 (1993). When Morris looked at Ms. Molina, said \"[he'd] like that,\" and then\n   pulled up his shirt to uncover the flare gun, he exhibited or exposed the weapon in a shameless or aggressive manner. And Morris brandished the weapon in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of Peter Molina. Although Molina may not have said he was in fear for his own safety, he stated unequivocally that he feared for the safety of his wife, and that is sufficient to prove the \"induced fear\" element of a conviction for brandishing a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-282.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finding no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals, we will affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Code \u00a7 18.2-282 makes it a Class 6 felony to point, hold, or brandish a firearm on or within 1000 feet of school property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The question in\n    <em>\n     Armstrong\n    </em>\n    was whether, in a prosecution for violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the Commonwealth is required to prove as an element of the offense that the object possessed by the defendant was an \"operable\" firearm.
