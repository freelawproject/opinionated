The father argues on appeal primarily that the record contains insufficient evidence to support the termination of the father's parental rights. After reviewing the record, we hold that the trial court's findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, and those findings support the trial court's conclusion of law that the father was neglecting M.S.B. Because the record contains nothing to suggest that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the best interests of M.S.B. required termination, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 3 June 2002, M.S.B.'s mother relinquished custody of her three children, including M.S.B., to the Harnett County Department of Social Services (\"Harnett DSS\"). Prior to that date, M.S.B. and her two siblings lived with their mother in a car. Harnett DSS placed the children in foster care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after the mother relinquished custody, a Harnett DSS social worker contacted the father, who lived in Sampson County, and asked him to make a plan of care for M.S.B. The father, accompanied by his grandmother, went to Harnett DSS and requested that he be given custody of the child. Harnett DSS then requested the Sampson County Department of Social Services (\"Sampson DSS\") to conduct a home study and determine whether custody of M.S.B. could be given to the father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 13 September 2002, a Sampson DSS social worker, Sandra Hines, met with the father to evaluate his plan of care for M.S.B. Sampson DSS learned that the father did not have his own home, but instead was residing with his grandmother who had recently adopted two of her own grandchildren. The grandmother and grandchildren were living in a two-bedroom home with M.S.B.'s father sleeping on his grandmother's sofa. The father had no plan for where M.S.B. would sleep, was unemployed, and was considering traveling to Kentucky to find work. Because the father did not have a job and did not have a plan to care for M.S.B., Sampson DSS did not recommend giving the father custody of the child. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-909 (2003), Harnett DSS sought review of the child's placement at a hearing scheduled for 22 November 2002. The hearing was ultimately continued because the father had not been formally served and was not present. His grandmother was present, but indicated that she had been unable to provide transportation for the father due to inclement weather conditions. On 13 December 2002, the court reviewed the status of the child's placement, concluding that the permanent plan for the child should be adoption and Harnett DSS should proceed to terminate the father's parental rights. The father did not attend this hearing either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Harnett DSS filed a petition to terminate the father's parental rights on 28 January 2003. In that petition, Harnett DSS alleged that the father had (1) neglected the child, (2) willfully failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care for the child during the previous six months while the child was in foster care, and (3) abandoned the child and showed a willful desire to forego his parental rights. Following an evidentiary hearing on 8 August 2003, the trial court entered an order on 29 September 2003 terminating the father's parental rights based on all the grounds alleged in the petition. The father filed a timely notice of appeal from this order on 3 October 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A termination of parental rights proceeding involves two separate analytical phases: an adjudicatory stage and a dispositional stage.\n   <em>\n    In re Blackburn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9442570\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/142/607/#p610\">\n    142 N.C.

After reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court's determination that the father neglected M.S.B. is supported by the findings of fact, and those findings were based upon competent evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(1) (2003), a court may terminate parental rights if the parent has neglected the child. A neglected juvenile is defined by the General Statutes as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A juvenile who does not receive proper care, supervision, or discipline from the juvenile's parent, guardian, custodian, or caretaker; or who has been abandoned; or who is not provided necessary medical care; or who is not provided necessary remedial care; or who lives in an environment injurious to the juvenile's welfare; or who has been placed for care or adoption in violation of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-101(15) (2003). In this case, the district court found that the father neglected his child because he (1) had failed to have contact with M.S.B. while she lived with her mother; (2) had little or no contact with Harnett DSS to inquire about the child's welfare while in foster care; (3) had never sent the child a card or a birthday present; (4) did not have an appropriate plan for the child's care and supervision; and (5) failed to pay childsupport to the mother and Harnett DSS in order to assist with the child's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   These findings, if supported by competent evidence, are sufficient to warrant a conclusion of neglect.\n   <em>\n    See In re Yocum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186618\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/158/198/#p204\">\n    158 N.C.

Our review of the record in this case reveals that there is sufficient evidence to support the district court's findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Father's Contact with M.S.B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In findings of fact 10 and 29, the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   10. The juvenile was born out-of-wedlock. The respondent father has had no contact with the juvenile since her birth and she has not had any ties or bonds with the father's family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   29. The father's failure to contact the petitioner to inquire about the child was an act of neglect. The father's failure to send cards and presents was an act of neglect. Such acts of neglect were a complete forbearance of his parental rights and obligations to his child. These failures to attend to his child occurred after he was aware the child was in the custody of the petitioner. The father left the State and went to Kentucky. He knew about scheduled court hearings concerning his child but he did not attend them. His actions of neglect and failure to assume his parent[al] rights and obligations were done knowingly and willfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The father argues there is insufficient evidence for the trial court to find that the \"father has had no contact with the juvenile since her birth and she has not had any ties or bonds with the father's family.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We note first that the father has not assigned error to finding of fact number 25, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Since the child was placed with the petitioner in June 2002, the father has not sent thechild any presents or birthday cards. He has not called to ask about her welfare. He has not attempted to contact her. All the contacts made by the father to the petitioner were in response to the social worker's request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Findings of fact that are not challenged on appeal \"are deemed supported by competent evidence\" and are binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    In re Padgett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191956\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/156/644/#p648\">\n    156 N.C. App. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20S.E.2d%20337\">\n    577 S.E.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition, findings of fact 10 and 29 are supported by the testimony of Sandra Hines, who testified that the father told her that he had no contact with the child since she was born. Additionally, Anne Verdin, a social worker for Harnett DSS, testified that the father told her that he had had no contact with the child since she was \"very, very small.\" Verdin also testified that the father failed to contact her for months while the child was in the custody of Harnett DSS, either to inquire about how the child was doing or to offer a plan for her care, and that the father had not sent any presents or cards to the child while she was in DSS custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There is also evidence to support the determination in finding 29 that the father knew about the scheduled court hearings, but failed to attend them. While the father was not present at the 22 November 2002 hearing, his grandmother attended and indicated that the father could not attend due to inclement weather - even though he was living with or next door to his grandmother at the time. The hearing was continued until 13 December 2002, and the order from that hearing notes that the matter was properly noticed. Thetrial court was entitled to draw the inference from these facts that the father knew of the hearings, but chose not to attend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Lack of a Plan of Care and Supervision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The father assigned error to finding of fact number 14, in which the trial court found that the father did not have an appropriate plan of care for the child at the time he was staying with his grandmother. Sandra Hines, however, testified that the father told her that he was unemployed, that he had no home of his own, and that he was staying on his grandmother's couch. The father offered that the child could stay with his grandmother, but she had just adopted two of her own grandchildren and there was no place for the child to sleep. Hines did not recommend the father's plan for the child because there was no room for the child in the grandmother's house and the father was unemployed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the father's testimony indicated that he later did have his own apartment, his only plan for financially caring for M.S.B. at that time was a pending, but unapproved, claim for disability. Based upon this evidence, the trial court was entitled to find that the father lacked an appropriate plan of care for M.S.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to Pay Child Support\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to the findings on child support, the father first argues that the trial court relied upon inadmissible hearsay to find that he had failed to pay child support. Specifically, the father objects to the testimony of Sandra Hines because he argues that she did not have personal knowledge of his failure to make payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We need not decide whether Hines' testimony was inadmissible hearsay because its admission was not prejudicial. \"Where improperly admitted evidence merely corroborates testimony from other witnesses, we have found the error harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ct. 1464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). At the termination hearing, Ann Verdin and Paulette Howard both testified without objection that the father had failed to pay child support to Sampson DSS and Harnett DSS and was in arrears as to M.S.B.'s mother. Thus, any error in the admission of Hines' testimony was harmless. The father does not otherwise assign error to the trial court's finding that he did not pay child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Instead, the father argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that he had the ability to earn income that he could have contributed to the support of the child. While the father assigns error to finding of fact 23 that he could earn some income, the father did not assign error to findings 17, 18, 19, or 21, which state: 17. While the child was in the custody of her mother, a child support action was commenced and an order was entered requiring the father to pay child support to the mother. The last child support payment made by the father to the mother was on April 17, 2002. He made no further payments of child support to the mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   18. Since the child was placed with the petitioner, the father made no child support payment[s] to the petitioner; he has not offered or made any contribution to the support of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   19. The father is a college graduate with a four year degree in business engineering. He is a veteran of the United States Army.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   21. In December 2002, the father left Clinton NC for the State of Kentucky to work. He testified he sold his property in Clinton, NC and moved to Kentucky. The father stayed in Kentucky and worked until April 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   These uncontested findings establish that defendant had the ability to earn some income that he could have contributed to the child's support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Even without considering the unchallenged findings of fact, the record contains evidence that the father had the ability to earn income and contribute to the support of M.S.B. The father's own testimony shows that (1) he had two different jobs in Kentucky before he returned to Clinton, (2) that he was employed in Clinton for a short period of time after his return, and (3) that he was employed in Kentucky immediately before and after the filing of the petition. This evidence supports the trial court's finding that hewas able to earn some income during the lifetime of M.S.B., including while the child was in the custody of Harnett DSS, that he could have, but did not, contribute to the welfare of the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See In re Faircloth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8958991\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/161/523/#p526\">\n    161 N.C.

The termination of parental rights statute provides: Should the court determine that any one or more of the conditions authorizing a termination of the parental rights of a parent exist, the court shall issue an order terminating the parental rights of such parent with respect to the juvenile unless the court shall further determine that the best interests of the juvenile require that the parental rights of the parent not be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   N.C.

Stat. \u00a7 7A-289.31(a) (1998)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The father first argues that the trial court's failure to make a clear distinction between the \"grounds\" phase and the \"best interest\" phase \"muddied the waters\" between the two stages. Although there are two separate stages requiring application of two different standards in a termination of parental rights proceeding, the court does not have to conduct two separate hearings.\n   <em>\n    In re Carr,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8524252\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/116/403/#p407\">\n    116 N.C.

In this case, the father has not pointed to anything in the record indicating that the trial court failed to apply the proper standards. The father argues only that the trial judge's reference in the same sentence to both \"clear and cogent\" evidence and that a termination of parental rights was in M.S.B.'s best interests suggests that the trial court did not distinguish between the two standards. We do not believe that a reference to \"clear and cogent\" evidence rather than \"clear, cogent and convincing\" evidence is anything more than a\n   <em>\n    lapsus linguae.\n   </em>\n   Further, the mention of both standards simply reflects the dual nature of these proceedings. After independently reviewing the record, we have identified nothing that suggests the trial court failed to properly recognize the different stages and applicable standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the father argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it terminated his parental rights because he should have been given more time, and DSS should have made a greater effort, to reunify him with his child. The trial court's findings, many of which are not assigned as error, show a lack of contact between the father and the child beginning shortly after the birth of M.S.B.; an ongoing lack of concern for M.S.B. on the part of the father; and a failure by the father to continue to pay child support. The trial court was entitled to conclude that the father had been given ample opportunity to demonstrate his interest in andconcern for M.S.B. and that allowing him further time was not in the best interests of M.S.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In light of the court's findings and the underlying evidence, we cannot say that the trial court's decision that it was in the best interests of the child to terminate the father's parental rights was an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See Yocum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186618\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/158/198/#p204\">\n    158 N.C.
