Martin and Ziherl were unmarried adults in a sexually active relationship from approximately October 31, 2001 through November 3, 2003. Martin experienced a vaginal outbreak in June 2003, which her physician diagnosed as herpes. Martin filed a motion for judgment against Ziherl alleging that he knew he was infected with the sexually transmitted herpes virus when he and Martin were engaged in unprotected sexual conduct, knew that the virus was contagious, and failed to inform Martin of his condition. In the two-count motion for judgment, Martin asserted claims of negligence, intentional battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress and sought compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ziherl filed a demurrer asserting that Martin's injuries were caused by her participation in an illegal act and therefore, under\n   <em>\n    Zysk,\n   </em>\n   the motion for judgment did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Following a hearing, the trial court applied\n   <em>\n    Zysk\n   </em>\n   and sustained Ziherl's demurrer holding that\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   did not \"strike down\" Code \u00a7 18.2-344 and that valid reasons such as the protection of public health and encouraging marriage for the procreation of children are \"rationally related to achieve the objective of the statute.\" We awarded Martin an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before turning to the merits of Martin's appeal, we consider Ziherl's assertion that Martin lacks \"standing\" to challenge the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-344. In making his \"standing\" argument, Ziherl refers to the lack of real or threatened prosecution of Martin under Code \u00a7 18.2-344 and states that invalidation of the statute would not impact her liberty interest but, instead, would only allow her to maintain her action for damages. Regardless of the approach, well established law precludes us from considering Ziherl's \"standing\" challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A basic principle of appellate review is that, with few exceptions not relevant here, arguments made for the first time on appeal will not be considered. Ziherl did not assert before the trial court that Martin lacked \"standing\" to challenge the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-344. We have repeatedly held that challenges to a litigant's standing must be raised at the trial level, and the failure to do so precludes consideration of a litigant's standing by this Court on appeal.

In the case at bar, the Court's decision on the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-344 will determine Martin's right to pursue her tort claim for damages.

The issue in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   as stated by the Court, was \"whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 564.

Second, individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Using this rationale, the Supreme Court found that the Texas statute criminalizing a specific sexual act between two persons of the same sex violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because such statute improperly abridged a personal relationship that was within the liberty interest of persons to choose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    at 578-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find no principled way to conclude that the specific act of intercourse is not an element of a personal relationship between two unmarried persons or that the Virginia statute criminalizing intercourse between unmarried persons does not improperly abridge a personal relationship that is within the liberty interest of persons to choose. Because Code \u00a7 18.2-334, like the Texas statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   is an attempt by the state to control the liberty interest which is exercised in making these personal decisions, it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ziherl argues, and the trial court held, that Code \u00a7 18.2-344 withstands constitutional scrutiny because \"[v]alid public reasons for the law exist,\" including protection of public health and \"encouraging that children be born into a family consisting of a married couple.\" Regardless of the merit of the policies referred to by the trial court, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   indicated that such policies are insufficient to sustain the statute's constitutionality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Supreme Court did not consider the liberty right vindicated in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   as a fundamental constitutional right which could be infringed only if the statute in question satisfied the strict scrutiny test. Rather, the Court applied a rational basis test, but held that \"[t]he Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This statement is not limited to state interests offered by the state of Texas in support of its statute, but sweeps within it all manner of states' interests and finds them insufficient when measured against the intrusion upon a person's liberty interest when that interest is exercised in the form of private, consensual sexual conduct between adults. As we have said, this same liberty interest is invoked in this case when two unmarried adults make the choice to engage in the intimate sexual conduct proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-344. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   the Commonwealth's interests do not warrant such encroachment on personal liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Therefore, applying the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   as Martin asks us to do, leads us to conclude that Code \u00a7 18.2-344 is unconstitutional because by subjecting certain private sexual conduct between two consenting adults to criminal penalties it infringes on the rights of adults to \"engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is important to note that this case does not involve minors, non-consensual activity, prostitution, or public activity. The\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   court indicated that state regulation of that type of activity might support a different result. Our holding, like that of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   addresses only private, consensual conduct between adults and the respective statutes' impact on such conduct. Our holding does not affect the Commonwealth's police power regarding regulation of public fornication, prostitution, or other such crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We now turn to the application of\n   <em>\n    Zysk\n   </em>\n   to this case. The rule applied in\n   <em>\n    Zysk\n   </em>\n   was that \"a party who consents to and participates in an immoral and illegal act cannot recover damages from other participants for the consequence of that act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2106859\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/239/32/\">\n    239 Va. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20S.E.2d%20721\">\n    404 S.E.2d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Bennett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2154833\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/190/162/#p164\">\n    190 Va. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20S.E.2d%20217\">\n    56 S.E.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (1949)). We adhere to that rule. However, in light of our determination regarding the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-344, the sexual activity between Martin and Ziherl was not illegal and \"the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    539 U.S. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Zysk\n   </em>\n   is no longer controlling precedent to the extent that its holding applies to private, consensual sexual intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Indeed, but for the nature of the sexual act, the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-344 are identical to those of the Texas statute which\n    <em>\n     Lawrence\n    </em>\n    determined to be unconstitutional.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-33\">\n   Chief Justice HASSELL, concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I concur in the judgment of the majority.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
