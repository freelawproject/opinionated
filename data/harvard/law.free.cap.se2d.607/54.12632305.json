The trial court consolidated the two offenses for judgment and sentenced him to an active prison term of thirty-four to fifty months. Defendant filed timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show that April Denise Miller (\"Miller\") went to defendant's house to dry some clothes at 7:00 p.m. on 2 September 2002. Miller, who had been dating defendant for approximately six months at the time, brought her four children with her. More than twenty people were at defendant's residence when she arrived. Defendant and Rodney Maddix (\"Maddix\") wereinside \"playing cards and drinking[.]\" While she and her children were waiting for the clothes to dry, Maddix suggested that he and defendant \"go fight the dogs.\" Defendant declined and stayed in the house while Maddix went outside, where his dog was subsequently killed in a dog fight. When Maddix came back inside threatening to \"go[] home [and] get his gun[,]\" defendant asked him to leave. Defendant then told Miller to leave with her children, because he did not \"know what[] [was] getting ready to jump off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As defendant and Miller were talking, Maddix telephoned and had a conversation with defendant. Defendant became \"very upset\" and \"was saying that [Miller] had told [Maddix] something.\" Believing that alcohol \"had a lot to do with\" defendant's distress, Miller told him, \"[w]ell, you-all are drinking, let's talk about this another day.\" Defendant walked out with Miller as she gathered her children into the van, but returned to the house when his phone rang. As Miller was preparing to leave, defendant came back outside and approached her van. Visibly angry, he said something to Miller in a \"raised\" voice and punched out her van's driver's side window. As defendant raised his arm to strike the blow, Miller saw \"a handgun tucked down his pants.\" Miller hurriedly put the van in reverse, and was backing into the road when she saw \"a lot of gunshots\" coming from defendant's direction in the front of the house and \"from the side of the house also.\" When Miller arrived at a stop sign, she saw that her eight-year-old daughter, Jasmine, had been shot in the left side of her abdomen. Miller drove to Earl Depot and called paramedics, who took herdaughter to the hospital. Miller remained \"good friends\" with defendant following the episode. Although they never discussed the shooting, defendant told Miller that \"if he did it he's sorry.\" Miller did not see anyone else with a gun at defendant's house on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At 10:45 p.m. on 2 September 2002, Cleveland County Sheriff's Detective Gary Hogue was paged by his sergeant and responded to the report of a shooting at 2814 Bettis Road. Hogue first went to Earl Depot and examined Miller's van, which had a \"flat tire on it, a busted out window, and what appeared to be . . . a shattered window right behind the driver's side window on the left side.\" Hogue then proceeded to 2814 Bettis Road, where he located a cluster of five nine-millimeter shell casings in the driveway. He also found clear shattered glass both on the driveway next to the residence and \"in the roadway just off of the driveway.\" Hogue conducted \"a walk of the yard\" and found a dead dog behind the residence, but did not find any additional shell casings or evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After leaving Bettis Road, Hogue spoke with Miller at Cleveland Regional Medical Center. Miller told Hogue that defendant \"shot at the vehicle\" as she was backing out of the driveway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his first argument on appeal, defendant claims the trial court erred in allowing Hogue to testify regarding Miller's out-of-court statement that defendant shot at her vehicle while she was backing out of his driveway. While acknowledging that a witness' prior consistent statement is admissible for corroborativepurposes, defendant contends that Miller's statement to Hogue actually contradicted her trial testimony and was erroneously admitted under the guise of corroborative evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under North Carolina law, \"a witness' prior consistent statements may be admitted to corroborate the witness' `trial' testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court further ruled admissible Jovanta's prior statement that he thought he heard three gunshots, which differed from his trial testimony that he heard two shots.

Miller testified that defendant came outto her van with a handgun, and was so angry that he smashed her window with his fist while saying something to her in a \"raised\" voice. Miller further affirmed that, as she attempted to drive away, she saw gunshots \"come from the direction of [defendant].\" When she reached the end of the street, Miller noticed that Jasmine had been shot. Miller also testified that defendant later told her that \"if he did it he's sorry.\" Nothing in her out-of-court statement that defendant \"shot at the vehicle\" contradicted her trial testimony. As in\n   <em>\n    Lloyd,\n   </em>\n   Miller's statement to the detective at the hospital was a \"shorthand statement of fact\" reasonably drawn from her observations at defendant's residence, as detailed in her trial testimony.\n   <em>\n    Lloyd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"138508\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/354/76/\">\n    354 N.C. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20S.E.2d%20596\">\n    552 S.E.2d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to defendant's assertion, Miller's statement to the detective on the night of the shooting in no way contradicted her trial testimony. Miller did not testify that defendant did not fire his gun, that he fired it in a direction other than at her van, or that she saw someone other than defendant fire the shots at her van.\n   <em>\n    See generally Baity,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"790124\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/340/65/#p70\">\n    340 N.C. at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=455%20S.E.2d%20621\">\n    455 S.E.2d at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, we overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant next claims the admission of Miller's hearsay statement to Hogue \"constituted reversible error in that there was a reasonable possibility that a different result would have beenreached had the pretrial statement not been admitted.\" Because the admission of the statement was not error, however, this Court need not assess its potential prejudicial impact under the standard of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443 (2003). Defendant makes no argument that this otherwise admissible evidence was unduly prejudicial under N.C.R. Evid. 403, such that its admission was an abuse of the trial court's discretion. To the extent defendant claims the court's error \"was compounded by the fact that no limiting instruction as to corroborative testimony was given[,]\" we note that defendant did not request any limiting instruction at trial.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Miller testified that defendant became \"very upset\" with her just before the shooting, because Maddix \"was saying that [she] had told [Maddix] something.\" Defendant's distress at Miller was fueled by his consumption of alcohol, which appeared to Miller to have \"a lot to do with\" his emotional state. After receiving a second phone call, an angry defendant came out to his driveway with a handgun, said something to Miller in a loud voice, and shattered her van's window with his hand. As Miller backed out of defendant's driveway onto the street, she saw gunshots coming from his direction. When she arrived at a stop sign, she discovered that Jasmine was hit with a bullet. Defendant later told Miller that \"if he did it he's sorry.\" Police found a group of five nine-millimeter shell casings on the driveway. Moreover, although Miller testified that she also saw gunshots coming from the side of the house, she did not see anyone else with a gun; and police found no gun, shell casings, or other evidence of gunfire anywhere else in defendant's yard. Viewed in their totality and in the light most favorable to the State, these circumstances support a reasonable inference that defendant fired the shot that entered Miller's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Evidence that defendant fired his handgun in the direction of the van and injured Jasmine with a bullet also supports the jury's guilty verdict on the charge of assault with a deadly weapon,irrespective of his precise intentions.\n   <em>\n    See State v.
