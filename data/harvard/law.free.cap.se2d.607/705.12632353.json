The plea agreement provided that the State would reduce all of the Class E felony trafficking charges to lesser included Class F felony charges, and the sentences would be consolidated into one Class F felony trafficking charge with all the remaining charges in district court dismissed. In accordance with the plea agreement, the trial court consolidated the offenses into one Class F felony trafficking charge and sentenced defendant to seventy to eighty-four months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant's counsel states that \"[a]fter due inquiry, and serious consideration of the Transcript and Record, relevant law, and after consultation with the Appellate Defender, counsel has been unable to identify an issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal\" and asks this Court to review the record for possible prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Counsel has shown to the satisfaction of this Court that she has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

We conclude the appeal is wholly frivolous. In reaching this conclusion, we have conducted our own examination of the record for possible prejudicial error under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1444 and have found none. Furthermore, we decline to treat defendant's brief as a petition for writ of certiorari to review issues which are outside the scope of defendant's limited appeal.\n   <em>\n    See State v.
