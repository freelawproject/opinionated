We hold that defendant received a fair trial free from prejudicial error and dismiss, without prejudice, defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 11 January 2002, Frank Thompson (\"Thompson\") operated a burgundy 1995 Dodge Caravan (\"the van\") that was owned by his floral businesses to pick up flowers and parked at his shop. When Thompson returned to where he had parked the van, it had disappeared. Thompson contacted the Roseboro Police Department, reported the van missing, and subsequently completed a stolen motorvehicle report. The Roseboro Police Department issued a bulletin to surrounding law enforcement agencies \"to be on the lookout\" for the van. An officer from Sampson County Sheriff's Office relayed this bulletin to Corporal Matthew Hurley (\"Corporal Hurley\"), of the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office, while he was delivering paperwork in the Sampson County Sheriff's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the evening of 12 January 2002, Shirley Faircloth Olvera (\"Olvera\") saw a Dodge van parked outside a house under construction in her neighborhood on Page Road and called the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department. Olvera and her brother approached defendant who informed them that he had stopped at the house only to relieve himself. After Olvera informed defendant she had called the police, defendant entered the van and drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after midnight, Corporal Hurley and Deputy Shawna C. Leake (\"Deputy Leake\") responded to Olvera's call about a possible trespassing and larceny in progress on Page Road. By the time Corporal Hurley and Deputy Leake arrived at the house, the van was gone. The deputies resumed patrol. At approximately 1:00 a.m., the van passed Corporal Hurley and drove towards Deputy Leake. Both Corporal Hurley and Deputy Leake pursued the van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After stopping the van, Deputy Leake approached, found defendant sitting in the driver's seat, and placed him under arrest. Corporal Hurley searched the van and found a woman identified as Elizabeth Johnson (\"Johnson\") in the rear of the van and escorted her out the sliding door on the passenger side. A knife was found in the driver's seat area, and the van's engine wasrunning. A video camera in Deputy Leake's patrol car captured the stop of the van, including defendant's exit from the driver's seat. The State introduced the video tape at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After checking the van's registration, Corporal Hurley and Deputy Leake determined that the license plate displayed did not match the plate assigned to the van. After determining the van's vehicle identification number, Corporal Hurley and Deputy Leake learned the vehicle was reported stolen on 11 January 2002 in Roseboro, North Carolina. Corporal Hurley and Deputy Leake transported defendant to the Cumberland County Law Enforcement Center, where he was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle and carrying a concealed weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before defendant's arraignment on the stolen motor vehicle and weapon charges, the State offered defendant a plea bargain whereby it would drop the habitual felon indictment and defendant would serve twelve to fifteen months in prison on the stolen vehicle charge. The offer was not accepted and the District Attorney's office withdrew the plea offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 10 February 2003, the trial court allowed defendant's appointed counsel, Debra K. Price (\"Price\"), to withdraw as counsel for defendant because she had previously represented Johnson, the passenger in the van. Price was unable to locate defendant, who was not present for the hearing. The trial court appointed Juanita Dache (\"Dache\") as defendant's new counsel. It was later discovered that during the 10 February 2003 hearing, defendant was incarcerated in the Sampson County Jail on unrelated charges. On 21 May 2002, defendant was indicted on charges of possession of a stolen motor vehicle and carrying a concealed weapon. The grand jury also returned a special indictment against defendant charging him to be an habitual felon. The indictment listed three prior felony convictions, including a 22 September 1998 conviction for possession of cocaine in Sampson County. On 29 July 2003, the State dismissed the carrying a concealed weapon charge and proceeded with the charge for possession of a stolen motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury found defendant to be guilty of felonious possession of a stolen vehicle. Defendant's motion to set aside the verdict was denied. In the sentencing phase, defendant admitted his habitual felon status. The trial court sentenced defendant, a Level IV offender with twelve prior conviction points, to a minimum of eighty months and a maximum of 105 months and ordered defendant to pay restitution to Thompson in the amount of $2,873.33. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether: (1) defendant's indictment as an habitual felon was defective; (2) the trial court abused its discretion in allowing a video tape and related testimony into evidence; (3) the trial court abused its discretion in allowing opinion testimony by Corporal Hurley and Deputy Leake; (4) defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel by Price, defendant's first trial attorney; and (5) the trial court erred in sentencing defendant as an habitual felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Habitual Felon Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment on the habitual felon indictment because his prior conviction of felonious possession of cocaine on 22 September 1998 under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2090-95\">\n    N.C.

He also participated in defendant's arrest for possession of a stolen vehicle. When explaining how defendant could not switch seats in the vehicle without being noticed, Corporal Hurley testified to his perception regarding a fact in issue: whether defendant was the driver of the stolen vehicle, or whether defendant switched seats in the vehicle before the officers arrested him. The State has satisfied both requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rules 701(a) and 701(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant also argued at trial that Corporal Hurley's testimony was an opinion for the jury to determine.
