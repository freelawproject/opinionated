She contends the trial court erred in finding: (1) failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the juveniles' care; (2) failure to show reasonable progress; (3) dependency and a reasonable probability that such incapacity would continue into the future; and (4) neglect. After careful review, we affirm the order of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In brief, the procedural and factual history of the instant appeal is as follows: Respondent and her three children - J.Q.F., D.D.P., and C.W.B. - have interacted with Cabarrus CountyDepartment of Social Services (\"DSS\") since 1996, when Respondent was found to have neglected the juveniles. Family services were provided, but problems persisted. Respondent, who has a history of depression and substance abuse,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   failed to take the juveniles, and herself, to scheduled therapy and treatment appointments, failed to provide stable housing for the juveniles, regularly hit the juveniles with a cutting board, and verbally berated the juveniles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 18 October 2001, Respondent consented to a finding that the juveniles were neglected. Though DSS removed the juveniles from Respondent's care, reunification remained the permanency plan. On 14 November 2001, DSS found that Respondent had made progress by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   obtaining housing, getting counseling, taking parenting classes, and maintaining employment. Because of Respondent's progress, DSS recommended, and the trial court ordered trial placement of D.D.P. with Respondent. The record reveals, however, that the trial placement was unsuccessful. Respondent,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   threw a telephone at D.D.P., beat D.D.P. with a wooden paddle, snorted crushed medication through a straw in D.D.P.'s presence, left D.D.P. home alone on several occasions, and engaged in \"inappropriate discipline and neglect.\" DSS therefore found that \"the conditions leading to the removal of the children still exist\" and recommended \"that the goal for the children be adoption, as reunification does not appear to be in the children's best interest.\" The trial court heard the matter on 26 and 27 June 2003 and, in an order executed on 28 July 2003, made Findings of Fact including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   q.

Respondent []was ordered to comply with the family services case plan outlined in the court summary that she was to execute. . . .

Respondent asserts that the trial court failed to make a finding of what was reasonable for her to pay. North Carolina General Statute section 7B-1111(a)(3) states that parental rights may be terminated where a \"juvenile has been placedin the custody of a [] department of social services . . ., and the parent, for a continuous period of six months . . . has willfully failed for such period to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care for the juvenile although physically and financially able to do so.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a77B-1111(a)(3) (2003). \"[T]here is no requirement that the trial court make a finding as to what specific amount of support would have constituted a 'reasonable portion' under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Huff,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125951\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/140/288/#p293\">\n    140 N.C.

Respondent gave clear and convincing testimony showing her employment and salaries at several jobs - including Waffle House, Exxon Express, and an assisted living facility - while the juveniles were in DSS's care. Moreover, there was clear and convincing evidence that, while Respondent had received childsupport payments from D.D.P.'s father during the time D.D.P. was in DSS's care, Respondent kept the money for herself and did not give it to DSS to cover any of D.D.P.'s costs. Respondent \"failed to pay any portion of the cost of care for the [juveniles] during the relevant [] period. . . .

We therefore find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, Respondent contends that the trial court erred in finding that she had failed to show reasonable progress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   North Carolina General Statute section 7B-1111(a)(2) states that parental rights may be terminated where a \"parent has willfully left [a] juvenile in foster care or placement outside the home for more than 12 months without showing to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable progress under the circumstances has been made in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of the juvenile.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2) (2003). A parent must demonstrate not merely effort but also positive results to be deemed to have made reasonable progress.\n   <em>\n    In re Nolen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8526237\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/117/693/#p700\">\n    117 N.C.

This standard operates as a safeguard for children.

Respondent failed to attend individual and group counseling, attend non-offender parenting classes, and take medication prescribed to her. Further, Respondent maintained that her conduct toward her children had never been inappropriate. While D.D.P. was provisionally placed with Respondent, Respondent threw a telephone at D.D.P., beat D.D.P. with a wooden paddle, snorted medication in front of D.D.P., and left D.D.P. without supervision. Such conduct does not constitute reasonable progress in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of these juveniles. We therefore find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Third, Respondent contends that the trial court erred in finding that the juveniles were dependent, with a reasonableprobability that Respondent's incapacity to provide care would continue into the future. North Carolina General Statute section 7B-1111(a)(6) states that parental rights may be terminated where a \"parent is incapable of providing for the proper care and supervision of the juvenile, such that the juvenile is a dependent juvenile . . ., and that there is a reasonable probability that such incapability will continue for the foreseeable future.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(6) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the record reflects that Respondent, who had a history of cocaine and alcohol abuse, snorted medication through a straw in front of D.D.P. during D.D.P.'s trial placement with her. Further, Respondent failed to take required medication and attend individual and group counseling. Such treatment was deemed necessary for her mental conditions, which had been diagnosed as Depressive Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Because incapability to provide care \"may be the result of substance abuse, . . . [or] mental illness . . . that renders the parent unable or unavailable to parent the juvenile\" (N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(6)), and because the record reflects clear and convincing evidence that Respondent suffered from mental illness and substance abuse, the trial court did not err in finding the juveniles to be dependent, or in finding that Respondent's incapability would likely continue for the foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Respondent contends that the trial court erred in finding that the juveniles were neglected. North Carolina GeneralStatute section 7B-1111(a)(1) states that parental rights may be terminated where a juvenile is neglected.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201111\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2003). A juvenile is neglected where the juvenile \"does not receive proper care, supervision, or discipline from the juvenile's parent, . . . has been abandoned[,] . . . is not provided necessary medical care[,] or . . . lives in an environment injurious to the juvenile's welfare[.]\" N.C.

Furthermore, Respondent not only had been adjudicated neglectful over the course of the prior eight years, but even during the trial placement of D.D.P. in late 2001 through Spring 2002, she neglected D.D.P. \"Given the evidence of past neglect in conjunction with the special needs of the children and the evidence that respondent-mother has made no advancements in confronting and eliminating her problem[s] . . . , we are convinced that there was clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect and the probability of its repetition . . . to support the order terminating respondent-mother's parental rights.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Leftwich,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239010\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/135/67/\">\n    135 N.C.
