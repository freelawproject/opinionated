We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The pertinent facts are undisputed and may be summarized as follows: Plaintiff was employed by defendant Dollar Tree Stores as an associate manager at the Dollar Tree on Roxboro Road in Durham, North Carolina. Her duties included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   opening andclosing the store, \"closing out\" the cash registers at the end of the day, and depositing money at the Roxboro Road branch of Central Carolina Bank, which was located four tenths of a mile south of the Dollar Tree and was on plaintiff's regular route home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 7 March 2001 the store closed at 9:00 p.m. Plaintiff stayed to close up the store and the cash registers, then drove to the CCB branch and made the night deposit. Plaintiff then resumed driving south on Roxboro Road towards her home. After driving about three tenths of a mile, plaintiff's car was struck by a vehicle turning left across Roxboro Road. As a result of the accident, plaintiff suffered certain injuries requiring medical treatment and surgery. Several months later, on 11 September 2001, she filed a claim for workers' compensation. Defendant denied her claim on the basis that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A hearing was held before Deputy Commissioner Phillips of the Industrial Commission. On 20 November 2002 Phillips entered an opinion concluding that plaintiff \"was on a special errand\" for defendant when she was injured, and awarding workers' compensation benefits to plaintiff. Defendants appealed to the Full Commission, which filed its opinion and award on 23 October 2003. The Commission reversed the deputy commissioner, and ruled that plaintiff was not entitled to benefits. The Commission found that the after-hours night deposit at the bank was a regular part of plaintiff's employment, that the accident occurred after plaintiff finished making the deposit, and that making the night deposit didnot require plaintiff to take a different route home. The Commission concluded that the night deposit at CCB was not a special errand, that the \"coming and going\" rule applied, and that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of plaintiff's employment. From this opinion and award plaintiff appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The standard of review from opinions and awards of the Industrial Commission is well established: \"The standard of review on appeal to this Court from an award by the Commission is whether there is any competent evidence in the record to support the Commission's findings and whether those findings support the Commission's conclusions of law. Therefore, if there is competent evidence to support the findings, they are conclusive on appeal even though there is plenary evidence to support contrary findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

Plaintiff's duties were to open or close the store, close out registers, . . . and complete closing procedures. Plaintiff was responsible for making a deposit of money at the bank after the store had closed or throughout the day as needed as part of the regular procedure for handling revenues. During busy seasons, deposits were made at other times as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. . . . .

On March 7, 2001 the store closed at 9:00 p.m. After completing closing procedures, plaintiff . . . drove to the Central Carolina Bank located on Roxboro Street[,] . . . approximately four tenths of a mile from the store . . . on the opposite side of the street from the store.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   6.

The Full Commission finds based upon the greater weight of the evidence of record that plaintiff had completed her duties for defendants upon making the bank deposit at Central Carolina Bank. Plaintiff was on her way home from her employment when the accident occurred and had no further obligations or duties to defendants until she returned for her next scheduled shift.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   17. Making a bank deposit upon closing the store was a regular part of plaintiff's duties. It was done each time plaintiff closed the store. Plaintiff testified she made the night deposit two or three times a week for a total of at least 50 times in the five months she had been employed. Plaintiff's employment period ended upon making the deposit and plaintiff began her way home. The intersection where plaintiff was struck was the same one she would have encountered if she had gone home directly from the store instead of first making the deposit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Upon these and other findings of fact, the Commission reached conclusions of law including, in relevant part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1.
