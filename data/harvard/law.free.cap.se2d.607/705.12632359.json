Defendant testified and claimed that transportation problems, as well as physical and psychological problems, prevented him from complying with the terms of his probation. During the hearing, the State questioned defendant's capacity to proceed, and the trial court ordered that defendant be committed to Dorothea Dix Hospital for examination. After an evaluation, defendant was found \"capable of proceeding to trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant's probation revocation hearing resumed on 22 January 2004. The trial court found that defendant willfully violated the conditions of his probation as alleged in the violation report. The trial court revoked defendant's probation and activated his suspended sentence. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Counsel appointed to represent defendant has been unable to identify any issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal and asks that this Court conduct its own review of the record for possible prejudicial error. Counsel has also shown to the satisfaction of this Court that she has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Anders,\n   </em>\n   we have fully examined the record to determine whether any issues of arguable merit appear therefrom. We have been unable to find any possible prejudicial error and conclude that the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Judges McCULLOUGH and CALABRIA concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
