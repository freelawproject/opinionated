Winston, pro se, appeals the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d). The appeal, however, was filed outside of the time constraints which dictate this court\u2019s review of Veterans Court decisions. This court dismisses the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Mr. Winston began active duty service in the United States Marine Corp in June of 1999. In March of 2000, Mr. Winston was discharged from the Marine Corp due to a psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis that he suffered from a personality disorder. Specifically, eight months into his service Mr. Winston was hospitalized and evaluated for homicidal ideation, or thoughts of homicide. Mr. Winston reported to a psychiatrist that he had a history of such thoughts, and that there were no \u201cspecific stressors\u201d which triggered his most recent episode. Mr. Winston subsequently sought entitlement to disability benefits for his personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied Mr. Winston\u2019s claim. The Board concluded that Mr. Winston\u2019s personality disorder had not been aggravated by military service, and that military service had not caused any additional disorders. The Veterans Court affirmed, finding that the Board properly applied all applicable regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">The Veterans Court entered its judgment on August 5, 2010. On October 28, 2010, the Veterans Court received Mr. Winston\u2019s notice that he intended to appeal the decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">This court has jurisdiction to review decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). The statute states that \u201c[sjuch a review shall be obtained by filing a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims within the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where \u201cthe United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party,\u201d an appeal from the district court must be filed within sixty days of the entry of the judgment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). Therefore, appeals from the Veterans Court challenging the Secretary\u2019s determination must be filed within sixty days of entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">The Secretary contends that the time limit contained in \u00a7 7292 is jurisdictional, meaning a timely appeal is required for this court to hear a veteran\u2019s case. If so, this court lacks jurisdiction to hear Mr. Winston\u2019s appeal and must dismiss the case, as it was filed 84 days after the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">The Supreme Court has in recent years often been required to \u201cdecide whether a procedural rule is \u2018jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 1202, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011). The Court has distinguished \u201cclaim-processing rules\u201d \u2014 those \u201cthat seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times\u201d\u2014 from jurisdictional rules which \u201cgovern! ] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>court\u2019s adjudicatory capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine if a rule is jurisdictional, the Court has \u201clook[ed] to see if there is any \u2018clear\u2019 indication that Congress wanted the rule to be \u2018jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1203 (citing <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 515-16, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006)). Congress is not required to \u201cuse magic words to speak clearly on this point\u201d and \u201c[c]ontext, including [the Supreme Court\u2019s] interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The Supreme Court has long held that the \u201ctimely notice of appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982); <em>see also Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 209-10, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The Court has made clear that in civil cases, appeals from district courts must be filed within the time limits contained in \u00a7 2107 in order for the courts of appeals to have jurisdiction. <em>Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 213, 127 S.Ct. 2360. Section 7292(a), governing here, is a jurisdictional requirement as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Section 7292 was enacted in 1988 as a part of the Veterans\u2019 Judicial Review Act, 102 Stat. 4105. At that time, Supreme Court precedent was \u201cwell settled\u201d that a timely appeal from a district court was a jurisdictional requirement. <em>Griggs, </em>459 U.S. at 61, 103 S.Ct. 400. Congress in turn required that appeals from the Veterans Court be \u201cwithin the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). Given the context, we believe this is a \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 indication that Congress wanted the rule to be \u2018jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henderson, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Indeed, a unanimous Supreme Court recently applied this reasoning in <em>Henderson, </em>albeit in dicta. In construing another provision of the Veterans\u2019 Judicial Review Act, the Court noted that \u201c[i]f Congress had wanted\u201d to make the provision jurisdictional, \u201cit could have east that provision in language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1204-05. Because time limits for civil appeals are jurisdictional, the Court reasoned that the language of \u00a7 7292(a) \u201cclearly signals an intent to impose the same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The Veterans Court entered its judgment in Mr. Winston\u2019s case on August 5, 2010. The Veterans Court received Mr. Winston\u2019s notice of appeal on October 28, 2010, and subsequently forwarded the notice to this court. An appeal from the Veterans Court challenging the Secretary\u2019s determination must be filed within 60 days of the entry of judgment in order for this court to have jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). Because Mr. Winston\u2019s appeal was filed more than 60 days after the entry of judgment, this court lacks jurisdiction and must dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
