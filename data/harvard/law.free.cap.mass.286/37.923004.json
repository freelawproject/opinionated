The employee was injured by a fall on the premises of the Brae Burn Country Club, where she was employed as a waitress, on June 6, 1929. The Industrial Accident Board on August 3, 1929, approved an agreement for compensation for injury \u201cby reason of Fall on stairs and resulting in Contusion of left forehead \u2014 Left hip and left knee.\u201d She was to receive $16 \u201cper week until disability ceases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>and medical expenses as provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d No decree was entered. She went back to work. Compensation ceased July 3, 1929, by agreement. After hearing in March, 1933, for compensation for partial disability due to injury to her back caused by the fall, the single member found as a fact that she received injury to the back in the fall of June 6, 1929, and awarded partial compensation from her return to work until April 1, 1933, amounting to $781.71, to continue at $4 per week in accordance with the law. The reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings of the single member, and made a similar order.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">We need not discuss the evidence in detail. We think it sustains the findings; and that both single member and reviewing board were right in holding that the failure of the compromise agreement to mention injury to the back did not preclude evidence that such injury was received and was a result of the fall. The chief contention of the insurer is that evidence of injury to the back was not admissible. It argues that the agreement approved by the board had the effect of a decree, <em>Kareske\u2019s </em>Case, 250 Mass. 220, and was a final determination of all the issues material to the case. It is the law that a compensation agreement is a final determination of the facts material to the existence of liability, of the fact of employment, of injury arising out of and received in the course of the employment, of notice, etc., <em>Hurley\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 387, <em>Brode\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 414, but it is not final determination of the extent of the injury or of the payment to be made. <em>Hunnewell\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 351. <em>Bartoni\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 349. The original workmen\u2019s compensation act, St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 12, provided: \u201cAny weekly payment under this act may be reviewed by the industrial accident board at the request of the association or of the employee; and on such review it may be ended, diminished or increased, subject to the maximum and minimum amounts above provided, if the board finds that the condition of the employee warrants such action.\u201d It has since been amended, but no change has been made in the funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>mental purpose to permit change in payment if change in the employee\u2019s condition warrants. <em>Frizzi\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 460. <em>Korobchuk\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 412, 416. <em>Musgrave\u2019s Case, </em>281 Mass. 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">Evidence has been received of conditions arising after the original finding, agreement or decree if, in fact, causal connection with the original injury is established. There is nothing incredible in the omission, when claim is first made, of claims for injury due to the accident but then unknown or unrecognized. The beneficent purpose of the legislation would not be fully obtained if recovery should be precluded by such omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">A different situation would exist if the matter of the later claim, in fact, had been considered in the original agreement or hearing. All that appears here is a fall and contusions to left forehead, knee and hip \u2014 nothing inconsistent with injury to the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
