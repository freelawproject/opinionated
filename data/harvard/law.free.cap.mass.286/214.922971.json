L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135. On January 6, 1934, the defendant in each case filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions for failure to give such order. On January 12, 1934, the plaintiff filed in each case a motion to extend the time within which such order might be given until January 17, 1934. The judge allowed these motions of the plaintiff and denied the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The trial judge after the expiration of the ten days specified in \u00a7 135 had no power to grant the motions of the plaintiff. It has been decided that under this enabling statute the power to extend the time for giving the order must be exercised by the court before the time theretofore limited has expired. <em>Buchannan </em>v. <em>Meisner, </em>279 Mass. 457. <em>Stanwood </em>v. <em>Adams Garage Inc. </em>281 Mass. 452. Those decisions govern the cases at bar. In each case the motion of the plaintiff to extend the time for giving the order ought to have been denied and the motion of the defendant to dismiss the bill of exceptions ought to have been granted. The exceptions must be sustained and orders entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
