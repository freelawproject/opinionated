Kimball, who died in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>1923, against the present trustee of the Kimball Building Trust, so called, on a covenant in an indenture of lease, under seal, dated November 4, 1915, and in force during the year 1929 between said David P. Kimball, as lessor, and the former trustees of said trust, as lessees, to pay and discharge certain taxes and excises. The case was heard by a judge of the Superior Court upon an agreed statement of facts and was reported by him without decision for the determination of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The covenant sued on is in the following terms: \u201cThe Lessees covenant and agree as far as at any time permitted by law to pay and discharge any taxes or excises which during the term may be lawfully levied, laid or assessed upon or against the rent payable hereunder, whether levied or assessed upon the same as rental or as income of any person or persons entitled thereto.\u201d The \u201crent payable\u201d by the defendant under the lease for the calendar year 1929 and actually paid by him was $24,475.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The plaintiffs seek to recover under this covenant a part of the amount of the Federal income taxes for the calendar year 1929 imposed by the revenue act of 1928 (45 U. S. Sts. at Large, 791), and paid by three children of said David P. Kimball, life beneficiaries of a trust of the residue of his estate created by his will of which the plaintiffs are trustees. These three children of the testator were entitled under his will to receive from such trustees the \u201cnet annual income\u201d of the trust for the calendar year 1929, \u201cquarterly or oftener as . . . [the trustees] may deem best, in equal shares.\u201d The income of the trust for the calendar year 1929 consisted of the rent received from the defendant under the lease, other rents of real estate, interest and dividends, all taxable under the Federal income tax law, and interest on bonds of the United States and certain dividends not so taxable. The trustees also received gains on sales of property of the trust which were taxable as income but were not distributable to the fife beneficiaries. The trustees filed with the United States treasury department a \u201cfederal income tax information return\u201d in which they reported the distributable shares of the fife .beneficiaries, which shares were in fact distributed to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>beneficiaries. This return showed as distributable to each of the life beneficiaries one third of the taxable dividends and one third of the \u201cbalance of net income,\u201d the latter amount, in the cases of two of these beneficiaries, reduced by the amount of the Massachusetts income tax upon their shares respectively. The information return showed also the distribution to the life beneficiaries of nontaxable income. The \u201cbalance of net income\u201d was computed by deducting the trustees\u2019 \u201ccommissions\u201d and the expenses of the trust from the aggregate amount of rents, and taxable interest and dividends. The beneficiaries included in their \u201cindividual federal income tax returns,\u201d with income from other sources, the shares of the taxable dividends and of the \u201cbalance of net income,\u201d computed as above, set forth, and paid Federal income taxes based upon income so reported. The amount which the plaintiffs seek to recover from the defendant in this action is the aggregate of the parts of the Federal income taxes so paid by the beneficiaries fairly apportionable to rent received by the plaintiffs from the defendant. On April 16, 1931, the plaintiffs demanded payment from the defendant of $2,140.63 as such amount. They now concede that, due to errors in the figures, this amount should be $2,044.31. No contention is made that this amount as corrected is not computed rightly if, as matter of law, any part of such taxes is apportionable to the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Unlike the covenant considered in <em>Codman </em>v. <em>American Piano Co. </em>229 Mass. 285, and the agreement considered in <em>Greenburg </em>v. <em>Bopp, </em>251 Mass. 433, (see also <em>Stony Brook Railroad </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>260 Mass. 379), the covenant in this lease in express terms applies to \u201ctaxes or excises\u201d \u201clevied, laid or assessed upon or against the rent payable\u201d under the lease. Also in express terms the covenant applies to such taxes or excises, \u201cwhether levied or assessed upon\u201d such rent, \u201cas rental or as income of any person or persons entitled thereto.\u201d This language discloses \u201cthe purpose of the parties to impose the obligation [of paying or discharging taxes on rent] upon the. lessee whether the tax was levied as a property or as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>income tax\u201d <em>(Kimball </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>229 Mass. 541, 542), or on the rent as such or as income, and irrespective of the persons by whom the tax is to be paid which is \u201clevied, laid or assessed upon or against the rent\u201d if they are \u201cpersons entitled\u201d to such rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The defendant contends, however, that no part of the Federal income tax paid by a life beneficiary for the calendar year 1929 was \u201cassessed upon or against the rent,\u201d but, on the contrary, that such tax was assessed upon an \u201cundifferentiated mass\u201d of income in the hands of the beneficiary by reason of (a) the mingling of the rent in the hands of the trustees with other income of the trust so as to make up the \u201cgross income\u201d of the trust; (b) the making of deductions from such \u201cgross income\u201d of the trustees\u2019 \u201ccommissions\u201d and the expenses of the trust so as to determine the \u201cnet income\u201d of the trust; (c) the distribution of such \u201cnet income\u201d among the life beneficiaries; (d) the mingling of each beneficiary\u2019s share of such \u201cnet income\u201d with other income of the beneficiary to make up the \u201cgross income\u201d of such beneficiary; and (e) the making of statutory deductions from such \u201cgross income\u201d so as to determine the \u201cnet income\u201d of the beneficiary subject to Federal income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">It is clear that the \u201cnet income\u201d of each beneficiary upon which he was taxed was increased by reason of the rent paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs. And we think that, in spite of the mingling of such rent with other income, the deductions from \u201cgross income\u201d allowed by law and the distribution of the income of the trust among the life beneficiaries, such parts of the Federal income taxes of these beneficiaries as are fairly apportionable to such rent are taxes \u201cassessed upon or against the rent\u201d within the meaning of. the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">It was decided in <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>234 Mass. 172, 173, an action brought upon this covenant by David P. Kimball, the original lessor, that he was entitled to be reimbursed by the lessees for such parts of his Federal income taxes for the years 1915, 1916, and 1917, in the form of additional taxes or surtaxes, as were proportionate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>rent received by him under this lease on the ground that such an additional tax or surtax \u201cis a direct tax which may be assessed on rentals when received as income, for reasons pointed out in <em>Suter </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. 225 </em>Mass. 34, and <em>Codman </em>v. <em>American Piano Co. </em>229 Mass. 285.\u201d The defendant contends, however, that the authority of this case is weakened because the lessees conceded therein that they were bound by the covenant to reimburse the lessor for a part of the normal taxes paid by him, and because, as the defendant contends, this concession was improvidently made, and the decision of the case in respect to additional taxes or surtaxes was based on this concession. The argument underlying this contention is that the <em>Suter </em>case was decided on the ground that the provision in the income tax law of 1913 (38 U. S. Sts. at Large, 169, paragraph E), requiring withholding by a lessee of normal tax on rent and payment thereof to the United States, characterized such tax as a tax on rent and that this ground failed when there was no longer any such withholding of tax. In fact, the Revenue Act of 1917 (40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 332, \u2022 \u00a7 1205) amended the Revenue Act of 1916 so that for the year 1917 no withholding of normal tax on rent payable to a resident was required. And none of the statutes required withholding of additional tax or surtax. It is true, indeed, that in the <em>Suter </em>case the court rested heavily upon the withholding provision as characterizing normal tax on income as a tax on rent entering into the computation of such income. But this was not the sole ground of the decision. See also <em>Codman </em>v. <em>American Piano Co. </em>229 Mass. 285, 288-290. And <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>234 Mass. 172, was decided in the light of the fact, which was brought to the attention of the court by counsel, that withholding of rent payable to residents had been done away with by the Revenue Act of 1917. . The Federal income tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1928 is the same in nature as were the Federal income taxes imposed by the revenue acts of 1913, 1916, and 1917. The case of <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>234 Mass. 172, therefore, must be regarded as a controlling decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the effect that, even in the absence of an applicable withholding provision, if the original lessor had been living in 1929 a Federal income tax upon his income would in part have been \u201cassessed upon or against the rent\u201d received by him under the lease within the meaning of the covenant. It is not necessary to reexamine the point there decided. But it is to be observed that the said Revenue Act of 1928, like other Federal income tax laws, contains numerous provisions which indicate that the tax thereby imposed is to be regarded as related directly to the sources of income. Such, for example, are the provisions excluding income exempt because of its source from inclusion in \u201cgross income\u201d (\u00a722 [b] [4]), and excluding dividends received from domestic corporations from income subject to the normal tax (\u00a725 [a] [1]). And the United States Supreme Court in <em>William E. Peck &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>247 U. S. 165, 174, referring to the income tax imposed by the income tax law of 1913, described it as \u201can income tax laid generally on net incomes,\u201d but stated that though \u201cit is both nominally and actually a general tax,\u201d \u201cit cannot be applied to any income which Congress has no power to tax,\u201d thus recognizing that Federal income taxes are to be regarded as taxes upon the various specific items of income included in the gross income of the tax payers. See also <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>253 U. S. 245, 263-264, where the income tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 1057, c. 18) was considered. In accord with our decision in <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>234 Mass. 172, are <em>Philadelphia City Passenger Railway </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co. </em>263 Penn. St. 561, and <em>Philadelphia, Germantown &amp; Norristown Railroad </em>v. <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway, </em>265 Penn. St. 325. See also <em>North Pennsylvania Railroad </em>v. <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway, </em>249 Penn. St. 326. So far as <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>305 Mo. 105, <em>Laclede Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>St. Louis Union Trust Co. </em>321 Mo. 782, and <em>Missouri Athletic </em>Asso<em>ciation </em>v. <em>Delk Investment Corp. </em>323 Mo. 765, relied on by the defendant, are inconsistent with <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>we cannot follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">It is urged, however, in behalf of the defendant, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the income taxes here under consideration are still further removed from a tax \u201cassessed upon or against the rent\u201d by reason of the fact that they are assessed not upon income in the hands of the trustees \u2014 the lessor \u2014 \u25a0 but rather upon income in the hands of the beneficiaries of the trust. Under the Revenue Act of 1928, however, \u2014 as under other Federal income tax laws \u2014 \u25a0 the trustee is regarded as a mere conduit through which income \u201cto be distributed currently by the fiduciary to the beneficiaries,\u201d as here, passes to such beneficiaries, who are required to pay taxes thereon, \u00a7 162 (b), see also (c), see <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Falk, </em>291 U. S. 183, 189. Income so distributable retains in the hands of the beneficiaries the character which it had in the hands of the trustee. For example, exempt income remains exempt in the hands of the beneficiaries, \u00a7\u00a7 143, 22 (b) (4), dividends and interest on United States obligations not wholly exempt from income tax are taxed respectively as dividends and partially exempt income in the hands of the beneficiaries, \u00a7 163 (b), and deductions from the gross income of a trust for depreciation and depletion are apportionable among the beneficiaries on the basis of the income distributable or distributed among them, \u00a7 23 (k) (1). As was said by the United States Supreme Court, interpreting the Revenue Act of 1921, \u2014 which was closely similar to the Revenue Act of 1928 \u2014 in regard to income of a trust to be distributed currently, \u201cthe scheme of the Act is to treat the amount so distributable, not as the trust\u2019s income, but as the beneficiary\u2019s. But as the tax on the entire net income of the trust is to be paid by the fiduciary or the beneficiaries, or partly by each, the beneficiary\u2019s share of the income is considered his property from the moment of its receipt by the estate.\u201d <em>Freuler </em>v. <em>Helvering, </em>291 U. S. 35, 41-42. It follows that, according to the scheme of the statute, the taxes paid by the beneficiaries were in part \u201cassessed upon or against the rent\u201d as \u201cincome\u201d of the beneficiaries, the \u201cpersons entitled thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">There is nothing in the lease to indicate that the covenant should be given a more restricted meaning than is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>given to the statute. Each of the beneficiaries is a \u201cperson entitled\u201d to a part of the rent as a part of his share of the income of the trust, within the ordinary meaning of the word. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 197, \u00a7 27; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>139 Mass. 449; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Apthorp, </em>203 Mass. 249; <em>McElwain </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>203 Mass. 376. Cases holding that taxes on net income do not violate the constitutional protection of a particular source of income are based on the nature of the constitutional protection and the degree of remoteness of the tax from the constitutionally protected source. See <em>William E. Peck &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>247 U. S. 165; <em>United States Glue Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Creek, </em>247 U. S. 321. Compare <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>253 U. S. 245. Here, however, we \u201care construing an agreement; not determining the constitutionality of a taxing statute.\u201d <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad, </em>242 N. Y. 125, 133. See <em>Pittsfield &amp; North Adams Railroad </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>260 Mass. 390. And the language of the covenant does not indicate that the taxes in question, which under the income tax statute are regarded as \u201cassessed upon or against the rent,\u201d are so remote from the rent, considered as \u201cincome,\u201d that they are not to be regarded as assessed thereon within the meaning of the covenant. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The defendant contends, however, that even if the taxes paid by the beneficiaries are within the covenant, the plaintiffs \u2014 trustees \u2014 have not been damaged by the defendant\u2019s breach of such covenant so as to be entitled to recover in this action or, if they are entitled to recover in this action, that they can recover only nominal damages. By the terms of the lease the word \u201cLessor\u201d includes \u201chis heirs, assigns and devisees,\u201d and \u201call the agreements and engagements\u201d under the lease are to be \u201cconstrued and operative as covenants running with the land.\u201d The plaintiffs, therefore, \u2014 whatever would be true in the absence of such provisions \u2014 were entitled to sue on this covenant. See <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>131 Mass. 510; <em>Security System Co. </em>v. <em>S. S. Pierce Co. </em>258 Mass. 4, 5. See also <em>Pfaff </em>v. <em>Golden, </em>126 Mass. 402; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>165 Mass. 189, 190; <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>225 Mass. 209; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>228 Mass. 390, 394-395. They, only, can bring an action at law against the defendant on this sealed instrument, but since they are trustees for the beneficiaries they can recover in such an action for the benefit of such beneficiaries the amount in damages that the beneficiaries could have recovered if they had been parties to the lease. <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>198 Mass. 477, 487-488. See also <em>Drummond </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>159 Mass. 577, 580; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>165 Mass. 189, 192; <em>Grime </em>v. <em>Borden, </em>166 Mass. 198, 201; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Greany, </em>216 Mass. 296; <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. </em>227 Mass. 354, 368-369.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The plaintiffs make no contention that they are entitled to interest for any period before their demand on April 16, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">It follows that judgment must be entered for the plaintiffs for $2,044.31, with interest thereon from April 16, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
