The parties agreed that a fire occurred on the premises on July 21, 1931, that under the insurance policy the plaintiff was liable for loss, that if the policy should contain the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause\u201d the full amount of the plaintiff\u2019s liability is $3,184.96, but if it should not contain that clause its liability is $4,505.63, and that payment by the plaintiff of the sum of $3,184.96 to persons entitled thereto under the policy should be without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s rights to have the policy reformed by adding thereto the clause in question. The judge who heard the case made findings of fact and ordered entered a decree that there was due to the defendant owner of the premises from the plaintiff the sum of $1,320.67 \u2014 the difference between $4,505.63 and $3&gt;184.96 \u2014 with interest, and that the bill be dismissed with costs to be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>by the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">The judge found properly on the evidence the following facts: The order for the policy was given in behalf of the owner by an insurance broker. He requested the agents of the plaintiff to issue a policy covering the property for the term of five years \"at the low rate.\u201d The established rates for the risk insured were eighty-four cents per $100 for the term of five years provided the so called \"80% Reduced Rate Clause\u201d was made a part of the policy, and $1.20 per $100 insurance, or the \"flat rate,\u201d if said clause was not made a part thereof. After the application was received it was turned over to the \"policy writer\u201d in the office of the plaintiff\u2019s agent. A policy was issued May 13, 1930. It was written and sent to the first mortgagee without the so called \"80% Reduced Rate Clause,\u201d but the premium was computed at the rate of eighty-four cents per $100 insurance and the owner was charged by the plaintiff and paid the premium at that rate. The owner never saw the policy. After the policy was delivered a report that it had been issued was sent to the Fire Insurance Stamping Office for the Metropolitan District, an organization with certain duties including the duty of discovering errors in rates. The failure to include the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause\u201d was discovered May 20, 1930, and the plaintiff\u2019s agents notified. Thereafter, some time before the fire, an indorsement of such a clause on the policy was ordered by the plaintiff\u2019s agents and copies of such a clause were mailed \u2014 one to the stamping office and one to the insurance broker. No copy was ever received by the defendant owner, or seen by her. She received no information of the error until after the fire had occurred. She had no knowledge of the insurance rate or the rate at which the policy had been written, except so far as the knowledge of the broker might be imputed to her as matter of law. The plaintiff never intended to issue the policy for the amount of the premium paid without the \"80% Reduced Rate Clause.\u201d But no act of the defendant owner induced the plaintiff to issue and deliver the policy in the manner described.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The judge further found that there \u201cwas no stipulation that the policy should contain a so called \u201880% Reduced Rate Clause\u2019 or that the premium for said policy should be at the rate of eighty-four cents per $100 of insurance or at any other stipulated rate,\u201d that there was no agreement that the terms of the policy should include the so called \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause,\u201d and that the \u201cpolicy was issued without said \u201880% Reduced Rate Clause\u2019 affixed as a result of a mistake made by the agents of the . . . [plaintiff]. The mistake was that of the insurer and not of the insured. The mistake was not mutual.\u201d The judge ruled that \u201cthe . . . [plaintiff] is not entitled to the relief prayed for, to wit, that said policy be reformed by adding thereto the said \u201880% Reduced Rate Clause.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\">The findings that there was no \u201cstipulation\u201d or \u201cagreement\u201d that the policy should contain an \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause\u201d were proper so far as they mean that there was no such \u201cstipulation\u201d or \u201cagreement\u201d in terms. But on the warranted findings, considered in connection with the evidence, the policy contemplated by the parties would have included such a clause, and the policy as issued, therefore, did not express the mutual understanding of the parties as to the terms of the proposed bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The contract between the parties was made by the application of the owner through her broker for insurance and the issuance by the plaintiff of a policy purporting to be in accordance with the terms of the application. <em>American Mutual Liability Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>280 Mass. 517, 524. In view of the agreement of the parties that the plaintiff was liable under the policy the plaintiff is precluded from contending that, because of variance between the application and the policy, no contract of insurance was made when the policy was issued. See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>222 Mass. 382, 389. There was, however, no act of the owner at or after the time the policy was issued by which she agreed to a substituted contract different in terms from the application. And there was no act on the part of the plaintiff relied on by the owner which estopped the plaintiff from asserting that the policy as issued did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>not express the mutual understanding of the parties as to the terms of the proposed bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\">It must be taken on the warranted findings and the evidence that the parties contemplated the issuance of a policy containing the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause.\u201d The finding of the judge that the policy was issued without such a clause as a result of a \u201cmistake\u201d made by agents of the plaintiff so implies. The application for the policy by the owner must be construed as an application for a policy containing such a clause. The broker was the agent of the owner to make application for insurance and the owner was bound by the application made by him. See <em>Ritson </em>v. <em>Atlas Assurance Co. Ltd. </em>279 Mass. 385, 392. He applied for a.policy \u201cat the low rate,\u201d though he did not in terms apply for a policy containing the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause.\u201d \u201cOrdinarily, it is not expected that an application for insurance will contain all of the terms and conditions which are included in the policy when it is issued. Certain particulars are named, others are not. The application is for such insurance on such terms and conditions as, in view of the particulars submitted, the company sells. It is to be presumed that, as in other cases, the purchaser has made himself acquainted with what he is purchasing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>William Knabe &amp; Co. Manuf. Co. </em>171 Mass. 265, 270. The established rates in Boston were only two \u2014 a \u201cflat rate\u201d and an \u201c80% Reduced Rate.\u201d Though it does not appear affirmatively that the owner or her agent knew that this was the fact, and though there was no agreement in terms that the policy should contain the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause,\u201d it must be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the application for insurance \u201cat the low rate\u201d contemplated that the plaintiff should insure the owner\u2019s property at the \u201c80% Reduced Rate,\u201d the only \u201clow rate\u201d at which insurance was sold by the plaintiff. Consequently, a policy containing the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause\u201d was all the owner applied for, and all that she was entitled to on her application if it was accepted by the plaintiff. Furthermore, it was all that she paid for. And the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>intended to issue a policy containing the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause.\u201d This was the mutual understanding of the parties as to the proposed contract of insurance. See Williston on Contracts, \u00a7 1548.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\">The policy by reason of the omission of the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause\u201d was materially at variance with the mutual understanding of the parties thereto. The mistake was mutual in that the intention common to both parties was not expressed in the policy. See <em>Canedy </em>v. <em>Marcy, </em>13 Gray, 373, 376. A mistake was \u201cmade out according to the understanding of both parties.\u201d See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Jablonski, </em>253 Mass. 451, 453. The case in this respect is unlike <em>German American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>131 Mass. 316, where the evidence failed to show, as to -one of the parties to a written instrument, that it did not express his intention. See also <em>Barrell </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>252 Mass. 504, 508. Clearly it was the intention of the plaintiff that the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause \u201d should be included in the policy. The only evidence bearing on the owner\u2019s intention is the evidence of the application made in her behalf by the broker, which must be interpreted as an application for a policy containing this clause. This is not a case where the instrument sought to be reformed is strong evidence of the intention of a party executing it, for the owner did not sign or even see the policy. See <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Greenman, </em>283 Mass. 601, 614. It is immaterial that the error of omitting the \u201c80% Reduced Rate Clause\u201d from the policy was made by the plaintiff\u2019s agent. The essential element of mutuality in the mistake was not in the clerical act of the agent, but in the common intention of the parties which failed of expression. See <em>Canedy </em>v. <em>Marcy, </em>13 Gray, 373, 377; Williston on Contracts, \u00a7 1535. In the circumstances shown the plaintiff is entitled to have the policy reformed to conform to the mutual understanding of the parties. <em>Canedy </em>v. <em>Marcy, </em>13 Gray, 373. <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Holdsworth, </em>264 Mass. 303, 308. <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>266 Mass. 566. <em>Bourbeau </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>277 Mass. 28. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 504.
