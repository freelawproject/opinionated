Thomas abandoned his representation of both Lee and Sines; Thomas failed to attend a hearing in Lee\u2019s criminal case, never filed a complaint for divorce on Sines\u2019s behalf, and did not call any witnesses at the hearing in Sines\u2019s guardianship matter. Lee\u2019s mother and Sines filed complaints against Thomas with the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">On February 11, 2015, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Thomas, charging him with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 1.5(a) (Unreasonable Fees), 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation), 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation), and 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">On February 12, 2015, this Court designated the Honorable Daniel P. Dwyer (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Washington County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On April 8, 2015, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in the Circuit Court for Allegany County a \u201cComplaint for Temporary Restraining Order [and] Preliminary and Permanent Inju[n]ctive Relief\u2019 (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d) in which Bar Counsel sought, among other relief, a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that would prohibit Thorn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>as from practicing law under Maryland Rule 16-776(a) (Injunction to Prevent Serious Harm).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 10, 2015, the Complaint was transferred to the hearing judge. On April 17, 2015, with Thomas in attendance, the hearing judge conducted a hearing on the Complaint. On that date, with Thomas\u2019s consent, the hearing judge issued a temporary restraining order that prohibited Thomas from practicing law until April 80, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">On April 30, 2015, the hearing judge conducted a hearing on the propriety of a preliminary injunction; Thomas failed to attend. On that date, the hearing judge issued a preliminary injunction that prohibited Thomas from practicing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On June 30, 2015, the hearing judge conducted an evidentiary hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding; Thomas failed to attend. On August 31, 2015, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Thomas had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3,1.4,1.5(a), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">On November 10, 2015, we heard oral argument<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and disbarred Thomas. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. </em>Thomas, 445 Md. 117, 125 A.3d 360 (Md.2015) (per curiam). We now explain the reasons for Thomas\u2019s disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">On or about June 21, 2000, this Court admitted Thomas to the Bar of Maryland. At all relevant times, Thomas was a solo practitioner in Allegany County.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Thomas\u2019s Representation of Lee</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In or about October or November 2013, Lee was injured during an altercation with Kameron Kamp (\u201cKamp\u201d). Lee\u2019s injuries included a broken jaw, and necessitated that Lee have his jaw wired shut and have his arm placed in a sling. Lee and his family incurred medical expenses as a result of his injuries. Lee pressed criminal charges of assault against Kamp, and Kamp pressed criminal charges of assault against Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">On or about January 6, 2014, Lee\u2019s mother, Ren\u00e9e Walker (\u201cWalker\u201d), retained Thomas to represent Lee in the defense of the criminal charge against him. Thomas charged a flat fee of $750, which was paid in full. Thomas told Walker also that it would be possible for Lee to sue Kamp in an attempt to obtain compensation for Lee\u2019s medical expenses. Walker provided Thomas with a list of people who could testify on Lee\u2019s behalf. Thomas failed to interview or subpoena any of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">A hearing in Lee\u2019s criminal case was scheduled for March 4, 2014. On the night of March 3, 2014, Walker telephoned Thomas. This was the first time that Lee or Walker had communicated with Thomas since January 2014. Thomas told Walker that he could not attend the hearing for personal reasons. Thomas failed either to offer to find another lawyer who could attend the hearing or raise the possibility of requesting a postponement. On March 4, 2014, without Thomas, Lee and Walker attended the hearing, at which they learned that the State planned to dismiss the charges against both Lee and Kamp. Lee and Walker never heard from Thomas again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>despite Walker\u2019s attempts to discuss a possible civil action against Kamp and/or a refund of Thomas\u2019s fee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Thomas\u2019s Representation of Sines</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In November 2010, Sines separated from her then-husband. Sines retained Thomas to represent her for purposes of her separation and to obtain a divorce when she had been separated for one year. Thomas charged Sines a flat fee, which Sines paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Thomas drafted a separation agreement, gave it to Sines, and told Sines to give it to her then-husband.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thomas also made inquiries on Sines\u2019s behalf regarding title to some Holstein cattle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These were the only two services that Thomas ever performed as to Sines\u2019s divorce matter; Thomas never filed a complaint for divorce on Sines\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In or about July 2011, Sines learned that her then-husband may have molested her daughter, a vulnerable adult with a disability. Sines retained Thomas to represent her for purposes of becoming her daughter\u2019s guardian. Thomas charged Sines a fee of approximately $1,000, which Sines paid in full. Two doctors evaluated Sines\u2019s daughter and provided the two medicaVpsychiatric opinions that were necessary for the appointment of a guardian of the person of a disabled person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>under Maryland Rule 10-202(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thomas needed to file a petition for guardianship of the person of a disabled person within twenty-one days of the latest dated doctors\u2019 evaluations. <em>See </em>Md. R. 10-202(a) (\u201cAn examination or evaluation by at least one of the health care professionals under this subsection shall occur within 21 days before the filing of the petition [for guardianship of the person of a disabled person].\u201d). Thomas failed to file a petition for guardianship of the person of a disabled person within the required twenty-one-day window, thus forcing Sines and her daughter to experience the expense and inconvenience of having Sines\u2019s daughter evaluated again.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Sines provided Thomas with the names of several people, including Sines\u2019s daughter\u2019s pediatrician, who would have testified in support of Sines becoming her daughter\u2019s guardian. However, Thomas failed to interview any of the people; and, at the guardianship hearing, Thomas failed to call any witnesses. The trial court did not appoint Sines as her daughter\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In January 2012, Sines texted Thomas to ask about the delay in proceeding with her divorce matter. Thomas informed Sines that he was busy. In March 2012, on several occasions, Sines unsuccessfully attempted to arrange an appointment with Thomas. On March 26, 2012, Thomas emailed Sines to tell her to review a complaint for divorce that was attached to the e-mail. Sines was unable to download and view the complaint for divorce. On March 28, 2012, Sines emailed Thomas to tell him to mail her a paper copy of the complaint for divorce. Despite sending messages to Thomas in April, May, and June 2012, Sines never heard from Thomas again. In June 2012, Sines filed a complaint against Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>with the Commission. Afterward, Thomas refunded \u201cthe prepaid fees\u201d that he had charged Sines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Conditional Diversion Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On or about March 20, 2013, Thomas and Bar Counsel entered into a \u201cConditional Diversion Agreement\u201d that partially arose out of Sines\u2019s complaint to the Commission. In the Conditional Diversion Agreement, which the hearing judge admitted into evidence, Thomas agreed to the following conditions, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">[Thomas] will abstain from all use of alcohol and/or opiates[.] During the pendency of the [Conditional Diversion] Agreement, [Thomas] will attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at least once per week and provide Bar Counsel with proof of his attendance^] Within thirty [ ] days of the date of th[e Conditional Diversion] Agreement, [Thomas] will arrange for counseling through the Alleg[ ]any County Health Department. [Thomas] will ... waive confidentiality to the extent necessary for Bar Counsel to confirm that [Thomas] is receiving counseling for his substance abuse problems and that [Thomas] is abstaining from the use of alcohol and/or opiates[.] If, during the duration of th[e Conditional Diversion] Agreement, [Thomas] resumes the use of alcohol or opiates, [Thomas] will immediately voluntarily cease practicing law, notify all active clients, return files and unearned fees[,] and withdraw his appearance in any and all [c]ourt proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">(Paragraph breaks omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On or about May 15, 2013, the Commission approved the Conditional Diversion Agreement. On or about July 25, 2013, in accordance with the Conditional Diversion Agreement, Thomas enrolled in an \u201cOutpatient Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>dictions Program\u201d that was conducted by the Allegany County Health Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">On or about February 24, 2014, Thomas successfully completed an \u201cIntensive Outpatient Program\u201d and advanced to another program that required attending counseling sessions once per week. Between February 24, 2014 and July 2, 2014, however, Thomas attended only seven counseling sessions. As a result, on or about July 2, 2014,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thomas was discharged from the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">On or about August 26, 2014, Thomas again sought treatment. The Allegany County Health Department allowed Thomas to enroll in the program from which he had been discharged, provided that Thomas took a urinalysis test on that day. Thomas failed to take the urinalysis test, and was not re-enrolled in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On August 28, 2014, Thomas consulted with a counselor and was again enrolled in the Intensive Outpatient Program, which now required attending counseling sessions three times per week. Thomas again failed to attend the required number of counseling sessions. As a result, Thomas was discharged yet again from the Intensive Outpatient Program. Thomas refrained from informing Bar Counsel of his two discharges, and also refrained from informing Bar Counsel that he was using alcohol and/or opiates. The hearing judge specifically found that Thomas\u2019s \u201cfailure to keep Bar Counsel informed was[ ] an attempt to continue practicing law and avoid the consequences of failing to attend the [counseling] programfs] and maintain his sobriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">On September 16, 2014, Thomas\u2019s former counselor informed Bar Counsel that Thomas had been discharged from the Intensive Outpatient Program. As a result, on or about December 17, 2014, the Commission revoked the Conditional Diversion Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Neither party excepts to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact; thus, we \u201ctreat the findings of fact as established!;.]\u201d Md. R. 16\u2014759(b)(2)(A). In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews without deference a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d).

Walker provided Thomas with a list of people who could testify on Lee\u2019s behalf in his criminal case. Thomas failed to interview or subpoena any of the people. Thomas also failed to attend the hearing in Lee\u2019s criminal case, offer to find another lawyer who could attend the hearing, or raise the possibility of requesting a postponement. The circumstance that the State dismissed the charges against Lee did not reheve Thomas of his duty to prepare for and attend the scheduled hearing in Lee\u2019s criminal case. Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>also failed to pursue a civil lawsuit on Lee\u2019s behalf in an attempt to obtain compensation for Lee\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Thomas violated MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3 in representing Sines. Despite being retained to obtain a divorce for Sines, Thomas never filed a complaint for divorce on Sines\u2019s behalf. Additionally, in Sines\u2019s guardianship matter, Thomas failed to timely file a petition for guardianship of the person of a disabled person. Furthermore, Sines provided Thomas with the names of several people, including Sines\u2019s daughter\u2019s pediatrician, who would have testified in support of Sines becoming her daughter\u2019s guardian. Thomas failed to interview any of the people; at the guardianship hearing, Thomas failed to call any witnesses; and the trial court did not appoint Sines as her daughter\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) and 1.4(a)(3) (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u201cA lawyer shall: ...

Thomas failed to contact Lee or Walker between January 2014 (the month in which Walker retained Thomas on Lee\u2019s behalf) and March 3, 2014 (when Walker telephoned Thomas the night before the hearing in Lee\u2019s criminal case). After March 3, 2014, Lee and Walker never heard from Thomas again, despite Walker\u2019s attempts to discuss a possible civil action against Kamp and/or a refund of Thomas\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Thomas violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) and 1.4(a)(3) in representing Sines. In March 2012, on several occasions, Sines unsuccessfully attempted to arrange an appointment with Thomas. On March 26, 2012, Thomas emailed Sines to tell her to review a complaint for divorce that was attached to the e-mail. Sines was unable to download and view the complaint for divorce. On March 28, 2012, Sines emailed Thomas to tell him to mail a paper copy of the complaint for divorce.

Davy, </em>435 Md. 674, 701-02, 80 A.3d 322, 338 (2013) (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Thomas violated MLRPC 1.5(a) in representing Lee. Thomas charged a flat fee of $750 to represent Lee in his criminal case. Thomas failed to interview potential witnesses, issue subpoenas, or attend the hearing in Lee\u2019s criminal case. Thomas\u2019s fee was unreasonable because he failed to perform any meaningful services for Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Thomas violated MLRPC 1.5(a) in representing Sines. Thomas charged Sines a flat fee that was approximately $1,500 to represent her for purposes of her separation and divorce. Thomas never filed a complaint for divorce on Sines\u2019s behalf. Thomas also charged Sines approximately $1,000 to represent her for purposes of becoming her daughter\u2019s guardian. Thomas failed to timely file a petition for guardianship of the person of a disabled person, failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>interview potential witnesses, and failed to call any witnesses at the guardianship hearing. Although he ultimately refunded part of his fees, both of Thomas\u2019s fees were unreasonable because he failed to perform any meaningful services for Sines.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">MLRPC 1.16(d) (Terminating Representation)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u201cUpon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client ... and refunding any advance payment of fee ... that has not been earnedf.]\u201d MLRPC 1.16(d). \u201cTermination of representation\u201d includes abandonment of representation. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Thomas abandoned his representation of Lee and Sines by abruptly and continuously failing to communicate with them and perform services for them; thus, Thomas effectively terminated his representation of Lee and Sines. Thomas never provided notice that he would be terminating his representation of Lee and Sines. Additionally, as discussed above, Thomas failed to earn the fees that he charged Lee and Sines and was paid; Thomas never provided Lee with a refund; and Thomas did not provide Sines with a refund until after she filed a complaint against him with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">MLRPC 8.1(b) (Disciplinary Matters) and 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">\u201c[A] lawyer ... in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not ... fail to disclose a fact [that is] necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>correct a misapprehension [that is] known by the [lawyer] to have arisen in the matter[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.1(b). \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit[,] or misrepresentation[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Thomas violated MLRPC 8.1(b) and 8.4(c). In the Conditional Diversion Agreement, Thomas agreed to \u201cabstain from all use of alcohol and/or opiates[,]\u201d to \u201carrange for counseling\u201d for substance abuse, and to \u201cwaive confidentiality to the extent necessary for Bar Counsel to confirm that [Thomas wa]s receiving counseling for his substance abuse problems[.]\u201d On two occasions, Thomas was discharged from a substance abuse program for failing to attend the required number of counseling sessions. Thomas refrained from informing Bar Counsel of the two discharges, and also refrained from informing Bar Counsel that he was using alcohol and/or opiates. The hearing judge found that Thomas\u2019s \u201cfailure to keep Bar Counsel informed was[] an attempt to continue practicing law and avoid the consequences of failing to attend the [counseling] programfs] and maintain his sobriety.\u201d In other words, Thomas failed to disclose a fact that was necessary to correct Bar Counsel\u2019s impression that Thomas was complying with the Conditional Diversion Agreement. We agree with the hearing judge\u2019s determination that Thomas\u2019s refraining from informing Bar Counsel of his violations of the Conditional Diversion Agreement constituted dishonesty that was motivated by Thomas\u2019s desire to continue practicing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d). \u201cGenerally, a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer\u2019s conduct would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

As discussed above, Thomas abandoned his representation of Lee and Sines; thus, Thomas engaged in conduct that would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public. A lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) by abandoning his or her representation of a client. <em>See Shuler, </em>443 Md. at 505-06, 117 A.3d at 45 (\u201cShuler essentially abandoned her representation of [a client], and thus engaged in conduct that would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Thomas violated MLRPC 8.4(d) in connection with the Conditional Diversion Agreement. For the purpose of continuing to practice law, Thomas dishonestly refrained from informing Bar Counsel that he was using alcohol and/or opiates and that, on two occasions, he had been discharged from a substance abuse program for failing to attend the required number of counseling sessions. In dishonestly refraining from informing Bar Counsel of these matters, Thomas engaged in conduct that would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public. Indeed, no reasonable member of the public would expect a lawyer to violate a conditional diversion agreement and dishonestly refrain from informing Bar Counsel as much so that the lawyer could continue to practice law. A lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) by being dishonest with Bar Counsel in connection with a disciplinary matter. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brigerman, </em>441 Md. 23, 40-41, 105 A.3d 467, 477 (2014) (\u201c[Brigerman] violated MLRPC 8.4(d) ... when [Brigerman] misrepresented to Bar Counsel that he would send promptly [a client\u2019s case file to him, upon his written request.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(B) Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The Commission recommended that we disbar Thomas, who failed to recommend a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In <em>Shuler, </em>443 Md. at 506-07, 117 A.3d at 46, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">This Court sanctions a lawyer not to punish the lawyer, but instead to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession.

De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 557-58, 16 A.3d 181, 195 (2011), this Court disbarred a lawyer who violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.16(d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d). The lawyer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">clearly neglected his clients, leaving one client to fend for himself at his own hearing and the other to lose his cause of action entirely for failure to prosecute. [The lawyer] also repeatedly ignored his clients\u2019 inquiries into the status of their cases, and then moved his practice without informing his clients of his new contact information. He then later declined to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 558, 16 A.3d at 195. This Court did not note any aggravating factors, and observed that there were no mitigating factors. <em>See id. </em>at 558, 16 A.3d at 195. This Court explained: \u201cWe previously have found disbarment to be appropriate when attorneys repeatedly neglect client affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 16 A.3d at 195 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Here, Thomas violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), 1.5(a), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). Thomas abandoned his representation of Lee and Sines and dishonestly refrained from informing Bar Counsel that he was using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>alcohol and/or opiates and that, on two occasions, he had been discharged from a substance abuse program for failing to attend the required number of counseling sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Thomas injured Lee by depriving him and/or Walker of $750 in exchange for no meaningful services, failing to attend the scheduled hearing in Lee\u2019s criminal case, and failing to pursue a civil lawsuit on Lee\u2019s behalf in an attempt to obtain compensation for Lee\u2019s medical expenses. Thomas injured Sines by failing to file a complaint for divorce on Sines\u2019s behalf, forcing Sines and her daughter to experience the expense and inconvenience of having Sines\u2019s daughter evaluated one more time than was necessary in connection with Sine\u2019s guardianship matter, and failing to call any witnesses at the guardianship hearing. Ostensibly, Thomas\u2019s failure to call any witnesses played a role in the trial court\u2019s decision not to appoint Sines as her daughter\u2019s guardian. Additionally, in connection with Lee\u2019s matter, Sines\u2019s matters, and the Conditional Diversion Agreement, Thomas engaged in conduct that would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We note seven aggravating factors. First, Thomas had a dishonest or selfish motive, as Thomas\u2019s refraining from informing Bar Counsel that he was using alcohol and/or opiates and that on two occasions he had been discharged from a substance abuse program for failing to attend the required number of counseling sessions, constituted dishonesty that was motivated by Thomas\u2019s desire to continue practicing law. Second, Thomas committed multiple violations of the MLRPC. Third, Thomas has substantial experience in the practice of law, as he had been a member of the Bar of Maryland for more than a decade at the time of his misconduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Fourth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Thomas has shown indifference to making restitution, as he never provided Lee and/or Walker with a refund, and provided Sines with a refund only after she filed a complaint against him with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Even more importantly, fifth, sixth, and seventh, Thomas has received prior attorney discipline, has demonstrated a pattern of misconduct, and has shown that he is likely to repeat his misconduct. In 2008, the Commission reprimanded Thomas by consent for violating MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence) by \u201cfailing] to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his client and failing] to respond to requests for production of documents and evidence of causation in a timely manner[.]\u201d Just two years later, this Court granted a joint petition to suspend Thomas from the practice of law in Maryland for sixty days for violating MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, </em>413 Md. 520, 993 A.2d 626 (2010). In 2010, Thomas began representing Sines in her separation and divorce matter. In 2011, Thomas began representing Sines in her guardianship matter. As discussed above, Thomas violated MLRPC 1.3 in both of Sines\u2019s matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">On or about March 20, 2013, Thomas and Bar Counsel entered into the Conditional Diversion Agreement, which partially arose out of Thomas\u2019s representation of Sines. The Conditional Diversion Agreement stated that Thomas\u2019s \u201calleged misconduct\u201d in Sines\u2019s separation and divorce matter included a violation of, among others, MLRPC 1.3. The Conditional Diversion Agreement also stated that Thomas \u201cacknowledge^] that he ha[d] engaged in professional misconduct[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Despite having consented to a reprimand by the Commission for violating MLRPC 1.3, having consented to being suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for sixty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>for violating MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3, and having entered into a conditional diversion agreement that was based on a violation of, among others, MLRPC 1.3, Thomas violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing Lee in 2014. Thus, in three prior instances, Thomas acknowledged that he had violated MLRPC 1.3, then proceeded to violate MLRPC 1.3 again in a later case. Thomas\u2019s repeated violations demonstrate both a pattern of misconduct and the likelihood that, if permitted to continue to practice law, Thomas would continue to fail to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The hearing judge did not find any mitigating factors, and we discern none. We observe that the record implies that Thomas has alcoholism. Specifically, in the Conditional Diversion Agreement, Thomas agreed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at least once per week and to abstain from all use of alcohol. As noted above, however, a lawyer\u2019s alcoholism is a mitigating factor if and only if, among other things, \u201cthe lawyer\u2019s recovery from [alcoholism] is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation[.]\u201d <em>Shuler, </em>443 Md. at 507, 117 A.3d at 46 (citation omitted). Here, Thomas has not engaged in a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; to the contrary, on two occasions, Thomas had been discharged from a substance abuse program for failing to attend the required number of counseling sessions. Thus, alcoholism does not mitigate Thomas\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In agreement with the Commission, we concluded that the appropriate sanction for Thomas\u2019s misconduct was disbarment. Here, as in <em>De La Paz, </em>418 Md. at 557-58, 16 A.3d at 195, disbarment was the appropriate sanction for neglecting clients in two unrelated cases, failing to provide competent and diligent representation, failing to adequately communicate with clients, charging unreasonable fees, failing to properly terminate representation, and failing to provide information to Bar Counsel, all without a single mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">If anything, disbarment was even more appropriate here than it was in <em>De La Paz. </em>For one reason, there were no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>aggravating factors in <em>De La Paz; </em>by contrast, here, as discussed above, there are multiple aggravating factors, including prior attorney discipline, a dishonest or selfish motive, indifference to making restitution, a pattern of misconduct, and a likelihood of repetition of the misconduct. Additionally, unlike the lawyer in <em>De La Paz, </em>Thomas violated MLRPC 8.4(c); specifically, for the purpose of continuing to practice law, Thomas dishonestly refrained from informing Bar Counsel that he was using alcohol and/or opiates and that, on two occasions, he had been discharged from a substance abuse program for failing to attend the required number of counseling sessions. \u201cAbsent compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer will result in disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Katz, </em>443 Md. 389, 411, 116 A.3d 999, 1012 (2015) (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, there are no mitigating factors, let alone compelling extenuating circumstances, that would have justified a lesser sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">For the above reasons, on November 10, 2015, we disbarred Thomas and awarded costs against him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-12\">.
