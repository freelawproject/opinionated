Bar Counsel charged Good with violating the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) in her capacity as a representative of Blaine A. White, Jeanne P. Delaney, Joseph A. Chester, III, Eriss Tubman, Cynthia Lewis, and Paul D. Newman. Specifically, Bar Counsel alleged that Good violated the following rules: (1) MLRPC 1.1 (Competence); (2) MLRPC 1.2 (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer); (3) MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence); (4) MLRPC 1.4 (Communication); (5) MLRPC 1.5 (Fees); (6) MLRPC 1.15 (Safekeeping Property); (7) MLRPC 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation); (8) MLRPC 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); and (9) MLRPC 8.4 (Misconduct). In addition, Bar Counsel alleged that Good violated \u00a7 10-306 of the Maryland Code (1989, Repl.Vol.2010), Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the petitions to the Honorable Nancy M. Purpura (\u201chearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Good did not attend the hearings conducted on April 2, 2015 and August 21, 2015. Following the hearings, Judge Purpura issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which she found by clear and convincing evidence that Good violated MLRPC 1.1; MLRPC 1.2(a); MLRPC 1.3; MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b); MLRPC 1.5(a); MLRPC 1.15(a), (c), and (d); MLRPC 1.16(d); MLRPC 8.1(b); MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d); and \u00a7 10-306 of the Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article. Neither Bar Counsel nor Good filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Good did not appear before us for oral argument as to sanction. We issued a per curiam order on November 6, 2015, disbarring Good immediately from the practice of law. We now explain the reasons for that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Tamara Good was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 17, 2008, and maintained a practice in Towson, Maryland. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Because the petitions here arose out of six separate client complaints, we set forth the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings pertaining to each client complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Complaint of Blaine A. White</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Before retaining Good, Blaine A. White and Virlynn D. Atkinson-White (\u201cMr. and Mrs. White\u201d) failed to make three months of mortgage payments to their mortgage lender, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, NA (\u201cChase\u201d). In May 2012, Mr. and Mrs'. White retained Good to file a lawsuit against Chase. Mr. and Mrs. White paid Good a $500 retainer fee. In December 2012, Good filed a lawsuit against Chase in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and the timeline of events as found by the hearing judge followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">On or about March 15, 2013, [Good] filed an Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial. On March 15, 2013, [Good] filed a Motion for Extension of Time to file a Response to Chase\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. On March 29, 2013, Chase filed a Motion to Dismiss Mr. and Mrs. White\u2019s case. On April 16, 2013, [Good\u2019s] Motion for Extension was denied by the court, although the court allowed her to submit a response by April 17, 2013. On April 22, 2013, [Good] filed a Response to Chase\u2019s Motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">On April 22, 2013, Chase filed a Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions. [Good] did not file a response to Chase\u2019s Motion for Sanctions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In June 2013, Good emailed Mr. White advising him that she was awaiting the court\u2019s opinion. Shortly thereafter, Mr. White emailed Good requesting a status update. Later that month, the federal judge granted Chase\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint and Chase\u2019s motion for sanctions, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>granted the Whites\u2019 motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Good, however, never filed a second amended complaint on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. White.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Mr. and Mrs. White were unable to reach Good and obtain status updates regarding their case. Mr. and Mrs. White \u201crepeatedly\u201d attempted to telephone Good during the summer of 2013, but she did not return their phone calls. Mr. and Mrs. White also emailed Good in October and November 2013 requesting a status update of their case, but Good did not respond to these requests. The hearing judge found that despite the Whites\u2019 telephone calls and emails, Good \u201cfailed to inform Mr. and Mrs. White that their case was dismissed or file additional pleadings on their behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Complaint of Jeanne Delaney</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In June 2010, Jeanne Delaney retained Good to file a bankruptcy petition on her behalf. During Delaney\u2019s initial meeting with Good, she provided Good with a check in the amount of $1,329.00 for legal services. Good\u2019s \u201ctotal attorney\u2019s fees for Ms. Delaney\u2019s case, including the plan payments and the initial payment of $1,329.00 totaled $4,904.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">After this meeting, the hearing judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">On June 21, 2010, [Good] filed Ms. Delaney\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Case Number 10-23937). Ms. Delaney continued to make Plan payments over the next three years. On December 20, 2013 Ms. Delaney received a notice from the bankruptcy court informing her that her case would be closed without proper discharge. [Good] failed to file the letter of discharge for Ms. Delaney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">Shortly thereafter, Ms. Delaney repeatedly attempted to contact [Good] to no avail. [Good] did not return Ms. Delaney\u2019s phone calls. Ms. Delaney sought assistance from Legal Aid and was able to complete the Debtor\u2019s Affidavit Requesting Discharge <em>pro se. </em>On January 8, 2014, Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Delaney\u2019s bankruptcy was discharged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Complaint of Joseph Chester</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In October 2012, Joseph Chester retained Good to file a bankruptcy petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland. Chester is retired from the United States Postal Service and currently suffers from scleroderma and arthritis. Chester paid Good a total of $1,481 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">After filing a bankruptcy petition on behalf of Chester, Good telephoned Chester at 11:00 A.M. on October 15, 2013 to inform him that he needed to be present at a hearing at the bankruptcy court at 2:00 P.M. on the same day. Prior to October 15, 2013, Chester had not been provided sufficient notice that his presence was necessary at the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">On October 17, 2013, the bankruptcy judge issued an order denying confirmation of the plan with leave to amend. The order required that an amended plan be filed on or before November 4, 2013. Good told Chester that she would be filing an amended plan before November 4, 2013. After receiving a copy of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, Chester contacted Good \u201crepeatedly\u201d to remind her of the court\u2019s denying confirmation of the plan. Nonetheless, Good failed to respond to Chester\u2019s phone calls. Good then failed to file an amended plan with the bankruptcy court and Chester\u2019s case was dismissed in November 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">At Good\u2019s disciplinary hearing, Chester testified that she failed to pursue his bankruptcy to its conclusion. The hearing judge found that \u201c[Good\u2019s] inaction resulted in the near dismissal\u201d of Chester\u2019s bankruptcy until his new attorney began handling the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Complaint of Eriss Tubman</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">In May 2010, Eriss Tubman retained Good to file a bankruptcy petition on her behalf. In June 2013, Tubman met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>with Good and gave her $1,271 to begin the preparation of the bankruptcy petition. Tubman paid $1,671 in total attorney\u2019s fees and filing fees for the bankruptcy. In September 2013, Good informed Tubman that she was having family problems that prevented her from filing the bankruptcy petition. Later that month, Good filed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">After the petition was filed, Tubman attended the meeting of creditors in October 2013. Good contacted Tubman in November 2013 and told her that she did not have to attend the confirmation hearing later that month. Tubman then attempted to contact Good on several occasions over a nine month period, but Good did not reply to these voicemail requests for information. In June 2014, Tubman sent Good a termination letter informing her that she had \u201ccalled her several times a month since our last face to face meeting which was with the creditors\u201d and wrote that their last telephone conversation had been on November 11, 2013. Tubman also filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission in June 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Bar Counsel sent Good two letters in July 2014 regarding Tubman\u2019s complaint, but Good never replied to either of these letters. In September 2014, Good filed a motion to withdraw with the bankruptcy court. Good, however, did not provide Tubman with notice that she was withdrawing from her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Complaint of Cynthia Lewis</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Good met with Cynthia Lewis in 2012 to discuss Lewis\u2019s legal options related to her financial situation. In September 2013, Good filed a bankruptcy petition on behalf of Lewis. Lewis agreed to pay Good $3,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and filing fees under the retainer agreement. Lewis attended the meeting of creditors in October 2013 and her repayment plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court in December 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The hearing judge found that \u201c[Good] failed to respond to Ms. Lewis\u2019s requests for information concerning her case.\u201d In June 2014, Lewis sent Good a letter regarding the status of her bankruptcy case and sent a second letter regarding Good\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>lack of communication. Good did not respond to either of these letters. In addition, the U.S. bankruptcy trustee wrote to Lewis that she had been unable to contact Good. Lewis was unable to retain new counsel for her bankruptcy matter because of her financial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">During AGC\u2019s investigation of Lewis\u2019s complaint, Good was similarly unresponsive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">On July 24, 2014, Bar Counsel sent [Good] a letter notifying her of Ms. Lewis\u2019s complaint. [Good] failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s initial letter. On August 13, 2014, Bar Counsel sent [Good] a second letter notifying her of Ms. Lewis\u2019s complaint. [Good] failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s second letter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Complaint of Paul Newman</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In March 2009, Paul Newman, a disabled retiree, retained Good to file a patent application \"with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and paid $2,500 in total attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Newman provided Good with original drawings of his design for her to file with his application. Although Good initially communicated with Newman, the hearing judge found that he later experienced difficulty contacting Good:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1V\">[Good] provided invoices to Mr. Newman related to her purported work on Mr. Newman\u2019s USPTO application for work performed in 2009. In 2009, [Good] initially contacted Mr. Newman on a regular basis, but later ceased all communication sometime in 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">Beginning in 2009 through 2013, Mr. Newman continued to contact [Good] to arrange meetings with her, but she cancelled each of their scheduled meetings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>In September 2014, Bar Counsel sent Good two letters notifying her of Newman\u2019s complaint, but she failed to respond to either of these letters. Notably, the hearing judge also found that Good has neither provided Newman a refund of attorney\u2019s fees for the patent application nor returned copies of his original drawings.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">From the facts of the six complaints, the hearing judge concluded that Good violated MLRPC 1.1; 1.2(a); 1.3; 1.4(a) and (b); 1.5(a); 1.15(a), (c), and (d); 1.16(d); 8.1(b); and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). The hearing judge also decided that Good violated \u00a7 10-306 of the Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Rule 1.1<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">MLRPC 1.1 requires that an attorney provide competent representation. As to Blaine White\u2019s complaint, the hearing judge found that \u201c[Good] failed to accomplish what she was hired for: to complete the prosecution of [ ] Wfiiite\u2019s [sic] case against Chase.\u201d The judge concluded that Good\u2019s failure to file a second amended complaint after the district judge granted Chase\u2019s motion to dismiss constituted a lack of thoroughness and supported a violation of Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The judge also determined that Good failed to provide competent representation of Joseph Chester when she failed to file an amended plan, which \u201clargely led\u201d to the dismissal of Chester\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding. The judge stated that this \u201cinaction\u201d violated Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Regarding the complaints of Eriss Tubman, Cynthia Lewis, and Paul Newman, the hearing judge wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Competency includes, \u201cat a minimum, the attorney\u2019s presence at any court proceeding for which he or she was retained, absent an acceptable explanation for that attorney\u2019s absence.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 403, 784 A.2d 516, 531 (2001); <em>see Attorney Grievance Commission v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. [at] 534, 553-54, 16 A.3d [at] 181, 193 (2011) (finding that an attorney violated MLRPC 1.1 when he failed to appear before the court in his client\u2019s case). If an attorney \u201cfails to act or acts in an untimely manner, resulting in harm to his or her client,\u201d generally this Court finds a violation of MLRPC 1.1. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Thomas, </em>440 Md. 523, 551, 103 A.3d 629, 646-647 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">[Good] failed to provide competent representation to both Ms. Tubman and Ms. Lewis in that she failed to continue to represent them during their Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings despite their requests for information. [Good] failed to act with the requisite legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation thereby violating RPC 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">[Good] also violated RPC 1.1 for Mr. Newman\u2019s case. [Good] did little to no discernable work on Mr. Newman\u2019s case after she was retained to file his USPTO application. Respondent\u2019s conduct supports a violation of RPC 1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Rule 1.2(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">MLRPC 1.2(a) requires that an attorney abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tion and, when appropriate, consult with the client as to the means by which those objectives are to be pursued. Addressing Blaine White\u2019s complaint, the hearing judge concluded that Good violated Rule 1.2(a) when she failed to \u201cfully prosecute the White\u2019s [sic] case with their informed consent.\u201d The judge also found a violation of Rule 1.2(a) when Good failed to file papers seeking discharge for Jeanne Delaney in her bankruptcy proceeding. In addition, the hearing judge determined that Good violated Rule 1.2(a) when she failed to file an amended petition on behalf of Joseph Chester after he \u201crepeatedly asked\u201d her to do so. The judge wrote that Good \u201ccontinually ignored [Chester\u2019s] entreaties to assist him\u201d and that this conduct supported a violation of Rule 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The hearing judge concluded that Good\u2019s failure \u201cto fully execute her clients\u2019 objectives\u201d and her actions while representing Eriss Tubman, Cynthia Lewis, and Paul Newman constituted a violation of Rule 1.2(a). The judge pointed to Good\u2019s failure to provide Tubman with information concerning her bankruptcy as well as her decision to withdraw from Tubman\u2019s case without first consulting her client as support for a Rule 1.2 violation. The hearing judge highlighted Good\u2019s failure to respond to requests for information by Lewis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>her performing almost no legal services concerning Newman\u2019s patent application as additional violations of Rule 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Rule 1.3<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">MLRPC 1.3 stipulates that a \u201clawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that Good\u2019s failure to file a response to Chase\u2019s motion to dismiss within the time specified by the court, failure to respond to Chase\u2019s motion for sanctions, and failure to inform the Whites that they had leave to file a second amended complaint before she \u201cabandon[ed]\u201d their case constituted a violation of Rule 1.3. The judge determined that Good also violated Rule 1.3 when she failed to file papers seeking discharge, which \u201ccould have resulted in the dismissal\u201d of Jeanne Delaney\u2019s bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Further, the hearing judge found that Good failed to represent Joseph Chester with reasonable diligence and promptness when she failed to file an amended plan as ordered by the bankruptcy court, which resulted in the dismissal of Chester\u2019s bankruptcy. The judge also concluded that Good violated Rule 1.3 when she initially filed bankruptcy petitions on behalf of Eriss Tubman and Cynthia Lewis but \u201cfailed to complete the representation.\u201d Finally, the judge cited Good\u2019s deficient representation of Paul Newman in his patent application as another violation of Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Rule 1.4(a) and (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">MLRPC 1.4 mandates that attorneys communicate with their clients. The hearing judge identified many instane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>es in which Good failed to act in accordance with this rule. As to the complaint of Blaine White, the judge concluded that Good violated Rule 1.4 \u201cby failing to respond to both Mr. and Mrs. White\u2019s separate requests for information regarding their case.\u201d The judge explained that \u201cMr. and Mrs. White frequently contacted [Good], but she failed to respond to any of their phone calls or emails.\u201d Additionally, the judge concluded that Good\u2019s failure to \u201ccommunicate to her clients that there was a need to file a [s]econd [a]mended [c]omplaint\u201d supported a finding of a Rule 1.4 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The judge also concluded that Good violated Rule 1.4 when she \u201cfailed to return [Jeanne] Delaney\u2019s phone calls regarding requests for updates concerning her case.\u201d In addition, the judge concluded that Good initially communicated with Joseph Chester, but \u201cas time progressed,\u201d Good \u201cfailed to communicate with him regarding updates concerning his case.\u201d The judge stated that Good\u2019s behavior denied Chester the \u201copportunity to make informed decisions regarding his representation.\u201d The judge also found that Good \u201crepeatedly failed to communicate\u201d with Eriss Tubman, Cynthia Lewis, and Paul Newman: \u201c[Good] failed to respond to her clients\u2019 requests for information and failed to update them on the status of their legal matters in violation of RPC 1.4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Rule 1.5(a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">MLRPC 1.5(a) provides that a \u201clawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>unreasonable amount for expenses.\u201d Regarding the complaint of Blaine White, the hearing judge concluded Good violated Rule 1.5 and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">Good billed a flat fee of $500.00, which on its face was not an excessive fee. However, the court finds that [Good\u2019s] overall billing charges were unreasonable, considering her inability to complete Mr. and Mrs. White\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">Part (4) of RPC 1.5(a) contemplates the amount of fees involved and the results obtained, which is perhaps the most glaring example of why [Good\u2019s] billing was excessive. [Good] failed to complete the legal matter for which she was hired, with the exception of the initial and amended filing of the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The judge also concluded that Good violated Rule 1.5 while representing Jeanne Delaney. The judge reasoned that Good was paid $4,904 to complete Delaney\u2019s bankruptcy yet \u201cfailed to perform the legal services for which she was retained and therefore was not entitled to the entire $4,904.00 fee.\u201d As to Joseph Chester\u2019s complaint, the judge stated that Good\u2019s \u201cfailure to pursue [Chester\u2019s bankruptcy] to its conclusion resulted in her obtaining an excessive fee\u201d and concluded that this violated Rule 1.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Additionally, the hearing judge concluded that Good violated Rule 1.5 in her representation of Eriss Tubman, Cynthia Lewis, and Paul Newman. The judge cited our recognition that fees charged when little or no work is performed are unreasonable fees under Rule 1.5(a) and offered the following support for her conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">According to [Good\u2019s] retainer agreement, [Good] was hired by Ms. Lewis for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">a. Analysis of the debtor\u2019s financial situation and rendering advice to the debtor in determining whether to file a petition in bankruptcy and if so under which Chapter of Bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">b. Preparation and filing of any petition, schedules, statement of financial affairs, and plan which may be required; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">c. Representation of the debtor at the initial meeting of creditors and confirmation hearing, and any adjourned hearings thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">[Good] did not adhere to the terms of her representation agreement in its entirety for Ms. Lewis. [Good\u2019s] failure to communicate with the bankruptcy trustee in Ms. Lewis\u2019s case violated both (b) and (c) of her representation agreement.

Specifically, the judge highlighted Good\u2019s failure to return Newman\u2019s original drawings related to his patent application.

The judge explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">[Good] did not refund unearned attorney\u2019s fees to either Ms. Tubman or Ms. Lewis for the portion of the work that she did not complete related to their bankruptcies. Additionally, [Good] failed to refund any attorney\u2019s fees for Mr. Newman\u2019s USPTO application matter for which she produced no tangible work.

In that regard, we examine the record to ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to support the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions, by a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, we shall accept the hearing judge\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). In addition, based upon our review without deference to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, we agree that Good violated the following MLRPC provisions: Rule 1.1; Rule 1.2(a); Rule 1.3; Rule 1.4(a) and (b); Rule 1.5(a); Rule 1.15(a), (c), and (d); Rule 1.16(d); Rule 8.1(b); and Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d). We also agree that Good violated \u00a7 10-306 of the Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">As a general principle, when a lawyer is found to have engaged in misconduct, this Court sanctions the lawyer not to punish the lawyer, but to protect the public and to maintain confidence in the legal profession. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Greenleaf, </em>438 Md. 151, 163, 91 A.3d 1066, 1073 (2014). In attorney discipline cases, the appropriate sanction depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including our assessment of aggravating and mitigating factors promulgated by the American Bar Association. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Coppock, </em>432 Md. 629, 648, 69 A.3d 1092, 1102 (2013). We also keep in mind that sanctions should be \u201ccommensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stein, </em>373 Md. 531, 537, 819 A.2d 372, 375 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Here, Bar Counsel recommends that Good be disbarred. In its Recommendation for Sanction, Bar Counsel directs the Court\u2019s attention to five aggravating factors found in Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association\u2019s Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Counsel points to Good\u2019s dishonest or selfish motive (Standard 9.22(b)), her pattern of misconduct (Standard 9.22(c)), her multiple offenses (Standard 9.22(d)), her failure to respond to requests during the disciplinary process (Standard 9.22(e)), and the vulnerability of the victims affected by the conduct (Standard 9.22(h)). Indeed, the hearing judge found by clear and convincing evidence that Good\u2019s conduct fell within these aggravating factors. Consequently, these factors support a sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">When determining the appropriate sanction, we must also consider any mitigating factors. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137, 165, 904 A.2d 557, 574 (2006) (\u201cThe appropriate sanction depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including any mitigating factors.\u201d); <em>see Coppock, </em>432 Md. at 648, 69 A.3d at 1102. The hearing judge in this proceeding found no mitigating factors, and there is no reason to upset that finding. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. West, </em>378 Md. 395, 411, 836 A.2d 588, 597 (2003) (\u201cOn review, we keep in mind that the findings of the trial judge are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Pertaining to Good\u2019s failure to communicate with her clients, her egregious abandonment of client cases, her repeated ignoring of clients\u2019 requests for status updates, and her failure to return unearned fees as well as original design drawings in a patent application matter, we are guided by our holding in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Heung Sik Park, </em>427 Md. 180, 46 A.3d 1153 (2012). In that case, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">[Disbarment is the appropriate sanction when an attorney abandons a client by failing to pursue the client\u2019s interests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>failing to communicate with the client, ignoring a client\u2019s repeated requests for status updates, terminating the representation without notice by failing wholly to provide effective services, and failing to return unearned fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 196, 46 A.3d at 1162. Good\u2019s conduct while representing Blaine White, Jeanne Delaney, Joseph Chester, Eriss Tubman, Cynthia Lewis, and Paul Newman fits well within the dictates of <em>Park.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.
