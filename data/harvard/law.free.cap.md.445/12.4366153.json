Here, however, the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the District Court to a circuit court was untimely. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction; and, resolution of the question presented must wait for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">On November 1, 2013, The Brownstones at Park Potomac Homeowners Association (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) filed in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County (\u201cthe District Court\u201d) a complaint against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cRespondent\u201d) alleging that Respondent had failed to pay homeowners\u2019 association dues since taking possession of property in Potomac, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">On November 27, 2013, Respondent filed a Notice of Intention to Defend generally denying the facts averred in the complaint as well as \u201cany and all liability!)]\u201d On January 28, 2014, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss. On March 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>2014, the District Court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss and held the matter <em>sub curia. </em>Later that day, the District Court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss. According to its certificate of service, the District Court\u2019s order was sent to each party\u2019s counsel on March 10, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">On April 10, 2014, Petitioner appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d), which affirmed the judgment of the District Court without a hearing. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Broumstones at Park Potomac v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, </em>441 Md. 666, 109 A.3d 665 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Respondent moves to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, contending that Petitioner\u2019s appeal to the circuit court was untimely. Respondent alleges that the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the case was entered on the docket on March 10, 2014, and that Petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed until April 10, 2014, one day after expiration of the thirty-day appeal period. Petitioner responds that the District Court docket is ambiguous as to the date on which the District Court\u2019s order was entered. Petitioner argues that, in light of alleged ambiguity on the docket, and because Respondent has not previously raised an issue as to the timeliness of the filing of the notice of appeal, this Court should deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Md.Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. (1973, 2013 RepLVol., 2015 Supp.) \u00a7 12-401(e)(l) sets forth the time for filing an appeal from an order of the District Court, stating: \u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an appeal shall be taken by filing an order for appeal with the clerk of the District Court within 30 days from the date .of the final judgment from which appealed.\u201d Correspondingly, Maryland Rule 7-104(a), concerning the timing for filing an appeal from the District Court to a circuit court, clearly provides that, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in this Rule or by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d At the time when the judgment and appeal were filed in this case, Maryland Rule T\u2014104(e) defined \u201centry\u201d for purposes of the Rule as \u201coccur[ring] on the day when the District Court first makes a record in writing of the judgment, notice or order on the file jacket, or on a docket within the file, according to the practice of that court, and records the actual date of the entry.\u201d Md. R. 7-104(e) (2014) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">It is of no consequence that Respondent has not previously raised an issue concerning the appeal\u2019s timeliness. <em>See </em>Md. R. 8-131(a) (\u201cThe issue[ ] of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter ... may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court.\u201d). In this case, the appeal to the circuit court was untimely\u2014mandating dismissal of the instant appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Cf. Ruby v. State, </em>353 Md. 100, 113, 724 A.2d 673, 679 (1999) (In discussing an appeal from a circuit court to the Court of Special Appeals, we stated: \u201cMaryland Rule 8-202(a) mandates that a \u2018notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u2019 Failure of an aggrieved party to so file terminates its right of appeal[,] and the appellate court ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>quires no jurisdiction to hear that matter.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">There is no ambiguity in the record as to the date on which judgment was entered in the District Court. The District Court docket contains multiple entries dated March 10, 2014. One entry, labeled \u201cGeneral Dismissal,\u201d states: \u201cComplaint dismissed by court[.]\u201d (Capitalization omitted). Another entry, labeled \u201cTrial Delete,\u201d states: \u201cDismissal entered[.]\u201d (Capitalization omitted). Significantly, another entry is labeled \u201cCourt Order Entered\u201d and spans five lines on the docket, stating: \u201cBased on the foregoing and after consideration on this 10th day of March 2014 it is therefore ordered that [Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted and it is further ordered that the above referenced suit is dismissed with prejudice.\u201d (Capitalization omitted). Thus, it is evident that judgment was entered on March 10, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Docket entries for March 11, 2014, state: (1) \u201cComment\u201d stating \u201cfile rec\u2019d back in Rockville\u201d; (2) \u201cTrial/Hearing Postponement\u201d stating \u201cprev set on 11052013\u201d; and (3) \u201cNotice Sent\u201d stating \u201cNotice of Trial Postponement (ATP)\u2014Cl\u201d and \u201cAlso sent to\u2014ATD[.]\u201d (Capitalization omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The docket also contains several entries dated March 28, 2014, including: (1) \u201cMotion Change\u201d stating \u201cto dismiss\u201d; (2) \u201cNotice Sent\u201d stating \u201cNotice of outcome of motion filed\u201d and \u201calso sent to\u2014 ATD\u201d; and (3) \u201cNotice Sent\u201d stating \u201cNotice of Dismissal\u201d and \u201calso sent to\u2014ATD.\u201d (Capitalization omitted). A copy of the District Court\u2019s Order, signed on March 10, 2014, contains the handwritten initials \u201cTM\u201d and a small date stamp on the bottom-left corner reading \u201cMar 28, 2014.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-104(e) (2014), we conclude that the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the case was entered onto the docket within the file, as the docket entries state, on March 10, 2014; <em>ie., </em>on March 10, 2014, \u201cthe District Court first ma[d]e[ ] a record in writing of the ... order on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>... [the] docket within the file, ... and recorded] the actual date of the entry\u201d by notating and entering onto the electronic docket the order dismissing the case. Petitioner had thirty days from that date to file a notice of appeal. The docket entries are not \u201cambiguous,\u201d as Petitioner urges this Court to conclude. Certain docket entries for March 10, 2014, are specifically and expressly labeled \u201cCourt Order Entered\u201d and detail that the motion to dismiss was granted and that the case was dismissed with prejudice. The docket entries for March 11, 2014, are routine ministerial entries detailing that the file returned to Rockville and that the trial previously set was postponed. And the docket entries for March 28, 2014, note simply that a notice of the outcome of the motion to dismiss and a notice of dismissal were sent out by the clerk\u2019s office. The date on which the clerk\u2019s office sends a notice is not the date of the entry of the order for purposes of Maryland Rule 7-104(a). As stated above, Maryland Rule 7-104(e) (2014) defined \u201centry\u201d as \u201coccur[ring] on the day when the District Court first makes a record in writing of the ... order ... on a docket within the file, ... and records the actual date of the entry[,]\u201d and not as the date on which the District Court sends a \u201cnotice\u201d that a particular event was entered onto docket. Furthermore, according to its certificate of service the District Court\u2019s order was sent to each party\u2019s counsel on March 10, 2014; in other words, there is simply no basis for Petitioner\u2019s position that the District Court\u2019s order was not docketed until March 28, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Petitioner had thirty days from March 10, 2014, to note an appeal of District Court\u2019s order dismissing the case. Thirty days from March 10, 2014, was April 9, 2014; however, Petitioner noted an appeal to the circuit court on April 10, 2014, one day after expiration of the thirty-day appeal period set forth in Maryland Rule 7-104(a). Petitioner has not identified any rule, statute, or case extending its time for noting an appeal, and we know of none applicable under these circumstances. Petitioner, like any other party, is responsible for complying with the Maryland Rules, including Maryland Rule 7-104(a). <em>See Woodfield v. West River Imp. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>395 Md. 377, 388-89, 910 A.2d 452, 459 (2006) (\u201cWhen a legislative body commands that something be done, using words such as \u2018shall\u2019 or \u2018must,\u2019 rather than \u2018may\u2019 or \u2018should,\u2019 we must assume, absent some evidence to the contrary, that it was serious and that it meant for the thing to be done in the manner it directed. In that sense, the obligation to comply with the statute (or rule) is both mandatory and directory.\u201d (Citation omitted)). In this case, we conclude that the appeal to the circuit court was untimely and that, not only did the circuit court lack jurisdiction for the appeal, but also this Court lacks jurisdiction to address the appeal on <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.
