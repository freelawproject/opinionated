This finding was based on Mother taking her child to health providers on multiple occasions after the child complained that her father had hurt her, and the child exhibited vaginal redness. Our decision hinges on the role of scienter in such a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In 2010 the Washington County Department of Social Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d) conducted investigations of Mother\u2019s alleged abuse and neglect of her daughter (\u201cR\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The investigations were triggered by multiple allegations by R that her biological father (Mother\u2019s ex-husband) had sexually abused her when she visited him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mother reported these allegations at various medical facilities, where R was subjected to eight vaginal exams<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> over the course of several years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These exams showed evidence of vaginal redness or discharge, not sexual abuse. Those who examined R, however, could not fully discount her allegation that her father had \u201churt her bottom.\u201d As one medical professional noted, a normal exam does not exclude sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>R received a ninth vaginal exam at a pediatric practice. Mother took R in because of a cough and an injury. When R reported that her father hurt her \u201cbottom,\u201d a physician assistant examined her vaginal area. The assistant referred Mother to a medical facility equipped to further evaluate R. But at the Department\u2019s request,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that facility refused to conduct a SAFE exam on R. This is the only evidence that a medical professional refused to examine R out of concern for her mental health. Mother testified that since then, R made more allegations of abuse against her father, but that she was afraid to take her to a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The Department asked two experts in clinical child welfare, Dr. Carlton E. Munson (\u201cMunson\u201d) and Ronald E. Zuskin, LCSW-C<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u201cZuskin\u201d), to assess R.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Munson and Zuskin diagnosed R as suffering from several mental disorders and identified Mother as the cause of R\u2019s mental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">After conducting its investigations, the Department notified Mother that it found her responsible for indicated child abuse mental injury and indicated child neglect. Exercising her right of appeal under Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-706.1(b) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d), Mother requested contested case hearings through the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge both findings. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) who was assigned to Mother\u2019s appeal held a hearing for both cases in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In its decision, the ALJ affirmed the Department\u2019s finding of indicated child abuse mental injury. Relying heavily on Munson\u2019s and Zuskin\u2019s assessments, the ALJ concluded that Mother\u2019s actions \u201cwere either an intentional attempt to manipulate and influence the outcome of an ongoing custody dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>with R[ ]\u2019s father, or were a result of her subconscious efforts to have R[ ] remain close to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Munson concluded that Mother had caused R\u2019s mental injury by \u201cengaging in conscious or unconscious suggestive utterances to R[ ] about abuse by the father and engaging in alienating activities related to the father.\u201d Munson also explained that R suffered emotional and behavioral problems because of Mother\u2019s \u201cfrequent abuse allegations,\u201d which \u201cresulted in repeated exams and investigations.\u201d Zuskin reached similar conclusions. Although Zuskin did not state that Mother \u201ccoached\u201d R to make false abuse allegations, he believed that Mother reinforced her daughter\u2019s behavior by responding to R\u2019s statements of abuse with \u201canimal protectiveness and closeness.\u201d Munson and Zuskin contacted Amy Hershey, a licensed social worker who counseled R and incorporated their communications with her into their assessments of R.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The ALJ rejected Mother\u2019s argument that she had acted reasonably, ruling that no medical evidence justified the repeated allegations Mother and R had made. The ALJ authorized the Department to identify Mother in a central registry<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as being responsible for child abuse mental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The ALJ, however, modified the Department\u2019s finding of indicated child neglect to \u201cruled out child neglect.\u201d The ALJ reasoned that because Mother\u2019s acts already constituted child abuse mental injury, that same conduct could not constitute child neglect mental injury. The Department did not appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Mother appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Washington County as provided by Md.Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(a) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d). Affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision, the Circuit Court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Hershey\u2019s statements were not privileged and that the ALJ did not err in permitting Munson and Zuskin from relying on communications with and a report from Hershey. The court also found that Mother had failed to preserve her arguments that she was immune from liability by making a good faith report of child abuse, that Munson and Zuskin were not qualified as experts, and that Munson\u2019s and Zuskin\u2019s testimony was inadmissible. Finally, the Circuit Court rejected Mother\u2019s argument that a finding of indicated child abuse mental injury requires proof of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>McClanahan v. Washington Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>218 Md.App. 258, 96 A.3d 917 (2014), <em>cert. granted, </em>440 Md. 461, 103 A.3d 593 (2014). In relevant part, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the ALJ did not err by failing to include scienter as an element of indicated child abuse mental injury. <em>Id. </em>at 277-83, 96 A.3d at 928-31. The court also concluded that Mother had failed to preserve the privilege and immunity issues. <em>Id. </em>at 283-86, 96 A.3d at 931-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We granted Mother\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">1. Does the Court of Special Appeals[\u2019] decision that a parent can be strictly liable for child abuse by mental injury by seeking medical help for her five year old based on the child\u2019s disclosures and symptoms, absent any finding that the parent acted intentionally, recklessly, or in bad faith to cause injury, violate the Due Process Clause, Family Law Article \u00a7\u00a7 5-701 <em>et seq., </em>and <em>Taylor v. Harford County Department of Social Services, </em>384 Md. 213[, 862 A.2d 1026] (2004)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">2.

Did the ALJ\u2019s decision against Petitioner violate the immunity provisions of Family Law Article \u00a7 5-708 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>[Md.Code (1973, 2013 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-620 of the] Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article [ ]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Because we answer yes to the first question (in part), we need not address the other questions. We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">When reviewing an administrative decision, we assume the same role as the Circuit Court and intermediate appellate court, and \u201c \u2018limit our review to the agency\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cosby v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>425 Md. 629, 637, 42 A.3d 596, 601 (2012) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\u201c[A] challenge to the entry of one\u2019s name in a central registry as an \u2018indicated child abuser\u2019 pursuant to [FL] \u00a7 5-701 [ ] is a contested case within the meaning of [SG] \u00a7 10-202(d)(1)\u201d in which the agency acts in its quasi-judicial capacity. <em>Taylor v. Harford Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>384 Md. 213, 221, 862 A.2d 1026, 1030 (2004). In a contested case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> when an ALJ<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> affirms a finding that a person is responsible for indicated child abuse, SG \u00a7 10-222(h) establishes the standards of review of the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Charles Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 295, 855 A.2d 313, 318 (2004); <em>see </em>SG \u00a7 10-222(a)(l) (A party \u201caggrieved by the final decision in a contested case\u201d may seek judicial review of that decision.).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">If a petitioner challenges the agency\u2019s factual determinations, we review whether substantial evidence supports the finding. SG \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v); <em>Vann, </em>382 Md. at 295, 855 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>A.2d at 318. When a petitioner challenges how to apply and interpret statutes and regulations, we are reviewing a question of law. <em>Cosby, </em>425 Md. at 638, 42 A.3d at 602. In reviewing legal questions, we accord \u201csome deference\u201d to \u201can agency\u2019s legal interpretation of the statute it administers or of its own regulations.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>384 Md. at 222, 862 A.2d at 1031. Even if we grant some deference to the agency\u2019s legal interpretations, we must correct a legal conclusion that is erroneous. <em>Cosby, </em>425 Md. at 639, 42 A.3d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Mother challenges the intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ did not err in failing to include scienter as an element of indicated child abuse mental injury. <em>See McClanahan, </em>218 Md.App. at 277-83, 96 A.3d at 928-31. Thus, we review only a legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Our role today is to engage in statutory interpretation as we decide whether a parent can be hable for child abuse mental injury within the meaning of FL \u00a7 5-701<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> if the parent acted without intent to harm the child. Mother and the Department dispute the meaning of FL \u00a7 5-701, as well as the scope of Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 07.02.07.12, which directs the dispositions of investigations of suspected child abuse. Mother argues that <em>Taylor v. Harford County Department of Social Services, </em>384 Md. 213, 862 A.2d 1026 (2004), forecloses any finding of indicated child abuse mental injury based on strict liability. She avers that a strict liability standard not only conflicts with <em>Taylor, </em>but would undermine other statutes that require reporting of child abuse in the Family Law Article, as well as other pertinent regulations. The Department counters that the statutes and regulations pertaining to child abuse mental injury contain no scienter requirement. The Department dismisses <em>Taylor </em>as a case limited to child abuse causing physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 462, 597 A.2d 939, 943 (1991). Under the plain meaning rule, we must give the \u201cordinary and natural meaning\u201d to statutory language because this language is \u201cthe primary source of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the intent of the legislature is clear from the words of the statute, our inquiry normally ends and we apply the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Huffman v. State, </em>356 Md. 622, 628, 741 A.2d 1088, 1091 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Moreover, we should reasonably construe a statute \u201cwith reference to the purpose, aim or policy of the legislature reflected in that statute.\u201d <em>Shrader, </em>324 Md. at 463, 597 A.2d at 943. \u201c \u2018[RJesults that are unreasonable, illogical or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided whenever possible consistent with the statutory language, with the real legislative intention prevailing over the intention indicated by the literal meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also </em>2A Norman J. Singer <em>&amp; </em>Shambie Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46:7 (7th ed.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Terms of Statutes, Regulations and <em>Taylor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The key statutory language is found in the definition of child abuse in FL \u00a7 5-701. Abuse means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">(l) the physical or mental injury of a child by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member, under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or at substantial risk of being harmed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Additionally, FL \u00a7 5-701 defines the three findings that a local department may make after investigating a report of suspected abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">(m) \u201cIndicated\u201d means a finding that there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>(w) \u201cRuled out\u201d means a finding that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did not occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">(y) \u201cUnsubstantiated\u201d means a finding that there is an insufficient amount of evidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">FL \u00a7 5-707(a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> authorizes DHR to \u201cprovide by regulation\u201d for \u201cconditions for determining\u201d whether abuse \u201cis indicated, ruled out, or unsubstantiated.\u201d COMAR 07.02.07.12<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> sets forth the following elements for indicated child abuse regarding physical and mental injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">A. Indicated Child Abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">(1) Physical Abuse Other than Mental Injury. Except as provided in \u00a7 A(3) of this regulation, a finding of indicated child physical abuse is appropriate if there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that it is more likely than not that the following four elements are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">(a) A current or prior physical injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">(b) The injury was caused by a parent, caretaker, or household or family member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">(c) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the incident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>(d) The nature, extent, and location of the injury indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">(3) Abuse-Mental Injury. A finding of indicated child abuse with mental injury is appropriate if there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that the following four elements are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">(a) A current or prior mental injury characterized by an observable, identifiable, substantial impairment to the child\u2019s mental or psychological ability to function, which may be shown by the need for specific psychiatric, psychological, or social work intervention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">(b) The mental injury was caused by a parent, a caretaker, or household or family member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">(c) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the incident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">(d) The nature and extent of the mental injury indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">(Emphasis added.) COMAR 07.02.07.12 also sets forth the following pertinent criteria for ruling out<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> child abuse in cases of physical and mental injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">C. Ruled Out Child Abuse. A finding of ruled out child abuse is appropriate if child abuse did not occur. A finding of ruled out may be based on credible evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">(1) There was no physical or mental injury....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">(2) In the case of physical abuse:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">(a) The alleged abuser was not responsible for the injury for reasons including, but not limited to, one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>(i) The contact with the child was accidental and unintended and under the circumstances, the injury was not foreseeable ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">(Emphasis added.) We keep FL \u00a7 5-701(b), the statutory definition of abuse, in the forefront of our minds as we construe these regulations and evaluate the actions of Mother. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Human Res., Balt. City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., v. Hayward, </em>426 Md. 638, 658, 45 A.3d 224, 236 (2012) (An agency\u2019s \u201cauthority to promulgate regulations ... must be consistent, and not in conflict, with the statute the regulations are intended to implement. We have consistently held that the statute must control.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Department points out that the regulations pertaining to child abuse mental injury contain no express scienter requirement. <em>See </em>COMAR 07.02.07.12A(3)(b). Scienter only appears in one criterion, namely, to rule out child abuse <em>physical </em>injury: \u201c[t]he contact with the child was accidental and unintended and under the circumstances, the injury was not foreseeable.\u201d COMAR 07.02.07.12C(2)(a)(i). There exist no similar criteria to rule out child abuse mental injury. COMAR 07.02.07.12C. The Department insists that we should rely on COMAR 07.02.07.12 to conclude that a parent\u2019s mental state is not material in a case of child abuse mental injury, citing <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 223-24, 817 A.2d 229, 235 (2003) (\u201c[Wjhere the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We reject the Department\u2019s argument because the statute itself fails to draw any distinction between physical and mental injury to a child. Without statutory directive, there is no reason why scienter should be required in one instance (physical), and not the other (mental). <em>See Hayward, </em>426 Md. at 658, 45 A.3d at 236. Our decision in <em>Taylor </em>is instructive on how to interpret this statute. As the Department underscores, <em>Taylor </em>involved a physical injury and our holding addressed that. But a mental injury can be accidental to the same extent as a physical one. Moreover, a study of <em>Taylor </em>reveals that our concerns about \u201cstrict liability\u201d stemmed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>part from the statute, which treats \u201cmental\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d injury identically in the definition of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In <em>Taylor, </em>an investigator for the local department made a finding of indicated child abuse where the father, acting in anger, kicked a footstool that collided with his daughter. 384 Md. at 216-18, 862 A.2d at 1027-28. On appeal, the ALJ agreed with the local department that \u201cit is immaterial whether the [father] intended to hit [his daughter].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 862 A.2d at 1029 (italics omitted). The ALJ reasoned that FL \u00a7 5-701 includes no scienter element in the definition of abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 862 A.2d at 1029. In the ALJ\u2019s view, COMAR 07.02.07.12 also did not allow the father to avoid \u201cresponsibility for the unintended but foreseeable consequences of his intended act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the ALJ committed reversible error by failing to consider COMAR 07.02.07.12C(2)(a)(i), an explicit criterion for ruling out child abuse physical injury if the \u201cact causing the injury was accidental or unintentional and not reckless or deliberate.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 226, 231, 862 A.2d at 1033, 1036. Notably, we did not stop there.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We further explained that the ALJ\u2019s reasoning was flawed because it could extend to <em>\u201cany </em>intentional act by a parent or caretaker which has the unintentional consequence of harming that person\u2019s child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 862 A.2d at 1036 (emphasis in original). We were skeptical that <em>\u201ceither </em>\u00a7 5-701 of the Family Law Article or COMAR 07.02.07.12 intend[ed] for such a draconian strict liability standard always to attach to the intentional acts of parents or caretakers who unintentionally injure their children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231-32, 862 A.2d at 1036-37 (emphasis added). In other words, we did not limit our concern about a strict liability standard to acts causing physical injury, as COMAR 07.02.07.12 did.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We see no reason to do so now. When expert witnesses testify that a parental action has caused mental injury to a child, the parent\u2019s action must be examined in context. As we concluded in <em>Taylor, \u201cit is material </em>whether there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u2018intent\u2019 to injure [the child].\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 233, 862 A.2d at 1037 (emphasis in original). Because FL \u00a7 5-701(b) does not differentiate between mental injury and physical injury, we do not interpret Subtitle 7 to sanction a regulation in which a parent can be deemed a child abuser for unintentionally causing mental injury but not liable for unintentionally causing physical injury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Department offers no reasonable explanation for that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In light of our discussion of <em>Taylor, </em>we are similarly unpersuaded by the Department\u2019s argument that FL \u00a7 5-701 excludes any consideration of scienter for mental injury because it contains no express scienter requirement. FL \u00a7 5-701 contains no express scienter requirement for physical injury either. Under the Department\u2019s theory, then, DHR would have no authority in the first place to exclude accidental physical injuries in COMAR 07.02.07.12. But that theory does not square with <em>Taylor. </em>The Department has avoided explaining the central problem in this case: the regulation excludes accidental physical injury but includes accidental mental injury, a distinction FL \u00a7 5-701 does not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">To be sure, there may be examples of mental injury arising from parental conduct that are so reprehensible that an ALJ might infer intent to harm or reckless disregard just from the act. One family law scholar has discussed classic examples of such conduct in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>What does emotional abuse and neglect look like? Elle\u2019s case is one example. The \u201cCinderella syndrome\u201d is another common form of emotional abuse. In these cases, parents designate one child as a scapegoat. They require her to do more household tasks than their other children and do not give her the same privileges and opportunities as they do the other children. Both methods of abuse include ignoring, rejecting, and isolating a child, which typically causes depression and low self-esteem.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The nature of the conduct in this case is patently different. We are faced with parental conduct that is ostensibly for a child\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Indeed, the Department\u2019s view would undermine the paramount statutory purpose of Subtitle 7\u2014child protection. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>FL \u00a7 5-702. <em>Amici curiae</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>help elucidate why. A parent who in good faith reports suspected child abuse and seeks a SAFE exam can be a critical \u201cprotector and advocate\u201d of that child. Brief of Child Justice, Inc., et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>in Support of Mother, at 5. If we read the statutory and regulatory scheme as the Department does, however, the parent faces potential inclusion on the central registry merely by reporting. Thus the parent receives a badge of dishonor even if she had no intent to harm the child. The parent must now consider her \u201cown interests and potential liability before\u201d her child\u2019s welfare. <em>Id. </em>at 6. And if the reporting parent is penalized, then that parent has a disincentive to report future abuse. The child, then, will lose the effective protection and advocacy her parent can provide through reporting. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Indubitably, Subtitle 7 of the Family Law Article was not designed to dissuade parents from reporting allegations of child abuse. <em>See id. </em>at 8, 9. For these reasons, we conclude that the Department interprets the child abuse statutory scheme in a manner that is \u201c \u2018unreasonable, illogical [and] inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Shrader, </em>324 Md. at 463, 597 A.2d at 943 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">We are well aware that \u201ccourts should generally defer to agencies\u2019 decisions in promulgating new regulations because they presumably make rules based upon their expertise in a particular field.\u201d <em>Fogle v.

In <em>Department of Human Resources, Baltimore City Department of Social Services v. Hayward, </em>we addressed the appeal rights of a person subject to a child abuse investigation after a local department makes a finding of unsubstantiated child abuse, and held that such person has a right to appeal that finding (with a goal of securing a \u201cruled out\u201d decision). 426 Md. at 642, 662-69, 45 A.3d at 226, 238-43. We rejected the Department\u2019s effort to foreclose any appeal from such finding because the Department relied on its own regulations that were inconsistent with the applicable statute. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 45 A.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><em>Hayward </em>involved FL \u00a7 5-706.1, which created a right to a conference and a right to appeal for persons challenging findings of unsubstantiated child abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 45 A.3d at 237. But COMAE 07.02.26.05B limited the right to appeal to \u201c[a]n individual <em>found responsible </em>for unsubstantiated child abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). We explained that the regulation conflicted with the statutory language because \u201cthe statute [did] not differentiate between individuals who are found responsible for \u2018unsubstantiated\u2019 child abuse, and those who are not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the regulations conflicted with the statute, we refused to \u201cgive effect to those regulations\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe statute must control.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 668, 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>A.3d at 242. <em>Hayward </em>is closely analogous to the present case because here we also have a regulation that distinguishes between purported child abusers in a manner the statute does not. COMAR 07.02.07.12 sets different standards for child abusers causing physical and mental injuries. FL \u00a7 5-701(b) does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Our decision is also informed by a case from our intermediate appellate court. In <em>Fields v. Department of Human Resources Howard County Department of Social Services, </em>also involving child abuse, the applicable statute required an individual contesting a finding of indicated child abuse to respond \u201cto the notice of the local department in writing within 60 days.\u201d 176 Md.App. 152, 156, 932 A.2d 824, 827 (2007) (italics omitted). The corresponding regulation, however, imposed a requirement on the individual to respond twice: (1) to request an appeal form and (2) return the appeal form \u2022within 60 days of the issuance of notice. <em>Id. </em>at 157-58, 932 A.2d at 827-28. The intermediate appellate court ruled that the regulation \u201cexceed[ed] the scope of what [the statute] permitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 932 A.2d at 829.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>COMAR 07.02.26.05 was \u201cnot consistent with the letter or spirit of [FL \u00a7 5-706.1].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162, 932 A.2d at 830. By the same token, COMAR 07.02.07.12 is not consistent with FL \u00a7 5-701.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Accordingly, we decline to enforce the portion of COMAR 07.02.07.12C that limits its exculpatory scope (for accidental injury) to alleged abusers causing physical injury. FL \u00a7 5-706 does not justify such distinction. This means, then, that to be included as a \u201cchild abuser\u201d in DHR\u2019s central registry, a person must either intend to injure the child or at least act in reckless disregard of the child\u2019s welfare. This inteni/reckless disregard standard meets that established by DHR for physical injuries and utilized by the <em>Taylor </em>Court. We reverse the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that a person can be listed on the central registry for actions causing mental injury to a child without intent to harm the child or reckless disregard of the child\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The Reckless Disregard Standard and Mother\u2019s Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The ALJ concluded that Mother\u2019s actions were \u201ceither an intentional attempt to manipulate and influence\u201d the custody dispute over R \u201cor were a result of her subconscious efforts to have R[] remain close to her.\u201d The standard we have adopted does not permit inclusion of a parent\u2019s name in the central registry as a child abuser if the parent\u2019s inappropriate motivations for reporting child abuse were only at the subconscious level, even if the child was mentally injured. A standard of liability reaching the subconscious level veers much too close to strict liability for parental decisions. <em>See Taylor, </em>384 Md. at 231, 862 A.2d at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Even if Mother intended to gain an advantage in the ongoing custody battle, inclusion on the central registry as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>child abuser is not permitted unless Mother intended to harm R or acted in reckless disregard of R\u2019s welfare. Acting with intent or reckless disregard is the standard we required the ALJ to apply in <em>Taylor, </em>and was, at the time, adopted by DHR with respect to physical injuries.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 225-26, 862 A.2d at 1033 (quoting COMAR 07.02.07.12C(2)(a)(i) effective in 2004, wherein physical abuse was ruled out when \u201c[t]he act causing the injury was accidental or unintentional and not reckless or deliberate\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In a case where the alleged abuser\u2019s conduct falls within the realm of conduct that could benefit the child, as medical treatment does, there must be some evidence that supports a conclusion that the parent was at least reckless visa-vis the child\u2019s health. In other words, a parent\u2019s conduct must constitute a gross departure from the type of conduct a reasonable person would engage in under the circumstances. <em>Cf. Jones v.

Servs., </em>384 Md. 213, 862 A.2d 1026 (2004), a case involving the physical abuse of a child, to vacate all of the determinations of the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), the Circuit Court, and the Court of Special Appeals and rule that a mother cannot be found to have committed indicated child abuse, mental injury, when she subjected her daughter to repeated invasive sexual examinations as well as investigations by the Washington County Department of Social Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The following specific findings of the ALJ regarding Ms. McClanahan\u2019s behavior toward her daughter (\u201cR\u201d), when her daughter was between the ages of two to five years old, are certainly more graphic than the Majority describes. The ALJ found that Ms. McClanahan took R to the hospital on nine different occasions for Sexual Assault Forensic Examinations (\u201cSAFE\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> over a three and a half year period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>10. The occasions on which the Appellant reported alleged sexual abuse and took R[ ] to a medical provider for treatment are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u2022 On June 7, 2007, the Appellant had taken R[ ] to the hospital after R[ ] returned from her father\u2019s house with redness and irritation in her vaginal area. The hospital instructed the Appellant to take R[ ] to the Child Advocacy Center for a SAFE exam. Dr. Ruth Ann Dwyer performed the examination of R[], the results of which were normal. (Dept.4)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u2022 On February 21, 2008, the Appellant had taken R[ ] to the Child Advocacy Center for an examination after R[ ] had returned from her father\u2019s house with her vaginal area red and swollen and she had reported that her father\u2019s 8-year-old stepson, Sean, hurt her. Dr. Dwyer performed a SAFE exam of R[ ] and diagnosed R[ ] with vulvitis, which is often caused by poor hygiene and is not uncommon in prepubescent children. (Dept.5)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u2022 On March 23, 2008, the Appellant had taken R[ ] to the Waynesboro Hospital in Pennsylvania reporting that R[ ] had stated that her \u201cbottom hurt.\u201d She had reported that her father put things in her vagina. R[ ] reported to the treating physician that a monster came from the cave and touched her. The physician noted that R[ ]\u2019s vaginal area was red but that her hymen was intact. Pictures of R[ ]\u2019s vaginal area were taken during the exam. (Dept.6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\u2022 On April 28, 2008, the Appellant had taken R[ ] to Washington County Hospital. The Appellant reported that R[ ] had returned that day from her father\u2019s house and had been reporting that \u201csomeone hurt her bottom.\u201d The Appellant requested that a SAFE be performed on R[ ]. A SAFE exam was performed, the results of which revealed some redness in the vaginal area. (Dept.7)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\u2022 On May 26, 2008, the Appellant had taken R[] to the Washington County Hospital requesting a sexual assault examination of R[]. The Appellant had reported to a hospital physician that R[ ] had returned from her father\u2019s home that day and reported that her \u201cbottom hurt\u201d and that \u201cSean had put a lollipop in her bottom.\u201d The Appellant also reported that R[ ] had discharge in her panties earlier that day. (Dept.8). R[ ] also volunteered to the doctor that Shawn had put a lollipop in her bottom. (Dept.8)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u2022 On May 26, 2008, Washington County Hospital performed a SAFE examination on R[ ] which revealed no indicia of sexual abuse. (Dept.8)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u2022 On December 6, 2009, the Appellant had taken R[ ] to the Chambersburg Hospital in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. R[ ] had reported that her father hurt her \u201cbottom\u201d and stuck her with a needle there. The Appellant reported that R[ ]\u2019s vulva was red and swollen. (Dept.9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u2022 On December 6, 2009, upon examination of R[ ], the doctor noted mild erythema and swelling in the inferior vulva; foul discharge present but no other redness. A urianalysis that was requested by the Appellant was unremarkable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u2022 On June 23, 2010, after R[ ] returned from a visit with her father, the Appellant took R[ ] to Chambersburg Hospital emergency room. The Appellant reported that R[ ] had stated that her father \u201cpoked her with a needle in her front bottom.\u201d R[] reported to hospital staff that her \u201cfront bottom\u201d hurts. (Dept.10). Upon examination of R[ ], the physician noted \u201cmild erythema\u201d and \u201cfoul-smelling whitish discharge noted on retraction of vulva.\u201d R[ ] was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection at Chambers-burg Hospital. Chambersburg Hospital does not perform SAFE exams. (Dept.10)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u2022 On June 23, 2010, the Appellant took R[ ] to Washington County Hospital for a SAFE exam. R[ ] was not cooperative for the exam so the Appellant brought her back to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>hospital later that same day for an exam. R[ ] reported at the hospital that her father \u201cstuck a needle in her front bottom.\u201d R[] further reported that her father touched her the previous night. The SAFE examination revealed redness around R[]\u2019s labia majora but no trauma was noted. (Dept.12)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">\u2022 On November 17, 2010, the Appellant took R[ ] to White Oak Pediatric for a cough and injury. After R[ ] reported that she was there for her \u201cbottom,\u201d Jane Shughart, the physician\u2019s assistant (PA), examined R[]\u2019s vaginal area. She observed redness in the area with mucus discharge and what appeared to be a black coarse hair. Ms. Shugar referred the Appellant to Emergency Room to do further evaluation. (Appellant 1). The Appellant took R[] to Washington County Hospital where R[ ] reported that her father \u201cpokes her with a needle and puts cream on her front bottom.\u201d The Washington County Hospital physician refused to perform a SAFE exam based on the request of the local department and its report that R[] had undergone numerous previous SAFE exams. (Dept.13)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The ALJ also found that the Department had \u201cconducted approximately 14 investigations pertaining to R[ ] and allegations of abuse\u201d and that every investigation of sexual abuse of R by her father had resulted in a ruled out disposition. Further, the ALJ\u2019s findings questioned the bases for the numerous examinations and investigations initiated by Ms. McClanahan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">20. R[] has not demonstrated sexual behavior symptoms that are typical of a child that has experienced sexual abuse at the level alleged by the Appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">21. Redness in the vagina area and discharge are not uncommon medical occurrences in children of R[ ]\u2019s age and are often the result of poor hygiene (Dwyer testimony).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">22. R[ ]\u2019s statements of alleged sexual abuse by her father are made to the Appellant upon her return to the Appellant from visits with her father. R[ ]\u2019s statements to profession<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>als regarding the alleged abuse are most always made in the presence of the Appellant and not followed up on with the professional at a later time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">23. R[ ] has never made a disclosure of sex abuse to CPS workers during any of the investigations. (McCarthy testimony).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The ALJ found that R suffered mental injury based upon the reports of Dr. Carlton E. Munson and Mr. Ronald E. Zuskin, but specifically attributed the source of that injury to Ms. McClanahan based on the evaluation provided by Dr. Munson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">27. It is the opinion of Dr. Munson that R[] has been mentally injured and that the source of the injury is the Appellant\u2019s engaging in suggestive utterances to R[ ] about abuse by R[ ]\u2019s father and engaging in alienating activities related to the father. (Dept. 17, page 21)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">28. It is the opinion of Dr. Munson that R[] has been mentally injured and that the source of the injury is the Appellant\u2019s exploitation of R[ ] by her use of sexual abuse allegations, investigations and examinations which encourages the development and reinforcement of aberrant behavior by drawing R[ ] in a closer relationship to the Appellant. (Dept. 19)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The ALJ, thus, affirmed the Department\u2019s finding of indicated child abuse, mental injury, by Ms. McClanahan. In doing so, the ALJ used language upon which the Majority seizes regarding Ms. McClanahan\u2019s <em>motives:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">The evidence presented by the local department has led me to conclude that the Appellant\u2019s actions were either an intentional attempt to manipulate and influence the outcome of an ongoing custody dispute with R[ ]\u2019s father, or were a result of her subconscious efforts to have R[ ] remain close to her. A finding of indicated abuse mental injury is appropriate as the Appellant\u2019s actions have resulted in the mental injury of R[ ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The Majority, however, in doing so, obviates the ALJ\u2019s finding that Ms. McClanahan\u2019s <em>actions, </em>which include <em>reporting </em>sexual abuse allegations, <em>taking </em>R to various hospitals for treatment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>and <em>subjecting </em>R to intrusive sexual examinations, were intentional and \u201cresulted in the mental injury of R\u201d and that the ALJ specifically found that Ms. McClanahan\u2019s \u201cact of making multiple allegations of sex abuse of R[] by her father and subjecting R[] to repeated sexual abuse exams constitutes child abuse mental injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The first holding of the Majority with which I disagree, however, is that the standard used in <em>Taylor, </em>a child abuse physical injury case, should be applied in a child abuse, mental injury, case. In <em>Taylor, </em>the father\u2019s act of kicking a footstool that hit his daughter without intent to hurt the child did not constitute child abuse, physical injury. In that case, the ALJ had applied Section 5\u2014701(b)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Family Law Article and rejected the father\u2019s defense of \u201caccident\u201d as encompassed by the ruled out provision of COMAR 07.02.07.12C(2)(a)(i),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">A finding of ruled out child abuse is appropriate if child abuse did not occur. A finding of ruled out may be based on credible evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>(2) In the case of physical abuse:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">(a) The alleged abuser was not responsible for the injury for reasons including, but not limited to, one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">(i) The act causing the injury was accidental or unintentional and not reckless or deliberate[ ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 225-26, 862 A.2d at 1033. We determined that the father\u2019s act of kicking the stool was \u201cunintentional\u201d, such that physical child abuse was ruled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The <em>Taylor </em>holding, however, is totally inapplicable to a child abuse, mental injury, case, because by its very terms COMAR 07.02.07.12C(2)(a)(i), then and now, is limited in scope to \u201cphysical injury.\u201d The Majority points to nothing to support its conclusion that it \u201cdecline[s] to enforce the portion of COMAR 07.02.07.12C that limits its exculpatory scope (for accidental injury) to alleged abusers causing physical injury.\u201d Maj. Op. at 711, 129 A.3d at 304. Clearly, physical abuse is different from mental abuse not only in the types of acts of the perpetrator and the harm experienced by the child victim, but, most importantly, in the recognition that physical injury can result from accidental or unintended acts while mental injury of a child by a caretaker cannot. The Majority does not cite any basis for its lumping physical and mental abuse together, nor can I discern any.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Even assuming <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>holding can apply in the context of mental injury, with which I vehemently disagree, the Majority, nevertheless, errs because of its emphasis on a piece of the opinion by the ALJ that Ms. McClanahan\u2019s actions were \u201ca result of her subconscious efforts\u201d to rule out child abuse, mental injury. Here, Ms. McClanahan\u2019s acts met the standard of intentional abuse, not accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The Majority equates the ALJ\u2019s discussion of subconscious motive with unintentional acts when it states that \u201c[a] standard of liability reaching the subconscious level veers much too close to strict liability for parental decisions\u201d, Maj. Op. at 711, 129 A.3d at 305, thereby conflating motive and intention. The ALJ never said that Ms. McClanahan\u2019s conduct was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>unintentional </em>or <em>unconscious </em>but rather was specific in finding intention and volition in the acts of Ms. McClanahan when stating: \u201cI have found that [Ms. McClanahan\u2019s] act of making multiple allegations of sex abuse of R[] by her father and subjecting R[] to repeated sexual abuse exams constitutes child abuse mental injury.\u201d The ALJ also found that Ms. McClanahan\u2019s \u201cexploitation\u201d of R by \u201cher use of sexual abuse allegations, investigations and examinations\u201d caused R\u2019s mental injury. The ALJ, thus, consistently found Ms. McClanahan\u2019s conduct to be volitional and intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The important distinction between subconscious motive and intentional acts has been persuasively articulated in <em>Johnson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>273 F.Supp. 589, 593 (D.N.J.1967), aff<em>'d, </em>404 F.2d 1202 (3d Cir.1968). In <em>Johnson, </em>a widow of a man who committed suicide sought to recover under a policy excluding death benefits from a suicide, under a number of theories, one of which was that her husband was \u201cirresistibly compelled by impulse to immolate himself, and therefore, that his action was no more the product of a conscious intent that [sic] would be a purely accidental act\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 594. The Court rejected the widow\u2019s theory and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">In this regard, one must be careful to distinguish questions of intent and questions of motive. Psychoanalytically oriented and other schools of \u201cdepth psychology\u201d have made the notions of \u201cunconscious\u201d or \u201csubconscious\u201d motive common parlance. But it is not helpful to define \u201csuicide\u201d as an intentional self-destruction, and then to confuse the slippery notion of \u201cintent\u201d with its underlying causes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">Whatever the constellation of drives, impulses or subconscious motives which cause the subject to perform a given act, unless that act is actually inadvertent, its physical execution is \u201cintentional\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word. In short, my motive for doing, or impulse to do, the act is one thing; the fact that I therefore intend to do it and do so is a separate point and one that is not here in doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXi\"><em>Id. </em>In the present case, Ms. McClanahan intended to subject her child to nine sexual examinations and fourteen investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>tions, all of which resulted in mental injuries. Ms. McClanahan\u2019s motives, as found by the ALJ, included \u201cto manipulate and influence the outcome of an ongoing custody dispute\u201d or to \u201chave R[ ] remain close to her.\u201d Ms. McClanahan\u2019s actions were not inadvertent or beneficent but were intentional and caused injury to R.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">I would affirm. Judge McDonald authorizes me to state that he joins the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">. In her findings, the ALJ explained that, \u201cSAFE exams are conducted by doctors who are SAFE trained and when there is a concern of sexual abuse or assault. SAFE exams require retraction of the genitalia and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>are not routinely conducted on children between two and five years old.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">. Section 5-701(b) of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.) defined 'abuse' and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">(1) the physical or mental injury of a child by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member, under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or at substantial risk of being harmed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">(2) sexual abuse of a child, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\">.
