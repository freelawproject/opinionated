I don\u2019t know\u201d an ambiguous or clear invocation of his right to remain silent under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)? Whether Williams\u2019s confession, given after waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, was voluntary or the product of inducement, poses another conundrum.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Specifically, the questions before us are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">1. Did police violate Petitioner\u2019s right to remain silent during a custodial interrogation when he said \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know,\u2014\u201dto which the police responded \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to say nothing\u201d but continued with the interrogation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">2. Did the police interrupting Petitioner while he invoked his right to remain silent convert an unambiguous invocation into an ambiguous invocation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">3. Was Petitioner\u2019s confession involuntary under Maryland common law because the police implied that Petitioner might see outside again if he confessed to a robbery gone bad instead of a premeditated murder?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">The State filed a Conditional Cross-Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we also granted, but do not reach.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">We shall hold that Williams\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent by saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u201d was ambiguous and that his confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Williams was indicted in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for first degree murder, second degree murder, first degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, second degree assault, reckless endangerment and carrying a handgun. The charges arose from the shooting death of Justin DeSha-Overcash on January 10, 2011 in College Park. Ultimately, Williams was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, with all but 49 years suspended for first degree murder, as well as a concurrent 20 years sentence for the use of the handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Prior to trial, Williams moved for the suppression of a confession he had given to a Detective Harris and Sergeant Gregory McDonald of the Prince George\u2019s County Police. Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald had interviewed Williams in an interrogation room in the District of Columbia; the interview was digitally recorded, then later copied to a DVD and transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The video and the transcript reflect Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald asking whether Williams wanted to speak with them and noting several times that he did not have to talk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: (Inaudible). Heard you was fast as lightening. Lightening. Okay. The reason why me and Sergeant McDonald are here, we are investigating an incident that happened in January. We been working nonstop on it. Through our investigation your name came up, okay? [WILLIAMS]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Now, what we have now are what other people have been saying about it. It was enough for us to get an arrest warrant for you, okay? What we\u2019d like to do is give you an opportunity to answer any questions that we may have, or ask us any questions that you have about the incident. We want to ask you questions. You can stop answering at any time. You don\u2019t have to talk to us. We want you to talk to us, to be honest with you. Like I say, it\u2019s your prerogative. Like I said, you can talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to us about anything. If you are wondering what we may have to say, this is your opportunity to say, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHy\">[WILLIAMS]: What\u2019s the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">[WILLIAMS]: I said what\u2019s the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: What\u2019s the answer to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asv\">[WILLIAMS]: I said what\u2019s the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Well, we\u2019ll get into it after I, if you want to know about it, if you want to know what we\u2019re talking about, I\u2019m going to have to read you your rights. You have the right to talk to us, you have the right not to talk to us. You have the right to talk to us and stop talking at any time. You understand that? Like I said, we\u2019d like to lay everything out for you and then sit back and listen to what you have to say. We\u2019ll listen to anything that you have to say. Anything. You can dispute anything that we might say, and then we\u2019ll listen to you. You understand that? Okay. Like I said, all we have at this point is what we\u2019ve heard up to this point. We would love to hear from you. You understand? We\u2019re fair. You\u2019ve probably got two of the fairest people at the Homicide Unit talking to you right now, okay? Like I said, that\u2019s your prerogative. Like I said, we\u2019d love to lay it out and get you to talk to us, but like I said, you don\u2019t have to. But we would love for you to talk to us, and we can stop so you can see exactly where we\u2019re coming from and go from there. Is that something you\u2019d like to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">[WILLIAMS]: I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why I ask you what\u2019s the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: That\u2019s what I said. I can read you your rights. Like I said, after that, we can talk. Like I said, if you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m saying you ain\u2019t got to say nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">[WILLIAMS]: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, so I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab9\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Okay. This incident happened January in College Park. Through our investigation your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>name came up. Like I said, this is your opportunity to say, yeah, you were involved or no, you weren\u2019t involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZh\">[WILLIAMS]: I don\u2019t know anything about what you all are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: Well, we can get to that. We got to go over your, your rights, first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">[WILLIAMS]: I know. I still, I don\u2019t know what,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5u\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: I understand that. I understand that. But we got to go through the process. Before we can ask you were you involved, we got to,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABYV\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: We got stuff we got to take care of before we,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">[WILLIAMS]: Yeah, I understand that. I still don\u2019t know,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: I understand that. But we still got to go through the process, though. You know. We want to talk to you, but we got to go through the process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA1\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: We want to lay everything out to you, but you have to agree to, you want to at least hear what we have to say, and that\u2019s fine. But you say you don\u2019t, once we read you your rights, if you don\u2019t have nothing to do with it, then we just get up and roll. But we can\u2019t get into it until we get through that. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. So if you\u2019re sitting here and wondering why you\u2019re here, we, we\u2019re ready to tell you why you are here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">[WILLIAMS]: We already know but it\u2019s so, you all sound, it sounds so confusing. I don\u2019t know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: It\u2019s not confusing. Let me break it down to you like this right here. You be, you watch T.V., right? Do you see when the police walk up to somebody, and we want to ask you, we want to talk to you about something, we always read the person their rights? You\u2019ve seen that on T.V., right? They say, you\u2019ve got the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. You\u2019ve heard that before, haven\u2019t you? Yeah. We have to go through that formality to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>get to what we want to talk about. That\u2019s, we have to go through that formality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">[WILLIAMS]: I don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: But you don\u2019t have to say nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">[WILLIAMS]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: You don\u2019t have to say nothing. That\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s your right. But to get to one point, from point A to point B, we have to read you your rights. And the key word is, they\u2019re your rights. So we got to read them to you, so you understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">In addition to the videotape of the interview, Detective Harris turned on a tape recorder before reading Williams his <em>Miranda </em>rights and then asking several follow-up questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0j\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: And I told you, it\u2019s your prerogative, but we\u2019d love to get everybody\u2019s side. All we got is one side. One side at this point. We couldn\u2019t risk just asking in confidence. We have to take it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">(Tape recording begins.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: My name is Detective Harris with the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. Today\u2019s date is March 30, 2011. The time is 1:58, put 13:58 on here because we use military time. All right? I am now going to read to you your rights under the law. If you do not understand something I say to you, please stop me and I will explain it to you. Okay? You have the right to remain silent. If you chose to give up this right, anything that you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer before you are asked any questions, and have a lawyer while you are being questioned. If you want a lawyer but cannot afford one, a lawyer will be provided to you at no cost. If you want to answer questions now without a lawyer you still have the right to stop answering at any time. That\u2019s what I emphasized before we started. You understand that? At this point in time, would you like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>to make a statement or would you like to talk about why we are here, without a lawyer? Okay. Have you been promised anything? Have you been offered any kind of reward or benefit, or have you been threatened in any way in order to get you to make a statement? Have I threatened you? Has he threatened you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">[WILLIAMS]: (No verbal response.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Williams then received a copy of the Prince George\u2019s County Advice of Rights form from Detective Harris, from which Williams read a portion aloud; the questioning continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGy\">[WILLIAMS]: Man, I don\u2019t know. Is this for my best interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Hold on for a second. Now, let me show you a couple, a couple of pictures real quick, okay? See, what we don\u2019t want you to do is have us leave here thinking that you went in there specifically to kill somebody. That\u2019s what you don\u2019t want us to do. You understand that? That means you premeditatively went in there with your gun and gunned this guy down. You don\u2019t really want us to believe you were doing that. Do you understand that? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">[WILLIAMS]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: That\u2019s different, that\u2019s different than a robbery gone bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">[WILLIAMS]: Yeah. I hear, I hear, I hear what you all are saying, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Hold on, hold on, hold on</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Okay. Now, but somebody that we\u2019ve talked to, just let me talk for a minute. You can talk in a minute, said hey man, this guy just walked in this house and gunned this dude down, took his stuff, and rolled out. Would you want us to believe that? This right up came in, gunned him down, didn\u2019t say shit, and just smoked this dude and walked out the house. That would be a bad thing, wouldn\u2019t it? That\u2019s no altercation. That\u2019s no talking. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>you, but it was a person there that might have said that. Hey man, this black guy just came in, gunned the dude down, and walked out. Now, if somebody said, hey man, he came in. He did try to rob him but I don\u2019t think he tried to kill this dude, and they got into a bad fight, and actually the guy that came in with the gun felt that maybe he was going to get hurt and he shot in self defense, now that\u2019s a whole different story than a dude just walked in, pop, killed the dude and walked out, took his stuff, and rolled, right? That\u2019s two different stories that a police officer has to investigate and charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">[WILLIAMS]: The only,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: I\u2019m, I\u2019m just saying. That\u2019s two scenarios.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Detective Harris again characterized the two different scenarios, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: ... There are two different charges here. There is a pre-meditated going in, blasting somebody away, taking their stuff and roll. That\u2019s a bad charge. We go by his story, the fact that you went in there, he had no intentions on killing this dude. None. Stuff got out of hand, the dude wouldn\u2019t talk, wouldn\u2019t putting up what he was saying [sic ]. The dude is a big dude. You\u2019re kind of a slim dude, and he wanted to fight. He wanted to see whether or not you had balls enough to pull the trigger. Came after you, you gave a warning shot. He still wouldn\u2019t listen to what you were saying, and then bam, all hell broke loose. Glass breaking, whole nine. That\u2019s a different charge, okay? All I\u2019m saying is, I would not, if I were you, I would not want us to leave here thinking that you walked in that house, popped this dude, premeditated, walked in there, I\u2019m going to kill this cat, take everything in the house, and roll out. You may never see outside again if you let us leave here thinking that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: But, you ain\u2019t even go that hard. You didn\u2019t even go that hard, and like I tell you, it\u2019s not a, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>we\u2019re not here to ask you things in reference to were you there or what? We know that. We already know you were there. That\u2019s not the point. The point is, you\u2019re the only one, we can\u2019t go by what you said while you were there or what happened. We can\u2019t go by what he said why you were there or what happened, because they may be trying to cover up, you know, make it look good for you. Maybe they\u2019re trying to help you out. Hey man, he didn\u2019t mean to shoot nobody. Man, who, I\u2019m the police. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you walked up in that joint with the intentions of killing that dude. But I need to hear from you and figure out how sincere you are that that\u2019s not what you meant to happen. That\u2019s the only reason why we\u2019re here, and if we were some heartless bastards we could just, screw it, first degree murder. He went in there. He premeditatedly killed that dude, and that\u2019s it. We ain\u2019t taking no deals. We\u2019re walking out the door. We ain\u2019t even talking to you. Send you straight to jail. I mean, if that\u2019s the way, I mean, but we\u2019re not like that. We, we want to give people opportunities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The Detective then told Williams he had already been charged; two potential scenarios again were discussed, at which point Williams confessed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">[WILLIAMS]: If I\u2019m already being charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Well, you were charged when you got here. I mean, that\u2019s,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">[WILLIAMS]: Yeah, yeah, I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: But what you think they\u2019re going to charge you, just grab you off the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7bY\">[WILLIAMS]: You all tell me I\u2019m already being charged with that shit. No matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: That\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: No, that\u2019s not, that\u2019s untrue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHZ\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: That ain\u2019t true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: We have to go, like I said, to get from one point to the other point, we got, we got certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>procedures where we got to go through. To get you here, and we had probable cause, what we call probable cause to get an arrest warrant for your arrest, because we had information that you were involved in this incident. That gives the probable cause to get you arrested, bring you, to arrest you. That\u2019s the point we\u2019re at. It\u2019s just called probable cause. We\u2019re not the court. We just do our end of it, and we take care of the, our end, and we, we the first ones that get to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: And your statement goes a long way. I mean, you, just because you\u2019re arrested, like you said, we could not risk just going out and trying to find you without arresting you. We have probable cause for that, okay? So we type it up. Your statement goes a long way because we have evidence. You already lied to us and said you was never in the house. That\u2019s a lie. You already lied to us, flat out. Flat out lied to us. You was in that house. We know that. All I\u2019m saying is at this point, if I were you, I would try to keep my deception or my lies to a minimum because everything, everything, it\u2019s like a point system. You\u2019re getting graded now. You cannot lie. You cannot lie. You understand that? When you talk, when it comes to a point you\u2019re going to be like, damn, why did I tell them that? And them guys told me X, Y, Z, and they were straight up with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: Yeah. This is me. I\u2019m normally, I mean everybody I talk to, I\u2019m always straight up. It is what it is. I\u2019ve never come in, try to,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: It could be as simple as a robbery gone bad, or a flat out cold blooded first degree murder. It\u2019s as simple as that. Robbery gone bad. First degree murder. Prove it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">[WILLIAMS]: I\u2019m going to tell you all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">[WILLIAMS]: I\u2019m going in the joint and shit. I\u2019m [sic ] didn\u2019t even have a mother fucking gun out, or no shit like that. So, like you said, somebody came in the house. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>at this point, there still wasn\u2019t no mother fucking gun or nothing like that. The dude rushed me and shit. So I whipped the gun out and shit. He tried to take the mother fucking gun. So, I shoot the gun, but I don\u2019t want to shoot him. He\u2019s still trying to take the mother fucking gun. Boom. I shoot the gun again. Then after that, I don\u2019t know where the fuck I shot, but I didn\u2019t want to hit him or nothing, no way. I just was trying to get him off me and shit, because he was on me and shit, and then that was that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Williams continued to describe to Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald the events at the house which led to the shooting of Justin DeSha-Overcash and then inquired as to whether or not he might \u201csee the street again\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">[WILLIAMS]: Hell, yeah. Sorry I got to ask you all a question. Even after like, I mean, am I ever going to see the street again? You all know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: Look, dude. We can\u2019t get into that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: We\u2019d love to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: We\u2019d love to, we can\u2019t. We\u2019re not allowed to go down that road, at all, and I\u2019m not going to go down that road because I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Your statement to us is that you did not contentionally (phonetic) go in there to kill that boy, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">[WILLIAMS]: Yeah, I didn\u2019t want,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: I told you it was two ways that thing could have went. Intentional or unintentional. And you told us it was unintentional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">Williams later spoke to the veracity of his story and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKQ\">[WILLIAMS]: ... So, of course, they going to tell you all that shit and cover their, they cover their end, their ass. But that\u2019s what I just told you all. Yeah, I know I fucked up as a man and I got to deal with that shit. I\u2019m not going to tell you all no lies or no mother fucking stories, for what? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>It\u2019s too late in the game for all that, but that\u2019s what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">[SERGEANT MCDONALD]: I respect you for that, brother. I ain\u2019t going to lie to you. I\u2019ll meet you on that one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The interview concluded when Williams stated, again, what had happened and Detective Harris instructed Williams to write down his story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">[WILLIAMS]: It happened so quick. The white boy was on the computer. I think it was either a, it was either a futon bed or a little couch. When I mean the shit happened so quick, so say I\u2019m walking down and he going in the room. I\u2019m like, man, both of you all sit down on the floor and shit, put you all hands out and shit. Soon as I tell them that, I hear the door slam and shit. When I turned around, it\u2019s somebody walking down the steps, but they already seen me, so they trying to go out the back, out the back door and shit. Boom, soon as I turned my head back the other way, the dude hit me in the face with something, so I\u2019m really stumbling back. I\u2019m like, oh, shit. So, boom, just reaching for the gun, I was like, boom. I shoot the mother fucker. I\u2019m like, man, I\u2019m telling myself, maybe he going to back up and shit so I can just, what the fuck, he reached for the fucking gun again, and after that, I\u2019m like, man, fuck it. He can keep coming at me and shit. I shot the gun like two or three times and I ran the fuck up out of there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFSz\">[DETECTIVE HARRIS]: Okay. What we\u2019re going to do now is have you write that down. Write your story down and then we\u2019ll ask you a couple of questions and (inaudible). All right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">At the hearing on his suppression motion, Williams argued that he made a declaratory statement invoking his right to silence when, responding to Sergeant McDonald\u2019s explanation of the formality of going through Williams\u2019s rights, he stated \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know,\u2014\u2019\u2019Williams also argued that the statements he made were involuntary because the detectives presented two scenarios characterizing different charges and indicated that under one scenario Williams might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201csee outside again,\u201d while in the other he would spend his life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The State argued, conversely, that Williams\u2019s statement that \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u201d was unclear because of the phrase, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The State also urged that nothing said by Detective Harris or Sergeant McDonald suggested that Williams would be offered any deal or receive a lighter sentence by choosing a scenario based on a robbery gone bad nor had Williams relied on anything the police promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">After reviewing the DVD and the transcript, Judge Cathy H. Serrette of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denied Williams\u2019s motion to suppress, after finding Williams\u2019s invocation of \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u201d to be \u201cambiguous and equivocal\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">This Court finds the I don\u2019t know, as the State indicated, to render what would have otherwise been a clear statement at which time the questions would have to stop an ambiguous and equivocal statement. Thereafter, Sergeant McDonald says, but you don\u2019t have to say nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">Mr. Williams again says, yeah. Then Sergeant McDonald again says, you don\u2019t have to say nothing. That, you know, that\u2019s you right. And they continue to talk about it, and again, in more or less a lay manner after which Mr. Williams says, hold on, I\u2019d like to know what\u2019s going on. So if you all got to read me my rights, then go ahead. Where after, the Advice of Rights were presented to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">Detective Harris went over the Advice of Rights with the Defendant. He asked at this point, would you like to make a statement or would you like to talk about why we are here without a lawyer, and the defendant nodded his head yes. He went on to say, have you been promised anything, have you been offered anything, any kind of reward or benefit or have you been threatened in any way in order to get you to make a statement, have I threatened you, has he threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>you, and Mr. Williams, the Defendant shook his head no. The Advice of Rights went on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">The Detective asked Mr. Williams if he could read, but didn\u2019t take his word for it. He actually had him read something out loud to make sure that he wasn\u2019t just asserting that he was intelligent and literate, but indeed he was literate, and he then gave it to Mr. Williams to read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADT\">In observing the DVD, one notes that Mr. Williams did not just take the form and sign it as one often does when one gets a contract, but rather actually took his time and read over the Advice of Rights which he did then sign. Accordingly, this Court does not find the claim, vis-\u00e1-vis the Miranda Rights, to be a valid claim and finds the State has met its burden as regards to that claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Judge Serrette then addressed the voluntariness of Williams\u2019s confession and determined that it was voluntary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">The second issue is the issue of whether or not the actual confessions were coerced or whether they were truly, voluntarily and intelligently made. A review of the DVD indicated that the interrogation was certainly not a long prolonged interrogation. The Defendant was not cuffed. There was no allegations of any physical coercion, and the interaction between the Defendant, Sergeant McDonald and Detective Harris was indeed cordial. To be sure, the detectives distinguished premeditated murder and a robbery gone bad. However, Defendant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge on the stand that the gone bad part of the robbery gone bad was a shooting of the victim flies in the face of the DVD and the transcript and is simply not credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">The officers in this matter clearly employed trickery regarding the DNA and fingerprinting, yet such trickery is permissible. The question is whether the Defendant\u2019s statements were coerced or compelled or whether they were freely, voluntarily made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">The Court agrees with the State that the Defendant was well aware that not only did he have an option not to speak, but that he had repeatedly been advised that he could stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>speaking at any time even if he had started to speak. The Court further finds that the Defendant\u2019s statements during the interrogation, including that on Page 36, no matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway, and that which is found on Page 46 of the transcript, I mean, am I ever going to see the street again, do you all know, indicate that he did not have the misunderstanding that he now alleges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, this Court does not find that the Defendant\u2019s decision to give a statement was the product of physical or psychological coercion, nor that the officer\u2019s conduct in this case overbore his will to resist or otherwise brought about a statement not freely self-determined by the Defendant. Accordingly, the Court finds that the State met its burden of proof, and the motion to suppress will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Williams was convicted on a not-guilty statement of facts of first degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. He was sentenced to life in prison, with all but 49 years suspended for first degree murder and a concurrent 20 year sentence for use of the handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On appeal, Williams presented two questions;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. In a reported opinion, <em>Williams v. State, </em>219 Md.App. 295, 100 A.3d 1208 (2014), rejecting the State\u2019s argument that a <em>pre-Miranda </em>statement was involved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the intermediate appellate court, noting that the statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing\u201d was a clear invocation of the right to silence, concluded that the addition of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d rendered the statement ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">We agree with the suppression court, however, that the \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u2014\u2019\u2019appended to the statement, and made by [Williams] in the same breath as the first portion of his comment, renders what would have otherwise been a clear statement at which time the questions would have to stop an ambiguous and equivocal statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\"><em>Williams, </em>219 Md.App. at 326, 100 A.3d at 1226 (internal quotation omitted). Our brethren also determined that, viewed objectively, statements made by Williams prior to his saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u2014\u2019\u2019revealed an attempt by him to understand what the officers were investigating. With respect to the officers\u2019 viewpoint, \u201c[I]t is enough for our purposes that, from an objective standpoint, a reasonable police officer would have believed that the comment [Williams] made was ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 100 A.3d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Our intermediate appellate court then addressed the question of whether or not Williams\u2019s confession was voluntary and \u201cconclude[d] that the police did not make any improper promises or inducements to secure [Williams\u2019s] confession. Accordingly, [Williams\u2019s] confession was not involuntary under Maryland\u2019s nonconstitutional law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 100 A.3d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Under <em>Miranda v.

Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010), a post-conviction case, in which the Supreme Court considered whether Thompkins had invoked his right to remain silent by, in fact, remaining silent after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In deciding that silence was not a sufficient invocation, the Court relied on the tenets of <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994), which involved the right to an attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">There is good reason to require an accused who wants to invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambiguously.

Essentially, the <em>Davis </em>inquiry requires that a suspect\u2019s invocation of <em>Miranda </em>must be unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">If an accused makes a statement concerning the right to counsel \u201cthat is ambiguous or equivocal\u201d or makes no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation, or ask questions to clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights____A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights results in an objective inquiry that \u201cavoids difficulties of proof and ... provides guidance to officers\u201d on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 381, 130 S.Ct. at 2259-60, 176 L.Ed.2d at 1110-11, quoting <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 458-59, 114 S.Ct. at 2355, 129 L.Ed.2d at 371 (internal citation omitted). The Supreme Court concluded that, \u201cThompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he made either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he would have invoked his right to cut off questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382, 130 S.Ct. at 2260, 176 L.Ed.2d at 1111 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Heretofore, we have not had the opportunity to address the efficacy of the invocation of the right to remain silent, but have discussed the logistics of invoking the right to counsel in <em>Ballard v. State, </em>420 Md. 480, 24 A.3d 96 (2011). In that case, after Ballard had been given, and waived, his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he offered several responses to the interviewing detective\u2019s questions. When the detective pressed Ballard to explain what happened, Ballard stated, \u201cYou mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 24 A.3d at 99. Belying on <em>Berghuis </em>and <em>Davis, </em>we held that Ballard\u2019s statement was an unambiguous and unequivocal invocation of his right to an attorney. We identified the phrase \u201cyou mind if ...\u201d as a colloquialism and not as a question to the officers but a clear message that he wanted an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Several of our sister state courts have had occasion to address what constitutes a clear invocation of the right to remain silent and that which is an ambiguous one. Cases in which the courts have determined that the right to remain silent has been invoked include <em>Buster v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, </em>364 S.W.3d 157 (Ky.2012), <em>People v. Arroya, </em>988 P.2d 1124 (Colo.1999), and <em>State v. Strayhand, </em>184 Ariz. 571, 911 P.2d 577 (Ct.App.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In <em>Buster, </em>after having been read her <em>Miranda </em>rights when she arrived at the police station, Buster told an officer that \u201cshe had nothing to say to him.\u201d 364 S.W.3d at 160. The Kentucky Supreme Court held that \u201cthere was nothing equivocal about Appellant\u2019s assertion of her right to remain silent\u201d, and that any further questioning of Buster \u201cdid not scrupu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>lously honor [Buster\u2019s] right to cut off questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In <em>Arroyo, </em>the Supreme Court of Colorado considered, during an interlocutory appeal, whether the statement, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk no more\u201d, was an invocation of Arroya\u2019s right to remain silent. 988 P.2d at 1127. Arroya had been interviewed two different times over a span of three hours. <em>Id. </em>During the second interview, when the police officer pressed Arroya about the circumstances of her son\u2019s death, she made incriminatory statements. <em>Id. </em>During the interview, the officer asked her if she wanted a break to which she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk no more.\u201d In affirming the suppression of statements she made after the statement, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk no more\u201d, the court cautioned that \u201cthe scope of a trial court\u2019s analysis should not be limited to the words as they appear on their face\u201d and surveyed \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the statement in order to assess the words in context\u201d before concluding that the trial court properly found Arroya invoked her right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 1132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Finally, in <em>Strayhand, </em>Arizona\u2019s intermediate appellate court analyzed the voluntariness of Strayhand\u2019s confession after he had said, \u201cWell I don\u2019t want to answer any more. I mean, I\u2019m in, fuck it. I\u2019m going to have a fucked up life.\u201d 911 P.2d at 583, and later stated, \u201cI can\u2019t do this shit\u201d, and even later remarked, \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk worth a shit anyway so it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that Strayhand\u2019s initial invocation of his right to silence was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhI\">The Defendant\u2019s first invocation, \u201cWell I don\u2019t want to answer anymore,\u201d could not have been clearer. The additional words \u201cI mean I\u2019m in, fuck it. I\u2019m going to have a fucked up life\u201d do nothing to confuse or detract from the idea that the Defendant did not want to answer any more questions. His other repeated indications that he did not want to answer questions, if less clear, were clear enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atz\"><em>Id. </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">What constituted an ambiguous and equivocal invocation of the right to remain silent, conversely, was addressed in <em>U.S. v. Sherrod, </em>445 F.3d 980, 982 (7th Cir.2006). In the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Sherrod asked the interrogating officer what he was charged with, but the officer \u201cinsisted that they finish reviewing the written <em>Miranda </em>warnings before proceeding with the interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response, Sherrod declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about nothin\u2019 \u201d and, further, emphasized, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna talk about nothin\u2019\u2014if you\u2019d give me a picture of what\u2019s going on, but I ain\u2019t gonna talk about shit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Sherrod argued that his statement that he was \u201cnot going to talk about nothing\u201d was an invocation of his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of Sherrod\u2019s motion to suppress, explaining, \u201cA suspect telling a police officer that he\u2019s \u2018not going to talk about nothing\u2019 is as much a taunt\u2014even a provocation\u2014as it is an invocation of the right to remain silent. When Sherrod wanted to end the interview, he knew how to do it unambiguously.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In. <em>U.S. v. Banks, </em>78 F.3d 1190, 1196, n. 6 (7th Cir.1996), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Mills v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 990, 117 S.Ct. 478, 136 L.Ed.2d 373 (1996), Banks argued that his statement \u201cGet the f\u2014out of my face. I don\u2019t have nothing to say. I refuse to sign\u201d, statements made while he was seated in the back of the patrol car after having been presented with a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form, was a clear invocation of his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, relying on a finding that the statement was not clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Mr. Mills\u2019 response of \u201cI don\u2019t got nothing to say,\u201d standing alone, could be construed as an invocation of his right to remain silent. Yet, when placed in the context of his other comments, the alternate interpretation\u2014that it was merely an angry response to the form in front of him\u2014is also possible. Given these two possible interpretations, the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that Mr. Mills\u2019 statement, when considered in context, was not a clear, unambiguous assertion of his right to remain silent cannot be disturbed by this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In <em>State v. Nixon, </em>369 Mont. 359, 298 P.3d 408, 415 (2013), Nixon stating repeatedly during his interview with police, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201cThere isn\u2019t really anything to talk about\u201d, was held to be an equivocal invocation of his right to silence. When Nixon was arrested, he had been provided with a copy of his outstanding warrants. <em>Id. </em>at 411. At the start of the interview, Nixon answered general questions regarding his address and his whereabouts on the evening in question. <em>Id. </em>After giving Nixon his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the officer asked him, \u201c[D]o you want talk to me?\u201d. Nixon replied, \u201cThere isn\u2019t really anything to talk about\u201d and repeated that statement each time the officer asked if Nixon was interested in talking. The court rejected Nixon\u2019s assertion that he unequivocally invoked his right to silence, explaining that given Nixon\u2019s statements, a \u201creasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand Nixon\u2019s statements to mean that the outstanding warrants were self-explanatory and did not provide a sufficient topic of conversation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Whether the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d was an ambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent was considered in <em>State v. </em>Holmes, 278 Kan. 603, 102 P.3d 406, 414 (2004). Holmes stated, \u201cI think I\u2019ll just quit talking. I don\u2019t know\u201d and the Kansas Supreme Court held his words to be an ambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>After responding to a 911 call in which Holmes declared that he had shot his girlfriend, the officers, after reading him his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the scene, asked Holmes about his relationship with the victim. <em>Id. </em>When they asked him about the fatal shooting of his girlfriend, Holmes shook his head and said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll just quit talking. I don\u2019t know.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer understood the defendant\u2019s statement \u201cto mean that he was uneasy about the line of questioning and that he did not appear comfortable with the direction the conversation was taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419. The Supreme Court of Kansas reasoned that Holmes\u2019s statement \u201ccould be construed as not wanting to talk about the shooting details at that moment in the interrogation but not knowing if he should. However, Holmes\u2019 statement could also be construed as an assertion of his right to remain silent. Nevertheless, the officers followed proper procedure by fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ther inquiring whether he wanted to talk about something else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In <em>State v. Hassel, </em>280 Wis.2d 637, 696 N.W.2d 270, 274 (Ct.App.2005) <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Wis.2d 99, 705 N.W.2d 660 (2005), Hassel\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should speak to you\u201d was determined to be an ambiguous invocation by the Wisconsin intermediate appellate court. The court determined that Hassel\u2019s statement was not a clear invocation of his right to remain silent, explaining \u201c[i]t does not indicate Hassel\u2019s desire to remain silent, only his uncertainty as to whether he should.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The essential inquiry that the courts rely upon in all of the above cases is whether the invocation is clear or ambiguous. The test applied, generally, using an objective standard, is whether a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be an invocation of the right to silence. <em>See Berghuis, </em>560 U.S. at 381-82, 130 S.Ct. at 2260, 176 L.Ed.2d at 1110-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Assuming for the sake of our analysis that in the instant case <em>Miranda </em>rights were implicated, the trial court and our intermediate appellate court determined that the addition of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d rendered Williams\u2019s statement ambiguous. As the trial court stated, the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d at the end of Williams\u2019s first statement, \u201crender[ed] what would have otherwise been a clear statement at which time the questions would have to stop an ambiguous and equivocal statement.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals agreed. Our intermediate appellate court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">As a classic expression of uncertainty, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d introduced a level of doubt into the message being communicated by appellant to Detective Harris and Sergeant McDonald. Indeed, the inclusion of those three words strongly suggest that appellant himself\u2014let alone the police officers whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the law charges with understanding his intent\u2014was unsure of how to proceed. At most, [Williams\u2019s] comment suggested that he <em>might </em>want to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><em>Williams, </em>219 Md.App. at 327, 100 A.3d at 1226-27 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In the present case, Williams argues that his statement, <em>\u201cI </em>don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u201d was a clear invocation of his right to remain silent. He asserts that his statement of \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing\u201d followed by \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d was not an equivocation, because the detectives cut him off by saying \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to say nothing.\u201d Williams insists, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, that the only reasonable interpretation of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d was a continuation, not a renunciation, of the previous sentence, which was confirmed by his tone of voice, speech cadence, and body language. Finally, Williams argues that there is no need for a court to speculate about the meaning of his \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, because Sergeant McDonald repeatedly responded \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to say nothing\u201d after having interrupted Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The State insists that Williams\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not going to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u201d was the consummate expression of indecision and ambiguity, and, as a whole, was not sufficient to convey to a reasonable police officer that he wished to stop the interview. The State disputes Williams\u2019s assertion that Sergeant McDonald cut him off and counters that the detectives and Williams frequently talked over one another. The State emphasizes that to speculate about Williams\u2019s tone, cadence, or body language is inappropriate because the purpose of requiring a suspect to clearly articulate that he wants to invoke his right to silence is so that police officers do not have to guess what is being said. The State argues that Sergeant McDonald understood Williams\u2019s statement to express indecision about whether he wished to proceed, and because of this indecision Sergeant McDonald\u2019s repeated statements that Williams did not have to speak with them were an attempt to clarify whether Williams wished to continue to speak with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Did the addition of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d after \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing\u201d in the present case convert what could be construed as a clear statement into an ambiguous one? As in <em>Holmes, </em>in which the Supreme Court of Kansas interpreted \u201cI think I\u2019ll just quit talking, I don\u2019t know\u201d as ambiguous, 102 P.3d at 420, a reasonable police officer could have interpreted Williams\u2019s statement as that of one who, in weighing his options, was deciding whether or not he wanted to talk. The \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d statement could have been him weighing his options about wanting to talk or not knowing whether to speak. Williams may have been unsure about whether to proceed with the interview and curious about why he was being interviewed. A reasonable police officer could have understood the statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u201d to be an ambiguous request to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Williams asserts, however, that the officers actually understood that he invoked his right to silence, because Detective Harris stated, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to say nothing.\u201d The extended colloquy, however, reflects that Williams consistently stated \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d related to his knowledge about the incident in question, to which the detectives responded repeatedly that he did not have to say anything. Williams repeated a variant of the statement that he did not know about that which the detectives were investigating six times before the final \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, which could have led a reasonable police officer to believe that Williams did not want to talk about an incident in January about which he consistently portrayed ignorance in various contexts during the course of the interview, whether or not the detectives were talking over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">As a result, we determine that the addition of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d to the preceding sentence of \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing\u201d created ambiguity as to whether Williams wanted to invoke his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Williams, of course, would have us rely on the cases in which the courts determined that there was a clear invocation of the right to remain silent. <em>Buster, Arroyo, </em>and <em>Strayhand </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>are inapposite, however, because the language in <em>Buster </em>that she \u201chad nothing to say\u201d, as well as that in <em>Arroya </em>of \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk no more\u201d, and in <em>Strayhand </em>of \u201cWell I don\u2019t want to answer any more. I mean, I\u2019m in, fuck it. I\u2019m going to have a fucked up life\u201d were clearly invocative of the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Whether Williams\u2019s confession was the result of an improper inducement and, thus, involuntary under Maryland criminal law is our next inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Williams asserts that his confession was involuntary because the detectives implied Williams \u201cmight see outside again if he confessed to a robbery gone bad instead of a premeditated murder.\u201d Williams alleges that the detectives led him to believe that \u201ca robbery gone bad was not a \u2018bad charge,\u2019 that a deal might be offered if he confessed to a robbery gone bad, and that his boots might not be smoked if he confessed to a robbery gone bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u201c[Ujnder Maryland criminal law, independent of any federal constitutional requirement, if an accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration, and he makes remarks in reliance on that inducement, his declaration will be considered to have been involuntarily made and therefore inadmissible.\u201d <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 153, 406 A.2d 415, 420 (1979). Judge Irma Raker writing for this Court in <em>State v. Tolbert, </em>381 Md. 539, 558, 850 A.2d 1192, 1203 (2004), articulated the two-pronged test for involuntariness by inducement: \u2018We look first to see if the police made a threat, promise, or inducement. If that prong is satisfied, we look next to see whether there was a nexus between the promise or inducement and the defendant\u2019s confession.\u201d Since <em>Tolbert </em>we have had occasion to further explore the two-pronged test for voluntariness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">The first prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test is an objective one. In other words, when determining whether a police officer\u2019s conduct satisfies the first prong, the court must determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>would be moved to make an inculpatory statement upon hearing the officer\u2019s declaration; an accused\u2019s subjective belief that he will receive a benefit in exchange for a confession carries no weight under this prong. Ultimately, the court must determine whether the interrogating officers or an agent of the police made a threat, promise, or inducement. The threat, promise, or inducement can be considered improper regardless whether it is express or implied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">If the suppression court finds that the law enforcement officer improperly induced the accused, then the second prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test requires the court to determine whether the accused relied on that inducement in making the statement he or she seeks to suppress. Specifically, the court must examine whether there exists a causal nexus between the inducement and the statement!!]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>Hill v. State, </em>418 Md. 62, 76-77, 12 A.3d 1193, 1201 (2011), citing <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In the present case, Judge Serrette, in determining that Williams\u2019s confession was voluntary, reasoned that the detectives distinguished between premeditated murder and a robbery gone bad and \u201cemployed trickery regarding the DNA and fingerprinting, yet such trickery is permissible\u201d and found noteworthy that Williams was well aware that he had \u201can option not to speak\u201d. Additionally, Judge Serrette determined Williams\u2019s statements that, \u201cno matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway\u201d and \u201cI mean, am I ever going to see the street again\u201d indicated that \u201che did not have the misunderstanding he now alleges.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals agreed that Williams\u2019s confession was voluntary, relying primarily on <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We agree with our brethren on the Court of Special Appeals that our reasoning in <em>Ball, </em>347 Md. at 156, 699 A.2d at 1170, is dispositive. In that case, Ball confessed to the murder of Debbie Goodwich, was convicted and argued on appeal that his confession was \u201cinduced by improper promises, threats, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>psychological coercion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 699 A.2d at 1178. During Ball\u2019s interrogation detectives presented him with two documents prepared by police officers, the first of which stated that \u201cDEBBIE GOODWICH WAS BRUTALLY KILLED IN HER PARENT\u2019S HOME\u201d and described Ball as \u201cA COLD BLOODED KILLER.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 699 A.2d at 1175. The other document, in contrast, stated that, \u201cDEBBIE GOODWICH WAS ACCIDENTALLY KILLED IN HER PARENT\u2019S HOME\u201d and described that Ball \u201cHAS HAD A TOUGH LIFE\u201d and \u201cWAS TRYING TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 699 A.2d at 1176. The detective, in response to a question by Ball, responded that the documents \u201cwere two different ways of characterizing him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ball subsequently confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Ball argued before us that the presentation of two contrasting versions of the killing and of himself was \u201cpsychological coercion\u201d and rendered his statements involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 699 A.2d at 1180. We reasoned that \u201cthe record [does not] support Appellant\u2019s assertion that the police took advantage of Appellant\u2019s ignorance that the two different scenarios both amounted to first degree murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 699 A.2d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Recognizing that \u201cdeception short of an overbearing inducement is a valid weapon of the police arsenal,\u201d we noted that the police \u201care permitted to trick the suspect into making an inculpatory statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 699 A.2d at 1180. We explained that, \u201c[s]imilarly, an appeal to the inner psychological pressure of conscience to tell the truth does not constitute coercion in the legal sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 699 A.2d at 1181. We concluded that, \u201c[t]here is no indication that Appellant\u2019s will was overborne by the use of this interrogation method.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 699 A.2d at 1181. Furthermore, based on Ball\u2019s statement asking \u201cwhat do they do for me\u201d we concluded that he \u201capparently recognized, therefore, that under either scenario he would be admitting to the murder of Debra Goodwich.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>With respect to the argument that his confession was involuntary because of inducement, we reasoned that Detective Bollinger was merely giving Ball \u201can opportunity to explain his criminal behavior in his own words\u201d and any \u201cbenefit\u201d to Ball did not amount to an improper inducement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">Detective Bollinger was not suggesting to Appellant that the police or any other State official would confer any special benefit or advantage on Appellant in exchange for a written confession. Rather, the message that Detective Bollinger was trying to convey when he stated that it would be \u201cbetter\u201d for Appellant was simply that a written confession would provide Appellant an opportunity to explain his criminal behavior in his own words. To the extent that this opportunity constituted a \u201cbenefit\u201d to Appellant, it did not rise to the level of an improper inducement. That Appellant was aware that no other benefit was to be realized from providing a written confession is evidenced, in fact, by his remark to Detective Bollinger that \u201cI am going to convict myself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 176, 699 A.2d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Our reasoning in <em>Ball </em>is applicable in the present case. The officer stated that, \u201cwhat we don\u2019t want you to do is have us leaving here thinking that you went in there specifically to kill somebody\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s different than a robbery gone bad.\u201d As in <em>Ball, </em>presentment of two different ways of characterizing the situation is not an inducement. As Detective Harris aptly put it, \u201cThat\u2019s two scenarios.\u201d We, thus, agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cDetective Harris was merely advising appellant of the <em>possible </em>legal consequences of a verdict of first degree premeditated murder at appellant\u2019s future trial.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>219 Md.App. at 338, 100 A.3d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Williams, however, also relies on <em>Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 722, 404 A.2d 1073, 1082 (1979) in which we stated that there are \u201climits to the type of police deception which will be tolerated without rendering a confession involuntary, particularly with regard to deception concerning constitutional rights.\u201d In addition to other arguments Lewis alleged that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>confession was involuntary and that interrogating officers had stated to him that \u201cfailure to take a lie detector test would essentially amount to an admission of guilt\u201d as well as that \u201casking for a lawyer amounted to an admission of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721, 404 A.2d at 1081. We did not, however, address the issue, because we decided the case on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Williams also urges us to adopt the reasoning of the dissent of Judge Raker in <em>Baynor v. State, </em>355 Md. 726, 750-51, 736 A.2d 325, 337-38 (1999) (J. Raker dissenting), in which she acknowledged that, \u201cCourts around the country have held that the giving of false advice as to the possible penalties is a factor affecting the voluntariness determination\u201d and concluded that \u201c[i]n order to properly assess the voluntariness of Baynor\u2019s confession, the jury should have been allowed to consider evidence that the detective told him that he faced being put to death summarily.\u201d We agree that false advice may be a factor affecting the voluntariness determination, but that is not in issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Even were we to have found that the comments of the police could have been construed as an improper inducement or promise, Williams did not rely on these statements in making his confession. Prior to confessing, Williams stated, \u201cNo matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway.\u201d His statement certainly reflected Williams\u2019s understanding that he would be subject to severe sanctions, no matter what he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Williams, however, argues that police \u201cdid more than just present Petitioner with two different characterizations of the crime at issue\u201d because, he asserts, they took advantage of his ignorance that the two possibilities presented both constituted first degree murder. Any reliance that Williams now claims based on the detectives\u2019 characterizations of the crime is belied by Williams\u2019s own statements of \u201cno matter what you all find out, they\u2019re going to smoke my boots anyway.\u201d As Judge Serrette found, Williams\u2019s statement, \u201cI mean, am I ever going to see the street again\u201d, indicates that \u201che did not have the misunderstanding he now alleges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>In conclusion, we hold that Williams\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know\u201d was an ambiguous invocation of his right remain silent. We further hold that his confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The State\u2019s conditional cross-petition posed the following question: Where the officers were still in the process of explaining Williams\u2019s rights to him, and had not yet said or done anything that would have been reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Williams, did the Court of Special Appeals err in ruling that Williams was being interrogated for purposes of <em>Miranda?</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">.

Specifically, the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides, \"No person shall ... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law ...\u201d U.S. Const.Amend. V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\">. The Wisconsin intermediate appellate court also noted that Hassel conceded that his statement was ambiguous. <em>State v.

When the suspect is in police custody, officers must advise the suspect of that right, among others, in a litany that has come to be known as the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and must cease questioning if the suspect invokes the right to silence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The basic rules are straightforward. But in a particular case there may be uncertainty\u2014as to whether the person is in custody, whether the person has invoked the right to silence, or whether the police have engaged in forbidden questioning. The case law has developed subsidiary rules for grappling with such uncertainties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But it does not support finding ambiguity where there is none\u2014even if it is tempting to do so in a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>where the officers are not overbearing and are simply trying to keep the prime suspect talking about his role in a horrendous crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The Majority opinion accurately summarizes case law concerning the invocation of the right to silence by a person in police custody, some of it dealing with ambiguous invocations of the right to silence. Much of it, however, does not apply to this case. In my view, a review of the complete transcript and video of the police interview of Mr. Williams leads inevitably to the conclusion that he unambiguously asserted his right to remain silent, and that a reasonable officer would readily comprehend that election. But the officers did not halt the interrogation and Mr. Williams ultimately made oral and written statements that were used as part of the agreed statement of facts that resulted in his conviction. I would hold that the statements should have been excluded from the prosecution\u2019s case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">As the Majority opinion notes, the critical juncture in Mr. Williams\u2019 interrogation came when he told the detectives: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing. I don\u2019t know ...\u201d In the circumstances of this interview, a reasonable police officer (which, as the Majority opinion discusses, is the relevant legal test) would understand that statement to be an invocation of the right to remain silent. Some context is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">According to the video recording, Mr. Williams had been alone in the interrogation room for approximately one hour when the two police officers entered and began speaking with him. The officers first asked Mr. Williams various questions concerning his background and then began to explain their interest in what he might have to say to them. Mr. Williams stated repeatedly that \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d The detectives insisted that it was premature for him to respond until they \u201cgo through the process.\u201d Sergeant McDonald then gave what amounted to a preview of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Mr. Williams responded \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing,\u201d with an audible emphasis on \u201cnothing\u201d and appeared to be about to repeat the same sentence he had stated, in one form or another, six times in the prior two minutes\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\u201d\u2014when Sergeant McDonald waved his hands to cut him off and talked over him. It is evident from the video that Mr. Williams kept talking, but the content is indiscernible (to this ear, at least, and apparently to the official transcriber as well) as a result of the officer\u2019s simultaneous comments. However, it seems a fair inference that Mr. Williams was simply repeating the same protestation of ignorance that he had given throughout the interview to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">As the State concedes, there is no ambiguity in the statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing\u201d as an invocation of the right to remain silent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both detectives certainly appeared to interpret Mr. Williams\u2019 statement as conveying that sentiment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sergeant McDonald\u2019s immediate response was \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to say nothing.... You don\u2019t have to say nothing....\u201d And, shortly thereafter, Detective Harris confirmed that \u201cyou have the right to stop answering questions at any time.\u201d However, the officers took the position that it was premature for Mr. Williams to invoke the right to silence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>that point in the interview because \u201cto get to one point, from point A to point B, we have to read you your rights.\u201d While the officers\u2019 subjective understandings of Mr. Williams\u2019 statement is not legally dispositive, the officers appeared to come to the reasonable conclusion that Mr. Williams was trying to assert his right to remain silent. Essentially, the detectives were telling Mr. Williams that he could not invoke his right to silence until, as Sergeant McDonald phrased it, \u201cwe go through that <em>formality\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>reciting the full <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Consistent with the apparent position of the officers, the State has argued, before the Court of Special Appeals and in its cross-petition for <em>certiorari </em>to us, that Mr. Williams\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>rights had not yet attached at the time he made the statement in question. For the reasons explained well in the opinion of the intermediate appellate court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I would reject that argument and hold that the statement was made in the context of custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 182 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991) <em>(Miranda </em>rights are to be asserted within \u201cthe context of custodial interrogation\u201d). Hence, Mr. Williams could invoke his right to remain silent at that time. The officers\u2019 advice to Mr. Williams that he could not assert the right to silence until they reached \u201cpoint B\u201d was simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Thus, because Mr. Williams\u2019 statements would have communicated (and did communicate) to reasonable officers that he chose to say nothing, Mr. Williams effectively invoked his constitutional right to remain silent. The officers should have respected his rights and ended the interview at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge ADKINS advise that they join this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\">. <em>Miranda v.

Do you see when the police walk up to somebody, and we want to ask you, we want to talk to you about something, we always read the person their rights? You've seen that on T.V., right? They say, you\u2019ve got the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. You've heard that before, haven\u2019t you? Yeah. We have to go through that formality to get to what we want to talk about. That\u2019s, we have to go through that formality.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. This fact distinguishes this case from every case cited by the Majority opinion as an ambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent: in each ambiguous invocation cited by the Majority opinion, the suspect never made any statement that, standing alone, would be clear enough to invoke the right to remain silent. For example, \"I think I\u2019ll just quit talking,\u201d which preceded \"I don\u2019t know\u201d in <em>State v. Holmes, </em>278 Kan. 603, 102 P.3d 406 (2004), is ambiguous even standing alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. Mr. Williams\u2019 body language also supported this interpretation. He was leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets as if totally disengaged from the interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\">. <em>See </em>219 Md.App. 295, 316-23, 100 A.3d 1208 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\">. The Majority opinion assumes for the sake of analysis that <em>Miranda </em>rights had attached at the time of Mr. Williams' statement, but does not otherwise address the issue.
