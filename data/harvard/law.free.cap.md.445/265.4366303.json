The charges against Sibug arose from an incident in 1998, when, according to charging documents, Sibug pointed a handgun at his five children and threatened to kill them.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Prior to trial in 1999, Sibug entered pleas of not guilty, not competent to stand trial and not criminally responsible. The judge ordered that Sibug be examined by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to determine if he were \u201cincompetent to stand trial pursuant to Health-General 12-101(d).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After Sibug was evaluated at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital, the Department, in a letter to the court dated December 7, 1999, opined that Sibug was not competent to stand trial because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>his \u201creligious delusions\u201d and inability to \u201cseparate man-made law from \u2018God\u2019s moral law\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">The defendant is Not Competent to Stand Trial. The defendant demonstrated a factual understanding of the court system. However, his appreciation of the proceedings and his ability to assist in his own defense is significantly impaired by his psychosis. His religious delusions have led the defendant to believe that the judicial system and its agents are \u201cof Satan.\u201d As a result, he believes he cannot receive a fair trial and he will not assist an attorney who does not have the same religious beliefs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">The defendant does not accurately appreciate the proceedings against him. The defendant cannot separate man-made law from \u201cGod\u2019s moral law.\u201d Consequently, he does not believe that his situation is simply a criminal prosecution; but rather, a struggle between the \u201crighteous\u201d and the \u201cwicked.\u201d This belief has impaired his ability to rationally weigh the advantages and the disadvantages of a plea bargain. He refuses to consider a plea bargain because \u201cit would be succumbing to the forces of evil.\u201d He would rather be imprisoned for life or executed than betray his \u201crighteous faith in the one true God.\u201d Furthermore, he intends to use a legal defense based upon Biblical scripture and \u201cGod\u2019s truth\u201d rather than developing evidence to contest the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">The defendant\u2019s alleged offenses were of a serious nature. His threats and behaviors indicate a significant potential for life threatening violence. This occurred in the setting of his displeasure with his children for lack of discipline. His recent onset of religious and paranoid delusions has intensified his negative feelings and thoughts toward his children. He now considers them \u201cdevils.\u201d Consequently, his risk for harming his children has intensified. The defendant is dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">In January of 2000, the Circuit Court issued a \u201cFinding of Incompetency and Order of Commitment\u201d that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Upon evidence presented that Mario Sibug is not able to understand the nature or object of the proceeding or to assist in the defense, this Court finds that Mario Sibug is presently incompetent to stand trial, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">Upon evidence presented that because of mental disorder, Mario Sibug is a danger to self of the person or property of others, it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">ORDERED, this 10th day of January, 2000, that Mario Sibug shall be committed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for inpatient care and treatment until this Court is satisfied that Mario Sibug is no longer incompetent to stand trial or no longer is, because of mental retardation or mental disorder, a danger to self or the person or property of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Sibug remained at Perkins; by April, 2000, the Department had re-evaluated him and concluded that he was competent to stand trial because he was able \u201cto distinguish between \u2018moral law1 and \u2018man\u2019s law,\u2019 \u201d although his \u201cdelusions\u201d persisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">Mario Sibug has a good understanding of the court system. He correctly identified the roles of the judge, jury, State\u2019s Attorney, and defense attorney. He offered that the three pleas available to him were guilty, not guilty, and not criminally responsible. The defendant also articulated an understanding of the concept of plea bargaining. In addition, the defendant correctly identified the charges against him and assessed them as \u201csevere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">The defendant stated that it was his intention to plead not guilty. He stated that he would not plea bargain because he believed that it would be an admission of guilt for something he did not do. The defendant stated that he continues to believe that he is the \u201crighteous one\u201d in this case and that the complaining witnesses are \u201cwicked.\u201d However, he recognized that despite this belief he could be found guilty and convicted. The defendant stated that he would be willing to accept that outcome if that was determined by the jury on interpretation of the facts of the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The defendant\u2019s previous beliefs on admission that the judicial system and its agents were \u201cSatan\u201d have resolved. The defendant currently demonstrates an ability to distinguish between \u201cmoral law\u201d and \u201cman\u2019s law.\u201d Moreover, the defendant no longer believes that he requires a Christian attorney in order to receive a fair trial since the outcome will be based on the evidence. The defendant demonstrated an understanding that the outcome of his case will be determined by a dispute over the facts. The defendant can now rationally weigh the advantages and disadvantages of various defenses. The defendant stated that he could .work with a defense attorney who was ethical, hard working, and seriously interested in representing him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">The defendant continues to lack insight regarding past and present delusional beliefs and has remained unwilling to accept treatment. Despite this, the defendant\u2019s delusional beliefs no longer rise to the level of impairing his ability to understand the nature or object of the proceedings; or to assist in his defense. The defendant is competent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">After the letter was docketed, trial was set for August of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On August 1, 2000, however, the Department sent another letter to the Circuit Court opining that Sibug\u2019s condition had deteriorated and that he was not competent to stand trial. Although a full evaluation was not attached, in a follow-up letter to the court in October of 2000 the Department stated that \u201c[gjiven his persisting delusions, his lack of insight, and emotional lability, Mr. Sibug is unable to understand the nature and the object of the proceedings against him\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">In his previous evaluation, Mr. Sibug was deemed competent to stand trial because he understood the nature and quality of the legal proceedings, and demonstrated the ability to assist a lawyer in his defense. In his most recent competency monitoring evaluation, however, his mental state showed a return of psychotic symptoms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">Mr. Sibug demonstrated a basic understanding of the court system and the charges against him. He correctly identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>fled the role of the judge, State\u2019s Attorney, defense attorney, and jury. He described Guilty, Not Guilty, and Not Criminally Responsible as available pleas. Further, he correctly listed the charges against him, and their severity. He understood the use of plea-bargaining to mitigate punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">Despite his understanding of these abstractions, Mr. Sibug\u2019s religious and paranoid delusions prevented their application to his legal circumstances. For instance, he believed that his attorney was in league with his children and Satan. He stated that he was a \u201crighteous man\u201d like Noah, Abraham and Moses, and that these charges are meant to \u201ctest his faith in God,\u201d not to punish him for wrongdoing. He believed to plead Guilty or Not Criminally Responsible would result in rejecting God. When asked about his role in the alleged offenses, he answered with a litany of Biblical scriptures. When directed to answer in his own words, he became agitated and spewed forth more scripture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">Given his persisting delusions, his lack of insight, and emotional lability, Mr. Sibug is unable to understand the nature and the object of the proceedings against him; he is unable to assist in his defense. His history of acting violently in response to these delusions makes him a high risk for dangerousness to self and to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">With full participation in treatment, Mr. Sibug is expected to achieve competency in the foreseeable future. His refusal to take medications is a major hurdle in the pathway to regaining competency to stand trial. Mr. Sibug would be expected to achieve competency once he becomes compliant with medications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Thereafter, the Department periodically sent annual letters and evaluations to the Circuit Court indicating that Sibug remained incompetent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In 2003, the Department reflected that, \u201cSibug recently [has] been receiving medications involuntarily under a Clinical Review Panel and has improved with treatment\u201d and \u201crequested that the court make a determination regarding Mr. Sibug\u2019s competency to stand trial.\u201d The attached evaluation reaffirmed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">Mr. Sibug\u2019s past reported symptoms included paranoid thinking, hyperreligousity, and emotional lability. He denied having an illness. An ALJ hearing to determine if he could be medicated against his wishes was held in February, 2003. This hearing was the result of Mr. Sibug\u2019s appeal of the CTPMC Clinical Review Board\u2019s decision that Mr. Sibug be medicated against his wishes. The judge ruled that Mr. Sibug could be medicated. Olanzapine, an antipsychotic medication, was started at that time and was titrated to its current dosage of 15 mg by mouth per day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Mr. Sibug\u2019s symptoms of paranoia and emotional lability had improved since his last evaluation. Mr. Sibug agreed to meet with his attending physician voluntarily. He also agreed to meet with this evaluator for the first time. His willingness to meet with medical staff was a significant improvement in his treatment status. Mr. Sibug was willing to listen to rational arguments. In some instances he was agreed with what was presented to him. For example, when it was explained that his refusal to meet with me for competency monitoring evaluations based on his belief that \u201cyou were just like the others and would not be fair to me\u201d was a rash decision not based totally on fact, Mr. Sibug was able to agree. In other areas, Mr. Sibug could understand the rationale of others, even though he continued to disagree. For example, Mr. Sibug felt that his doctors were trying to help him, despite the fact that he continued to deny that he was mentally ill. He did not think the staff was plotting against him or trying to violate his rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>maliciously. He said, \u201cThey think everyone who get in here is mentally ill, so I can see why they think I am too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Mr. Sibug was able to demonstrate the capacity to assist in his own defense. Mr. Sibug, when presented with hypothetical situations was able to share his reasons for making specific choices. For example, Mr. Sibug indicated a preference to have a trial by jury. When presented with a rational and reasonable scenario where his attorney may suggest that a trial with only a judge might be in his best interest, Mr. Sibug said, \u201cIf he gave me a good reason like what you just described, I would agree with him and choose the judge over the jury.\u201d As Mr. Sibug felt he was not mentally ill, he was unwilling to entertain the NCR plea. Mr. Sibug was also adamant that he did not want to accept a plea agreement where he had to say he was guilty. Mr. Sibug understood that his attorney had to recommend these avenues if he thought they were in Mr. Sibug\u2019s best interest. Mr. Sibug said that if his lawyer recommended a plea bargain or NCR he understood that his attorney was trying to do what he thought was best. Mr. Sibug did not think his attorney was out to get him or otherwise against him. Mr. Sibug suggested that the problem he had was that his attorney might not be able to understand his religious and cultural beliefs, which would make it difficult for the attorney to understand why he might choose to go to court and \u201caccept the risk\u201d that he might end up in jail longer than if he accepted a plea bargain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">Mr. Sibug understood the nature and object of the proceedings against him. He understood the roles of the judge, jury, State\u2019s Attorney, public defender and witnesses. He understood that the judge or jury would decide if he was innocent or guilty based on the different kinds of evidence presented at the trial. He felt that the judge or jury would try to be fair. He described the term plea bargain. He understood the pleas of guilty, not guilty, and NCR and understood the outcomes of each plea. He described proper courtroom behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Mr. Sibug should continue to be offered medications. Efforts at developing a relationship with Mr. Sibug, which would enable him to work better with staff and continue to be more amenable to education regarding his condition and situation, should be continued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The letter stated, \u201c[ejnclosed, for your convenience, please find a draft order of competence. If this is acceptable to you, please execute it and request that the clerk\u2019s office forward copies to all interested parties.\u201d The \u201cOrder of Competence,\u201d thereafter, though, was neither signed nor docketed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Later in 2003, the Department sent another letter to the Circuit Court stating that Sibug remained competent and requested \u201cthe court\u2019s determination regarding Mr. Sibug\u2019s competency to stand trial.\u201d Attached to the letter was the Department\u2019s evaluation, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">Mr. Sibug\u2019s clinical condition did not change significantly since his last competency assessment. He did not believe that he had a mental disorder. He did not believe that his mental condition changed during his hospitalization at Clifton. T. Perkins Hospital Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">He refused to discuss his clinical progress with staff. He did not believe that he' benefitted from the psychotropic medication regimen. He stated that he planned to discontinue his psychotropic medication regimen upon discharge from Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. Inpatient treatment staff observed that his delusional symptoms persisted, manifested by paranoia and religious preoccupation. Staff observed limited improvement in some aspects of his clinical condition, for example, he was no longer hyperverbal, his religious preoccupation was less extreme, and he was less irritable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">Mr. Sibug presented for the interview without overt evidence of psychotic symptoms. His thoughts were organized. He did not express suspicions or religious preoccupation. He was not irritable or restless. Mr. Sibug was able to control his behavior during the interview. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>able to focus on the issues raised in the interview with regard to his competency to stand trial. He was able to describe the criminal charges against him. He described alternative pleas and stated his intention to plead \u201cnot guilty\u201d if he was allowed to stand trial. He would consider a plea bargain. He understood the roles of the courtroom participants. He believed that he could assist his defense attorney in his own legal defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">Mr. Sibug described past mistrust of his defense attorney when he was adjudicated incompetent to stand trial. He stated, \u201cMy public defender didn\u2019t tell me what I was not competent. I had to find out by reading my record.\u201d He stated that he did not know why his public defender allegedly did not inform him of his competency status. He stated that a social worker later explained to him that \u201csometimes they have so many clients that they can\u2019t get in touch with everybody.\u201d He considered this explanation of the public defender\u2019s alleged failure to inform him of his competency status and said, \u201cthat\u2019s possible.\u201d When asked whether he could work with his public defender, given the past history of alleged miscommunication, he said, \u201cI think so. We\u2019ll see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Based on a review of the hospital record, discussion with inpatient staff, and this interview, Mr. Sibug was able to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him. He was able to assist his counsel in the defense. Therefore, Mr. Sibug was competent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Another letter by the Department sent in January of 2004 iterated that, \u201cMr. Sibug was most recently evaluated for his competency to stand trial on November 13, 2003, and was assessed as competent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">The Clinical Review Panel was discontinued. [Sibug] took his medication voluntarily, but he did not believe that he received benefit from his psychotropic medication regimen. He stated, \u201cI take the medicine so I can have my trial.\u201d He said that he did not plan to continue his medication after he was discharged from Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>There was no evidence that Mr. Sibug\u2019s clinical condition changed significantly since his last competency assessment. He did not believe that his mental condition was changed since his admission to Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I have a mental illness.\u201d He refused to discuss his clinical progress with inpatient staff. Treatment staff observed that his delusional symptoms persisted, manifested by religious preoccupation and paranoia. Staff observed limited improvement in some aspects of his clinical condition. For example, he was no longer hyperverbal, his religious preoccupation was less extreme. He was less anxious and irritable. He did not demonstrate assaultive behavior. His behavior occasionally appeared friendly. He participated in patient groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">Mr. Sibug described his criminal charges as, \u201cThe first one is first degree assault. That means hitting someone else. Next is parental abuse. That means you are abusing your children. And the last one is child endangerment. That means you put your children in danger.\u201d He was not sure about the penalties associated with his charges or his legal defense, but said, \u201cI will have to discuss that with my attorney. But I\u2019ve requested a new attorney.\u201d He described the available pleas as, \u201cGuilty means they do the crime. Not guilty meant they didn\u2019t do the crime. And NCR means, they do the crime but because of mental illness, they aren\u2019t responsible.\u201d He described a plea bargain as, \u201cThe State will make a deal so there will not be a trial. There will be a lesser charge or sentence.\u201d He said that \u201cThe judge is neutral, and interprets and imposes the law.\u201d He said that, \u201cThe jury makes a verdict, and is also neutral.\u201d He said that, \u201cThe prosecutor proves that you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>committed the crime.\u201d He said that, \u201cThe witnesses tell their story for either side.\u201d He said that, \u201cThe defense attorney defends you.\u201d He stated, \u201cMy role is to tell the truth.\u201d He understood that he could not be forced to testify against himself, and added, \u201cThat\u2019s my constitutional right.\u201d He understood that his attorney could \u201ccross examine\u201d the prosecution witnesses. He said that a defendant in the courtroom must, \u201cPay attention and not be disruptive.\u201d Mr. Sibug stated that he filed a grievance against his public defender with the \u201cAttorney Grievance Commission.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not happy with my attorney. He\u2019s very controlling and domineering. He doesn\u2019t want to listen to anything I have to say. He wants to make all the decisions. But I think that I should be able to say what I think, also. It\u2019s my trial.\u201d He said that he requested a new public defender. Based on a review of the hospital record, discussion with inpatient staff, and the present interview with Mr. Sibug, he was able to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him. He was able to assist his counsel in his defense. Therefore, Mr. Sibug was competent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Mr. Sibug presented for the interview without overt evidence of delusions or hallucinations. His behavior was calm and cooperative throughout the interview. His thoughts were organized and concrete. He did not express suspicions or religious preoccupation. He was not irritable. He was able to focus on the issues raised in the interview with regard to his competency to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In May of 2004, when Sibug appeared in the Circuit Court, he proceeded by way of a not guilty statement of facts to the charge of second degree assault. During the proceedings, Sibug was informed of the implications of proceeding on an agreed statement of facts to which he indicated understanding. After being found guilty, Sibug was sentenced to four and one-half years\u2019 imprisonment and was granted credit for the time he had spent in Perkins, which equated to the sentence of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">After his conviction, Sibug faced deportation to the Philippines. While in the custody of the Immigration and Nationalization Service, Sibug, <em>pro se, </em>filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis, alleging that he had not been advised of the effect a conviction for assault would have on his immigration status. In 2005, the Circuit Court determined that Sibug\u2019s counsel had been ineffective because he had not advised Sibug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>of the immigration consequences of his assault conviction, vacated Sibug\u2019s sentence and ordered a new trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The retrial began in September, 2008 before the same judge who had presided over the coram nobis proceeding. During jury selection there was a conference at the bench, during which the circuit judge spoke briefly with Sibug, although the interaction between Sibug and the judge was limited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">When Sibug took the stand,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he cited extensively to the Bible and expressed that he had held a gun on his children to test their faith during the incident in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, on the evening you had an occasion to discipline [your children]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">[SIBUG]: Not really discipline them. I discipline them with the word of God just as stated, you know, in the Bible; especially, Hebrew 4:2, but on that time, as I said, I\u2019m searching about the mustard grain of Jesus Christ. If they had a faith just like the size of a mustard grain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you pull a gun that night, Mr. Sibug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>[SIBUG]: It\u2019s not easy like that. Just, like, you know, every novel, you know, I tell, you know, a sermon alluding to the Bible. Just like Second Timothy 3:16 says, all Scripture is part of God for improving, for setting things straight and disciplining in righteousness, but they don\u2019t listen. I just want to get their attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Tell the ladies and gentlemen how you went about trying to get their attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">[SIBUG]: Yes. It\u2019s just like what Abraham did in Genesis:22:l-18. Abraham used a dagger but God tested his faith, and it make him subdued to his Father. Abraham were going to offer Isaac to Jehovah God. That\u2019s why in that chapter Abraham passed the test and from Abraham he set Jacob to marry and come out to Jesus Christ, your Savior, because of our sin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, were you testing the faith of your children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">[SIBUG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And will you tell the ladies and gentlemen specifically what you did to test their faith? [SIBUG]: Yeah. I said, you know, if you will not listen to the Bible and also what I have said, I said I cannot let that go. Then I said, you know, just tell me the truth. Because they are always lying. Do you believe in God? Do you believe in the Bible? Because, if they had the sense of a mustard grain, then I let them go, but whether they did because one time I do like that, but I did not point anyone the gun to my children because my children they are nearest to my God. Solomon 157:3-5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">I remove, you know, the gun. I came from upstairs because I go back upstairs and pray. I said, you know, Jehovah, God, please help me. I\u2019m in trouble. My children, they are rebellious. Then I come back; I said, you know how, you know, Abraham used the dagger, and I\u2019m going to use the gun, and I put, you know, the empty bullet shells in the gun. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>I said, everyone, now, and then I said, you know, you call me names and everything. In this house there is authority I said and repeated and repeated. The head of the woman is the man. The head of the man is the Christ, and the head of Christ is God. 1 Cornelian 11:3. I said, why you don\u2019t respect authority? They never say anything and Mark is laughing. Gizele and Maria Lovely, they are, you know, they are\u2014I\u2019m talking to them like this. They was facing in the wall just as usual. They are mocking me as father and then I did change all my bullets. I said, probably I\u2019m going to offer you as sacrifice to my God, and the bullets fell down, all of them until the time there is no more left, and I put it on the table, and I pick up all the bullet shells from the table because they are not looking. Then I put them in my pocket. I pick up the live bullets in my left pocket and then put them over there. (Indicating.) I\u2019m waiting for them. They look and they don\u2019t really care about me, but when they look at the gun and the bullets, then all of them cry. They are scared of the bullets, but they are not scared of my God and my Bible and me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, Mr. Sibug, why did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">[SIBUG]: Well, as I said, sir, before they came in here they just using me as a stepping stone here. They don\u2019t love me. They hate me. They calling me names. I\u2019m wife beater. I\u2019m adulterer. My wife is a whore. Everything. And now, I\u2019m Devil and my two children they are Devil. In front of me Mark is saying that one. I cannot touch him because I know the Devil is in him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you point a gun at Mark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">[SIBUG]: No. I point up in the ceiling. I did not\u2014I\u2019m sorry. You know, I did not mean, you know, to scare them, but you know, the other two kids and my wife and my father-in-law, they are not scared because they know. They know God and they are righteous, but my children, whatever the Bible said, they just refuse. They are wicked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Sibug continued to allude to Biblical references on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: So it\u2019s all on your kids who were sort of considered as rebellious. They were all rebellious. They were all doing things that were not disciplined, right? [SIBUG]: Sure. Only the three. The two, they are like human being but the three, they are goat like human being just like what Jesus Christ said in Matthew 25:31-46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And when you brought [the gun] out and you had all of your kids around the table and you put it on the table, as you said, you did that as like a psychological strategy, right, to scare them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">[SIBUG]: Maybe in a sense because I\u2019m a spiritual man and you are a disciple. A physical man cannot know the things about the spirit of God because everything is foolishness to him and then a spiritual man, you know, he examine everything but a man like you will never examine me. Corinthian 2:14-15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: You felt it was okay to scare your kids by putting the gun in front of them, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">[SIBUG]: No, sir. You are the one who said it. Don\u2019t put something in my mouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m asking you a question. [SIBUG]: No, sir. I just said, you know testing their faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Mark is the Devil, right, to you? [SIBUG]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: He\u2019s not? You just said on direct examination that the Devil is in him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">[SIBUG]: Oh, yeah. Can I clarify that one, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m not asking you to clarify. That\u2019s what you said, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">[SIBUG]: How can I explain it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m not asking you to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>[SIBUG]: Yeah. According to 1 John:3:10, he\u2019s not doing righteousness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: You referred to him as Satan at one point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">[SIBUG]: Oh, yes because Satan is the Father of Lies. John 8:44.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: So did you feel then that it was okay to point a gun at him because he was the Devil? [SIBUG]: No, sir. You are mistaken. You make me crazy. No, sir. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I have nothing further, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The jury found Sibug guilty of two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of second-degree assault, one count of using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and one count of giving minors access to a firearm as well as not guilty of one count of first degree assault and three counts of reckless endangerment. At the end of the proceeding, the judge addressed Sibug:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">[THE COURT]: Let me just advise you Mr. Sibug ... all your other rights will accrue as of your date of sentencing. [SIBUG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Prior to sentencing, weeks later, Sibug, through counsel, requested that the sentencing be delayed in order to accommodate a competency evaluation because \u201cDefense attorney in retrospect believes that Mr. Sibug was incompetent to stand trial\u201d:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>2. That Mario Sibug\u2019s testimony and his lack of intelligent communications with his trial attorney indicate that Mr. Sibug was not competent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">3. Mario Sibug has expressed the thought that \u201cGod\u2019s law is superior to man\u2019s law\u201d which means that a man (a judge) has no jurisdiction in his case\u2014a false belief, which in turn renders an alliance with his attorney problematic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">4. That Defense attorney in retrospect believes that Mr. Sibug was incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">WHEREFORE, Defense counsel requests that sentencing be held <em>sub cu\u00f1a </em>pending an evaluation on competency and criminal responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">While the motion did not state that Sibug had been found incompetent in the same case, Sibug\u2019s counsel, at sentencing, stated that Sibug had been institutionalized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">He had put his faith as he still does in the Bible. As you saw him testify Your Honor, it was a little incoherent, to say the least, and I would like to really have him evaluated. I should have done this before, but I listened to my client. In retrospect after looking at the trial, having gone to trial and having witnessed him, I think that, if we would be granted a new trial to have him evaluated, it would be probably more\u2014very beneficial for my client. He was evaluated before, Your Honor. He stayed five years, four and a half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>years in an institution being evaluated and their finding at the time was that he was competent and that he was not NCR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The State, in response, argued at sentencing that, \u201che certainly quoted the Bible often, but his responses were rational. He was at times combative with me on cross-examination which shows he knew what was happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Ruling that Sibug was competent to stand trial, the judge examined the statutory requirements for a judicial determination of competency and gave Sibug\u2019s attorney an opportunity to present evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">[THE COURT]: The statute is kind of vague. 3-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article says if before or during a trial the defendant in a criminal case appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetency to stand trial, the court shall determine when evidence is presented on the record whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">If after receiving evidence the court finds that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the trial shall begin as soon as practical or if already begun, shall continue so there it indicates that if it appears to the court or the defendant alleges it has to be before or during trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct. I read that statute, and it has no language in there about a post trial motion such as I have made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">[THE COURT]: Except on the issue of reconsideration it says\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">[THE COURT]:\u2014under [subsection] (c) [of 3-104], at any time before final judgment and this would be before final judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">[THE COURT]: The court may reconsider the question of whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial but that presupposes an initial consideration of the question, which wasn\u2019t raised before or dining the trial. I guess it could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>construed, as I look at it now, at any time before final judgment the court may reconsider the question of whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial. I guess technically, since we\u2019re before judgment now, I could hold a hearing on that issue. Is that what you\u2019re asking for? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I spoke to my client just now because, frankly, Your Honor, we have no evidence this morning to suggest competency or incompetency. I\u2019m just basing this on my observation and my consistent contact with my client. Right now this morning at this moment my client is asking me to withdraw this motion.... [H]e wants to proceed here today so with that being said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">[THE COURT]: But as his attorney you want the court to pursue it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">[THE COURT]: Well, do you want to put on evidence? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, the kind of evidence\u2014that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m not prepared because I\u2019m not an expert. If I were to put on any evidence, it would be the medical information that was already done where he was found competent, but I do know this much, Your Honor. I know that competency is a shifting standard. You could be competent today and incompetent tomorrow but I\u2019m not prepared to put that on. I would have to call doctors. I would have to have him evaluated, and I would need a psychologist or psychiatrist to come in and tell the court if he is he is, in fact, incompetent or at that time that we went to trial. Now, my client has indicated to me, as I said to the court, that he wants to proceed today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">[SIBUG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He has that right so with that being said, Your Honor, I think we\u2019re ready to go forward here today because not to go forward\u2014I don\u2019t want\u2014he\u2019s adamant about this as he has been all along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>[THE COURT]: Okay. All right. So you have no additional evidence to put forth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, I do not, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">[THE COURT]: All right. Well, based on the record that I have which consists of the 2004 evaluation from the [Department] finding Mr. Sibug competent to stand trial and the fact that it appeared to me during trial that he was able to communicate with his defense attorney. The trial lasted some time. Didn\u2019t it last a couple days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, it did, Your Honor. I believe that trial lasted two days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">[THE COURT]: All right. Two days. I observed him communicating with counsel. I observed him engage in the voir dire process. He seemed to understand exactly what was going on. I do believe that his rejection of the plea offer, even accepting [defense counsel\u2019s] statement that it was a slim chance of deportation, there\u2019s still a chance of it even with that plea agreement and he rejected it. So based on everything that I recall, based on the evidence in this hearing, which is actually no additional evidence, I believe he did understand the nature of the proceedings against him, and he was able to assist in his own defense and so I find that he\u2019s competent____I find based on the totality of the facts and circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt he was competent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Prior to sentencing, the court addressed Sibug regarding the right of allocution, and Sibug provided a letter he wanted read and more Biblical references:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">[THE COURT]: Mr. Sibug you have a right of allocution. That means you have a right to tell me anything you want me to know about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">[SIBUG]: Thank you very much, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">[THE COURT]: Stand up a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-15\">[SIBUG]: Thank you very much, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-16\">[THE COURT]: You\u2019re free to remain silent if you wish. You\u2019re free to remain silent if you wish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>[SIBUG]: No, sir. I must, you know, tell you truthful messages to the honorable court, and I would like to use my rights and freedom of speech granted by the First Amendment of the United States constitution. I would like to read my message.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">[THE COURT]: If you want to read something, why don\u2019t you just hand it up to me? I can read it. I can read what you wrote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">[SIBUG]: I would like to read it so that everyone would hear it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">[THE COURT]: How long is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[SIBUG]: Only seven pages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">[THE COURT]:' I can read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">[SIBUG]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Let the judge read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">[SIBUG]: I need\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">[THE COURT]: If you\u2019re just going to read it, I don\u2019t need you to read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">[SIBUG]: Okay. Please read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">[THE COURT]: Is there anything you want to tell me besides what\u2019s in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-16\">[SIBUG]: No. Please read it, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-17\">[THE COURT]: Thank you, sir. Liz, have this marked as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit Sentencing Hearing Exhibit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-18\">[THE CLERK]: All right. (Whereupon, Defendant\u2019s Sentencing Exhibit No. 1, Defendant\u2019s letter, was marked as Defendant\u2019s Sentencing Exhibit No. 1.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-19\">[THE COURT]: Okay. I have read it. Thank you, Mr. Sibug. Anything else you want to tell me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-20\">[SIBUG]: Yes, Your Honor. I just want to say on the record that\u2019s all I want and then whatever you going to do to me, do it just like what is written. If I live, if I die, I belong to Jesus, God. Romans 14:8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-21\">[THE COURT]: Thank you, sir. All right----So, essentially, if you put it altogether, it\u2019s really a ten year sentence with credit for time served, including that time committed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Okay? [Defense counsel], you want to advise your client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. Mr. Sibug, you have 90 days to ask the court to modify the sentence. You have 30 days to file an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals____ Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">[SIBUG]: Yeah. I would like to note an appeal, everything, and I want a copy of that, you know, letter that has not been read in the court of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The letter, seven pages in total, stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">I did not violate any laws in the State of Maryland; I simply obeyed Jehovah God just like my Forefather Abraham (See Genesis 22:1-18); But I was convicted already as a Criminal by Man\u2019s law in the Baltimore County Circus Court. \u201cApostle Peter and John said Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to you, rather than to God, judge for yourself\u2019 (Acts 4:19). Jesus Christ said: \u201cStop judging that you may not be judged; for what judgement you are judging you will be judged.\u201d (Matthew 7:1, 2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">Jesus Christ said: \u201cI am not part of the world.\u201d My case is a God thing and not a Caesar thing. I must be judged by Jehovah\u2019s Perfect law and not by the laws of the State of Maryland. Therefore, the Baltimore County Circus Court has no jurisdiction in my Case, simply because it is a God thing. God said: \u201cSearch for what is Good and not what is Bad, to the end that you people may keep living and that thus Jehovah the God of Armies may come to be with you, just as you have said: Hate what is bad, and love what is good, and give justice a place in the gate.\u201d (Amos 5:14, 15).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">After the court sentenced Sibug to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, Sibug filed his own petition for post-conviction relief; with the consent of the State, the Circuit Court entered an order granting Sibug the right to file a belated notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Sibug appealed and presented two questions to the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>I. Was Sibug\u2019s right to due process of law violated by the court\u2019s failure to determine, prior to his new trial, that he was competent to stand trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">II. Did the trial court err in finding, at the sentencing hearing following Sibug\u2019s new trial, that he was competent to stand trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\"><em>Sibug v. State, </em>219 Md.App. 358, 362, 100 A.3d 1245 (2014). In affirming Sibug\u2019s conviction, our intermediate appellate court reasoned that there was no need for the Circuit Court to determine competency because the issue was not raised prior to or during his new trial in 2008:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">Given that the reversal of a conviction \u201cwith an order for a new trial, \u2018wipe[s] the slate clean,\u2019 and the case [begins] anew proeedurally,\u201d returning the case to the stage where \u201cany pretrial motions could be filed and resolved,\u201d <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 295, 313-14, 965 A.2d 912 (2009), it was incumbent upon Sibug, or his counsel, to raise the issue of incompetency anew. <em>Cf. Harrod, v. State, </em>423 Md. 24, 34-36, 31 A.3d 173 (2011) (explaining that the grant of a mistrial, like the grant of a new trial, \u201crequires the litigants to observe pretrial procedures once again,\u201d including the State\u2019s obligation to give notice of its intent to introduce a chemist\u2019s report even though the same report had been introduced at the first trial); <em>Marshall v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 532, 550-54, 74 A.3d 831 (2013) (concluding that the grant of a new trial \u201ceffectively wipe[d] out the prior proceedings\u201d and required the defendant to allege at his second trial that the Maryland gang statute was unconstitutional even though he had raised that same issue prior to his first trial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 370, 100 A.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In reaching its decision, the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201cno appellate decision has stated that a defendant\u2019s incompetence to stand trial must be raised anew,\u201d but reasoned that <em>Gregg v. State, </em>377 Md. 515, 833 A.2d 1040 (2003) suggested that result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">In that case, the District Court of Maryland ordered a competency evaluation of John Leon Gregg, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>charged with second-degree assault. At the competency hearing that followed, the district court\u2014after reviewing the report prepared by the facility where Gregg had been evaluated, hearing testimony from one of Gregg\u2019s evaluators, and questioning Gregg directly\u2014found Gregg competent to stand trial. Gregg subsequently prayed a jury trial and the case was transferred to the circuit court, where Gregg was tried by a jury and found guilty. He thereafter noted an appeal, contending that the circuit court had a duty to inquire into his competence to stand trial and had erred in failing to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">The Court of Appeals explained that, when Gregg\u2019s case was removed to the circuit court, \u201cthe proceedings properly began anew,\u201d and the circuit court was not bound by the district court\u2019s ruling on \u201cpre-trial matters,\u201d including any prior determination of Gregg\u2019s competence. Since the circuit court trial was a \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d proceeding from the district court trial, the issue of Gregg\u2019s competence to stand trial had to be \u201craised anew in the Circuit Court proceedings,\u201d according to the Court of Appeals, \u201cin order to compel the need for a competency determination.\u201d Because that issue was not raised anew in the circuit court, and because Gregg\u2019s behavior at trial did not trigger any obligation of that court to evaluate his competence <em>sua sponte, </em>the issue of Gregg\u2019s competency \u201cwas not properly before the court,\u201d said the Court of Appeals, and thus the circuit court did not err in failing to address it. As Gregg\u2019s circuit court trial was \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the preceding district court proceeding, so too was Sibug\u2019s new trial \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from his first trial. It, in effect, \u201cwiped the slate clean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 100 A.3d at 1252-53 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Because the issue of Sibug\u2019s competency was not raised pretrial, the Court of Special Appeals asserted that, \u201cthe \u2018only way1 in which the question of competency could have been placed before the circuit court was if Sibug \u2018appear[ed] to the court to be incompetent to stand trial,\u2019 triggering the court\u2019s <em>\u2018sua sponte </em>duty\u2019 to evaluate his competence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>A.3d at 1253, citing <em>Gregg, </em>377 Md. at 545, 833 A.2d at 1058. In assessing what the judge did, our intermediate appellate court relied upon the fact that, \u201c[t]he circuit court, in finding at sentencing that Sibug was competent to stand trial, recalled its observations of Sibug during the trial and concluded that Sibug \u2018seemed to understand exactly what was going on\u2019 during the proceedings. The court\u2019s conclusion is supported by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 100 A.3d at 1253. Thus, \u201c[a]t no time during trial did it appear from the transcript of that proceeding that Sibug did not have the ability to work with his lawyer and to assist in his own defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Our statutory framework addressing capacity to stand trial can be traced back to at least 1826 with the enactment of Chapter 197 of the Maryland Laws, entitled \u201cAn Act relating to Lunatic and Insane Persons.\u201d The Act provided that, \u201cwhere any person shall be indicted for a crime or misdemean- or, and such person sets up, or alleges insanity or lunacy\u201d a jury would determine if \u201csuch person was, at the time of the commission of such offence, or still is, insane, lunatic or otherwise.\u201d 1826 Md. Laws, Chapter 197.

In <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), Robinson was convicted of murder, although his counsel had claimed Robinson was insane at the time of the murder and raised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>issue of Robinson\u2019s competency to stand trial. Without holding a hearing, however, the trial court had rejected these contentions and Robinson was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 86 S.Ct. at 837, 15 L.Ed.2d at 815. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed, determining that \u201cno hearing on mental capacity to stand trial had been requested, that the evidence failed to raise sufficient doubt as to his competence to require the trial court to conduct a hearing on its own motion, and further that the evidence did not raise a \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 as to his sanity at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 86 S.Ct. at 837, 15 L.Ed.2d at 815. Robinson then filed a federal habeas corpus petition, which was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 86 S.Ct. at 837-38, 15 L.Ed.2d at 815. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, however, reversed \u201con the ground that Robinson was convicted in an unduly hurried trial without a fair opportunity to obtain expert psychiatric testimony, and without sufficient development of the facts on the issues of Robinson\u2019s insanity when he committed the homicide and his present incompetence.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 377, 86 S.Ct. at 838, 15 L.Ed.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed, concluding \u201cRobinson was constitutionally entitled to a hearing on the issue of his competence to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 86 S.Ct. at 838, 15 L.Ed.2d at 815-16.

In <em>Dusky v.

State, </em>361 Md. 346, 363-64, 761 A.2d 885, 894-95 (2000).

In <em>Roberts </em>we held \u201cthat when a defendant makes an allegation of incompetency to stand trial and there is <em>no evidence in the record </em>as to the defendant\u2019s incompetency to stand trial, as opposed to a proffer, an accused must be afforded an opportunity to present evidence upon which a valid determination can be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 761 A.2d at 891 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In the present case, the State alleges that Sibug\u2019s claim regarding the needed determination of competency was not \u201cpreserved,\u201d so that it was Sibug\u2019s burden to raise the issue of competency \u201canew,\u201d relying on <em>Gregg, </em>377 Md. 515, 518, 833 A.2d 1040, 1042 (2003), in which we held that a district court\u2019s determination that the defendant was competent did not trigger the circuit court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to evaluate competency when the case was transferred from the district court to the circuit court. <em>Sibug, </em>219 Md.App. at 374, 100 A.3d at 1254. In <em>Gregg, </em>the district court had ordered a competency evaluation of Gregg, in which the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene opined that Gregg was not competent to stand trial. Subsequently, a competency hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>held in which the district court judge questioned Gregg and heard testimony from one of the evaluators who opined that Gregg was then competent to stand trial. Based on the evidence, the district court judge determined Gregg was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">After Gregg requested a jury trial, the case was transferred to the circuit court. The circuit court did not inquire into Gregg\u2019s competency and Gregg was convicted. We concluded that the district court\u2019s findings did not require the circuit court to examine the defendant\u2019s competency <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cbecause that issue was not properly before the court.\u201d 377 Md. at 543, 833 A.2d at 1056-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We reasoned that, \u201c[w]hen a criminal defendant prior to trial in the District Court requests a jury trial, the District Court is divested of its jurisdiction and jurisdiction is then conferred on the circuit court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 833 A.2d at 1056. Thus, the \u201cDistrict Court proceedings conducted to that point were not binding on the circuit court,\u201d and the case began \u201canew.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that under Section 3-101(c) of the Criminal Procedure Article, Maryland Code (2001) \u201cthe \u2018court\u2019 is defined as \u2018a court that has criminal jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 833 A.2d at 1056. Thus, \u201c[w]hen the Circuit Court obtained jurisdiction over Gregg it was not bound by the prior determination of competency made by the District Court and the proceedings properly began anew without any competency determination on the Circuit Court record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The situation in <em>Gregg </em>is inapposite to the situation which presents itself in the instant matter. In the present case, we have one case in one circuit court, albeit with a circuitous history. The Circuit Court\u2019s jurisdiction continued throughout the case without divestment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In addition to <em>Gregg, </em>with respect to the issue beginning \u201cafresh\u201d because of a retrial, the Court of Special Appeals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the State, relied on <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 295, 965 A.2d 912 (2009) and <em>Harrod v. State, </em>428 Md. 24, 31 A.3d 173 (2011) for the proposition that the grant of a new trial \u201cwiped the slate clean\u201d such that the issue of competency must have been raised \u201cafresh.\u201d In <em>Hammersla </em>the State sought an enhanced penalty of life without the possibility of parole after having advised Hammersla of its intent, as required under Section 2-203 of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Hammersla\u2019s conviction was reversed by the Court of Special Appeals, and a new trial was ordered. 184 Md.App. at 309, 965 A.2d at 920. Notice of the State\u2019s intent to seek life without parole, which had not been timely afforded to Hammersla before his second trial, became the b\u00e9te noire of the case. The trial court concluded that the State was not required to refile notice, but the Court of Special Appeals reversed and determined that the notice of intent had to have been timely presented to Hammersla because the retrial \u201c \u2018wiped the slate clean,\u2019 and the case began anew procedurally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 965 A.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Similarly in <em>Harrod, </em>the State had provided Harrod with notice of its intent to seek admission of a chemist\u2019s report, as required by statute, but did not timely afford notice after a new trial was ordered.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We determined that \u201cthe grant of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>new trial after a mistrial creates a \u2018tabula rasa,\u2019 \u201d and the \u201cmistrial revived the State\u2019s obligation.\u201d <em>Harrod, </em>423 Md. at 36, 31 A.3d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In essence what the State is alleging is that what is \u201csauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\u201d because the State\u2019s responsibilities in the latter two cases were revived before retrial, such that Sibug would be required to raise competency afresh before his 2008 trial. The State erroneously assumes that its procedural obligations in <em>Hammersla </em>and <em>Harrod </em>are on the same footing with respect to raising the issue of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The State\u2019s equation is not sound. As recently as <em>Gregg </em>we recognized the constitutional underpinnings of the issue of competency and opined that the obligation with respect to a determination of competency rests with the court and not the defendant. 377 Md. at 526, 833 A.2d at 1047. In <em>Gregg </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">A competency hearing and determination must meet the due process requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See Medina [v.

The State also argues that, \u201c[u]pon receiving the opinion of DHMH in August, 2004, that Sibug was competent to stand trial, and in thereafter repeatedly scheduling and then calling Sibug\u2019s case for trial without opposition, the court necessarily determined that Si-bug was competent to stand trial.\u201d Additionally, the State argues that \u201c[i]n <em>Wood v. State, </em>[436 Md. 276, 81 A.3d 427 (2013) ] this Court addressed a claim identical to that made by Sibug: that the trial court committed a procedural error by failing to make a competency determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We agree with Sibug, but we need not go so far as to embrace that a presumption of incompetency existed as a result of the first adjudication.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Rather, it is sufficient on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>facts before us that the tenets of Section 3-104 were engaged during the retrial in 2008, requiring a determination of competency, because Sibug had been adjudicated incompetent in the same case in the same court.

State, </em>388 P.2d 816, 818 (Alaska 1964), a case close to point and decided even before the Supreme Court decided <em>Pate, </em>the trial court determined Clark to be incompetent to stand trial and had ordered him committed \u201c \u2018until released and certified by competent authority to have sufficient soundness of mind to appreciate the charges against him and to enable him to make a proper defense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>later, a letter from the psychiatrists who had evaluated him opined that Clark \u201cwas competent to make a proper defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clark\u2019s case was set for trial; he was convicted without having a hearing and a judicial determination of competence. <em>Id. </em>at 817-19. On appeal, Clark alleged that the trial court erred in permitting him to be tried without a hearing and judicial determination that he was competent. <em>Id. </em>at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In determining that Clark was entitled to a new trial, the Alaska Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase in Alaska law which stated that, \u201cwhen an accused person is judicially determined to be mentally incompetent, the court may order him to be institutionalized \u2018until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819 citing Section 2 of chapter 104, SLA 1960. In interpreting the statute, the Alaska court ultimately determined that \u201cthe [trial] court erred in permitting Clark to be tried on October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>15,1962, without first affording him a second hearing as to his competency to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 821. In so doing, the court noted that the provisions under investigation were \u201cidentical with those contained in sections 4244 and 4246 of title 18 U.S.C.A. (1951)\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and relied upon federal cases to support its conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">That court in the leading case of <em>Gunther v. United States1 </em><footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] held that, after an accused had been judicially determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>incompetent to stand trial under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4244 and 4246, it was error for the trial court to proceed with his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>without other preliminary than the certificate of the superintendent of the mental hospital to which he had been committed that the accused had recovered his reason, was again of sound mind, and had been discharged from treatment. Explained the court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Section 4244 describes the motion initiating proceedings as \u2018a motion for a <em>judicial determination </em>of * * * mental competency of the accused * * *.\u2019 A judicial finding of mental <em>incompetency, </em>far from discharging the court\u2019s duty in response to such a motion, creates a greater necessity than previously existed for a judicial determination of competency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">If the question were merely whether a mentally incompetent person should be discharged from further hospitalization, it might well be left to the sole judgment of the hospital officials. Indeed, in related sections where that is the question, Congress has entrusted it to administrative officials. But the question here is not merely whether one who has previously been adjudged incompetent shall be discharged from further hospitalization, but, rather, whether such a person is competent to stand trial; in the language of the statute \u2018to understand the proceedings against him or [and] properly to assist in his own defense\u2019. While, of course, expert psychiatric judgment is relevant on this question, it cannot be controlling. Resolution of this issue requires not only a clinical psychiatric judgment but also a judgment based upon a knowledge of criminal trial proceedings that is peculiarly within the competence of the trial judge. That Congress recognized this is borne out by the fact that \u00a7 4246, providing for the commitment of persons found incompetent under \u00a7 4244, withholds the blanket authority to terminate custody which Congress has given to administrative officials where capacity to stand trial is not an issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">Four months later, November 24, 1954, the same court expressed its opinion in the case of <em>Kelley v. United </em>States[ <footnotemark>24</footnotemark>] as to what constitutes a sufficient motion for a judicial determination of competency of an accused to stand trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>after a prior determination of his incompetency and order of commitment for treatment. Kelley, who had been indicted for robbery and pleaded not guilty, was found not competent to stand trial after a court hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4244 and committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital. On February 13, 1953, the superintendent of the hospital certified that Kelly had recovered his reason, was of sound mind and had been discharged that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">Eight months later the case was called for trial. Kelley\u2019s counsel then asked the court, presided over by another judge, to order a re-examination, pointing out to the court the prior commitment and referring to the record from St. Elizabeths of Kelley\u2019s return to sanity and discharge as not conclusive. Counsel also informed the court that he had talked to Kelley for about twenty minutes and felt that he was not prepared to go to trial and that the two doctors who had testified at the prior hearing \u2018will testify even now that the man is insane.\u2019 The court denied the motion and the case went to trial. The court of appeals ruled that the motion was well-founded and should have been granted. In so ruling, the court called attention to the fact that in the Gunther case it had held that even in the absence of any motion a judicial determination of mental competency to stand trial is required when, in circumstances like those in Kelley\u2019s case, there has been an earlier judicial determination of incompetency and no subsequent judicial determination of competency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">Next in line appears the case of <em>Taylor v. United </em>States,[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] in which the court of appeals epitomized the rule first announced in Gunther as follows: \u201cWhen an accused person has been judicially found incompetent to stand trial, it is erroneous to try him until it has been judicially determined that he is competent to stand trial. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">Lastly, in <em>Blunt v. United </em>States[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>] the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit went a step further in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>holding that a judicial determination, still outstanding at the time of an accused\u2019s trial and conviction, that he was incompetent to stand trial, applies equally to every step involved in his prosecution of an appeal from the conviction. The particular circumstances in that case were that Blunt was in prison and without counsel from October 30, 1953, the day he was sentenced, until March 9, 1956, when the appellate court granted his motion to appeal in forma pauperis and appointed counsel for him. Although the Government argued that the appellate court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter because Blunt had abandoned his appeal by doing nothing for more than two years towards pursuing the appeal, the court concluded for reasons explained in its opinion that he had made timely efforts to pursue his appeal. Said the court in a marginal footnote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">We need not go so far as to say that any actual notice to him [that the trial court had denied his request that he be furnished a stenographic transcript at Government expense] could have had no legal effect. For present purposes, it is enough to say that until there has been a judicial determination of restored competency, one who has been judicially determined to be incompetent is\u2014at least pilma facie\u2014legally incapable of making the choices involved in such processes as abandonment, waiver or consent. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">We find the foregoing federal decisions to be based upon sound reasoning and regard them as persuasive because they construe statutes identical with those of Alaska on the question here presented. We conclude that the court erred in permitting Clark to be tried on October 15, 1962, without first affording him a second hearing as to his competency to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 819-21 (internal footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The Alaska statute in <em>Clark </em>was similar to the federal statute, which described \u201ca <em>judicial determination </em>of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>competency\u201d and a hearing where the court was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cmake a finding with respect thereto\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4244 (1951) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Alaska Code, Chapter 104, SLA 1960. Our statute which provides that \u201cthe <em>court </em>shall determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial,\u201d Md.Code Ann., Crim. Pro. \u00a7 3-104(a) (emphasis added), is also similar. If anything, our statute has greater clarity in the need for a judicial determination of competency, such that, we already have stated that \u201cit is strikingly obvious that the Legislature envisioned a need for a Court determination of competency.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>361 Md. at 363, 761 A.2d at 894-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In 1999, the trial court found Sibug incompetent. Subsequently, psychiatrists wrote that he was competent, but no court ever found him competent again until after his 2008 trial. Because the responsibility for a competence determination lies with the court, Sibug was still under the previous finding of incompetence at the time of his 2008 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">A determination made by a psychiatrist is not sufficient; delegation by the court of its constitutional responsibility is not acceptable. <em>See In re: Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 782 A.2d 332 (2001) (\u201cWhile determinations concerning visitation are generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, not to be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion, where a trial court\u2019s order constitutes an improper delegation of judicial authority to a non-judicial agency or person, the trial court has committed an error of law\u201d.). Therefore, there needed to be a subsequent adjudication of competency once Sibug was determined to be incompetent in the same case, in the same court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The State, however, argues that there was no need for a judicial determination of competency \u201c[i]n light of the numerous proceedings conducted after [Sibug] was determined to be competent to stand trial\u201d. The State also asserts, in the alternative, that the continued proceedings since 2004 leads to the conclusion that \u201cthe court necessarily determined that Sibug was competent to stand trial.\u201d Competence to stand trial is dependent upon when a proceeding occurs and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>factors, such as medication administration, among others, which necessitates an explicit judicial determination when the issue is in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The State further urges that our decision in <em>Wood, </em>436 Md. at 276, 81 A.3d at 427, undercuts the necessity of a judicial determination of competency. In that case, Wood\u2019s counsel had requested, pretrial, an evaluation of competence, which the court granted, but Wood refused to meet with the evaluating doctor. At a subsequent pretrial hearing, when Wood\u2019s attorney withdrew his request for the competency evaluation, the trial court then considered the competency issue moot; Wood was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Before us, Wood argued he should not have been allowed to withdraw his request for a competency evaluation and that the trial court should have made a competency determination on the record. We disagreed. We determined that, \u201c[t]he withdrawal of Petitioner\u2019s request for an evaluation, under the circumstances, rendered the issue of competency moot\u201d in part because the trial judge could give \u201ccredence to the fact that Petitioner\u2019s counsel ultimately withdrew his request for a competency evaluation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 81 A.3d at 435. We also held that though the judge had a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to evaluate Wood\u2019s competency \u201cif there was a bona fide doubt created by evidence on the record\u201d there was not sufficient evidence on the record to establish such a duty. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 81 A.3d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\"><em>Wood, </em>contrary to what the State asserts, does not support its contention that a determination of competency in the present case was not required. Wood, rather, supports our decision in the present case that not only was a competency determination required, but that the judge clearly erred in determining at sentencing that Sibug was competent. Unlike in <em>Wood, </em>Sibug\u2019s testimony at trial upon which the trial court relied in making its post hoc evaluation of Sibug\u2019s competency, clearly reflected the same belief system on Sibug\u2019s part that led the Department to repeatedly opine that Sibug was incompetent, prior to the time he was forcibly or voluntarily medicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>At trial, Sibug described his children from his previous marriage as \u201cwicked\u201d as opposed to his other \u201crighteous\u201d children, and further described them as \u201cgoat like human being\u201d and \u201cthe Devil.\u201d He further testified that, after praying to God for assistance, God spoke to him and he did \u201cjust like what Abraham did in Genesis 22:1-18. Abraham used a dagger but God tested his faith, and it make him subdued to his Father.\u201d Sibug answered questions using Biblical references rather than responding to the questions, to the point that Sibug\u2019s counsel requested to lead:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">He has never told me what has done with the gun. He has been dancing around this issue for a long time. He needs to tell them that he did take the gun out and what he did with that gun when he took it out; otherwise, Your Honor, we\u2019re going to hear about Jacob, Isaac, Saul and down the line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akk\">Sibug\u2019s testimony at trial mirrors what Sibug had stated to the Department when on numerous occasions the Department had opined that he was incompetent. Additionally, the letter that Sibug tendered to the trial court at sentencing contained much of the same references that heretofore had fueled a determination of incompetency. In the letter, Sibug referred to his son as \u201cthe Devil\u201d and maintained that he \u201cwas maliciously persecuted and convicted as a Criminal in Man\u2019s law by obeying Jehovah God\u2019s law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In 1999 Sibug told his evaluators that \u201cMy defense would be based on righteousness and the right to practice godly personal values.\u201d Based on Sibug\u2019s behavior and responses, the Department sent a letter to the court stating that while Sibug had \u201ca factual understanding of the court system\u201d he suffered from \u201creligious delusions\u201d and could not \u201cseparate man-made law from \u2018God\u2019s moral law.\u2019 \u201d As a result, he intended \u201cto use a legal defense based upon Biblical scripture and \u2018God\u2019s truth\u2019 rather than developing evidence to contest the facts of the case.\u201d Again, the same beliefs led the Department to opine in 1999 that Sibug was not competent to stand trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">The characterization of the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs as delusional does not indicate that the beliefs themselves are false; but rather, it indicates that the defendant\u2019s attribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>tion of religion to his situation is false. His beliefs reflect both paranoia and grandiosity. The defendant believes that his legal case is more than a criminal prosecution. He is convinced that his legal case involves the eternal struggle between the forces of Satan and God. He believes that his case is \u201cGod\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">After the evaluation was sent to the court, the Circuit Court determined that Sibug was not competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Additionally, in 2000, the Department opined that Sibug\u2019s condition \u201cdeteriorated\u201d based upon the fact that \u201c[w]hen asked about his role in the alleged offenses, he answered with a litany of Biblical scriptures. When directed to answer in his own words, he became agitated and spewed forth more scripture.\u201d A later report from the Department in 2001 further indicated, \u201c[e]ven though religious reasons for making decisions in life are valid, it is important to note that, in this case, Mr. Sibug\u2019s religious arguments are fueled by his underlying delusional disorder. Because his decision-making regarding his case was firmly rooted within his fixed, non-bizarre delusion it was impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Juxtaposing these recitations of Sibug\u2019s belief system with those that led to prior evaluations of incompetency yields to the conclusion that the judge clearly erred in finding Sibug competent to stand trial. While Sibug may not have exhibited the same constellation of behaviors as exhibited by Trimble in <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 582 A.2d 794 (1990), nor by Thanos in <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 622 A.2d 727 (1993) <em>(Thanos I); Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 576, 625 A.2d 932 (1993) <em>(Thanos II), </em>Sibug\u2019s repeated beliefs should have flagged a concern about incompetency such that the judges determination at sentencing that Sibug was competent was clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In conclusion, under Section 3-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol), the court was required to make a determination upon retrial whether Sibug was competent to stand trial and clearly erred in determining at sentencing that Sibug was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL WHEN COMPETENCY IS FOUND; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">ADKINS and WATTS, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">.

The court stated that \u201c[tjhis was, of course, the statute Congress adopted for the explicit purpose of altering our holding in <em>Gunther.\u201d Id. </em>at 815. Because of the change in the statutory climate after <em>Gunther </em>was decided the court opined that a judicial determination of competency in <em>Whalem </em>was not necessary: \"In enacting the 1955 amendments to \u00a7 301 Congress, as we read the statute, <em>specifically overruled </em>that much of the <em>Gunther </em>and <em>Contee </em>cases which held that an accused could not be ordered to trial on the basis of the certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of the accused\u2019s competency to stand trial by the superintendent of the mental institution wherein the accused has been examined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In <em>Whalem </em>the defendant had been civilly committed to a psychiatric hospital and committed several crimes while on \"convalescent leave\u201d from the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 814. After his arrest, Whalem filed a motion for a mental examination, which was granted, and the reporting psychiatrist opined that Whalem was competent. <em>Id. </em>Whalem then moved for a further evaluation, which was granted, and the second report also stated that he was competent. <em>Id. </em>After receiving the reports he did not object or request a hearing. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Whalem argued that the court erred in not holding a hearing to determine his competency to stand trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The court noted that the statute was silent on what a court must do after reports generated as the result of a court order for a mental examination state the defendant is competent to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that if the report opines that the defendant is not competent to stand trial, then, under Section 24-301(a) of the D.C.Code, \" '[sjuch report shall be sufficient to authorize the court to commit by order the accused to a hospital for the mentally ill unless the accused or the Government objects, in which event, the court, after hearing without a jury, shall make a judicial determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814-15. Furthermore, if the defendant is then committed, Section 24-301(b) of the D.C.Code then addressed what a court must do if the superintendent of the hospital states that the defendant has been restored to competency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak1O\">The superintendent shall certify such fact to the clerk of the court * * * and such certification shall be sufficient to authorize the court to enter an order thereon adjudicating him to be competent to stand trial, unless the accused or the Government objects, in which event, the court, after hearing without a jury, shall make a judicial determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 815.

Op. at 305, 126 A.3d at 109 (footnote omitted). In framing the issue and disagreeing with the persuasive opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, the Majority accords little to no significance to critical facts\u2014namely, in 2004, Sibug entered a plea of not guilty on an agreed statement of facts as to one count of second-degree assault, and was found guilty; and, at the time, Sibug did not raise any issue as to competency. Sibug was sentenced to four-and-a-half years of imprisonment with credit for time served, and, as a result, was immediately released from custody. Thereafter, Sibug did not file a motion for new trial, appeal, or raise any collateral challenge to the conviction on the ground that he had been incompetent to stand trial. Instead, Sibug filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in which he alleged that his trial counsel had failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his conviction for second-degree assault. And, in 2005, the circuit court granted the petition for a writ of error coram nobis and granted Sibug a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In the intervening time period, for over three years, before his September 10, 2008 trial, Sibug never contended, pled, or raised in any manner that he was not competent to stand trial. In short, the issue of competency was not before the circuit court at Sibug\u2019s 2008 trial, and was never before the circuit court until Sibug raised the issue in a motion for a new trial prior to sentencing. In raising the issue, Sibug\u2019s counsel apparently did not assert that the issue remained ripe, as, in the motion for a new trial, Sibug\u2019s counsel stated that, \u201cin retrospect[,]\u201d he then believed that Sibug had not been competent to stand trial. The circuit court properly denied the after-the-fact motion and found that Sibug had indeed been competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The Court of Special Appeals correctly stated that there are three ways in which a trial court\u2019s duty to determine a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>criminal defendant\u2019s competence may be triggered\u2014\u201cupon the motion of the defendant, upon the motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel, or upon a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the [trial] court that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial[,]\u201d <em>Sibug, </em>219 Md.App. at 369, 100 A.3d at 1251 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014and that none of these occurred in this case before or during trial, <em>id. </em>at 371-72, 100 A.3d at 1253. To adopt the Majority\u2019s reasoning in this case is to conclude that an allegation of incompetence raised in 1999, not pursued in a not guilty agreed statement of facts and sentencing proceeding in 2004, nor in a petition for a writ of error coram nobis and the granting of a new trial on another ground in 2005, somehow remained ripe under CP \u00a7\u00a7 3-101 to 3-123, and that the circuit court was required to adjudicate the matter, without any request by Sibug, before his 2008 trial. In complete agreement with the Court of Special Appeals, for reasons upon which I cannot much improve, I would not so conclude.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As stated by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Sibug, </em>219 Md.App. at 370, 100 A.3d at 1252:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Given that the reversal of a conviction \u201cwith an order for a new trial, \u2018wipe[s] the slate clean,\u2019 and the case [begins] anew proeedurally,\u201d returning the case to the stage where \u201cany pretrial motions could be filed and resolved,\u201d <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 295, 313-14, 965 A.2d 912[, 923, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 Md. 49, 972 A.2d 862] (2009), it was incumbent upon Sibug, or his counsel, to raise the issue of incompetency anew. <em>Cf. Harrod v. State, </em>423 Md. 24, 34-36, 31 A.3d 173[, 179-80] (2011) (explaining that the grant of a mistrial, like the grant of a new trial, \u201crequires the litigants to observe pretrial procedures once again,\u201d including the State\u2019s obligation to give notice of its intent to introduce a chemist\u2019s report[,] even though the same report had been introduced at the first trial); <em>Marshall v. State, </em>213 Md. App. 532, 550-54, 74 A.3d 831[, 841-43, <em>cert. denied, </em>436 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>329, 81 A.3d 458] (2013) (concluding that the grant of a new trial \u201ceffectively wipe[d] out the prior proceedings\u201d and required the defendant to allege at his second trial that the Maryland gang statute was unconstitutional,] even though he had raised that same issue prior to his first trial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1OX\">(Some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">As to the circuit court\u2019s obligation to raise the issue of competency based on Sibug\u2019s conduct at trial, the circuit court did not err in refraining from independently raising whether Sibug was competent to stand trial; it is undisputed that neither Sibug nor his counsel alleged incompetence to stand trial, and the record does not demonstrate that Sibug appeared to be incompetent to stand trial. Nothing in the record indicates that Sibug failed to observe proper courtroom behavior <em>(e.g., </em>by standing up, shouting, or moving around inappropriately). To the contrary, Sibug acted properly at trial; he elected to testify, and answered questions from his counsel and the prosecutor. It is accurate that, as noted by the Majority, Sibug referenced the Bible several times while testifying, prompting his counsel to ask the circuit court for permission to lead Sibug. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 316-17, 126 A.3d at 117. That said, Sibug\u2019s counsel eventually elicited the testimony that he had been seeking <em>(ie., </em>that Sibug displayed a gun to his children, but did not point it at them), and Sibug\u2019s references to the Bible in no way demonstrated that Sibug was \u201cnot able: (1) to understand the nature or object of the proceeding; or (2) to assist in [his] defense.\u201d CP \u00a7 3\u2014101(f) (paragraph breaks omitted). On this record, I would not conclude that the circuit court erred in refraining from raising Sibug\u2019s competency <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent, as I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Judge Adkins has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\">. Likewise, I would conclude that the circuit court did not err in holding a hearing on the issue of Sibug\u2019s competence after the trial\u2019s conclusion, even though the circuit court was not required to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
