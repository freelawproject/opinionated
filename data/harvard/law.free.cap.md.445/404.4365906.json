Inst. (1980, 2011 RepLVol.) (\u201cFI\u201d) l^lMffi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">We decide: (I) whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for theft, and whether an individual can commit theft from a joint or multiple-party bank account to which the individual is a party; and (II) whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">We hold that: (I) the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for theft where the individual willfully or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over funds\u2014belonging to another\u2014contained in a joint bank account without the other\u2019s knowledge or consent and with the intent to deprive the other of those funds; statutorily granted authority permitting a party to a joint or multiple-party account to access and withdraw funds in the account does not confer ownership of the funds in the account to that party such that, as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>law, the party cannot be guilty of theft; and (II) the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">On February 14, 2013, the State, Respondent, charged Jacqueline Wagner (\u2018Wagner\u201d), Petitioner, with theft of property with a value of at least $500<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary). On October 17 and 18, 2013, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) conducted a bench trial, at which the following evidence was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">As a witness for the State, Marion Wagner (\u201cFather\u201d), who was eighty-four years old at the time of trial, testified as follows. Father had three daughters, including Wagner. For most of his life, Father lived in a row house on South Curley Street in Baltimore City with his wife, Jean, who died in 2005. While Jean was alive, she handled the family finances because \u201c[s]he was very good with figures[.]\u201d After Jean\u2019s death, Father handled his own finances for a short period of time before asking Wagner to assist him. At that time, Father had an individual retirement account (\u201cthe IRA\u201d) with American Century Investments containing nearly $200,000, and a checking account and a savings account (collectively, \u201cthe Account\u201d) with Provident Bank containing \u201ca few thousand\u201d dollars.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Father also received a monthly pension check in the amount of $88 and income from the Social Security Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On July 29, 2005, Father added Wagner to the Account as a \u201cjoint owner.\u201d At trial, as to that event, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Now, 2005, you indicated that you put [] Wagner on your account. Why did that happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlG\">[FATHER]: That happened because I had my bank account with my wife\u2019s name on it[,] but[,] since she passed away, I wanted somebody else to be able to get the money if I couldn\u2019t get it myself. So I asked [Wagner] if I could put her name on the account[,] and this is my money in there, but not hers, and she agreed to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, what specific instructions did you give her about putting your, her name on your account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azd\">[FATHER]: The only reason I did that was in order for me to get my money out if I couldn\u2019t go get it, would she be able to get it for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">[FATHER]: That was my money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Father retained the checkbook for the Account, and \u201cnever knew [that he] had\u201d an ATM card. Father did not let anybody else have the checkbook for the Account except when he gave it to Wagner on one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">In 2006, Father mortgaged his house for $87,000,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and loaned the proceeds to Wagner to help with Wagner\u2019s business of transporting people to and from bingo halls.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Father expected Wagner to \u201cpay [the loan] back completely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>In January 2007, after his house was damaged by a fire, Father moved into Wagner\u2019s home in Baltimore County. Father received $40,000 from his insurance company to pay for the cost of repairs to his house.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Father put Wagner in charge of the repairs and instructed \u201cher to do whatever she want[ed] to get the house in shape\u201d and \u201cto pay the contractor whatever [s]he ha[d] to pay.\u201d In 2009, the repairs to Father\u2019s house were finished. Wagner \u201ctalked [Father] into letting [his] granddaughter and her boyfriend [ ] move into [Father\u2019s] house\u201d; as a result, Father kept living with Wagner. In late 2009, Wagner told Father that he needed to move out, so he moved out of Wagner\u2019s house and moved in with one of his other daughters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Before moving out of Wagner\u2019s house, Father received a statement from his bank informing him that the mortgage on his house had not been paid; the bank threatened to initiate foreclosure proceedings. After receiving the statement, Father telephoned his bank and discovered that the mortgage had not been paid and that he owed his bank $60,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When he asked the bank about the amount of funds in the Account, Father \u201cwas astonished to find out that it was nothing.\u201d The money in the IRA and the Account was missing. For several months thereafter, Father requested and reviewed copies of his bank records to find out what had happened to the funds in the Account and the IRA. In 2010, Father went to a Commissioner Station of the District Court of Maryland and filed a complaint against Wagner.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Father had not authorized Wagner to transfer funds from the IRA to the Account, make numerous ATM and cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>withdrawals from the Account, or transfer funds from the Account to Wagner\u2019s personal checking account<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or the bank accounts of companies (KLMJ Inc. and Smythe Transportation) that Wagner owned.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Father did not know the full extent of the withdrawals and transfers until he started reviewing his bank records.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">As a witness for the State, Detective Deborah Chenoweth (\u201cDetective Chenoweth\u201d) of the Baltimore County Police Department testified that she was assigned to investigate the matter, and that her investigation revealed that, from December 9, 2005, to October 13, 2009, $181,670.09 was transferred from the IRA to the Account,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and $251,645.83 was taken from the Account through ATM withdrawals, cash withdrawals, and wire transfers to Wagner\u2019s personal checking account and the bank accounts of companies that Wagner owned. In other words, funds would be transferred from the IRA to the Account, and thereafter would be withdrawn by ATM or cash or transferred by wire from the Account to Wagner\u2019s personal checking account or the bank accounts of companies that Wagner owned. The circuit court admitted into evidence a Provident Bank signature card, which was dated July 29, 2005, identified the Account, and listed Father as the \u201cPrimary Owner.\u201d The signature card\u2019s middle section contains Father\u2019s and Wagner\u2019s signatures and Social Security numbers, and labels each of Father and Wagner as a \u201cJoint Owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>On her own behalf, Wagner testified as follows. Wagner was \u201cput on [the A]ccount in ease anything happened to\u201d Father. Wagner put money into the Account, but she had \u201c[n]o idea\u201d how much. Wagner sometimes gave Father money out of her personal checking account (which was a joint account with Father) and sometimes transferred money between the Account and her personal checking account. Father received his bank statement every month and balanced his checkbook, so Father knew exactly \u201cwhat he had\u201d and \u201cwhat he was using and spending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">As to the IRA, originally, Father withdrew funds from the IRA by mailing a form; Father would then receive in the mail a check, which he would deposit. After Father began living with Wagner, Father informed her that he did not want to deal with \u201ceveryday things,\u201d including money, so he authorized her to handle telephonic withdrawals from the IRA. Wagner was required to fax a form confirming any telephonic withdrawal; after the form was processed, money from the IRA was deposited into the Account. Wagner did not take any money out of the IRA without Father\u2019s authorization because it was \u201chis money.\u201d Wagner did not sign Father\u2019s name on the requests for withdrawals from the IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">All of the money taken out of the Account was at Father\u2019s request. Father always used cash and never had a credit card or a debit card. Wagner never took money from the Account or the IRA for her own benefit or without Father\u2019s authorization. Wagner acknowledged that the money deposited into the Account was Father\u2019s money, and that her \u201cmoney was kept separate from [Father\u2019s] money.\u201d Father gave Wagner the proceeds of the $87,000 mortgage \u201cas a gift[,]\u201d but Wagner paid the mortgage when she had \u201cextra money[.]\u201d Wagner failed to pay the general contractor for the work on Father\u2019s house. When asked whether she gave Father $200,000 over the course of three years to \u201close at the casinos[,]\u201d Wagner testified \u201c[p]ossibly\u201d and explained: \u201cIt\u2019s [Father\u2019s] money. He wanted it, he got it, he did what he wanted with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>At the conclusion of the bench trial, the circuit court found that Wagner took funds from the Account, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW2\">I have absolutely no question in my mind, none, that [Wagner] took and used the money in [the A]ccount ... for her own purposes. I am truly well beyond hav[ing] a reasonable doubt. I have no doubt. I reject factually as strongly as I can that [Wagner] withdrew funds at [Father\u2019s request and that that money was lost gambling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afq\">After issuing its factual findings, the circuit court observed that the case presented a legal, not factual, question. Specifically, the circuit court stated: \u201cI really think factually there\u2019s no question about what happened. I think it\u2019s much more of a legal question----I have, frankly, spent the majority of my time[ ] trying to figure out what is, what are the consequences or ramifications of a joint account.\u201d As to legal conclusions, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">[T]here is, in fact, a rebuttable presumption. There\u2019s a difference between ownership and ability to withdraw[,] and one starts with the presumption that[,] in a case where there\u2019s joint ownership with a right of survivorship, which is created by the titling of the account, that it\u2019s joint owners. But it can be rebutted and the burden is on the person who wants to rebut it.... I\u2019m reading to you from <em>Haller v. White, </em>[228 Md. 505, 510, 180 A.2d 689, 692 (1962), <em>superseded by, </em>Md.Code Ann., Fin. Inst. (1980, 2011 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 1-204] it says we think the most significant fact is the form of the account, which on its faces creates a joint tenancy. It is true that this raises only a rebuttable presumption[,] but the burden is upon the party seeking to rebut it. In [ ] <em>Stanley [v. Stanley, </em>175 Md.App. 246, 262, 927 A.2d 40, 50, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>402 Md. 36, 935 A.2d 406 (2007) ], the common law presumption of joint ownership with the right of survivorship created by the titling of the bank account as joint can be overcome by evidence that the owner\u2019s intent was not to create such rights in the titleholder. I have really struggled, I make no bones about it, over this issue of [\u201c]ean you actually have a situation where there\u2019s theft when the titling is joint owners[?\u201d,] and I come down on the side that you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>can[,] and that is because I am persuaded that[,] even if one starts with this presumption that it\u2019s joint owners, it can be rebutted[,] and I have found in this case, as I said, ... it\u2019s not beyond a reasonable doubt, it is beyond all doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The circuit court found Wagner guilty of both theft of property with a value of at least $500 and embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On October 21, 2013, the circuit court sentenced Wagner to eight years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but eighteen months suspended, for theft of property with a value of at least $500, followed by five years\u2019 supervised probation; the circuit court also ordered Wagner to pay $122,355 in restitution to Father.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For sentencing purposes, the conviction for embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary) merged with the conviction for theft of property with a value of at least $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Wagner appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>See Wagner v. State, </em>220 Md.App. 174, 194, 102 A.3d 900, 912 (2014). Wagner filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Wagner v. State, </em>441 Md. 666, 109 A.3d 665 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Maryland Rule 8-131(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>In <em>Goff v. State, </em>387 Md. 327, 338, 875 A.2d 132, 138-39 (2005), we further explained the standard of review under Maryland Rule 8-131(c), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">The deference shown to the trial court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard does not, of course, apply to legal conclusions. When the trial court\u2019s decision involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, [this] Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">We will not disturb the judgment on the facts, however, unless the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. If there is any competent evidence to support the factual findings of the trial court, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">(Citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">As to sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he standard for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the [State], any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664, 668 (2003) (citations omitted). In so evaluating, \u201c[w]e do not re-weigh the evidence, but we do determine whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could convince a rational trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534, 823 A.2d at 668 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Because the issue in this case involves statutory interpretation, we set forth the pertinent rules of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the [General Assembly].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">As this Court has explained, [t]o determine that purpose or policy, we look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning. We do so on the tacit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>theory that the [General Assembly] is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant. When the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the [General Assembly]\u2019s intent. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, [w]e neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words [that] the [General Assembly] used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning. If there is no ambiguity in th[e] language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">If the language of the statute is ambiguous, however, then courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives[,] and [the] purpose of [the] enactment [under consideration]. We have said that there is an ambiguity within [a] statute when there exist[ ] two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. When a statute can be interpreted in more than one way, the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">If the true legislative intent cannot be readily determined from the statutory language alone, however, we may, and often must, resort to other recognized indicia\u2014among other things, the structure of the statute, including its title; how the statute relates to other laws; the legislative history, including the derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it; the general purpose behind the statute; and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>In construing a statute, [w]e avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which is appears. As this Court has stated, [bjecause it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\"><em>Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 661-63, 911 A.2d 1245, 1249-50 (2006) (citations, internal quotation marks, and paragraph break omitted) (some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Wagner contends that, as a matter of law, absent language in an account agreement restricting a person\u2019s use of funds, a person cannot be guilty of theft from a joint or multiple-party bank account if the person is a party to the bank account. Wagner argues that, because she was a party to the Account, she was an owner of the funds in the Account and had the right to withdraw funds from the Account, and accordingly could not be guilty of stealing her own property. Indeed, Wagner asserts that, under FI \u00a7 l-204(f), she had full authority to exert control over the funds in the Account as a party to the Account, and her ability to legally withdraw funds from the Account constituted an ownership interest in those funds. Wagner maintains that because she was a party to the Account, \u201c[tjhere was no restriction on her withdrawal of funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyN\">The State responds that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction for theft because Wagner withdrew funds from the Account without Father\u2019s authorization and used them for her benefit, not Father\u2019s. Indeed, the State contends that Wagner \u201cplainly committed theft\u201d because she took funds from the Account for her own use and without Father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>authorization. The State argues that FI \u00a7 1-204 does not shield Wagner from criminal liability for her unauthorized taking and use of Father\u2019s funds because FI \u00a7 1-204 concerns account access, not account ownership. The State asserts that FI \u00a7 l-204(f) does not confer ownership of an account, but instead provides authorization to withdraw funds from an account absent some other agreement between the financial institution and the parties to the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cCR\u201d) \u00a7 7-104(a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">A person may not willfully or knowingly obtain or exert unauthorized control over property, if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">(1) intends to deprive the owner of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">(2) willfully or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">(3) uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing the use, concealment, or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">For purposes of the theft statute, CR \u00a7 7-101 (h) defines \u201cowner\u201d as \u201ca person, other than the offender: (1) who has an interest in or possession of property regardless of whether the person\u2019s interest or possession is unlawful; and (2) without whose consent the offender has no authority to exert control over the property.\u201d (Paragraph breaks omitted). CR \u00a7 7-101(j) defines \u201cproperty of another\u201d as \u201cproperty in which a person other than the offender has an interest that the offender does not have the authority to defeat or impair, even though the offender also may have an interest in the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Here, we hold that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the conviction for theft. As of 2005, the IRA contained nearly $200,000, and the Account contained \u201ca few thousand\u201d dollars. On July 29, 2005, Father added Wagner to the Account as a \u201cjoint owner.\u201d Between December 2005 and October 2009, $181,670.09 was transferred from the IRA to the Account. During that same time, $251,645.83 was taken from the Account through ATM withdrawals, cash withdrawals, and wire transfers to Wagner\u2019s personal checking account and the bank accounts of companies that Wagner owned.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Father testified that he did not authorize Wagner to transfer funds from the IRA to the Account, make numerous ATM and cash withdrawals, or transfer funds from the Account to Wagner\u2019s personal checking account or the bank accounts of companies that Wagner owned. Indeed, Father testified that he did not know the full extent of the withdrawals and transfers until he started reviewing his bank records after moving out of Wagner\u2019s house. Put simply, the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support the circuit court\u2019s finding that Wagner \u201ctook and used the money in [the Account] for her own purposes\u201d and did so without Father\u2019s knowledge or authorization. In other words, Wagner willfully or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the funds in the IRA and the Account with the intent to deprive the owner (Father) of those funds in violation of CR \u00a7 7-104(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Significantly, Wagner does not dispute in any meaningful way the circuit court\u2019s factual findings that: (1) Father added Wagner to the Account to allow Wagner to access the funds in the Account if something happened to Father or for Father\u2019s benefit; (2) Wagner understood that the money in the Account belonged to Father; and (3) Wagner withdrew funds from the Account and used them for her own purposes. Indeed, rather than attacking the evidentiary basis for the conviction for theft of property with a value of at least $500, Wagner relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>exclusively on FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) to contend that, as a party to the Account, she was an owner of the funds in the Account and had the legal authority to access the Account and exercise control over the funds, such that she could not be convicted of stealing her own property. We disagree. Stated simply, FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) does not mention, let alone implicate, the ownership rights among living parties to a joint or multiple-party account; instead, FI \u00a7 l-204(f) provides that a party to a joint or multiple-party account may access and withdraw funds in the account. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">FI \u00a7 l-204(f) provides, in its entirety: \u201cUnless the account agreement expressly provides otherwise, the funds in a multiple-party account may be withdrawn by any party or by a convenience person for any party or parties, whether or not any other party to the account is incapacitated or deceased.\u201d FI \u00a7 l-204(b)(5) defines a \u201cconvenience person\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">[A]ny person who is authorized to draw upon funds in an account: (i) Under a power of attorney given by 1 or more parties to the account; or (ii) By virtue of a designation in the account agreement appointing that person as agent of a party or the parties to the account for the convenience of the party or parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">(Paragraph breaks omitted). By its plain language, FI \u00a7 1-204(f) simply grants a party or a convenience person to a joint or multiple-party account the authority to access the account and withdraw funds, absent language in the account agreement expressly providing otherwise; FI \u00a7 l-204(f) does not confer ownership of the funds in the account to the party or the convenience person. Indeed, FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) does not delineate or detail the relationship among the parties to a multiple-party account; instead, FI \u00a7 1-204(0 concerns the relationship between the parties to a multiple-party account and the financial institution where the account is held, as memorialized in an account agreement between the financial institution and the parties to the multiple-party account.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In short, the issue is whether a party authorized to withdraw under FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) is an \u201cowner\u201d of the property as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>defined by CR \u00a7 Y\u2014101(h)(1) and (2). In other words, does having the ability to withdraw funds pursuant to FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) create an interest in or give ownership of the property to a party to the account? We conclude that FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) does not create an interest in property or give ownership of property to the party authorized to withdraw. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\u201cInterest\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201c[a] legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property!)]\u201d). By its plain language, FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) authorizes only the act of withdrawal from a multiple-party account, nothing more and nothing less. The ordinary meaning of the term \u201cwithdrawal\u201d (the noun form of the verb \u201cwithdrawn\u201d in FI \u00a7 l-204(f)) does not convey or suggest that an individual who engages in a withdrawal expressly or impliedly becomes an owner of the withdrawn funds. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\u201cWithdrawal\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201c[t]he removal of money from a depository!!,]\u201d e.g., \u201cwithdrawal of funds from the checking account!)]\u201d); Withdrawal, Merriam-Webster (2015), http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/withdrawal [https://perma.cc//YLU4-CGNJ] (\u201cWithdrawal\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201cremoval from a place of deposit or investment^]\u201d). Nothing in FI \u00a7 l-204(f) uses the term \u201cownership\u201d or a synonym; nor does FI \u00a7 l-204(f) contain any terms concerning ownership of the funds that may be withdrawn from a multiple-party account. In short, FI \u00a7 l-204(f)\u2019s plain language says nothing about the ownership interests, or lack thereof, of those individuals who are authorized to make withdrawals from a multiple-party account. As such, equating the authority to withdraw with ownership strains the clear language of FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) beyond recognition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>A review of FI \u00a7 1-204\u2019s legislative history does not change the result or alter the plain meaning of FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f). Indeed, FI \u00a7 1-204\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that the General Assembly enacted FI \u00a7 1-204 to repeal the rules as to gift and trust that formerly governed the joint or multiple-party accounts of deceased individuals. In 1992, the General Assembly passed House Bill 956 (which became, among other statutes, FI \u00a7 1-204), for the purpose of, among other things, \u201cauthorizing certain persons to withdraw funds in a multiple-party account under certain circumstances[,]\u201d \u201cproviding that financial institutions may make payments from multiple-party accounts to certain persons without liability under certain circumstances[,]\u201d and \u201cproviding for the effect of [FI \u00a7 1-204] on common law[.]\u201d 1992 Md. Laws 3498 (Ch. 578, H.B. 956). Indeed, in an uncodified section of FI \u00a7 1-204, the General Assembly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">[FI \u00a7 1-204] is intended to alter the common law, including <em>Whalen v.

Whalen, </em>89 Md. 212, 43 A. 43 (1899) and their progeny, as it applies to all deposit accounts in financial institutions that are established in the name of one or more parties, whether or not in trust, or with survivorship rights, or with payable on death rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">1992 Md. Laws 3498, 3507 (Ch. 578, H.B.956).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Before continuing with our review of FI \u00a7 1-204\u2019s legislative history and, specifically, House Bill 956\u2019s file, we pause to provide context concerning the common law that was intended to be altered by FI \u00a7 1-204. The common law at issue developed through cases concerning \u201ccontests] between those claiming as co-owners or as surviving owner of a bank or building association account[.]\u201d <em>Jones v. Hamilton, </em>211 Md. 371, 380, 127 A.2d 519, 526 (1956). The first of these cases were <em>Whalen v. Milholland, </em>89 Md. 199, 200, 43 A. 45, 46 (1899) <em>(\u201cMilholland I\u201d) </em>and <em>Milholland v. Whalen, </em>89 Md. 212, 212-13, 43 A. 43, 43 (1899) <em>(\u2018Milholland II\u201d), </em>both of which involved bank accounts opened by Elizabeth O\u2019Neill (\u201cO\u2019Neill\u201d) and the contest between O\u2019Neill\u2019s sister, Mary Whalen (\u201cWhalen\u201d), and the executor of O\u2019Neill\u2019s estate, Ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>thur V. Milholland (\u201cMilholland\u201d), as to who was entitled to the funds in the accounts after O\u2019Neill died. In <em>Milholland I, </em>89 Md. at 200, 43 A. at 46, O\u2019Neill opened a bank account at the Savings Bank of Baltimore titled as follows: \u201cElizabeth O\u2019Neill and Mary Whalen. Joint owners. Payable to the order of either, or the survivor\u201d; the words \u201cjoint owners\u201d were not originally on the form, but were stamped on later. In <em>Milholland II, </em>89 Md. at 212-13, 43 A. at 43, O\u2019Neill opened a bank account at Metropolitan Savings Bank titled as follows: \u201cMetropolitan Savings Bank, in account with Miss Elizabeth O\u2019Neill. In trust for herself and Mrs. Mary Whalen, widow, joint owners, subject to the order of either; the balance at the death of either to belong to the survivor.\u201d The titling of the account at Metropolitan Savings Bank \u201cwas made at the instance and upon the request of [] O\u2019Neill\u201d and embodied the instructions that O\u2019Neill gave Metropolitan Savings Bank when she opened the account. <em>Milholland II, </em>89 Md. at 213, 43 A. at 43. O\u2019Neill funded the bank accounts and held the accounts\u2019 pass books, which were required to withdraw funds. <em>Milholland I, </em>89 Md. at 200, 203, 43 A. at 46, 47; <em>Milholland II, </em>89 Md. at 213, 43 A. at 43. After O\u2019Neill died, both Whalen and Milholland claimed the funds in the accounts. <em>Milholland I, </em>89 Md. at 200-01, 43 A. at 46; <em>Milholland II, </em>89 Md. at 213, 43 A. at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>Milholland I, </em>89 Md. at 202, 43 A. at 46, this Court held that the funds in the account at the Savings Bank of Baltimore belonged to O\u2019Neill\u2019s estate because Whalen failed to demonstrate that O\u2019Neill had validly gifted her the funds in the account before O\u2019Neill\u2019s death. We explained that the words \u201cjoint owners\u201d in the title of the account, standing alone, were \u201cnot sufficient\u201d to transfer title to the funds to Whalen or to establish a gift, particularly because O\u2019Neill \u201cretain[ed] possession of the pass book, and ... the book must be produced before the deposit can be withdrawn.\u201d <em>Milholland I, </em>89 Md. at 202-03, 43 A. at 47. We noted that the later addition of the words \u201cjoint owners\u201d to the title of the account was of no significance, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Those words were placed on the [pass] book, not because [ ] O\u2019Neill requested the bank officers to do so, and not because <em>she </em>thought they would, or designed they should!,] vest an indefeasible interest in [Whalen], but merely because the bank had adopted that form, as testified by the assistant treasurer, \u201cto make it uniform!,]\u201d\u2014though uniform with what[,] he did not say. The words were put there[,] not as expressing [ ] O\u2019Neill\u2019s intentions!,] or as limiting her control over the funds, but manifestly to carry out some policy or theory of the Savings Bank [of Baltimore]. They represent and stand for no voluntary, deliberate act of hers at all. In the face of these facts, whatever the import of the words might be, had they been consciously and purposely used by [ ] O\u2019Neill, they certainly can be given no weight or potency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Milholland I, </em>89 Md. at 203-04, 43 A. at 47 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">By contrast, in <em>Milholland II, </em>89 Md. at 215, 43 A. at 45, this Court held that the language used by O\u2019Neill in opening the account at Metropolitan Savings Bank demonstrated O\u2019Neill\u2019s intent to grant an ownership interest in the funds of the account to Whalen; <em>i.e., </em>the funds in the account belonged to Whalen, as the beneficiary of the trust, and not to O\u2019Neill\u2019s estate. We stated that \u201ca deposit [such] as we [we]re [then] dealing with[ ] constitute^] a valid declaration of trust, in the absence of contravening proof, and [ ] when a trust [was] thus created!,] the rights of the beneficiary become fixed, even though the settlor retains the [pass ]book in his [or her] possession.\u201d <em>Milholland II, </em>89 Md. at 218, 43 A. at 45. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">[O\u2019Neill] was seized of the money for the use of herself and her sister, as joint owners of the equitable interest; and both were authorized to draw the funds upon producing the [pass ]book.

Bohemian Bldg., Loan &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n, \u201cSlavie\u201d of Balt. City, </em>205 Md. 456, 461, 109 A.2d 120, 123 (1954). Also established in the common law was the corresponding general principle that, \u201c[i]f there was no intention to create a trust, none will be held to exist[,] no matter what words are used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 109 A.2d at 123 (footnote omitted). In other words, cases following <em>Milholland I </em>and <em>Milholland II </em>involving claims of ownership of a joint or multiple-party account focused on the intention of the creator of the joint or multiple-party account.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Indeed, following <em>Milholland I </em>and <em>Milholland II, </em>\u201c[i]n every case, the real purpose and intention of the donor, and not the [] use of one particular term or another, w[ould] decide the question of whether there was a trust.\u201d <em>Bierau, </em>205 Md. at 462, 109 A.2d at 123 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Jones, </em>211 Md. at 380, 127 A.2d at 526 (\u201cThe distillation of the Maryland cases is that[,] in a contest between those claiming as co-owners or as surviving owner of a bank or building association account, th[is] Court has sought to find who was the original owner of the money on deposit, the intention of the owner as to the fund, the mechanics employed to effectuate that intent, and their effectiveness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Nevertheless, over time, this Court\u2019s \u201cdecisions decided subsequent to <em>Milholland I </em>and <em>Milholland II </em>[ ] substantially \u2018blended\u2019 the distinction between the types of accounts discussed in those cases[, <em>i.e., </em>blurred the distinction between gift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>and trust,] and suggested] that the surviving owner of a joint account may have survivorship rights upon the death of the depositor, even in the absence of \u2018trust\u2019 language on the titling document.\u201d <em>Hartlove v.

Indeed, <em>Milholland I, Milholland II, </em>and then-progeny \u201cprecipitated some uncertainty concerning ownership of multiple-party bank accounts following the death of the account holder.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Stanley, </em>175 Md.App. 246, 262, 927 A.2d 40, 50, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>402 Md. 36, 935 A.2d 406 (2007). In response, the General Assembly enacted FI \u00a7 1-204. <em>See Stanley, </em>175 Md.App. at 262, 927 A.2d at 50 (The Court of Special Appeals stated that \u201cthe General Assembly enacted ...

(Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">That FI \u00a7 1-204 was intended to change the common law principles applicable to multiple-party accounts following the death of an individual is evident throughout House Bill 956\u2019s file. For example, House Bill 956\u2019s \u201cBill Analysis,\u201d prepared by the House Economic Matters Committee, stated that House Bill 956 was intended to alter the common law and provided the following information as background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Currently, common law and case law govern the rights of parties with regard to multiple party accounts. There are two basic forms of multiple party accounts, the Trust Form and the Joint Form. The Trust Form reads \u201cA in trust for A and B, subject to the order of either, balance on the death of either to the survivor\u201d; the Joint Form reads \u201cA and B as joint owners, subject to the order of either, balance on the death of either to the survivor\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Under the <em>Milholland </em>cases (decided in 1899), on the death of one of the depositors, the assets in a joint account belong to the survivor if the account was in a Trust Form for the benefit of the survivor; conversely, if the Joint Form was used instead of the Trust Form, the assets in the account belong to the estate of the deceased depositor regardless of any other language in the contract creating the account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">House Bill 956\u2019s \u201cBill Analysis\u201d explained, to that end, that one of the changes or effects on current and future accounts would be that \u201c[e]ach account agreement for a multiple-party account opened on or after January 1, 1992, must contain a clear and conspicuous written statement specifying that, unless contrary direction is given in the account agreement, upon the death of a party, the funds in the multiple-party account shall belong to the surviving party or parties.\u201d Indeed, House Bill 956\u2019s \u201cBill Analysis\u201d emphasized survivorship rights, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\n<em>RIGHTS OF PARTIES</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\n<em>Death of a Party</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">The bill sets out the rights of parties in multi-party accounts.

Language identical to that contained in House Bill 956\u2019s \u201cBill analysis\u201d is contained in House Bill 956\u2019s \u201cFloor Report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Concerns about survivorship rights, or what occurred after the death of an individual who was party to a multiple-party account, were also expressed elsewhere in House Bill 956\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>file. According to a document submitted by the Maryland Bankers Association,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> House Bill 956\u2019s purpose was to \u201cestablish[] a statutory framework for the creation of \u2018multiple-party\u2019 deposit accounts and for the determination of the rights of persons who claim to have an interest in multiple-party deposit accounts.\u201d The Maryland Bankers Association explained why House Bill 956 was needed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">Currently!,] there is no comprehensive Maryland law governing how to establish deposit accounts with multiple parties or how to determine who has rights in deposit account funds when more than one person is named on the account. Instead, deposit accounts are governed by various contradictory statutes scattered throughout the Maryland Code and by a series of cases first decided at the turn of the century. Current Maryland law often leads to uncertainty as to who has rights to funds in an account both during the life of[,] and after the death of[,] one or more persons named on an account. This uncertainty leads to disputes between a deceased account holder\u2019s estate and other persons who assert ownership of account funds. Moreover, current Maryland law is in conflict with the law applied by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] to establish ownership interests in jointly held accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">(Emphasis added). The Maryland Bankers Association observed that, \u201c[i]f the account agreement is silent as to the rights of the[] various individuals, then House Bill No. 956 [would] provide! that] an account party w[ould] have a right to funds in the account (i.e., w[ould] have survivorship rights) upon the death of another account party[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Jeffrey J. Radowich, the Chair-Elect of the Section of the Estate and Trust Law of the Maryland State Bar Association, testified in support of House Bill 956\u2019s substantially identical counterpart, Senate Bill 756, explaining the problem posed by the then-existing common law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The current state of the law is confusing[,] leads to uncertain results, and frustrates the intent[ ] of Maryland citizens. A person thinks [that] he or she has established an account at a financial institution [that] will pass on that person\u2019s death to another surviving person, but[,] after death[,] it turns out that the form of the account does not bring about that result. Instead, the property gets paid to the probate estate, and often ends up in the hands of an entirely different person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Testimony of Jeffrey J. Radowich, Chair-Elect, Section of Estate and Trust Law, Maryland State Bar Association, in Support of S.B. 756 (Feb. 28, 1991). Radowich testified that the problem was aggravated because \u201c[d]ifferent financial institutions use various forms of language to describe the different kinds of multiple[-]party deposit accounts, compounding the confusion\u201d and because \u201c[c]urrent Maryland statutes have different provisions regarding certain types of multiple[-]party deposit accounts for savings and loan associations, on the one hand, and banking institutions, on the other hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Radowich posited that Senate Bill 756 provided a solution by setting forth \u201c[c]lear and practical rules\u201d establishing \u201cfour types of accounts, and stipulating the legal rights of the parties to the account.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In sum, FI \u00a7 1-204\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that the General Assembly\u2019s intent was to abrogate common law distinctions between gift and trust established in <em>Milholland I </em>and <em>Milholland II, </em>and to erase the uncertainty that often accompanied the death of a party to a multiple-party account as to who was entitled to funds in the account. Our reading of FI \u00a7 1-204\u2019s legislative history is consistent with <em>Stanley, </em>175 Md.App. at 264, 927 A.2d at 51, in which the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">The history of [FI \u00a7 1-204] and its declared purpose make plain that the overriding intent of the [General Assembly] was to abrogate the common law rules concerning donative intent established by <em>Milholland I </em>and <em>II, </em>and to provide unequivocally that, in the absence of an account agreement that states otherwise, upon the death of one of the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>a multiple-party account[,] the survivors own the funds in the account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">At bottom, the General Assembly enacted FI \u00a7 1-204 to extinguish confusion regarding ownership rights of the funds in a multiple-party account following the death of one of the parties\u2014as is evidenced by the concerns about survivorship rights expressed in House Bill 956\u2019s file. In enacting FI \u00a7 1-204, the General Assembly eliminated the need to resort to extrinsic evidence to establish the donative intent of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Upon our review of FI \u00a7 1-204\u2019s legislative history, including a review of <em>Milholland I, Milholland II, </em>and subsequent case law, it is clear that the context of the common law and resulting enactment of FI \u00a7 1-204 concerned the ownership interest in funds contained in a joint or multiple-party account following the death of one of the parties, and not the ownership interests among living parties to a joint or multiple-party account. Stated otherwise, neither the common law as developed through <em>Milholland I, Milholland II, </em>and their .progeny, nor FI \u00a7 1-204 or its legislative history, demonstrates an intent to implicate the ownership interests among living parties to a joint or multiple-party account or to otherwise affect any agreement that may exist among living parties concerning the ownership interest in funds in the account. Instead, FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) simply grants a party or a convenience person to a joint or multiple-party account the authority to access the account and withdraw funds, absent language in the account agreement expressly providing otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Because we hold that FI \u00a7 l-204(f) does not confer ownership rights to the funds in a joint or multiple-party <em>account\u2014i.e., </em>a party to a joint or multiple-party account is not an \u201cowner\u201d of the funds in the account by virtue of the circumstance that he or she has the authority to withdraw funds from the account\u2014we perceive no merit in Wagner\u2019s reliance on CR \u00a7 7-110(a)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> for the contention that Wagner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>as an alleged \u201cjoint owner\u201d of the Account, cannot be convicted of theft. As Chief Judge Barbera pointed out during oral argument, such a position presupposes that Wagner was a joint owner of the funds in the Account in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Moreover, because neither FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) nor FI \u00a7 1-204 as a whole implicates ownership of funds in a joint or multiple-party account where the parties to the account are alive, our holding is not inconsistent with that of the Court of Special Appeals, which concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">In approaching ownership of a bank account prior to the death of one of the parties, the current state of the law requires us to look to the intent of [Father] and determine if he intended to make an irrevocable gift of ownership of the [A]ccount.... [T]itling an account as \u2018joint owners\u2019 presumptively creates an ownership interest in both parties, but that presumption can be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intent of the original owner of the account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\"><em>Wagner, </em>220 Md.App. at 190, 102 A.3d at 909-10; <em>see also Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. v. Andrews, </em>225 Md.App. 181, 182, 123 A.3d 640, 641 (2015) (In a case involving \u201cthe extent to which a creditor of one joint account holder may garnish funds in a joint account when another joint accountholder is a non-debtor[,]\u201d the Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat there is a rebuttable presumption that joint account holders own the funds in an account, but [ ] the presumption of joint ownership can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Even if a rebuttable presumption of equal ownership of funds among parties to a multiple-party account exists, we hold that the evidence adduced at trial rebutted that presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>tion in this case. As the circuit court found, Father added Wagner to the Account, and Wagner added Father to her personal checking account, \u201cfor the sole purpose of [e]nsuring that the funds could be accessed if necessary.... [B]ut [Father\u2019s money was [Fatherj\u2019s money and [ ] Wagner\u2019s money was [] Wagner\u2019s money[.]\u201d And, as Father testified, the funds in the Account were his funds\u2014not Wagner\u2019s\u2014and he added Wagner to the Account \u201conly ... for [him] to get [his] money out if [he] couldn\u2019t\u201d; Father testified that Wagner agreed to this arrangement. Thus, the circuit court correctly determined that Wagner was not an owner\u2014joint or otherwise\u2014of the funds in the Account; instead, Father was the owner of the funds. Again, that the signature card submitted to the bank identified Wagner as a \u201cjoint owner\u201d of the Account is not dispositive of Wagner\u2019s ownership interest; both Father and Wagner testified that the funds in the Account were Father\u2019s, and that it was understood that the funds were to be withdrawn only upon Father\u2019s direction and on his behalf. Stated otherwise, the existence of an agreement between Father and Wagner rebutted any presumption that Wagner, as a party to the Account, had an ownership interest in the funds; <em>i.e., </em>the titling of the Account, listing Father and Wagner as \u201cjoint owners,\u201d did not create an ownership interest in the funds in the Account, as Father and Wagner agreed that the funds belonged to Father. Put simply, the terms of the agreement between Father and Wagner governed their respective ownership rights, or lack thereof, as parties to the funds in the Account.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Moreover, we agree with the State that Wagner\u2019s strained interpretation of FI \u00a7 l-204(f) would effectively render FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(d) meaningless and lead to inconsistent outcomes under FI \u00a7 l-204(f) and FI \u00a7 l-204(d). FI \u00a7 l-204(d) addresses ownership of funds in a multiple-party account after the death of a party to a multiple-party account, and provides, in relevant part, for joint ownership of funds by the surviving parties unless another agreement exists. <em>See </em>FI \u00a7 l-204(d)(2) (\u201cIf the account agreement does not expressly establish the right to funds in the account upon the death of a party, or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>there is no account agreement, any funds in the account upon the death of a party shall belong to the surviving party or parties.\u201d). To interpret FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) as Wagner <em>urges\u2014ie., </em>that the right to withdraw funds from a multiple-party account constitutes an ownership interest in those funds\u2014would, in the case of an multiple-party account to which there are three or more parties, permit one surviving party to a multiple-party account to withdraw all funds from the account upon the death of one party, and thus eliminate the other parties\u2019 ownership rights to the funds in the account. This interpretation runs counter to FI \u00a7 l-204(d)\u2019s plain language. In <em>Stanley, </em>175 Md.App. at 260, 265, 927 A.2d at 49, 51-52, the Court of Special Appeals reached the same conclusion when addressing the interplay between FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(d) and FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f), explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">[FI \u00a7 1\u2014204](f) allows any owner of the multiple-party account to withdraw funds from it, but that right of withdrawal does not supersede [FI \u00a7 l-204](d), which grants survivorship rights (and thus ownership rights) to all of the parties to the account who survive the death of one of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">[T]he legislative history and the declared purpose of [FI \u00a7 1-204] resolve any possible ambiguity concerning how FI \u00a7 l-204(d) and (f) should be construed. Although any party to a multiple-party account may withdraw funds under FI \u00a7 l-204(f), that right of withdrawal does not create an ownership interest in the funds withdrawn that overrides the ownership interest of the remaining survivors to the account, established by FI \u00a7 l-204(d). Furthermore, the rebuttable presumption of a gift that was available at common law has been abrogated by [FI \u00a7 1-204]. Consequently, it is no longer relevant to the issue of survivorship whether the donor intended to create the right of survivor-ship in the title-holder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In short, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Wagner\u2019s conviction for theft of property with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>value of at least $500. Because FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) does not mention or implicate the ownership rights among living parties to a joint or multiple-party account, and instead provides that a party to a joint or multiple-party account may access and withdraw funds in the account, we reject Wagner\u2019s contention that she had an ownership interest in the funds in the Account and that, as a matter of law, she cannot be guilty of theft. Plainly put, under the circumstances of this case, nothing in FI \u00a7 l-204(f) prevents a conviction for theft. The evidence demonstrated that Wagner willfully or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the funds in the IRA and the Account\u2014which belonged to Father, the owner of the funds\u2014without Father\u2019s knowledge or consent, and with the intent to deprive Father of those funds. In other words, the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that Wagner committed theft.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Our holding\u2014that a party to a joint or multiple-party account may commit theft from that account\u2014is in accord with holdings from other jurisdictions. For example, in <em>Hicks v. State, </em>419 S.W.3d 555, 559 (Tex.Ct.App.2013), the Court of Appeals of Texas held that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for appropriation of property with a value between $20,000 and $100,000 without the owner\u2019s effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>consent under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.03, where a defendant who was added to her father-in-law\u2019s account \u201cfor purposes of expending the monies on behalf of her elderly father-in-law\u201d took and used funds from the account without the father-in-law\u2019s authorization. The Court observed that it was undisputed that funds in the account derived from \u201cdeposits [ ] made by [the] father-in-law or consisted of monies owned by him before deposit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that, because she was a party to a joint account, she owned the funds therein and could not be guilty of theft, <em>see id. </em>at 557, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">[I]t is not at all unusual for a person to deposit his or her funds into an account upon which another person is authorized to draw merely for the convenience of the depositor. In such situations, the owner of the money intends only to facilitate disbursement of the funds for his or her own purposes, not to transfer title to the co-signator on the account. Thus, the creation of a joint account does not necessarily create ownership in the co-signator of the account. From this, we conclude that a party to a joint account is entitled to lawfully draw monies from the account. That authority alone, however, does not establish the party\u2019s ownership of the funds. Nor does it alone divest title to the funds from the actual owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 558-59 (citations, internal quotation marks, brackets, and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As another example, in <em>State v. Gagne, </em>165 N.H. 363, 79 A.3d 448, 456 (2013), the Supreme Court of New Hampshire held that \u201cthe evidence was sufficient to prove that [a] defendant was not privileged to infringe upon [a] victim\u2019s interest in [] funds in [a] joint account for the defendant\u2019s own use[,]\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for theft by unauthorized taking.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Gagne, </em>79 A.3d at 450-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>51, the defendant and the victim, who were friends, opened a joint bank account; \u201c[t]he victim understood that the purpose of the joint account was to allow the defendant to better assist her with paying bills or cashing checks. The victim never told the defendant that she could take money from the joint account for her own use.\u201d Nevertheless, large sums of money were transferred from the victim\u2019s other accounts into the joint account, and the defendant withdrew a large sum of money from the joint account and deposited it into her own accounts. <em>See id. </em>at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">On appeal, the defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction of theft by unauthorized taking because the State failed to demonstrate that the property in the joint account was \u201cproperty of another\u201d under the theft statute. <em>See id. </em>at 454. The Court rejected that argument, noting that the statute defined \u201cproperty of another\u201d as \u201c \u2018property in which any person other than the actor has an interest which the actor is not privileged to infringe, regardless of the fact that the actor also has an interest in the property,\u2019 \u201d and concluding that \u201c[t]he plain language of the statute [] supported] the conclusion that the definition of \u2018[pjroperty of another\u2019 includes a joint bank account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (last alteration in original). The Court stated: \u201cWith respect to a joint account, if the arrangement does not provide one owner of the account with a privilege to take funds from the account in the circumstances under which that owner withdrew them, that owner may be convicted of stealing \u2018by unauthorized withdrawals from the account.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455 (citation omitted). The Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the theft conviction and to demonstrate \u201cthat the funds in the joint account were the \u2018[pjroperty of another[,]\u2019 \u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">The defendant argues that the terms of the account did not require the victim\u2019s permission for her to withdraw funds from the account. The fact that the defendant did not need the victim\u2019s permission in order to withdraw funds from the account, however, does not mean that the defendant was privileged to appropriate the victim\u2019s interest in those funds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Here, the victim testified that the purpose of the joint account was to allow the defendant to better assist her with \u201cbig bills.\u201d The victim further testified that she never authorized the defendant to make withdrawals from the joint account for her own needs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">As demonstrated by the cases discussed above, that a party to a joint or multiple-party account may commit theft from that account is not a new or novel holding.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In line with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the plain language of the statutes at issue, the legislative history, and case law, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Wagner\u2019s conviction for theft of property with a value of at least $500, and that FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f) did not confer an ownership interest to Wagner that prevented her from being found guilty of theft.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Wagner contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction for embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary) because the State failed to prove, and the circuit court never found, that she was a fiduciary.

The State contends that a fiduciary relationship includes both formal, business fiduciary relationships and informal relationships in which one person places trust in, and relies upon, another for his or her affairs. The State argues that, by allowing Wagner to access his account at his direction and on his behalf, Father created in Wagner a relationship \u201cimplying and necessitating great trust[,]\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a fiduciary relationship.

Despite the circumstance that\u2014for sentencing purposes\u2014the conviction for embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary) merged with the conviction for theft, the conviction for embezzlement (fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary) remains; thus, it is appropriate for this Court to consider the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that Wagner was a fiduciary in connection with the funds in the Account. To be sure, as Wagner points out, she was not a fiduciary by virtue of any formal, professional undertaking, such as that undertaken by an accountant or an attorney. A formal, professional relationship, however, is not required to create a fiduciary relationship. <em>See Andresen, </em>24 Md.App. at 149, 331 A.2d at 93-94.

It was Father\u2019s familial relationship with Wagner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and the trust and confidence such a relationship engenders, that was a key factor leading to Father\u2019s arrangement with Wagner with respect to the Account.

The decision of the Majority creates havoc because now a joint owner can orally criminalize withdrawals from a joint account, which in its establishment and maintenance did not reflect the post hoc limitations testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>fied to in this case. Family relationships, forever complicated, henceforth could engender criminal sanctions were a parent to become disenchanted with a child who is a joint owner. Indeed, the notion of a rebuttable presumption of ownership with regards to joint accounts that may be overcome post hoc through parol evidence, in light of the comprehensive framework for multiple-party accounts established under Section 1-204 of the Financial Institutions Article, is perplexing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Section 1-204 of the Financial Institutions Article of the Maryland Code (1980, 2011 Repl.Vol.) defines multiple-party accounts and sets forth the rights and ownership interests of parties and non-parties in joint accounts, both while all parties are living and upon the death of one of the parties. The statute defines a \u201cjoint account\u201d as \u201cany account other than a P.O.D. account or a trust account established in the name of 2 or more parties[ ]\u201d, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 l-204(b)(7), and includes a \u201cjoint account\u201d under the definition of a multiple-party account. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 l-204(b)(8)(i)(l). A \u201cparty\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who, by the terms of the account agreement, possesses a present right to draw upon funds in a multiple-party account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1\u2014204(b)(9)(i). Section l-204(f) provides for the right to withdraw finds from the joint account, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">Unless the account agreement expressly provides otherwise, the funds in a multiple-party account may be withdrawn by any party or by a convenience person for any party or parties, whether or not any other party to the account is incapacitated or deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In the present case, the trial judge found that the accounts created by Mr. Wagner and his daughter, Jacqueline Wagner, were joint accounts, that Ms. Wagner was a party to and joint owner of the accounts\u2014but not of the funds contained therein\u2014and that she was authorized under Section 1\u2014204(f) of the Financial Institutions Article to withdraw funds from the accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The Majority, interpreting Section l-204(f), states that \u201c\u00a7 l-204(f) does not create an interest in property or give ownership of property to the party authorized to withdraw.\u201d Maj.

To the contrary, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>absent some written limitation, a joint owner of an account possesses an ownership interest in the funds, because by its very nature a joint account establishes each party\u2019s right to all of the funds within the account. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 22 (10th ed. 2014) (\u201c[Jjoint account\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201cA bank or brokerage account opened by two or more people, by which each party has a present right to withdraw all funds in the account[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">What is most important is that Section 1-204 also provides for other types of accounts, which limit the use of the funds by the persons identified on the account.

Under the Majority\u2019s ruling, however, the joint account created by the Wagners is converted into a convenience account for the purpose of criminalizing Ms. Wagner\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In the present case, Mr. Wagner established a joint account, which was not a convenience account, nor one that included any limitation on withdrawals in the account agreement itself. As a result, Ms. Wagner could withdraw money from the joint account without peril of being prosecuted for theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The Majority suggests, however, were my reasoning followed that subsection (d) of Section 1-204 would be rendered meaningless \u201cand lead to inconsistent outcomes under FI \u00a7 1-204(f) and FI \u00a7 l-204(d).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maj. Op. at 434, 128 A.3d at 19. The Majority offers the example of a multi-party account with three or more parties where one of the parties dies, and one of the remaining parties withdraws all of the funds from the account, thereby eliminating any ownership interest of the other survivors. In essence, what the Majority is saying is that the survivors have equal rights to the funds in the account after the death of one of the parties, which would be negated were any one of the joint owners to have been able to withdraw all the funds prior to the death of one. It is true that under Section l-204(d)(2), upon the death of one of the joint owners, each remaining owner becomes entitled to an equal fractional part of the funds, similar to a tenant in common, because no one party could have, absent an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ment to the contrary, an ownership interest greater than any other party upon the death of a party to a joint account. Md.Code. Ann., Fin. Inst. \u00a7 1\u2014204(d)(2). While all parties to a joint account are <em>living, </em>however, each has an ownership interest in all of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">My observation is reinforced by the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Stanley v. Stanley, </em>175 Md.App. 246, 927 A.2d 40, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>402 Md. 36, 935 A.2d 406 (2007). <em>Stanley </em>involved multiple parties to multiple accounts, the death of the \u201cprimary\u201d account owner and subsequent family squabble over who owned the remaining account funds. <em>Id. </em>at 249, 927 A.2d at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Stanley was the \u201cprimary owner\u201d of several accounts on which his brother, Hal, and Stanley\u2019s second wife and her daughters were \u201csecondary owners\u201d. Upon Stanley\u2019s death, his second wife and her daughters withdrew all of the funds from the accounts, totaling some $120,000, and deposited the monies in a separate account in their names only. Stanley\u2019s brother, Hal, sued, claiming an ownership interest in the account funds under Section 1-204. The trial court found for the wife and daughters, and Hal appealed. Our intermediate appellate court reversed, opining in the situation of the death of one of the parties to a joint account that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">Although any party to a multiple-party account may withdraw funds under FI \u00a7 1\u2014204(f), that right of withdrawal does not create an ownership interest in the funds withdrawn that overrides the ownership interest of the remaining survivors to the account, established by FI \u00a7 l-204(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au5Q\"><em>Id. </em>at 265, 927 A.2d at 51-52. Essentially, then, when one party to a joint account dies the funds in a joint account become the property of each of the survivors who hold the account in a form similar to a tenancy in common with each having a fractional interest in the funds remaining at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In support of the conclusion that a joint owner of an account may be convicted of theft of the funds in the account, the Majority finds persuasive two cases from other jurisdictions in which a person was convicted of theft from a joint account. <em>Hicks v. State, </em>419 S.W.3d 555 (Tex.Ct.App.2013) and <em>State v. Gagne, </em>165 N.H. 363, 79 A.3d 448 (2013). In <em>Hicks, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>intermediate appellate court in Texas determined that, despite being \u201cmade a joint tenant in the account\u201d, Hicks\u2019s withdrawal and expenditure of monies from an account established and contributed to solely by her father-in-law constituted theft. 419 S.W.3d at 559. In Texas, however, at the time of <em>Hicks, </em>ownership of the monies in a joint account over the lifetime of the participants was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">A joint account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann., Probate \u00a7 438(a) (2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our statutes do not contain the same provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In <em>Gagne, </em>the Supreme Court of New Hampshire affirmed a conviction for theft from a joint account. Gagne and her friend opened a joint account with the friend\u2019s funds so that Gagne could assist the friend \u201cwith paying bills and cashing checks.\u201d 79 A.3d at 451. Gagne, subsequently, took a substantial portion of the money from the account and was convicted of theft, as well as misapplication of funds. <em>Id. </em>at 451-52. <em>Gagne </em>is inapposite because New Hampshire\u2019s statutory framework does not provide for the establishment of a \u201cconvenience account\u201d or the addition of a \u201cconvenience person\u201d to an account, as does our statutory framework, so that parol evidence of what the parties intended could be relevant to establishing that a \u201cconvenience account\u201d was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The Majority also concludes that, \u201c[b]y permitting [Ms.] Wagner to access the funds in the Account at his direction and on his behalf, Father, in essence, created with Wagner \u2018a relationship] implying and necessitating great confidence and trust on the one part and a high degree of good faith on the other part.\u2019\u201d Maj.

In essence, by the mere creation of a joint account whereby access to funds is permitted by statute, a fiduciary relationship is established, according to the Majority-</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">I would conclude, however, that a person\u2019s status as a joint owner of an account does not confer fiduciary obligations upon any other owner of the account. Section 1-204 contemplates a fiducial (\u201ctrust\u201d) relationship in the establishment of a multiple-party account\u2014the \u201ctrust account.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Md.Code Ann., Fin. Inst. \u00a7 1\u2014204(b)(8)(i). Under a \u201ctrust account\u201d, funds are accessible by the trustee, who is a party to the account and who is authorized to withdraw funds under l-204(f). The beneficiary of the trust account, however, does not possess a present right to withdraw funds from the account, but does stand to receive ownership of the account upon the death of all trustees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 l-204(b)(4). The trust relationship is established by the account agreement. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1-204(b)(13)(i)(2). Clearly, in providing for a multiple-party account based on a trust relationship expressly established by the account agreement, the statute provides for an account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>type, separate from that of a joint account, which may be established with fiducial obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">To hold otherwise would provide that, absent an express written agreement, any owner of a joint account could, thereby, then, post hoc, complain that another joint owner, by withdrawing funds for his or her personal use, violated his or her duty under the alleged fiduciary relationship sufficient to be prosecuted for embezzlement. This conclusion runs counter to the statute, which specifically contemplates the type of trust relationship argued by Mr. Wagner through the creation of a \u201ctrust account\u201d, rather than a joint account. To impose our highest standard of obligation and responsibility upon parties to a joint account and its access is folly.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge ADKINS authorize me to state that they join the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-12\">.

To the extent that courts in other jurisdictions have held that a party to a joint or multiple-party account cannot commit theft from the account, such cases are distinguishable and unpersuasive. For example, in <em>State v. Haack, </em>220 Mont. 141, 713 P.2d 1001, 1003 (1986), the Supreme Court of Montana held that Montana \u201c[statutes and case law demonstrate that a joint tenancy bank account is [ ] a special relationship between co-owners ... [that] precludes application of the theft laws[,]\u201d such that \"[t]he special relationship between co-owners in a joint tenancy bank account cannot have any 'unauthorized control\u2019 or 'interest to which offender is not entitled' by a joint tenant.\u201d In <em>Haack, id. </em>at 1001, the defendant contracted with two homeowners to construct a house for them; the homeowners deposited funds in a joint checking account in which one of the homeowners and the defendant \u201cwere joint tenants authorized to draw from the account.\u201d The defendant began drawing funds from the joint account, however, for unauthorized personal purposes instead of construction costs. <em>See id. </em>at 1001-02. The trial court concluded as a matter of law that the defendant could not be convicted of theft \"because he was a joint tenant\u201d on the account, and the Supreme Court of Montana agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 1002-03. Key to the Supreme Court of Montana's decision, though, was the development through Montana case law of the principle that a \u201cjoint tenancy bank account\u201d creates \"a special relationship\u201d among the parties to the account such that one cannot be convicted of \"theft of joint tenancy bank account property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1002. The same principle has not developed in Maryland case law with respect to FI \u00a7 1-204.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">As another example, in <em>Breining v. Harkness, </em>872 N.E.2d 155, 156-57, 160 (Ind.Ct.App.2007), in a civil lawsuit between two step-brothers, Breinig and Harkness, concerning Harkness\u2019s mother's voluntary transfer to Harkness of money from a joint checking account belonging to Harkness's mother and Breinig's father, the Court of Appeals of Indiana held that Harkness had not committed civil conversion or theft because he did not exert unauthorized control over the funds, which were given to him by Harkness's mother. In <em>Breining, </em>Harkness\u2019s mother gave the funds to Harkness, who was not a party to the joint checking account; by contrast, here, Father did not give the funds in the Account to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Wagner. Wagner's reliance on <em>Braining </em>is unpersuasive, as the case is factually distinct from this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\">. Nothing in our opinion alters the bar against prosecution of an individual for theft from his or her spouse where the individual and his or her spouse live in the same residence as husband and wife. Indeed, the bar against prosecution under those circumstances is codified at CR \u00a7 7-110(c)(3), which provides that \u201d[i]t is a defense to the crime of theft that ... the property involved was that of the defendant\u2019s spouse, unless the defendant and the defendant\u2019s spouse were not living together as husband and wife and were living in separate residences at the time of the alleged theft[J\u201d In other words, so long as the individual and his or her spouse live in the same residence as a husband and wife, the individual cannot be guilty of theft from his or her spouse. We note that there are any number of questions concerning CR \u00a7 7-110(c)(3)\u2019s effect that are not before this Court in this case. For example, any concern that, to avoid prosecution for theft, an individual who is about to cease residing in the same residence with his or her spouse will take assets before leaving the marital residence with the intent to deprive the spouse of those assets, is not before this Court. Whether such a scenario constitutes theft would be a matter of first impression not presented by the circumstances of this case and, as such, resolution of the issue must await another day. Similarly, we note that CR \u00a7 7-110(c)(3) has not been amended or updated to reflect the legality of same-sex marriages in Maryland since 2013, and still refers to married couples as those couples \u201cliving together as husband and wife[.]\u201d Although, for guidance, we observe that from our perspective CR \u00a7 7-110(c)(3) would apply to married same-sex couples, that matter is not before this Court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\">.
