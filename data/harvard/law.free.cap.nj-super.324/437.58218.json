Costantino,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was injured while working as an employee of BelleMead Construction Corporation, the general contractor on a construction project. Defendants are Louis Ven-triglia individually, Louis Ventriglia &amp; Sons, arguably a subcontractor or supplier to BelleMead, (collectively \u201cVentriglia\u201d) and Ventriglia\u2019s employee, Anthony Sansone. Sansone was operating Ventriglia\u2019s equipment, digging a hole where plaintiff was working, when the hole collapsed on plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict of no negligence. This appeal involves the proper use of OSEA standards of care as evidence in a negligence action. Because we conclude that the jury received incorrect instructions that may have contributed to an unjust result, we reverse and remand for a new trial. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">As in <em>Kane v. Hartz Mountain Industries, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 142, 650 A.2d 808 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>141, 669 A.2d 816 (1996), \u201cthe judge\u2019s charge appears to have been a hybrid between a general negligence standard and one requiring a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of a regulatory violation.\u201d In charging the jury, the court correctly defined negligence as the failure to exercise that degree of care for the safety of others which a person of ordinary prudence would exercise under similar circumstances. The court also charged the jury that evidence had been produced regarding construction standards in the industry, and that such evidence could be considered in determining whether defendants had a duty to protect the trench. Those charges were appropriate. The court also told the jury that plaintiffs claimed that defendants breached a duty of reasonable care and violated their obligations under OSHA. However, the order and juxtaposition of those charges were confusing and deprived plaintiff of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The relevant portion of the jury charge follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">In this case, in support of the charge of negligence made by the plaintiffs, the plaintiff asserts that the defendants violated a provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA. Specifically he charges that Ventriglia was a subcontractor, as that term is defined in OSHA, and therefore had the duty to protect the trench if it was over five feet, as provided in the OSHA regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">Now, OSHA has set up a standard of conduct for the safety and other various endeavors \u2014 for various endeavors, including the construction industry. However, the determination of whether the defendant is a subcontractor subject to the OSHA regulations depends \u2014 is a question of both law and of fact. The fact to be determined is the nature of the relationship between Ventriglia and the general contractor Bellemeade. <em>The statute defines a subcontractor, who is one who has contracted to do a part of the work,. </em>In this case, the defendants assert that the defendant was not a subcontractor, that he merely was a lessor of the back hoe in question, with its operator. That the operator was \u2014 the back hoe and the operator were released about an hour a day to do any work directed by Bellemeade site\u2019s superintendent, Mr. McCracken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\"><em>If you find that Ventriglia was merely a lessor of such equipment with an operator on such basis, then you will find, that he was not a subcontractor as that term is defined in the act. In effect, I am charging you that if you so find such a person is not, as a matter of law, a subcontractor under OSHA, and therefore is not required to comply with OSHA. If, however, you find that defendant was a subcontractor; namely, someone who was obligated by contract to do a part of the work, as that term is used in OSHA, then you may consider whether a defendant violated the OSHA requirements which were testified to by the various witnesses. </em>If you would find that he violated such OSHA requirements, then I would charge you in respect to the effect of such a finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\"><em>Whereas here the charge of negligence made is asseited by reason of the defendants having violated a provision of OSHA, you may consider that as some evidence of negligence. The statute in question has set up a standard of conduct </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>for the safety in the construction industry. If you find that the defendant has vix\u00fcated that standard of conduct, such violation is evidence to be considered by you in determining whether negligence, as I have defined that term to you, has been established. </em>You may find that such violation constituted negligence on the part of the defendants, or you may find that it did not constitute such negligence. Your finding on this issue maybe [sic] based on such violation alone, but in the event there is other or additional evidence bearing on that issue, you will consider such violation together with all such additional evidence in arriving at your ultimate decision as to defendant\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">[Emphasis added I.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We are convinced that these instructions, viewed as a whole, may have prevented the jury from considering the OSHA regulation as evidence of the standard of care applicable to defendants under general negligence principles, irrespective of whether Ventriglia was a \u201csubcontractor\u201d and subject to OSHA regulation and enforcement. The charge thus had the potential for leading the jury to an unjust result. <em>See Feldman v. Lederle Labs., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>339, 345-46, 625 A.2d 1066 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We recognize that plaintiff contributed substantially to the confusion in the way the case was presented to the jury. By seeking to prove that Ventriglia was a \u201csubcontractor\u201d subject to OSHA regulations, plaintiff apparently sought the advantage of instructing the jury that the OSHA regulation established the required standard of care; that defendants did not follow the standard; and that the OSHA violation is evidence of negligence. As we shall explain, under general negligence principles, the OSHA regulatory standard is merely evidence of the applicable standard of care. Having chosen to offer the jury the opportunity to consider an alleged OSHA violation as evidence of negligence, plaintiff took on the burden of proving that Ventriglia was actually subject to OSHA regulations, and defendant focused on disproving OSHA\u2019s application. Nevertheless, the judge erred in asking the jury to answer the question whether Ventriglia was a subcontractor subject to OSHA regulations \u2014 a legal question for the court\u2014 and in relying on the attorneys\u2019 descriptions of those regulations, which the parties failed to supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The parties\u2019 undue emphasis on the question whether Ventriglia was a \u201csub-contractor\u201d under OSHA apparently contributed to the judge\u2019s decision to charge the jury that if Ventriglia was not a subcontractor, it was not bound by the OSHA standard. .Even if that statement was literally accurate, in the sense that OSHA could not impose administrative sanctions upon Ventriglia, the instruction incorrectly implied that if OSHA had no jurisdiction over Ventrig-lia, the OSHA standard would be irrelevant to the standard of care Ventriglia owed to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The judge failed to charge the jury expressly, as he indicated in the charge conference that he would, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyO\">[T]he defendants are charged with the duty of reasonable care under the circumstances, that is, with respect with what they did. The defendant\u2019s conduct must be compared with the conduct of a reasonably prudent person digging a trench under the circumstances in this case. You may consider the testimony in regard to general customs and standards in the construction industry in determining whether or not the defendants did [not] act with reasonable care and therefore were negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">OSHA regulations have long been admissible as evidence of an industry standard for safety. <em>See Kane v. Hartz Mountain, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 141 \u2014 42, 650 A.2d 808; <em>Smith v. Kris-Bal Realty, Inc., </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 352, 576 A.2d 934 (App.Div.1990); <em>Sanna v. National Sponge Co., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>60, 69, 506 A.2d 1258 (App.Div.1986). Plaintiff was entitled to have the jury consider plaintiffs expert\u2019s reliance on the OSHA standards to demonstrate the construction industry standard of care, even though Ventriglia may not have been subject to OSHA regulations or jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Defendant\u2019s expert did not dispute the OSHA standard. Plaintiff was entitled to rely upon an accepted standard in the construction industry \u2014 that holes or trenches deeper than five feet must be shored \u2014 to convince the jury, through an expert, that these defendants had deviated from the applicable standard of care under general negligence principles. By allowing the jury to conclude that it should ignore that standard if it found that defendants merely supplied equipment and operator to the site, the court improperly limited plaintiffs opportunity to prove negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>In his direct testimony, plaintiffs expert offered opinions cast almost exclusively in terms <em>of </em>compliance with OSHA, thereby inviting defendants to establish that they were not subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of OSHA. However, both plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s experts testified that OSHA requires that a hole or trench that is five or more feet deep either must be shored up, or the walls constructed at an angle to prevent collapse. The record strongly supports the conclusion that this hole was more than five feet deep, and defendant\u2019s expert agreed that the common law standard of care requires the kind of safety measures spelled out by OSHA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The trial judge recognized that defendants were subject to general negligence law, and expressed his intention to charge the jury accordingly. However, he did not do so. The actual jury instructions may have prevented the jury from considering the OSHA safety standards relied upon by plaintiffs expert to establish a standard of care. New Jersey law has consistently allowed OSHA standards to be considered for that purpose, even where the allegedly negligent party is not subject to regulation or enforcement by OSHA. <em>See, e.g., Sanna v. National Sponge Co., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 69, 506 A.2d 1258:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">[B]eeause the case must be retried, we observe that federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standards may have been relevant and perhaps violated in this situation. .. Even if not specifically applicable in the regulatory context of this aeeident, a question which is not before us and which we do not decide today, the standards expressed in the OSHA regulations may be recognized and accepted as objective safety standards and practices generally prevailing in the community if appropriate expert or other testimony so develops. <em>McComish v. DeSoi, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>274, 282, 200 A.2d 116 (1964).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">[Additional citations and footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In this case, plaintiffs expert referred without objection to the OSHA regulation as a basis for establishing the appropriate standard of care for these defendants. As we said in <em>Smith v. Kris-Bal Realty, Inc., </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 352-53, 576 A.2d 934:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>While plaintiff here enjoyed the status of a business invitee of both the marina and the owner of the fishing trawler at the time of his accident, and was not an employee laboring at his workplace, safety standards targeted specifically for the protection of workers getting on and off vessels were not totally irrelevant to the reasonable standard of care owed to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">[Plaintiffs expert could, under the doctrine of <em>McComish v. DeSoi, </em>properly rely on OSHA standards in explaining his conclusions on the duty of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">[Citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">This conclusion is consistent with established precedent allowing industry standards as evidence of a standard of care. <em>See McComish v. DeSoi, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>274, 200 A.2d 116 (1964) (manuals properly admitted as safety codes):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">[A] safety code ordinarily represents a consensus of opinion carrying the approval of a significant segment of an industry. Such a code is not introduced as substantive law, as proof of regulations or absolute standards having the force of law or of scientific truth. It is offered in connection with expert testimony which identifies it as illustrative evidence of safety practices or rules generally prevailing in the industry, and as such it provides support for the opinion of the expert concerning the proper standard of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 282,200 A.2d 116].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The same rationale required this jury to be instructed on general negligence principles, and that the OSHA regulation was an available but not a required standard of care against which to measure defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>See also Perez v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>1, 24, 734 A.2d 1245 (1999) (\u201cFDA regulations are pertinent in determining the nature and extent of any duty of care that should be imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to direct-to-eonsumer advertising\u201d); <em>Dixon v. Jacobsen Mfg.

The majority favors admissibility. <em>See, e.g., Rolick v. Collins Pine Co., </em>975 F.2d 1009, 1013 (3d Cir.1992), cert. <em>denied, </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>973, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>1417, 122 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>787 (1993) (applying Pennsylvania law):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">The issue to be decided here is whether the OSHA regulation is admissible in a diversity action as evidence of the standard of care owed by the defendants to the plaintiff, not whether the OSHA itself controls that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>Sprankle v. Bower Ammonia &amp; Chemical Co., </em>824 F.2d 409, 416-17 (5th Cir.1987) (excluding the OSHA regulation as evidence was not an abuse of discretion, where defendant was not subject to OSHA, and plaintiffs expert was permitted to refer to the regulation as a foundation for his opinion about due care); <em>Miller v. Chicago &amp; North Western Transp. Co., </em>925 <em>F.Supp. </em>583, 588 (N.D.Ill.1996) (although defendant was not subject to OSHA regulation, which had been preempted by Federal Railroad Administration standards, plaintiffs expert could rely on the OSHA standard to support his testimony describing the appropriate standard of care); <em>Thoma v.

Skil Corp., </em>638 F.2d 270, 275 (1st Cir.1981); <em>Brantley v. Custom Sprinkler Sys., Inc., </em>218 <em>Ga.App. </em>431, 461 <em>S.E.2d </em>592, 593 (1995); <em>Knapstad v. Smith\u2019s Management Corp., </em>774 P.2d 1, 2-3 (Utah Ct.App.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In our view, although Ventriglia\u2019s status in relation to the job may be determinative of OSHA\u2019s jurisdiction over it, the absence of jurisdiction does not mean that defendant owes no duty of due care to plaintiff. General negligence principles control. In <em>Alloway v. Bradlees, Inc., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>221, 723 A.2d 960 (1999), decided two weeks before argument in this case, the Court reversed a summary judgment in favor of defendants and cited <em>Kane </em>for the proposition that \u201cgeneral negligence principles,\u201d rather than strict categorical analysis, govern tort claims involving worker safety issues. 157 <em>N.J. </em>at 235, 723 A.2d 960. The Court reaffirmed <em>Hopkins v. Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 625 A.2d 1110 (1993), <em>Clohesy v. Food Circus Supermarkets, Inc., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>496, 694 A.2d 1017 (1997), and <em>Carvalho v. Toll Brothers &amp; Developers, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>565, 675 A.2d 209 (1996), each holding that general negligence principles govern in circumstances previously governed by categorical analysis. 157 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 723 A.2d 960. As in <em>Alloway, </em>we are satisfied that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYk\">The combination of these several factors \u2014 the foreseeability of harm, the relationship between the parties, and the opportunity and capacity to take corrective action \u2014 strongly supports the imposition of a duty of reasonable care on [the general contractor] to assure the safety of plaintiff on the work site as a matter of fairness and sound policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">[157 <em>N.J. </em>at 233, 723 A.2d 960].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">There can be no dispute that Ventriglia owed plaintiff a duty of care. The dispute for this jury to resolve was the nature of the required care. There is substantial evidence in the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the hole that collapsed on plaintiff was more than five feet deep, that Sansone knew the walls were not shored or angled, and that he gave plaintiff the signal that it was safe to enter the hole. In light of the strong evidence of negligence, we conclude that the jury may have believed it could not consider the OSHA regulation as evidence of the care that a reasonable person in Sansone\u2019s position would have taken. Since that regulation was the only source of the standard of care offered by plaintiffs expert, an implied instruction to ignore that standard could well explain the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The common law duty of care is separate and apart from any duty to abide by OSHA regulations. Violation of an OSHA regulation by a party subject to its jurisdiction is, at most, some evidence of negligence, not negligence <em>per se. See Alloway, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 236, 723 A.2d 960:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">OSHA regulations are pertinent in determining the nature and extent of any duty of care. We find applicable in the circumstances of this ease the well-established principle that the violation of a legislated standard of conduct may be regarded as evidence of negligence if the plaintiff was a member of the class for whose benefit the standard was established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\"><em>See also Kane, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 144, 650 A.2d 808. Conversely, compliance with OSHA does not preclude a finding of negligence. <em>Kane, supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 142, 650 A.2d 808. Neither of those propositions resolves the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Defendant relies on <em>Alloway </em>for the proposition that an OSHA violation is evidence of negligence only where \u201cthe regulations are applicable to the defendant and ... plaintiff is an individual intended to be protected by the regulations.\u201d That may be so. But the Court in <em>Alloway </em>describes with approval our observation in <em>Kane </em>\u201cthat the common-law duty of a general contractor to assure the safety of its subcontractors\u2019 employees is not necessarily identical to the duty that arises from a general contractor\u2019s duty to comply with an OSHA regulation.\u201d <em>Alloway, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 237, 723 A.2d 960, citing <em>Kane, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 142, 650 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">As we said in <em>Kane, </em>OSHA \u201cdictate[s] that the prime contractor and any subcontractors are responsible jointly for any failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>comply with OSHA safety standards____\u201d 278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 141-42, 650 A.2d 808, and \u201cthe primary contractor and each tier of subcontractor [is] responsible for the safety of the workers under them on general negligence principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 650 A.2d 808. Application of negligence principles is consistent with our prior statement in <em>Bortz v. Rammel, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 322, 376 A.2d 1261 (App.Div.1977), describing the basis for a plaintiffs cause of action as \u201ctraditional negligence theory with a statutory mandate providing the source of the legal duty____\u201d 151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 322, 376 A.2d 1261. \u201c\u2018[P]roof of deviation from a statutory standard of conduct, while not conclusive on the issue of negligence in a civil action, is nevertheless a relevant circumstance to be considered by the trier of fact in assessing tort liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alloway, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 236, 723 A.2d 960 (quoting <em>Bortz, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 320, 376 A.2d 1261).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">We do not read <em>Alloway </em>to change existing law: that an expert may rely on OSHA regulations, just as an expert may rely on industry standards, to support an opinion about the appropriate standard of care owed by any reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position. Facts relied upon by an expert witness \u201cneed not be admissible in evidence\u201d \u201cif of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Where a defendant is subject to an OSHA safety regulation, its duty to workers is established by law. Therefore proof that the defendant violated the regulation is evidence of a breach of duty, <em>i.e., </em>evidence of negligence. Even where a defendant is not subject to OSHA regulatory jurisdiction, general negligence principles apply. In that case the court first determines whether the defendant owes a duty to the injured plaintiff. The nature of that duty, that is, the applicable standard of care, then may be evidenced by the OSHA standard. In the former case the jury can be instructed that the defendant had a duty to follow the regulation, that the jury should determine whether the defendant violated the regulation, and if so, that it <em>may </em>consider that violation as evidence of negligence. In the latter case, the jury should be instructed that the defendant owed plaintiff a duty of due care, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>that the jury must decide what constitutes due care under the circumstances, and that the OSHA standard may be considered as evidence of the care required.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We recognize certain language in <em>Attoway </em>that could be read to restrict <em>any </em>use of OSHA standards unless the defendant is directly subject to OSHA regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, in the context of the rest of the <em>Albway </em>opinion, and the precedent cited therein, we find no evidence that the Court intended to limit the existing rule that standards set forth in OSHA regulations, at least when incorporated in expert testimony, are a proper consideration for a jury in determining the applicable standard of care. Given the longstanding common law rule, as well as <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, we are satisfied that if the Court had intended so drastic a change in the law, it would have expressed that intention unequivocally.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">We agree with plaintiffs\u2019 argument in Point VI that his vocational expert\u2019s testimony was unduly limited. The issue was whether plaintiffs vocational expert could testify that plaintiff was likely to suffer decreased earnings in the future on account of his probable future physical inability to continue to work as a laborer.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Plaintiffs vocational expert concluded, based on tests he administered to plaintiff, that plaintiff was an unskilled worker with no transferable skills. Plaintiffs doctor had concluded that, based on plaintiffs permanent injury, there was a reasonable medical probability that he would not be able to work as a construction laborer for the entire course of his normal work life. Therefore, the vocational expert concluded that given plaintiffs limited employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ment skills, he would suffer diminished earning capacity if he were forced to stop working as a construction labor and had to take a sedentary job.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The expert was prepared to testify, in accordance with his report, that plaintiff likely would suffer a ten percent decrease in his earning ability as a result of his injury. In addition, if his physical condition worsened to the point where he could no longer perform his job as a construction laborer, and if he were restricted to sedentary work, his loss of earning capacity would be even greater. The defense objected to this testimony for lack of foundation, in view of plaintiffs own testimony that he continued to work as a laborer following the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Plaintiff relied upon his medical expert\u2019s testimony that there would come a time when plaintiff could no longer work as a laborer. He argued that one expert is allowed to rely on the opinion of another expert, Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 5 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, and that expert testimony about a probable future consequence is admissible even if the expert cannot say with precision when it will come about.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The court ruled that the vocational expert could not testify to plaintiffs likely loss of income if his condition worsened and he could no longer work as a laborer, because that was too speculative. Plaintiff contends that he should be allowed to present the expert\u2019s opinion with regard to plaintiffs reduced employability if he cannot work as a laborer. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">An injured party has the right to recover damages for the prospective consequences of a tortious injury as long as there is a reasonable probability that such consequences will occur. <em>Coll v. Sherry, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>166, 175-76, 148 A.2d 481 (1959); <em>Dombroski v. Atlantic City, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>459, 469, 706 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1998); <em>Higgins v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 611-12, 660 A.2d 1252 (App.Div.1995). To recover for diminished earning capacity, the plaintiff must show that there is a reasonable probability that the injuries will impair his or her future earning capacity. An expert witness must be able to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>an opinion based on a reasonably probable prediction, and not a mere guess or conjecture. <em>Myrlak v. Port Auth. of New York &amp; New Jersey, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 9, 694 A.2d 575 (App.Div.), <em>rev\u2019d, in part on other grounds, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>84, 723 A.2d 45 (1999); <em>Dawson v. Bunker Hill, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 323, 673 A.2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">This prohibition against a \u201cnet opinion\u201d bars expert testimony based on unfounded speculation or mere possibilities. <em>Grzanka v. Pfeifer, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>563, 580, 694 A.2d 295 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, 154 N.J. </em>607, 713 A.2d 498 (1998); <em>Dawson v. Bunker Hill, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 323, 673 A.2d 847. We are satisfied that by holding the proffered testimony too speculative, the trial judge failed to recognize that the vocational expert was entitled to rely, as he did, upon the opinion of plaintiffs medical expert\u2019s. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>703. In <em>Statham v. Bush, 253 N.J.Super. </em>607, 602 A.2d 779 (App.Div.1992), a vocational expert testified that based on an interview with the plaintiff, on a review of the plaintiffs medical records, and on an employability assessment the expert prepared from published labor statistics, plaintiff was employable only in light or sedentary jobs. We concluded that the testimony was properly admitted since \u201c[njothing more is required\u201d of an expert on this issue. <em>Id. </em>at 612-14, 602 A.2d 779. We reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Plaintiffs remaining points on appeal are either moot or without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-13\"> Plaintiff Patricia Costantino\u2019s action is derivative. We shall refer throughout to \"plaintiff\u201d in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-10\"> Neither party has quoted or even cited the critical portion of the OSHA regulations. Both agree it exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-11\"> We need not determine in this case whether the OSHA regulation for shoring up holes or trenches of a certain depth would have been admissible as independent evidence of the applicable standard of care without expert testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> In <em>Alloway </em>the initial question was whether the general contractor owed a duty of care to its subcontractor\u2019s employee, whereas here the issue is defendants\u2019 duty to an employee of the general contractor. The Court describes Alloway as an employee of a subcontractor who \"provided both truck and driver to [the general contractor] on a per diem basis,\" much like the arrangement between these defendants and this plaintiff\u2019s employer. 157 <em>N.J. </em>at 226, 723 A.2d 960. Just as here, \"the contractual relationship ... was not committed to writing.\u201d <em>Id. Compare Beatty Equipment Leasing, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>577 F.2d 534, 537 (9th Cir.1978) (drawing no conclusion from the fact that petitioner was labelled a materialman rather than a subcontractor where, for all relevant purposes, he functioned as a subcontractor on the job site in question).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\"> We refer to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">In sum, although OSHA issued a violation to Bernhard Excavating, and not to Pat Pavers, the failure by OSHA to find a violation against a particular party does not preclude a determination that the party nevertheless was subject to a duty imposed by OSHA regulations and that the standards prescribed by OSHA were violated. <em>If it is determined that OSHA regulations are applicable to Pat Pavers under the circumstances, they may be considered in determining the standard of care that was owed plaintiff and whether that standard was breached.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">[157 <em>NJ. </em>at 240, 723 A.2d 960 (emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
