FileNet Corporation designs, manufactures, installs and sells computer software. Wang Laboratories, Inc., a competitor, is suing it for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. FileNet called upon its liability insurers, Vigilant Insurance Company, Federal Insurance Company, and Pacific Indemnity Company, and upon their parent corporation, The Chubb Corporation, to defend and indemnify it against Wang\u2019s demands. The insurers denied coverage. FileNet sued the insurers, claiming breach of their contracts of insurance and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and FileNet cross-moved for summary judgment. Chubb moved for summary judgment on the ground that it has not issued any contracts of insurance to plaintiff. The other defendants moved on the ground that Wang has not asserted any claims within the coverages afforded by their policies. The Honorable Helen E. Hoens, J.S.C., granted defendants\u2019 motions. She also denied FileNet\u2019s motions for summary judgment and to amend its complaint to add another affiliated company, Chubb and Sons, Inc. Judge Hoens explained her rulings in three comprehensive, well-reasoned written opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>FileNet has appealed. The substance of its argument against the summary judgment in favor of Chubb is that \u201cChubb Corporation\u2019s dominance over Federal, Vigilant, and Pacific mandates the piercing of the corporate veil to prevent injustice,\u201d and \u201cChubb &amp; Son has abused the privilege of incorporation by using its affiliate insurers to perpetrate an injustice.\u201d The substance of FileNet\u2019s argument against the summary judgment in favor of the other defendants is that a \u201cpotential for coverage exists for Wang\u2019s allegations against FileNet pursuant to the advertising injury provisions of Chubb\u2019s commercial general liability and umbrella policies.\u201d The many other points listed in FileNet\u2019s argument headings are boiler plate legal propositions which are either undisputed or immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The basis for FileNet\u2019s claims against its insurers is the policy language providing coverage for advertising liability. This language varies somewhat among the several policies at issue here. But the differences are immaterial. Of the policy language relied upon by FileNet, the most comprehensive is that which insures against \u201cliability ... imposed on the insured by law ... arising out of advertising injury\u201d and defines \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as injury resulting from, insofar as relevant here, \u201cunfair competition or piracy\u201d arising in the course of advertising activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The fundamental flaw in FileNet\u2019s case, which Judge Hoens accurately perceived and convincingly analyzed, is that there is no evidence whatsoever in any of the twenty-four volumes of the appendix which FileNet supplied to us that Wang, either in its complaint or in any other litigation record, has claimed injury from \u201cpiracy\u201d or \u201cunfair competition\u201d arising in the course of advertising activities within any accepted meaning of those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Wang\u2019s general counsel, who is primarily responsible for the conduct of his company\u2019s litigation against FileNet, was questioned by FileNet\u2019s attorney in an oral deposition. The Wang counsel persistently and categorically denied that Wang was asserting any causes of action other than causes of action based on statutory patent infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>FileNet\u2019s brief asserts that \u201cWang specifically identified FileN-et\u2019s press releases, brochures, catalogs, and manuals as evidence that support its claims that FileNet passed off its products as Wang\u2019s patented inventions and induced third parties to infringe Wang\u2019s patents.\u201d That allegation is misleading. The materials cited as support for the statement consist of voluminous documents which Wang apparently collected from FileNet during discovery. The deposition of Wang\u2019s general counsel indicates that Wang intends to rely in part on some of those documents to prove its infringement claims, but only because, in Wang\u2019s view, the descriptions in these documents of the products and of their functioning are evidence that FileNet\u2019s products have features that conflict with Wang\u2019s patent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">FileNet\u2019s brief also states, \u201cAs the Wang Action progressed, Wang alleged that FileNet\u2019s products infringe the six Wang patents by mimicking the claims of Wang\u2019s patents.\u201d This assertion references a certification of an attorney who is a member of the law firm representing FileNet in the Wang action. The certification contains the statement attributed to him, but the certification does not cite any evidence which supports the assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">FileNet argues that Wang\u2019s cause of action implies that FileNet, by advertising its products, induced its customers to buy and use those products and, thus, according to Wang, FileNet used advertising to induce others to infringe Wang\u2019s patents. However, even if we assume that Wang\u2019s complaint implicitly makes that allegation, BhleNet would still not be entitled to indemnification and a defense under the terms of the policies which are the subject of this suit. First of all, we agree with Judge Hoens that \u201cunfair competition\u201d and \u201cpiracy\u201d as used in the insurance policies which are the subject of this suit do not encompass the statutory offense of patent infringement. Secondly, we reiterate that the claim which Wang has alleged against FileNet is a claim for patent infringement, i.e., that FileNet has manufactured, sold and used products protected by Wang patents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>In other words, Wang contends FileNet is a direct infringer. There is no indication in the record submitted to us that Wang asserts FileNet has sold non-infringing products and induced its customers to use them in a manner or in a combination that infringes. <em>Cf. Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite v. Lonza, Ltd., </em>36 F.Supp.2d 26, 30 (D.D.C.1999); <em>Fina Research v. Baroid Ltd., </em>141 F.3d 1479, 1481-82 (Fed.Cir.1998); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. Star Techs., Inc., </em>935 <em>F.Supp. </em>1110, 1115\u2014 16 (D.Cr.1996). For a direct infringer merely to advertise the availability of an infringing product does not itself make the advertiser liable for inducing infringement; the advertising is merely ancillary to the sale. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. Star Techs., Inc., supra, </em>935 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1115; <em>Jervis B. Webb Co. v. Southern Sys. Inc., </em>495 <em>F.Supp. </em>145, 147 (E.D.Mich.1980); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Superior Court, </em>19 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>320, 23 Cal.Rptr.2d 442, 446-47 (1994). <em>Cf. Self v. Fisher Controls Co., </em>566 F.2d 62, 64 (9th Cir.1977) (\u201cContributory infringement actions are limited to situations where defendant itself has not directly infringed the patent by making, using, or selling the invention, under 35 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 271(a), but has induced someone else to infringe the patent.\u201d). Consequently, even if Wang alleged that FileNet\u2019s advertising induced others to purchase and use FileNet\u2019s infringing products, and even if \u201cpiracy\u201d or \u201cunfair competition\u201d included patent infringement, nonetheless, even on those hypotheses, Wang\u2019s claim would not be a claim that FileNet was subject to a liability \u201cimposed on the insured by law ... <em>arising out of advertising injury.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Our affirmance of the summary judgment in favor of the insurers moots any issue raised by FileNet\u2019s appeal from the summary judgment in favor of Chubb. Furthermore, no persua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>sive reason has been advanced why we should not recognize Chubb as an entity separate from its subsidiary insurers. There is not even a suggestion that the individual insurers would not have been fully able to satisfy any damage award for which they might have been liable if FileNet had prevailed on its damage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We therefore affirm substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Hoens in her letter opinions dated April 3 and May 20, 1996, and December 19,1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\"> If Wang should assert a claim hereafter that FileNet\u2019s advertising has induced customers to use or combine non-infringing products in a way that causes them to infringe, FileNet might have a better claim against its insurers. We do not decide that issue because FileNet has not shown us that Wang has made such a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
