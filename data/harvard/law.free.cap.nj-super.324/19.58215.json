The indictment also charged co-defendant, Darrin Cobb, with the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>counts as well as charges of witness tampering, tampering with physical evidence and two counts of hindering apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Tried separately to a jury, defendant was found not guilty of aggravated manslaughter but convicted of reckless manslaughter. The trial judge also adjudicated her guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50 and reckless driving under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-96. The sentencing judge merged the reckless driving offense into the reckless manslaughter conviction and imposed a seven year prison term in addition to the various mandatory fines and penalties under both the indictable and motor vehicle convictions. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The testimony at trial adduced the following factual setting. During the evening hours on Sunday, September 25,1994, Howard Solomon, Kevin Standing and twenty-seven year old Betsy Ma-dera were among the many who attended a networking reception, the opening event of the annual two-day ASA Legal Systems Users Conference, at the Seaview Marriott in Atlantic City. At approximately 9:30 p.m., the three decided to return to their own hotel, a nearby Days Inn. Due to her unfamiliarity with the area, Madera decided to follow Solomon and Standing, who were traveling together in Solomon\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">As the two cars made their way south on Route 9, a two-lane road, Solomon was careful to keep his speed down to 40 m.p.h. so that he would not lose sight of Madera in her red Toyota. The road began to curve and, as Solomon rounded the bend, both he and Standing exclaimed, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d as they watched in sudden fear as two cars came barreling towards them in the opposite lane at a high rate of speed. Standing estimated that the cars were no more than one or two car lengths apart and that they were traveling in excess of seventy miles per hour. He believed that they might have been racing. As the two went by, both Solomon and Standing saw the lead car begin to fishtail and it appeared to them that the driver was losing control and swerving towards their lane. Notably, neither of the two men saw any contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>between the two vehicles. Moments later, just after the two cars passed out of sight, Solomon and Standing heard a crash and they immediately pulled over.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Standing ran to the first car at the accident site, which he recognized as Madera\u2019s red Toyota, while Solomon dialed 911 on his car phone. Standing approached Madera, shook her and checked for a pulse. Finding none, and noting that Madera\u2019s eyes were fixed, Standing concluded that she was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Patrolman Troy Midgette of the Galloway Township Police Department responded to the scene after receiving a call at 9:59 p.m. regarding a motor vehicle accident. He observed two cars, one a red Toyota and the other a blue Mustang GT, off to the side of southbound Route 9. He proceeded first to the red Toyota and determined that the driver was dead. He then headed over to the Mustang which he noted had sustained a great deal of front-end damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Emergency workers had already begun treating the driver of the Mustang, later identified as twenty-one year old Bobbie Choi-nacki. Midgette approached and asked defendant what had happened. According to Patrolman Midgette, defendant responded that she did not know what had happened, but that she \u201cmust have fallen asleep.\u201d As defendant spoke, Midgette detected an odor of alcohol on her breath. He noted that, although obviously injured, defendant appeared to be without pain and indifferent to her situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Patrolman Tom Davey, also of the Galloway Township Police Department, arrived at the scene shortly after Midgette. He approached the Mustang and asked defendant what had happened. According to Davey, defendant responded by asking him about the condition of her car and about some officers she knew. Defendant became upset and began to exhibit signs of pain and Davey discontinued his questioning after only a minute or two.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Defendant was transported to the Atlantic County Medical Center. Davey and another officer made their way to the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>to retrieve a blood sample from defendant for testing purposes and to interview her a second time. Davey, aware that witnesses described racing-type activity, was eager to learn if defendant knew the other driver. However, Davey was unable to get immediate access to defendant because she was being worked on by medical personnel. He placed a request for a blood sample which was eventually drawn at 11:43 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Defendant was treated by Dr. Joel Bayer. He diagnosed a hematoma on her forehead, broken tooth, compound fracture of her left ankle, concussion and right ankle fracture. At 10:50 p.m., Dr. Bayer found defendant oriented and alert, with clear speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">When Dr. Bayer permitted access to defendant, Davey insisted on being allowed to speak to her ahead of her family. During the subsequent ten-minute interview with defendant, defendant told Davey that after completing her 12:00 to 8:00 p.m. shift at the Trump Plaza Casino, she stopped at a local restaurant/bar called Sabatini\u2019s. She said that sometime later a friend named Terry Braun gave her a ride to her car and she headed home. After she drove on Route 9, a Mustang began following her closely. She refused to let him pass because she was in a hurry to get home so that she could use the bathroom. Defendant stated that she was traveling at approximately 50 to 55 m.p.h. and acknowledged that she and the other driver, whom she said she did not know, passed a Bronco. Defendant stated that she did not remember the collision, noting that she had had only three hours of sleep the night before and that she might have fallen asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Davey testified that throughout this interview defendant was crying and appeared to be in pain, but she never said that she did not understand his questions. He noted that she asked him again about certain officers she knew and about the condition of her car. He did not tell her that the accident had involved another car and resulted in a fatality.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">One of defendant\u2019s friends, Lisa Klein, also spoke with defendant while she was in the emergency room after the accident. According to Klein, both she and defendant were crying at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>time, but she was sure that defendant knew who she was. Klein recalled defendant telling her that the other driver had been \u201cfuckin\u2019 with\u201d her. Shortly thereafter defendant was taken away for surgery to clean and realign her fractures and also for the insertion of pins and screws to keep the bones in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">At 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 27,1994, Sergeant William Taggart of the Atlantic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, stopped by the hospital and obtained permission to speak with defendant. He was cautioned, however, by medical personnel not to mention the victim\u2019s death. Immediately after he introduced himself to defendant, who was awake, she asked about one of his fellow officers. In response to Taggart\u2019s questions defendant denied that she had taken any drugs other than a Benadryl prior to the accident, and she claimed that she had only one beer and one shot while at Sabatini\u2019s. She denied knowing the driver of the other car, which she recalled as being dark in color.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">When Taggart asked defendant how fast she was traveling prior to the accident, she did not immediately answer. Instead, after a ten-second pause, defendant asked Taggart whether there were any witnesses. When Taggart informed her that there were witnesses, defendant began to cry and stated that her car meant everything to her and that she wanted to die. Because defendant\u2019s condition had deteriorated during the interview and she appeared to be in pain, Taggart ended the interview. He testified that defendant did not seem to be under the influence of any drugs during the interview, although he assumed that she was taking medication. He said that defendant had no trouble understanding his questions, and that he had no trouble understanding her responses. In his estimation, defendant appeared to be talking freely.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Defendant underwent a second surgery on September 28, 1994. The following day she was moved to a regular room. Lisa Klein again visited defendant, who appeared \u201cout of it,\u201d but well enough to ask Klein if she had seen her car and if it was totaled. Klein responded that she had not seen the car and did not know if it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>totaled. Defendant then told her that she had stopped off at a bar after work and had a beer and a shot. She related that after she got on Route 9, a Mustang with primer spots on it came up fast behind her, high beamed her and rode her bumper so that she thought that it was going to hit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Defendant told Klein that the other Mustang passed her and then slowed down after pulling in front of her. She then passed him, but he again passed her and slowed down. The two traded places one more time and then defendant tried to pass a third time. However, according to defendant, this time the other driver refused to let her reenter the proper lane, first by speeding up, and then by slowing down. Defendant stated that she remembered seeing lights in the distance but that everything then went black. According to Klein, at no point did defendant tell her that she was afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">During the course of the investigation, the police inter-viewed a number of witnesses who offered statements regarding certain events leading up to the crash. One of these witnesses, Terry Braun, one of defendant\u2019s fellow employees at Trump\u2019s Plaza, confirmed that he met defendant at Sabatini\u2019s shortly after 8:00 p.m. on the night of the accident. He stated that he saw defendant drink one full beer, plus part of another. According to Braun, he and defendant left the bar at approximately 9:30 or 9:40 p.m. and retrieved his car from the Caesar\u2019s parking garage. Braun related that he then dropped defendant off at the employee parking lot (where she had left her car) and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Tony Amodio and his wife Christine testified that they were traveling northbound in a Ford Bronco at approximately 50 m.p.h. on Route 9 in Absecon when Tony, who was driving, noticed two Mustangs, one a dark color and the other gray, coming up fast behind them in his rear-view mirror. He stated, \u201cLook at these assholes,\u201d and Christine turned and watched as the two Mustangs passed them on the driver\u2019s side. She confirmed that the lead car was dark in color while the second had gray primer on it. According to Tony, the Mustangs were traveling approximately 80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>m.p.h., while Christine estimated their speed to be between 60 and 70 m.p.h.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Tony related that after the cars passed them, the lead ear pulled back into the northbound lane and the other moved alongside it as though to pass, but then backed off and moved in behind it because of oncoming traffic. Christine and Tony agreed that the two cars then passed another car the same way by moving into the southbound lane. Christine believed that the two Mustangs might have passed another car, but she was not sure. She stated that the Mustangs were traveling side by side as they entered a curve in the road. Shortly thereafter, they came upon the accident scene and pulled over to offer assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Tony stated that the Mustang at the crash site was the lead car that passed them. Tony believed that the two cars were racing because of their speed and the way they were weaving in and out of traffic. It appeared to him that neither driver wanted to yield to the other. Tony stated that when the two ears were traveling side by side it seemed as though they were drag racing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">According to witness William Hull who was heading northbound on Route 9 at approximately 9:45 p.m., the two cars came up fast behind him. He immediately slowed down to 35 m.p.h. to let them pass. He did not see the cars return to the right lane because of the bend in the road. As he rounded the bend, he saw debris and pulled over and ran to defendant\u2019s Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Adrian Bravenboer informed police that sometime after 9:30 p.m., he was traveling northbound on Route 9 at approximately 45 to 50 m.p.h. when he was passed by two cars which were doing about 75 m.p.h. He stated that, after passing him, the lead car moved back over into the proper lane but that the second car stayed in the left lane and pulled up alongside the lead car as they traveled uphill.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">According to Bravenboer, the two cars remained side-by-side entering the bend although there was more than enough room between the lead car and his own car in the northbound lane. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>believed that the two cars were racing and that the second car was trying to pass the lead car. As they entered the bend, Braven-boer saw the car on the left slam on its brakes and then, as he rounded the bend, he saw dust and debris all over the road. He noted that the car which had been on the left was disabled on the side of the road, while the other ear which had been involved in the racing had disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Stephen Nanfara informed police that he was stopped at the corner of Shore Road and Route 9, waiting to turn onto Route 9 when he saw two Mustangs, one blue and one gray, come flying by on the northbound side of Route 9. He estimated that the gray Mustang was about one or two ear lengths behind the blue GT which he believed was traveling at between 100 to 120 m.p.h. He stated that he thought the two cars were racing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Pasquale Mucciolo described talking to his girlfriend at a payphone located along Route 9 when he heard the sound of roaring engines and saw two Mustangs come speeding by traveling side by side at approximately 100 m.p.h. Just before the two cars disappeared around a bend, he saw the car on the left hit its brakes and heard the sound of downshifting and a backfire. He saw the car on the left shake as its driver tried to get back over into the right lane. He did not see the car on the right attempt to brake. When he later drove by the accident scene he noticed that one of the Mustangs he had observed was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Scott Beibin, who was living in a second-floor apartment in a house located on the Route 9 \u201cblind\u201d curve, told police that he glanced out a window upon hearing the sound of revving engines. Although his view of Route 9 was partially obscured by trees, he was able to see two cars pass by traveling side by side at a fast rate. Almost immediately after the two cars passed by, he heard the sound of a crash. Beibin then heard a car shift gears and drive off.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Dr. Walter Hofman, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on the victim and determined that Madera died from multiple injuries resulting from blunt force trauma. Specifically, he noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that she sustained multiple fractures of her skull, vertebrae, ribs, left arm and both legs. He said that the force of the crash had caused her brain to split, and her lungs, aorta, liver and spleen to tear, resulting in massive hemorrhaging. In his opinion death was instantaneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">On September 26, 1994, Dr. Steven Kuranovich, principal forensic scientist at the state police lab in Hammonton, New Jersey, received the two vials of defendant\u2019s blood which had been drawn at the hospital the night of the accident. Blood tests revealed a blood alcohol content of .089%. Defendant was arrested on February 6, 1995, and subsequently indicted in connection with Ma-dera\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">At trial the State presented the expert testimony of Investigator Barry Wythe of the Atlantic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, who had received extensive training in accident investigation and reconstruction. Wythe testified that based upon his examination of the damage to the two cars, the eyewitness accounts and the skid-marks, that at the time of the accident defendant was traveling between 67 and 70 m.p.h., and that the victim was traveling at approximately 40 m.p.h. He noted that the posted speed limit around the curve on Route 9 is 45 m.p.h. and that it is even lower (40 m.p.h.) on certain stretches of the highway leading to the crash site. Analogizing each car to a clock with the center of the hood at 12:00, Wythe believed that the victim\u2019s ear was struck at the equivalent of 11:00 while the initial impact to defendant\u2019s car occurred at 12:30 or 1:00. He opined that upon impact the defendant\u2019s car rotated counterclockwise and traveled 187 feet, while the victim\u2019s car lost all speed and was actually pushed backward.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Wythe noted that Betsy Madera\u2019s Toyota left no skid marks at the scene but that there were skid marks from a third vehicle, not the defendant\u2019s Mustang, which did not show any evidence of fishtailing. He stated that at some point either in October or November of 1994 the police received tips regarding the third car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>and the identity of its driver. He related that in early 1995 Darrin Cobb became the exclusive other suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Although he had not initially noticed any damage to defendant\u2019s vehicle, Wythe acknowledged that defendant\u2019s investigator brought to his attention that there was a small mark on the rear bumper of defendant\u2019s car. However, Wythe did not believe that this mark could have resulted from an impact from the rear because there was no corresponding damage to the superstructure of the car and the mark was actually located on a recessed portion of the bumper. In Wythe\u2019s estimation, the mark was nothing more than a smear which did not go into the bumper but ran across the bumper laterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Wythe also said that there was no evidence of contact between the car found to belong to Cobb and defendant\u2019s Mustang, noting that defendant never informed the police or anyone else that she had been bumped.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Dr. John Brick, a biological psychologist called by the State, gave an opinion as to defendant\u2019s peak blood alcohol content. Noting that the documented blood alcohol content was .089% at 11:43 p.m., Brick testified that a concentration of .089% reflected the consumption of the equivalent of 47 ounces of beer or four one-half ounce shots of 80 proof alcohol. Although peak blood alcohol content can occur anywhere from thirty to ninety minutes after consumption of the last drink, Brick believed that defendant would not have required the maximum amount of time to achieve her peak because she consumed distilled spirits which enter the system more rapidly. He estimated that defendant\u2019s peak blood alcohol concentration would have occurred approximately fifty minutes after she stopped drinking or twenty-plus minutes after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">In order to calculate defendant\u2019s peak blood alcohol content, Brick assumed that she had been drinking at an even rate, without consuming any food, between 8:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. and that alcohol was being eliminated from her system at the standard rate of .015% per hour. Utilizing a computer to create a curved graph, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Brick determined that defendant\u2019s peak blood alcohol concentration was .104%. He noted that if defendant consumed distilled spirits just before she left the bar, her blood alcohol content at the time of the accident would have been a little lower. Brick also stated that although he once used straight-line graphs to chart blood alcohol content, he no longer uses them because they cannot take into consideration as many variables and often result in overestimated peaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Brick testified that individuals with a .10% blood alcohol concentration are slightly impaired in their ability to operate a car even though they do not necessarily exhibit all of the classic signs of drunkenness. He noted that such individuals have difficulty dividing their attention and adjusting to glare from headlights, and also exhibit slower reaction times, impaired judgment and decreased attention to risk. Although defendant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration may have been a little less than .10% at the time of the accident, Brick had no doubt that she was impaired. He estimated that defendant\u2019s relative risk for an accident was six-plus times greater than a person with no alcohol in their system.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Defendant elected to testify in her own defense. She stated that in September 1994 she was attending a local community college and working part-time as a cashier at the Trump Plaza Casino Hotel. According to defendant, she owned a blue Mustang GT which she had purchased in April 1993. She explained that she took meticulous care of her car, washing it every other day and that there was absolutely no damage to the rear of the ear prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Defendant confirmed that on Sunday, September 25, 1994, she left work at approximately 8:00 p.m. after working an eight-hour shift and headed to Sabatini\u2019s in order to meet Braun. She said that she had eaten a slice of pizza and a salad between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. While at the bar, she ordered a Coors Lite, which she said she drank over the course of the next hour. At approximately 9:00 p.m., she returned to the bar from the bathroom and found a shot waiting for her. She drank the shot, although she did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>know what it contained. Immediately after, she took a sip from another beer in order to rid her mouth of the taste of the shot. Ten or fifteen minutes later, she and Braun left the bar, retrieved Braun\u2019s car and then drove to where her car was parked.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Defendant testified that she did not feel intoxicated as she started her car and headed north towards home. She stated that while she was following a Bronco on Route 9 she noticed a car come up so close behind her that she thought it was going to hit her. She noted that approximately three weeks earlier she had been badly frightened after being followed home by an unidentified car which repeatedly passed her and then slowed down. Defendant explained that because of this prior incident, she became frightened when the car which had been tailgating her, passed her and slowed down. She acknowledged that she did not know if it was the same car that had followed her three weeks earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Defendant testified that she passed the Bronco in order to get away from the car behind her, the other car also passed the Bronco and resumed tailgating her. Defendant stated that she did not recall passing any other cars. According to defendant, as she approached the critical curve in the road, she took her foot off the gas and glanced twice in her rear view mirror. She recalled seeing headlights for the first time when she glanced in the mirror, but not the second time, and that was when she began to fishtail. She testified that the last thing she remembered before waking up in the hospital was looking ahead of her and seeing approaching headlights. She denied having any recollection of her conversations with Klein, Davey or Taggart.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Jeanne Ferwerda, a friend of defendant, confirmed that on September 8, 1994, defendant told her that someone had been following her home from work the last couple of nights and that she was scared. Ferwerda stated that when she later visited defendant in the hospital, defendant informed her that she had been followed on the night of the collision. According to Ferwer-da, defendant stated that she became scared when a car began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tailgating her and then passing her and slowing down. However, Ferwerda acknowledged that defendant told her that she also passed the other car several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Steven Schoor, a civil engineer with extensive experience in accident reconstruction, testified on behalf of defendant that the damage to the rear bumper of her car could have occurred from being struck by Cobb\u2019s front bumper. He noted that the fanning out of the damage from right to left was consistent with a minor impact. He explained that although defendant and Cobb were evidently traveling at high speeds, a minor impact could still have occurred because both cars were traveling at approximately the same speed. He stated that a small bump could have either exacerbated defendant\u2019s fishtailing or made her swerve. Schoor admitted, however, that the damage to defendant\u2019s car could have predated the accident or occurred as a result of flying debris.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Defense witness Richard Saferstein, a forensic toxicologist, explained that he utilized a straight-line method, which he characterized as a more reality-based methodology, to track defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content. Assuming she consumed one and one-half twelve-ounce beers and two ounces of distilled spirits at a consistent pace over a ninety-minute period, he estimated defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at .085% at the time of the accident ultimately peaking at .10% at 10:30 p.m. However, Saferstein agreed with Brick, the State\u2019s expert, that if defendant drank significantly more during the latter part of the drinking period, her blood alcohol content at the time of the accident would have been below .08%.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Because alcohol can affect certain people more than others, Saferstein was unwilling to state that defendant was definitely impaired with a blood alcohol content below .10%. He acknowledged, though, that an individual with a blood alcohol content of .08% is two or three times greater a risk of collision than an alcohol-free driver. Saferstein also agreed that an individual with a blood alcohol content of .10% to .11% would be impaired and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>constitute a safety risk due to deteriorated judgment, loss of self-control and diminished visual acuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Substantial evidence was also presented by defendant regarding co-defendant Darrin Cobb, who was arrested in connection with this case on February 15, 1995. Most notable was the testimony of Leslie Belber Barker, Cobb\u2019s former girlfriend. She stated that on September 25, 1994, at 10:00 p.m., Cobb came flying through the door after work looking very shaken. According to Barker, she and Cobb conversed and then he went back outside to clear glass off the front of his car, a gray Mustang. Thereafter, they drove to the crash site using her car because Cobb did not want his car seen in the area. However, they never made it to the actual site because of police roadblocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Taggart also testified as a witness on defendant\u2019s behalf and confirmed that Cobb purchased a gray 1989 Mustang on May 24, 1994. Officer Emory Silipigni of the Pleasantville Police Department related that Cobb and his Mustang, which carried license plates reading \u201cER778P,\u201d had been involved in a one-car accident on August 12, 1994, which resulted in damage to the car\u2019s right bumper and front fender. Detective Peter Romanelli of the Galloway Police Department reported that on October 16,1994, he located Cobb\u2019s Mustang at South Jersey Auto Body in Absecon with significant damage to the right side of the car consistent with a substantial impact. Romanelli observed that the license plates registered to the car had been replaced with those belonging to a 1984 pick-up previously owned by Cobb and Barker which read \u201cCL894P.\u201d Kirti Patel, a car salesperson at Sheehy Ford, testified that on November 3, 1994, Cobb came in looking to buy a car and claiming to have a trade-in, a 1989 Mustang LX five-speed, with a 5.0 liter, V-8 engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Margaret Choinacki, defendant\u2019s mother, testified that while she was at home one day in late May or early June 1994, she heard a <em>very </em>noisy car approaching. She walked outside to the front of her home and watched as the car, which she recalled as being gray, pulled into the driveway of the Sykes residence across the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>street. Choinacki quickly took a piece of aper and jotted down the car\u2019s license plate number which read \u201cCL894P.\u201d She continued watching until the car drove off approximately five minutes later. Choinacki held on to this piece of paper until March 3, 1996, when she realized its potential significance and turned it over to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Numerous character witnesses testified that they knew defendant to be honest and truthful.

After a hearing pursuant to <em>State v. Hurd, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 432 A.2d 86 (1981), the trial judge restricted defendant\u2019s testimony to matters she could prove she recalled prior to being hypnotized, thereby precluding testimony as to alleged memories elicited as a result of hypnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">At the <em>Hurd </em>hearing defendant called Dr. Samuel Babcock, a clinical psychologist, who testified that defendant came to his office on June 8,1995, accompanied by defense investigator Kauff-man in the hope of obtaining a hypnotic refreshment of defendant\u2019s memory regarding the details of the accident. Dr. Babcock indicated that his initial objective was to determine whether this was an appropriate case of hypnotic refreshment. To that end, he first spoke with Kauffman in a recorded conversation to obtain background. Kauffman told him that defendant\u2019s memory of the events before the crash were \u201cvery vague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Dr. Babcock then spoke privately with defendant for about twenty minutes in a recorded conversation, confining himself to inquiries about the accident. He did not probe the nature of defendant\u2019s injuries, was unfamiliar with her medical records and did not speak with defendant\u2019s psychologist even though he conceded that the personal psychologist\u2019s opinion as to whether defendant had blocked out memories because of trauma would have been relevant. He maintained that he was able to get sufficient insight as to whether defendant suffered from traumatic obstruction of memory of the incident from conversing with defendant notwithstanding the fact that defendant had a natural motivation to fabricate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">At the outset of his conversation with defendant, Dr. Babcock underscored that his inquiry was relevant to her defense by specifically advising defendant that her attorney would get a copy of the tape of the hypnosis session and that he could \u201cdo whatever he wants to do with it. He can throw it in the trash or give it to the judge, it[\u2019s] his prerogative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Dr. Babcock testified that defendant was able to tell him when she left work, where she went, the time she left Sabatini\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>where she was headed. However, he determined that defendant\u2019s recollection closer to the time of the accident was confused and vague. He ruled out certain possible causes for this confusion, such as alcohol and head injury, because of the small amount of alcohol consumed by defendant and the relatively minor nature of her head injuries. Later he acknowledged that her statements about the amount of alcohol consumed was inaccurate in light of her blood alcohol concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">After his initial conversation, Dr. Babcock concluded that defendant suffered from traumatic memory loss and that she was, therefore, an appropriate candidate for hypnotic refreshment. He proceeded to hypnotize defendant and observed her during the twenty to thirty minute hypnotic induction period to conclude that she was hypnotizable.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The hypnotic interview lasted thirty to forty minutes, during which Dr. Babcock and defendant engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">Bobbi: He was like right behind me then he, it was like his lights went off. And I\u2019m trying to get control. All\u2019s I notice is I\u2019m trying to get control, and now is [sic] was like beside me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">Dr. Babcock: Did you see him, or did you just feel him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">Bobbi: It was like he was on, he was behind me, like I fishtailed, and I tried to regain back control of my car, and he was, wouldn\u2019t let me in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">Dr. Babcock: Did you see him beside you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">Bobbi: There was like a car there!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">Dr. Babcock: Beside you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">Bobbi: Yes! It was like I was trying to gain control of my car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-15\">Dr. Babcock: Could you see what color that car was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">Bobbi: No. Then I hit a car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-17\">Dr. Babcock: You have no idea who this other car was or who owned it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-18\">Bobbi: No. A couple of cars followed me before. I never said nothing to nobody, what do they want with me for? That was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-19\">Dr. Babcock: Do you recognize this car as ever following you before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-20\">Bobbi: Not that I remember, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-21\">Dr. Babcock: Okay. So as you say, you lost control of the car, it started fishtailing, you did see that car again, beside you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-22\">Bobbi: It was a car, I don\u2019t know, I never saw the car behind me, I don\u2019t know what make or nothing it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Dr. Babcock: So he was tight behind you, then as you were fishtailing, you feel that he pulled up along side of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">Bobbi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">Dr. Babcock: On which side, right or left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">Bobbi: On my right side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">Dr. Babcock: And you couldn\u2019t get back in the other lane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">Bobbi: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">Dr. Babcock: Okay. Alright I understand. And all this time he was, was this the first time he pulled up along side of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">Bobbi: Yeah. He was behind me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">Dr. Babcock: Eight. He never pulled up beside you before this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">Bobbi: Yeah. It was like I was pushed. I don\u2019t know how I lost control of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">Dr. Babcock: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">Bobbi: And then, I\u2019m fishtailing, and I\u2019m trying to gain control, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m tryin\u2019, it\u2019s like there was a ear beside me and headlights in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-16\">Dr. Babcock: Okay. And when he was following you, how dose do you think he was to the back of your ear. What was your best guess?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-17\">Bobbi: When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-18\">Dr. Babcock: As you were coming up towards that curve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-19\">Bobbi: Eight up my butt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-20\">Dr. Babcock: Like how far would you say that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-21\">Bobbi: Maybe on top of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-22\">Dr. Babcock: Was he 50 feet away or just inches?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-23\">Bobbi: Inches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-24\">Dr. Babcock maintained that as he restored defendant\u2019s memory, he tried to be neutral and not to lead her in any way, explaining that suggestion occurs when new information is injected into the proceedings as opposed to when a hypnotist merely repeats back what the subject has said to him. He admitted that he was mildly suggestive when he asked defendant whether the other driver was fifty feet or just inches away, but claimed that his question gave her the option of choosing any distance in between. He also agreed that he was suggestive when he asked defendant if she learned \u201clater\u201d that the other car had been a Mustang and that he had been \u201cnegatively suggestive\u201d when he asked whether the other car ever pulled up alongside her. He further admitted that when he mentioned that the tape of the hypnosis session <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>could be used to defendant\u2019s benefit in court, he may have created a situation in which defendant had a motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Babcock testified that he chose not to videotape the session because he believed that videotaping makes the subject more apprehensive and because he did not think there was any need for the hypnotist to appear on tape. He also pointed out that there was no way defendant could have received any visual cues from him since he was seated behind her head and her eyes were shut. Babcock confirmed that no one else was present in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In <em>Hurd, </em>the Supreme Court identified several factors of \u201cthe hypnotic experience\u201d which could render suspect the accuracy of the supposedly restored memory, including the subject\u2019s: (1) loss of critical judgment while under hypnosis; (2) the tendency to \u201cconfabulate\u201d or confound newly-evoked memories with those of original recollection; and (3) the vulnerability to suggestion while under hypnosis. <em>Hurd, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 539-40, 432 A.2d 86. As to this last feature, the Court observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">In describing the events he is reliving, [the subject] will tend to shape his \u201crecall\u201d in response to intentional or inadvertent cues from the questioner. These cues may be as obvious as leading questions or as subtle as the inflection of the questioner\u2019s voice or degree of apparent approval by the hypnotist. In addition, a subject often will incorporate into his response his notion of what is expected of him. Authorities note that there are particular problems of suggestibility when the subject is aware of a preferred response or when the examiner has a preconceived theory that is likely to influence his questioning. Because of the unpredictability of what will influence a subject, it is difficult even for an expert examining a videotape of a hypnotic session to identify possible cues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 539, 432 A.2d 86 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">However, despite these shortcomings, the <em>Hurd </em>Court ruled that hypnotically enhanced testimony is admissible in a criminal trial provided the trial judge concludes that \u201cthe use of hypnosis in the particular case was reasonably likely to result in recall comparable in accuracy to normal human memory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 432 A.2d 86. In order to make this admissibility determination, there must be an evaluation based on expert testimony of both the kind of memory loss which was purportedly restored through hypnosis and the specific techniques employed by the hypnotist in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>determine whether \u201cthe use of hypnosis and the procedure followed in the particular case was a reasonably reliable means of restoring the witness\u2019 memory.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">With regard to the type of memory loss involved, the Court noted that hypnosis is not appropriate in all instances of memory loss. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 432 A.2d 86. That is, while hypnosis is often reasonably reliable when dealing with memory loss stemming from a pathological reason, such as a traumatic neurosis, \u201cthe likelihood of obtaining reasonably accurate recall diminishes if hypnosis is used simply to refresh a witness\u2019 memory concerning details where there may be no recollection at all or to \u2018verify\u2019 one of several conflicting accounts given by a witness.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consideration need also be given to whether the subject has any discernible motivation for creating \u201cself-serving fantasy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Assuming that hypnosis is appropriate under the circumstances, the trial judge is obliged to evaluate the reliability of the hypnotic procedures used. <em>Hurd </em>stressed the necessity of considering the \u201cmanner of questioning and the presence of cues or suggestions during the trance and the post-hypnotic period,\u201d as well as the amenability of the subject to hypnosis in view of the increased suggestibility of subjects capable of entering deeper trances. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Therefore, to provide an adequate record for this reliability inquiry, and also to ensure a minimum level of reliability, <em>Hurd </em>adopted the following mandatory procedural requirements governing the conduct of hypnosis sessions: (1) the hypnosis session must be carried out by an experienced psychiatrist or psychologist who qualifies as an expert; (2) the hypnotist must be independent of and not regularly employed by either the State or the defense; (3) any information given to the hypnotist by any party prior to the hypnosis session must be recorded, either in writing or another suitable form; (4) before inducing hypnosis, the hypnotist should elicit from the subject a detailed description of the facts as remembered at that point in time; (5) all contacts between the hypnotist and the subject must be recorded, including the pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>hypnosis interview, the hypnosis session and the post-hypnotic period; and (6) the hypnotist should be alone with the subject during the pre-induction interview, the hypnosis session and the post-hypnotic period. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 432 A.2d 86. The <em>Hurd </em>court specifically noted that \u201c[t]he hypnotist should carefully avoid influencing the description by asking structured questions or adding new details.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 432 A.2d 86. The court also \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d videotaping the actual hypnosis session in order to record any visual cues. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The party seeking to introduce hypnotically refreshed testimony has the burden of establishing admissibility by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Ibid. See also, State v. L.K., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 582 A.2d 297 (App.Div.1990) (applying <em>Hurd </em>guidelines to defense applications in criminal cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We agree with the determination of the trial judge that the proofs adduced by the defendant did not meet the standard of suitability for hypnotically-refreshed testimony. Dr. Babcock did nothing to ascertain the actuality of defendant\u2019s memory loss beyond a general inquiry of Investigator Kauffman and reliance upon his response that defendant\u2019s memory of the accident was \u201cvague.\u201d The transcript of the pre-hypnotic session with defendant also does not evidence memory loss to meet the <em>Hurd </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">By failing to familiarize himself with defendant\u2019s prior statements about the incident, Dr. Babcock did not adequately consider the extent of defendant\u2019s memory with regard to the issue of whether traumatic blockage was the efficient cause of her alleged memory loss. By electing not to review medical records or interview treating physicians, Dr. Babcock\u2019s diagnosis of continuing post-traumatic stress disorder is speculative and based on incomplete information. Moreover, Dr. Babcock\u2019s comments to defendant regarding the potential use of the tape of the hypnotic session increased the possibility of defendant creating a self-serving scenario during the hypnotic session and his conduct of the hypnotic interview was suggestive as reinforcing information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>previously provided by the defendant in a speculative or tentative fashion. <em>See State v. Fertig, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>115, 121, 668 A.2d 1076 (1996)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Therefore, we affirm the finding that the defendant did not meet the burden of showing that the situation was appropriate for hypnotic memory enhancement, and we conclude that the trial judge properly precluded the use of the hypnotically-refreshed memories.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Defendant contends that the trial judge erred in failing to suppress the statements made by her without the benefit of Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> warnings while in the emergency room after the accident and in the intensive care unit after her surgery, claiming that the statements were elicited under circumstances which amounted to custodial interrogation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings are constitutionally mandated when a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation by law enforcement officers. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 444, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706-07 (1966). It is custodial interrogation and not the mere focus upon a particular subject which implicates the requirement that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given. <em>State v. Graves, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>441, 448, 291 A.2d 2 (1972); <em>State v. Coburn, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 595, 535 A.2d 531 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>300, 540 A.2d 1281 (1988). Custodial interrogation is \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>U.S. </em>at 444, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706-07. <em>Accord Stansbury v.

In determining whether a custodial interrogation has occurred, a court must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. <em>Stansbury, supra, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>at 320-21, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1528-29, 128 L.Ed.2d at 298; <em>State v.

Coburn, supra, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 596, 535 A.2d 531). A court may consider on a case-by-ease basis attendant circumstances such as the length of the interrogation, the place and time of the interrogation, the nature of the questions, the conduct of the police and all other relevant circumstances. <em>State v. Pierson, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 67, 537 A.2d 1340 (App.Div.1988); <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 353, 379 A.2d 860 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Defendant contends that the police questioning which occurred in the hospital, first by Davey and then by Taggart, cannot be considered anything other than custodial because it took place when defendant was in the hospital suffering from injuries and it occurred after both Davey and Taggart were in possession of sufficient evidence rendering defendant a suspect in a vehicular homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">A hospital room generally lacks the \u201ccompelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation.\u201d <em>State v. Zucconi, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>361, 364, 235 A.2d 193 (1967) (quoting from <em>Miranda v. State of Arizona, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 478, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726). <em>See also State v. Figueroa, </em>212 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>per. </em>343, 349-50, 515 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1986) (admission of statements made by defendant while in hospital bed deemed appropriate where there was no \u201coverbearing or over-reaching\u201d during the interrogation, the statements were made voluntarily and the statements appeared to be reliable and trustworthy in light of the other evidence in the case), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>142, 526 A.2d 204 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Other jurisdictions have similarly concluded that the fact that an individual is hospitalized and unable to leave due to disabling injuries when questioned by the police does not warrant the automatic administration of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the absence of other indicia of custody. <em>See State v. Cooper, </em>119 <em>Idaho </em>654, 809 P.2d 515 (1991) (in-hospital interview of defendant by police was not custodial in nature where defendant had been taken by ambulance, and not police car, to hospital and was being released at time of interview); <em>People v.

O\u2019Loughlin, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 637 A.2d 553 (App.Div.1994) is misplaced. In <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>defendant and her passenger were transported by ambulance to Harlem Hospital in New York City after being involved in a fatal automobile accident. Soon thereafter, a Port Authority police officer arrived, purportedly to prepare an \u201caided report\u201d regarding defendant\u2019s medical condition. The officer prevented defendant from leaving the hospital with her visibly intoxicated companion or another friend to seek treatment elsewhere indicating that defendant was \u201cunder ... [their] care\u201d and would have to wait for police-arranged transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Another officer soon arrived to relieve the original officer and offered to drive defendant to a nearby taxi stand where she could get a taxi to Englewood hospital. This officer insisted upon inspecting the contents of defendant\u2019s purse before allowing her to enter his car. The original responding officer then followed the car containing defendant to the taxi stand before leaving the scene. The driver of the cab which they eventually secured was told by the relieving officer that his fare would be paid by the Port Authority and that he should not \u201close\u201d defendant. The officer followed the cab to the hospital where he remained until he was relieved by two new officers. These officers then proceeded to interview defendant while she was sitting on a gurney after apparently ordering her friend to leave. The interview lasted approximately ten or fifteen minutes, and at no point was defendant formally arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In assessing whether or not defendant had been in custody when questioned by the police, we noted that after the accident, defendant was under \u201ccontinuous police supervision\u201d for nearly three hours before being interrogated. We observed that during this lengthy time period the officers failed to complete any \u201caided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>report\u201d or obtain any other accident information from defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 637 A.2d 553. Additionally, the officers permitted defendant\u2019s passenger to leave, thereby singling defendant out for special treatment. We found that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s circumstances would have believed that he or she was not free to leave and that the State had failed to \u201coffer any legitimate justification as to an asserted need to gather medical information simultaneously with the administration of ... medical treatment by a hospital to an injured accident victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 637 A.2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>is clearly distinguishable from the present cases. Here defendant was not physically detained nor subjected to continuous police supervision for a substantial period of time prior to giving her statements. Eather, the circumstances surrounding the taking of both statements indicate that she was not in custody. The police requested permission to speak to defendant on both occasions. No guards were posted outside the door of her hospital room, nor was she formally arrested. Others were permitted to be present during the interviews, and there was no overbearing police conduct. We conclude that the questioning of defendant both in the emergency room and the intensive care unit did not constitute custodial interrogation and that her statements were properly admitted despite the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Defendant next argues that the trial judge\u2019s reinstruction to the jury in response to a question relating to the differences between the charges of reckless manslaughter and death by auto constituted reversible error. Since no objection was made, the plain error standard must be met. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The crime of reckless manslaughter is based on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C.T1-4b(l), which provides that \u201c[cjriminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when ... [i]t is committed recklessly.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To determine whether the death <em>of </em>Madera was a homicide, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>had to find that defendant operated her vehicle recklessly by consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death would result from her conduct. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2(b)(3); <em>State v. Bowens, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 553, 501 A.2d 577 (App.Div.1985), aff<em>'d, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>622, 532 A.2d 215 (1987). Since the death was caused by a motor vehicle, the jury also had for its consideration the \u201cdeath by auto\u201d statute as a lesser-included offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The mental element of \u201crecklessness\u201d required for manslaughter is greater than that required for death by auto. That is, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201ccausative acts of recklessness that are different in kind from the acts involved in reckless driving that support a conviction for death by auto.\u201d <em>State v. Jamerson, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>318, 334, 708 A.2d 1183 (1998); <em>State v. Jiminez, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 584, 608 A.2d 996 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">While driving under the influence may alone satisfy the recklessness required by the death by auto statute, <em>Jamerson, supra, </em>at 334, 708 A.2d 1183; <em>State v. LaBrutto, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>187, 204, 553 A.2d 335 (1989), more is required for reckless manslaughter. When the State relies on the extent of drinking as an additional act constituting recklessness which caused death, the drinking must \u201cbe more than casual drinking and more than mere intoxication, rather, it would have to be exceptional drinking to a marked extent.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Scher, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 269, 650 A.2d 1012 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>276, 658 A.2d 299 (1995). The conduct while driving or prior to driving must be \u201cso extraordinary and extreme as to satisfy the reckless manslaughter standard.\u201d <em>Scher, supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 269, 650 A.2d 1012. The deviation from reasonable care must be gross so to satisfy the element of recklessness in a reckless manslaughter case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In the instant case, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that a determination of reckless manslaughter required the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>jury to find an additional act of recklessness beyond the reckless driving itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">Let me try to differentiate for you the difference between the manslaughter counts and death by auto statute. Standing alone the reckless driving of an automobile, which results in the death of another, satisfies all of the requirements for violation of the death by auto statute provided, of course, that you are so convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Now, a reckless manslaughter, and that\u2019s the middle one, that\u2019s the one step up from death by auto, a reckless manslaughter conviction on the other hand must be based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant engaged in an additional act or acts of recklessness beyond the mere driving of an automobile in a reckless manner and that such act or acts were also a cause of the victim\u2019s death. Such causative aets of recklessness must be different in kind from, although not necessarily worse than, those involved in reckless driving. The additional act or acts of recklessness must be conduct of the Defendant in addition to the recklessness in her operation of the motor vehicle. The additional aets of recklessness may occur but need not occur at the same time of the reckless driving, but may precede the reckless driving. This is not to say that someone guilty of reckless manslaughter may not have been driving recklessly as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">So as to satisfy the requirements of death by auto, but to find a person ... guilty of reckless manslaughter where an automobile is involved, there must be aets of recklessness separate and apart from and in addition to the manner in driving and these aets must have been a cause of the victim\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">After deliberations commenced the jury submitted a request for reinstruction on the elements of each charge. The trial judge stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">Now, having said all that, I will again attempt to differentiate between the aggravated manslaughter, reckless manslaughter and death by auto. Standing alone the reckless driving of an automobile, which results in the death of another, satisfies all of the requirements for violation of the death by auto statute provided that you are so convinced of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">A reckless manslaughter, that\u2019s the second one now, a reckless manslaughter conviction on the other hand must bo based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant engaged In an additional act or acts of recklessness beyond the mere driving of an automobile in a reckless manner and that such act or acts were also a cause of the victim\u2019s death. Such causative acts of recklessness must be different in kind from, although not necessarily worse than, those involved in reckless driving. The additional act or aets of recklessness must be conduct of the Defendant in addition to the recklessness in her operation of the motor vehicle. The additional acts of recklessness may occur but need not occur at the same time of the reckless driving, but may precede the reckless driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">In this case, the State has argued that the Defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol before driving is an additional act of recklessness. This is not to say that someone guilty of reckless manslaughter may not have been driving recklessly as well. So <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>as to satisfy the requirements of death by auto, but to find a person guilty of reckless manslaughter where an automobile is involved, there must be acts of recklessness separate and apart from and in addition to the manner of driving and these acts must have been a cause of the person\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">No objection was made to this re-charge. Thereafter the jury made an addition request to be reinstructed on the definition of \u201crecklessness.\u201d Rather than reciting the definition again, the trial judge elected over the State\u2019s objection to provide the jury with a chart blowup of the definition prepared by the defense and used as a visual aid by the defense in opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Defendant argues that the reinstruction was reversible plain error because the jury should have been told that \u201cmere intoxication\u201d would not suffice and that the defendant\u2019s drinking must have been extreme and exceptional. However this case is not one in which the only enhancement of recklessness rested upon the consumption of alcohol. The jury could well have found that defendant was racing with another car at grossly excessive speed on a two-lane State highway while passing other vehicles and going around blind curves. In our view, such a degree of reckless operation taken together with the consumption of alcohol constitutes a sufficient basis to support the conviction for reckless manslaughter in this case. Accordingly, we find that the jury charge and re-charge fairly conveyed the law and that in any event there was no plain error or error sufficient to adversely affect the substantial rights of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Finally, we find no basis to upset the imposition of the presumptive seven year sentence. The sentencing judge properly considered and weighed the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors, including the defendant\u2019s physical injuries resulting from the accident. There was no clear error of judgment to shock the judicial conscience. <em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989); <em>State v.
