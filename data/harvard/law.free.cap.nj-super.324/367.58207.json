On April 12, 1993, Brian Gilmartin, then thirty-four, died due to an overdose of the drug colchicine. Colchicine therapy had been prescribed by defendant, Dr. Herman J. Weinreb, as a treatment for decedent\u2019s multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr. Weinreb\u2019s office was located in New York City, but the Gilmartins, Brian and his wife Annette, the plaintiff herein, lived in Monmouth County, New Jersey. For the Gilmar-tins\u2019 convenience, beginning in April 1992, Brian\u2019s weekly injections of colchicine were administered by Old Bridge Medical Associates (Old Bridge), a New Jersey medical group which included Dr. S. Alan Weinstein and his son, Dr. Jeffrey W. Weinstein. Old Bridge\u2019s physicians administered the drug to Brian every Saturday morning. Although Dr. Weinreb had recommended Dr. Menosh, a New Jersey physician experienced in the use of colchicine to treat MS, the Gilmartins selected Old Bridge because the Weinsteins had treated Mrs. Gilmartin and her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Colchicine is toxic when administered in greater than recommended doses, but when administered in nontoxic doses it alleviates some symptoms of MS. Defendant prescribed a weekly dose of 4 milligrams (4 mg), which is the maximum recommended weekly dose. In 1992 Eli Lilly &amp; Company (Lilly), the only manufacturer of liquid colchicine, supplied it in ampules containing 0.5 mg per cc (a \u201cec\u201d equals a milliliter). This translates into a concentration of 1 milligram (lmg) per every 2 milliliters (2 ml). Thus, Gilmartin\u2019s prescription required the injection of 8 ml (8 cc\u2019s) of colchicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In April 1993, the Gilmartins informed Dr. Weinreb that Old Bridge was having difficulty obtaining colchicine in liquid form. Apparently, Lilly had terminated the manufacture of colchicine for intravenous administration. To accommodate the Gilmartins, defendant had a batch of liquid colchicine prepared by a pharmaceutical laboratory in Colorado. Defendant instructed the pharmacy to (a) prepare the colchicine in a new concentration of 2 mg per 1 ml, which was four times greater than the old concentration of 0.5 mg per 1 ml, and (b) package the colchicine in 30 cc vials, each containing 25 cc\u2019s of colchicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Upon receipt of these vials, defendant, on April 3, 1993, mailed one vial to Brian, along with a letter that said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Enclosed is the intravenous colchicine prepared by the pharmacist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">PLEASE NOTE THIS IS 2MG PER ML. IT IS HIGHER CONCENTRATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">THAN YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">The MAXIMUM DOSE PER INJECTION IS 4 MG OR 2 ML.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">Please give this to your doctor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">At 9:30 a.m. on April 10, 1993, Brian arrived at Old Bridge\u2019s office for his weekly colchicine injection, and delivered the vial and letter. Martha Sehikschneit, a medical assistant, prepared Gil-martin\u2019s medication in a syringe with a 10 ec capacity, and Dr. S. Alan Weinstein injected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">By 3:00 p.m. on April 10, 1993, Brian began to feel ill. At 4:30 p.m. on Monday, April 12, 1993, he suddenly stopped breathing, and he was pronounced dead at his home at 4:50 p.m. The cause of death was multi-organ dysfunction due to the toxic effects of colchicine. The evidence leads to the irresistible conclusion that Weinstein had injected Brian with at least 4 ml (8 mg) of colchi-cine, 2 times the prescribed dose, and perhaps as much as 8 ml (16 mg), which would have been 4 times the maximum safe dosage.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">In her complaint, plaintiff, Annette Gilmartin, Brian\u2019s wife, alleged negligence by Old Bridge and the Weinsteins for giving Brian a toxic overdose of colchicine on April 10, 1993, and for not disclosing the overdose to defendant, Dr. Weinreb, when he telephoned Jeffrey Weinstein on the morning of April 12, 1993. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Plaintiff alleged negligence by Dr. Weinreb for not recommending the immediate hospitalization of Brian after plaintiff informed him of Brian\u2019s symptoms by telephone on the morning of April 12, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">During the trial, the Weinsteins settled with plaintiff. Following this settlement, plaintiff pressed a claim of lack of informed consent against defendant, alleging that he never had informed Brian of the risks of a colchicine overdose.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The jurors answered \u201cno\u201d (8-0) to verdict sheet question 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\n<em>RE: INFORMED CONSENT</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">1.

Eetum your verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-20\">Plaintiff filed no motion for a new trial. On April 13, 1998, the judge entered a judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-21\">\n<em>Informed Consent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in several respects regarding the informed consent claim. Arguably, plaintiffs con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tentions are valid. We do not reach them, however, because we conclude that a physician has no duty to inform a patient of the risk of negligent treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court should not have submitted an informed consent issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In <em>Largey v. Rothman, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>204, 540 A.2d 504 (1988), our Supreme Court, relying on <em>Canterbury v. Spence, </em>464 F.2d 772 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>1064, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>560, 34 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>518 (1972), reformulated the elements of a medical negligence action based on the lack of informed consent. Under <em>Largey, </em>plaintiff must establish that the risk of the injury which plaintiff claims to have sustained as a result of medical treatment would have influenced a prudent patient in reaching a decision on whether to undergo the treatment. If so, then the physician deviated from informed consent standards if the physician had not advised plaintiff of that risk. <em>Id. </em>at 212-14, 540 A.2d 504. Additionally, plaintiff must establish causation. Causation is established if a prudent person in the patient\u2019s position would have declined treatment if he had been informed adequately of the risk that resulted in harm. <em>Largey, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 216, 540 A.2d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">As explained in <em>Canterbury, supra, </em>464 <em>F.2d </em>772, the physician must only disclose the \u201cinherent and potential hazards of the proposed treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787. In addition, the \u201cunrevealed risk that should have been made known must materialize,\u201d the \u201c[o]ceurrence of the risk must be harmful to the patient,\u201d and a causal connection must exist between the physician\u2019s failure to disclose \u201crisks incidental to [the] treatment\u201d and the patient\u2019s injury, and does so exist only when disclosure of the \u201cinherent and potential hazards of the proposed treatment\u201d would have resulted in the patient \u201cforegoing the treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787, 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The disclosure standard is the same in New Jersey. The physician must only disclose the \u201crisks associated with the proposed treatment\u201d and \u201cdangers associated with ... [the] proposed course of treatment.\u201d <em>Calabrese v. Trenton State College, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 156-57, 392 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>321, 413 A.2d 315 (1980). As explained in <em>Battenfeld v.

Mastromonaco, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>26, 733 A.2d 456 (1999) (holding that physician has duty to explain risks of noninvasive treatment, bedrest, as well as alternatives to that treatment); <em>Gracia v. Meiselman, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 323, 531 A.2d 1373 (Law Div.1987) (\u201cIn an informed consent case the violation of duty consists of the physician\u2019s neglect to inform the patient of an inherent risk in the proposed operation.\u201d); <em>Block v.

It was caused by the negligence of a third party or parties in administering the drug. This ease should be contrasted with <em>Calabrese, supra. </em>There, plaintiff had received an anti-rabies vaccine because the <em>dog </em>which had bit him was never found and, therefore, could not be tested. Although Calabrese did not contract rabies, he was affected with certain neurological side effects which were a known risk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>vaccine, even when properly administered. 162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 150, 392 A.2d 600. There was evidence that the treating physician had not advised Calabrese of those inherent risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">A physician, however, is \u201cnot responsible for failing to disclose a risk\u201d which is \u201cnot inherent in the procedure,\u201d and a physician \u201cneed not discuss a risk of the improper performance of an appropriate procedure.\u201d 61 <em>Am.Jur.2d Physicians, Surgeons, and Other Healers </em>\u00a7 191 (1981). In the case of a drug, an \u201cinherent risk\u201d of the drug is \u201cone which exists in and is inseparable from the drug itself.\u201d <em>Barclay v. Campbell, </em>704 S.W.2d 8, 10 (Tex.1986). For example, \u201ctardive dyskinesia is an inherent risk associated with neuroleptic drugs,\u201d in that tardive dyskinesia \u201carises from the use of the drug and not from any defect in the drug or negligent human intervention.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In the case of a \u201cmedical procedure,\u201d a \u201crisk inherent in the medical procedure performed\u201d means that the \u201crisk is one which exists in and is inseparable from the procedure .itself.\u201d <em>Jones v. Papp, </em>782 S.W.2d 236, 240 (Tex.App.1989). For example, \u201csurgery\u201d is not a \u201crisk inherent\u201d in the \u201cpurely investigative or diagnostic procedure known as coronary angiography,\u201d because <em>\u201csurgery is not an intended part of the coronary angiography procedure.\u201d Id. </em>at 240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">A physician owes his or her patient a duty to disclose the \u201cdangers inherent ... in the treatment proposed\u201d so that the patient will be in a position to make an intelligent decision whether or not to submit to the course of treatment that the physician \u201cproposes to take.\u201d <em>Block v. McVay, supra, </em>126 N.W.2d at 812. By the same token, because the informed consent doctrine is \u201cconcerned with instances of performance of treatments recognized to have inherent and probable substantial risks associated with them,\u201d a physician does not have a duty to disclose the \u201crisks of the improper performance of an appropriate procedure\u201d or the \u201cdangers in the procedure if not done properly.\u201d <em>Mallett v.

We are persuaded that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a physician has no duty to inform a patient of the risk of negligent treatment. Negligence can arise in such a rich variety of circumstances and contexts that a physician cannot anticipate and define all eventualities for a patient. Merely to advise a patient of the general risk of negligence by a physician, nurse, or technician is inadequate to the purposes of the informed consent rule which is to provide the patient with the ability to \u201cevaluate knowledgeably\u201d the available options and attendant risks. <em>Perna v. Pirozzi, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>446, 459, 457 A.2d 431 (1983). Similarly, a general warning of negligence would pose difficulties in establishing causation, ie., that the patient would have made a different decision if adequately informed. Moreover, we impute constructive knowledge to all patients that a negligent act by a caregiver can cause injury, whether the negligent caregiver is a surgeon, pharmacist, nurse or ambulance driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\n<em>Physician\u2019s Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Plaintiff contended below that Dr. Weinreb misdiagnosed Brian\u2019s condition on Monday, April 12 and that defendant should have hospitalized Brian that morning.

According to Annette, Allen said it sounded as if Brian had received too much medicine and advised Annette to give Brian lots of fluids.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Geraldine Allen\u2019s deposition was read to the jury. Allen received two phone calls from Annette on Easter Sunday evening. Annette told Allen at 7:00 p.m.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">Brian is very nauseous, vomiting, very weak. Annette told me Brian went to Dr. Weinstein on Saturday for an injection of colchicine. Brian told Dr. Weinstein the dosage was too much. He never got that much. I asked Annette if she gave the letter of instructions to the doctor before he was given the injection. She said yes. I told her to keep Brian quiet til morning and I would get Dr. Weinreb to call in the a.m. She told me Brian was in bed all day Easter Sunday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">According to Allen, Annette declined Allen\u2019s offer to call Dr. Weinreb, saying that \u201cshe just wanted me to be aware of the call; that it was not an emergency.\u201d Allen had also suggested that Annette take Brian to an emergency room since Brian \u201cwas fatigued and weak and that he had been vomiting.\u201d Annette responded that Brian did not want to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Allen also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">At 10 p.m. I had go\u00fcen a call. I don\u2019t remember if I called her or she called me. I got the call. She told me that he was still very weak and then I asked her if he had eaten anything. And, you know, she said no. I said to just keep him quiet. I said, but I would advise you, you know, do you want me to call Dr. Weinreb? She said, Geri-that\u2019s when she told me about the dosage. She said that he was very angry. And I could hear him in the background yelling and I said, Annette, let me talk to Brian. So she put him on the phone and he was angry because he had gotten \u2014 he had gone to Dr. Weinstein\u2019s office and had gotten the injection of colchicine. And he was angry because he says he kept yelling at the nurse and the doctor, to Dr. Weinstein, that they never got that much. I never asked the dosage. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Again Brian declined Allen\u2019s offer to call Dr. Weinreb, telling Annette \u201cno, I\u2019m okay, but just make sure he knows everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Defendant called Annette the next morning. Each testified to sharply different versions of their conversations. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Annette, she described for Dr. Weinreb a substantial list of symptoms, including rapid heartbeat, dilated pupils, shallow breathing, bluish tinge to his skin and clammy skin. Annette testified defendant told her that Brian had received an overdose of colchicine and that defendant had confirmed an overdose with Dr. Weinstein. Annette told the jury Dr. Weinreb informed her there was no antidote, there was nothing to do except give Brian fluids and that Brian would have to \u201cride it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Dr. Weinreb testified that when he called Annette on Monday morning, she told him about Brian\u2019s vomiting, nausea and diarrhea but she stated that those symptoms had subsided and that Brian had showered that morning though he was weak and would not be going to work. Annette expressed concern about the dosage. She wanted defendant to verify with Dr. Weinstein that the proper dosage had been given. Dr. Weinreb called Old Bridge and spoke with Dr. Jeffrey Weinstein who said that his father, Alan, had given the injection but that Alan was not available. Jeffrey, however, checked the chart and informed defendant that Brian had received 4 mg. of colchicine, the correct dosage. Dr. Weinreb instructed Jeffrey to reduce the dosage to 3 mg. for the next injection because defendant was concerned that Brian was developing an intolerance for the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">After his conversation with Jeffrey Weinstein, defendant called Annette and told her that Brian had received the correct dosage. According to defendant, Annette said that Brian had eaten cereal, was taking fluids and seemed to be better. Dr. Weinreb testified that Annette never mentioned that Brian had difficulty breathing and had a rapid heartbeat. He denied telling her that Brian had received an overdose and would have to \u201cride it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Dr. Weinreb agreed that an overdose of colchicine could be fatal and would constitute a medical emergency requiring hospitalization and management of the patient\u2019s symptoms. He testified that he initially had suspected that Brian had received an overdose, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>he rejected that diagnosis based on several factors. One of the factors was Jeffrey Weinstein\u2019s assurance that the chart reflected an injection of 4 mg. Another factor was the absence of vomiting and diarrhea by Monday morning. Additionally, Annette had reported that Brian was improving, <em>i.e., </em>he had showered and eaten some cereal. Dr. Weinreb testified that if Brian had received an overdose, he would have been getting progressively worse; instead, he was improving.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Plaintiff presented experts in the use, effect and toxicity of colchicine. They agreed that the 4 mg dosage prescribed by Dr. Weinreb was appropriate. They agreed that an overdose of colchicine was potentially fatal at levels above <em>7H\u00bf </em>mg, that dosage being the lowest dosage known to have caused a death. The experts, and the medical examiner who performed the autopsy testified that a colchicine overdose had killed Brian due to multiple organ dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Dr. Robert Rodvien testified there is no antidote for colchicine toxicity. The patient must be hospitalized and placed in intensive care for management and treatment of symptoms and support of cardiac and respiratory function. According to Dr. Rodvien, the cessation of vomiting and diarrhea within 24-36 hours after an overdose does not signify improvement because the bowel becomes paralyzed as a result of colchicine toxicity during that time period. According to Dr. Rodvien, Dr. Weinreb deviated from the applicable standard of care by not referring Brian to a physician or hospital \u201cto be seen, evaluated and treated.\u201d Dr. Rodvien testified that if Brian had been hospitalized on Monday morning, \u201cit\u2019s more probable than not, that his life would have been saved\u201d and that the failure to hospitalize Brian increased the risk of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Dr. Norman Ertel testified that Brian received a minimum dosage of 8 mg of colchicine. Dr. Rodvien opined that Brian had received 10 mg.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Dr. D\u2019Angelo testified as an expert witness for defendant, and supported defendant\u2019s position that the symptoms reported by Annette did not justify a diagnosis of colchicine overdose.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The trial judge used the version of Model Jury Charge 5.356(A) in effect in March 1998 when the case was tried. It instructs the jury that a physician is not liable for a diagnosis or treatment resulting from the physician\u2019s exercise of judgment. Our Supreme Court addressed this instruction in <em>Morlino v. Medical Center of Ocean County, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>563, 706 A.2d 721 (1998), decided the day after the Gilmartin trial began. The Court affirmed the appropriate role of a jury instruction recognizing \u201cthe critical role of judgment\u201d in the practice of medicine. <em>Id. </em>at 587, 706 A.2d 721. Substantively, the Court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">In selecting among alternative treatments, however, the doctor must exercise his or her judgment and select from alternatives that are objectively reasonable. The selection of an alternative that is objectively unreasonable would violate the doctor\u2019s duty of care to the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 583-84, 706 A.2d 721.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The Court, however, found the following sentence in the Model Charge to be problematic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">The physician cannot be held liable if, in the exercise of his judgment, he nevertheless made a mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">[Id at 588, 706 A.2d 721.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">We shall refer to this sentence as the \u201cmistake sentence.\u201d Regarding the \u201cmistake sentence\u201d the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">The danger is that the sentence could be construed to mean that an honest, but mistaken, exercise of judgment insulates the physician from liability for a mistake that violates a relevant standard of care. A mistake, however, connotes an instance in which the physician violates such a standard of care. Consequently, a physician who fails to abide by an objective standard of care is subject to liability even if the failure results from the exercise of judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">[Id at 589, 706 A.2d 721.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">Despite its criticism of the \u201cmistake sentence,\u201d the Court affirmed the judgment in favor of the defendant physician. It agreed with the Appellate Division that the Model Charge, \u201cwhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>read in its entirety, does not have the capacity to mislead the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 706 A.2d 721. Nevertheless, the Court referred the Model Charge to the Supreme Court Committee on Model Jury Charges, Civil, to review Model Jury Charge 5.36(A). Regarding the \u201cmistake sentence,\u201d the Court ordered the Committee to eliminate it \u201cbecause of its potential to confuse the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 706 A.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In the present case, the trial judge, despite plaintiffs objections, included the \u201cmistake sentence\u201d in its instructions regarding a physician\u2019s judgment. In doing so, the trial judge relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Morlino </em>that the charge in its entirety was not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Cases, however, must be decided on their facts. The facts in <em>Morlino </em>included \u201ccompelling evidence that [defendant] Dr. Dugenio conformed to prevailing medical standards by carefully weighing the risk of administering Cipro [Ciprofloxacin] against its benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 706 A.2d 721.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, the Court deemed use of the \u201cmistake sentence\u201d to be harmless in the circumstances of that case. In the present case, we conclude that in the face of compelling evidence of Dr. Weinreb\u2019s deviation the \u201cmistake sentence\u201d had the capacity to confuse the jury and tip the scales in defendant\u2019s favor. Additionally, the jury instruction regarding a physician\u2019s judgment was given in the abstract without an attempt to relate the principles of law to the evidence in the case. <em>See Brough v. Hidden Valley, Inc., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. 139, </em>146, 711 A.2d 382 (App.Div.1998); <em>Vallejo by Morales v. Rahway Police Dept., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 342, 678 A.2d 1135 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>262, 686 A.2d 763 (1996). We are persuaded, therefore, to reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Brian had received colchicine injections for approximately one year, almost 52 of them, with only limited side effects. For the first time since defendant began treating Brian in 1989, the Gilmartins reached out for Dr. Weinreb on a Sunday night, Easter Sunday. On Monday morning, Dr. Weinreb was informed that Brian, a person with a degree in chemical engineering, believed he had received an overdose. Brian\u2019s belief was based on his observation of the amount of fluid in the syringe. Defendant also was informed that Brian experienced symptoms consistent with an overdose. The fact that these events occurred the first time the Weinsteins injected Brian using the higher concentration should have alerted Dr. Weinreb to the probability that the Weinsteins had erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Defendant admitted that he suspected an overdose, but ruled it out in part because Dr. Jeffrey Weinstein had assured defendant that Brian had been given the appropriate dosage. A jury could have determined that Dr. Weinstein\u2019s assurances were virtually worthless. An overdose would have been inadvertent and the Weinsteins would not necessarily know whether they had given Brian a double dose.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Dr. Weinreb testified that he also relied on the cessation of vomiting and diarrhea and Annette\u2019s statement that Brian had showered, eaten cereal, and was feeling better. Plaintiffs expert testified that cessation of vomiting and diarrhea does not signify improvement in the case of a colchicine overdose. Rather, it means that the patient is entering the second phase of colchicine poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The alternatives facing Dr. Weinreb on Easter Monday were no treatment, which he chose, or referral to a local physician or hospital for a hands-on clinical examination of Brian in light of the history of suspected colchicine poisoning. The point is, that the alternative not selected was not dangerous or invasive and carried little, if any, down-side risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>On this evidence, a jury could have determined that where the stakes were survival or death, Dr. Weinreb made a \u201cmistake.\u201d The jury was told, however, that a physician who exercises judgment is not liable for a mistake, and thereby could have been misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We also observe that the jury instruction was delivered in the abstract. Relating the principles of law to the evidence and the fact determinations the jury had to make might have alleviated the impact of the mistake sentence. The trial court should have instructed the jury regarding the conflict between defendant and Annette about the content of their conversations on Easter Monday. The jury should have been instructed to determine from the evidence what was said at that time, and then to evaluate defendant\u2019s conduct. The jury also should have been instructed to evaluate Dr. Weinreb\u2019s conduct, even if the jury rejected Annette\u2019s credibility in this regard. Such an instruction would have avoided a verdict based solely on the jury\u2019s determination that in her testimony Annette had embellished her Easter Monday conversations with Dr. Weinreb.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The jury should have been instructed that it had to determine whether it was objectively reasonable for defendant to have ignored Brian\u2019s belief that he had been overdosed. Brian\u2019s belief was not based solely on his symptoms; it was based on his observation, as a chemical engineer, of the amount of fluid in a 10 cc syringe.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The jury should have been instructed whether it was objectively reasonable for defendant to have relied on Dr. Jeffrey Weinstein\u2019s assurance regarding the dosage administered to Brian.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Undoubtedly, Brian\u2019s rejection of Allen\u2019s suggestion that Brian go to an emergency room and his instruction not to call Dr. Weinreb Easter Sunday could support an inference that Brian did not consider his condition to be serious. Such an inference would tend to coiToborate Dr. Weinreb\u2019s testimony regarding Brian\u2019s symptoms as reported to him, and to corroborate Dr. Weinreb\u2019s judgment as to the severity and significance of Brian\u2019s symptoms. However, the Gilmartins did not know that an overdose could be lethal. A jury could determine that their ignorance diluted the significance of Brian\u2019s reluctance to go to an emergency room or speak with defendant on Sunday night.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Additionally, the expert\u2019s testimony that cessation of vomiting and diarrhea did not mean improvement was potentially significant evidence. If deemed credible, a jury could have concluded that Dr. Weinreb had misunderstood the information he admitted getting and relying on.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Plaintiffs contention that the instruction regarding a physician\u2019s judgment should not have been given is without merit. Plaintiff accused Dr. Weinreb of an improper diagnosis of Brian\u2019s condition on Easter Monday. Except in the unusual case, diagnosis requires an exercise of judgment. This is such a ease. <em>See Aiello v. Muhlenberg Regional Medical Center, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>618, 733 A.2d 433 (1999) (noting that \u201cour courts consistently have limited the application of the \u2018exercise of judgment\u2019 charge to medical malpractice actions concerning misdiagnosis or the selection of one of two or more generally accepted courses of treatment\u201d (159 <em>N.J. </em>at 628-29, 733 A.2d 433)).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Informed Consent Revisited</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">We now readdress informed consent. We have rejected plaintiffs theory that defendant failed to get Brian\u2019s informed consent to colchicine therapy in 1992 because he did not tell Brian that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Colchicine could be lethal if he accidently received an overdose. Although plaintiff did not raise it, an informed consent issue lurks in Dr. Weinreb\u2019s \u201ctreatment\u201d of Brian on Easter Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In April 1992, when defendant placed Brian on colchicine therapy, defendant was treating Brian for multiple sclerosis. On Easter Monday, 1993, however, the Gilmartins consulted Dr. Weinreb regarding Brian\u2019s acute physical condition and his suspicion that he had received an overdose of colchicine. Defendant marshaled the available information, made a diagnosis ruling out colchicine overdose and, based on that diagnosis, formulated a treatment plan. The treatment plan was to see Brian sometime that week.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Dr. Weinreb conceded that he never told the Gilmartins that a colchicine overdose was potentially lethal. None <em>of </em>the written material defendant gave Brian informed him of colchicine\u2019s lethality. The issue is whether Dr. Weinreb had a duty on Easter Monday to disclose to the Gilmartins the fact that an overdose can be lethal and that if Brian had received an overdose the treatment would be immediate hospitalization in an attempt to manage the symptoms of colchicine poisoning. Armed with that information, and in light of his initial suspicion that he had been given too much medicine, Brian may have rejected Dr. Weinreb\u2019s \u201ctreatment\u201d plan and opted for the alternative treatment of immediate hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">We are reluctant to rule on this issue because we have raised it <em>sua sponte </em>and it has not been briefed. Moreover, such a duty would be equivalent to requiring a physician to advise a patient of a diagnosis not made. Courts considering such a duty have rejected it. <em>See Backlund v. University of Washington, </em>137 Wash.2d 651, 975 P.2d 950, 956 (1999) (observing that a misdiagnosis is a matter of medical negligence, but does not fall within principles of informed consent); <em>Pratt v. University of Minnesota Affiliated Hospitals &amp; Clinics, </em>414 N.W.2d 399, 401-01 (Minn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>1987) (holding that principles of informed consent do not require a physician to inform a patient that a diagnosis may be incorrect). The present ease may be distinguishable, however, because here the patient, a chemical engineer, presented an overdose hypothesis and the circumstances established a well-grounded suspicion that the patient was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">On the other hand, disclosure of the drug\u2019s lethality in the event of an overdose may be the equivalent of informing a patient of available alternative diagnostic techniques. <em>See Keogan v. Holy Family Hospital, </em>95 <em>Wash.2d </em>306, 622 P.2d 1246, 1252-53 (1980) (holding that physician had duty, in face of acute abnormality, \u201cto inform the patient of potentially fatal causes of his abnormality and the means of ruling out or confirming this source of illness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We leave further consideration of this issue to the parties and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\n<em>United States Pharmacopoeia</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Plaintiff contends the judge \u201cerred in refusing to take judicial notice and in prohibiting plaintiff to establish through expert testimony that the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) is the standard of care for formulation, packaging and shipment of Colchicine\u201d and, as a result, he \u201cwrongfully dismissed plaintiffs negligence claim\u201d against defendant for \u201cimproperly packaging and shipping\u201d to Gilmartin a \u201chigher concentration of Colchicine in a multi-dose vial ... contrary to guidelines established in the USP for Colchicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Plaintiff relies specifically on the following language in the USP regarding liquid colchicine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">Caution - Colchicine is extremely poisonous. Packaging and storage - - Preserve in single-dose containers, preferably of Type I glass, protected from light.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Plaintiff argues that the USP established a standard applicable to Dr. Weinreb\u2019s use of multi-dose containers and that the purpose of the USP single-dose container standard was to prevent an overdose. The trial court refused to submit this issue to the jury because none of plaintiffs expert witnesses so testified. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>testimony in the record regarding the applicability of this USP standard was from Dr. Weinreb on plaintiffs cross-examination. He testified that the USP applied to drug manufacturers and pharmacists, but not to practicing physicians. He denied that prevention of overdose is the rationale behind the single-dose container requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling. In <em>Morlino, supra, </em>the Court also addressed the admissibility of pharmaceutical package inserts reproduced in the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference (PDR). The Court held that the package inserts and the PDR are admissible to establish a physician\u2019s standard of care when supported by expert testimony. <em>Morlino, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 579-82, 706 A.2d 721. We are persuaded that the Court\u2019s reasoning applies to the USP.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The judgment in favor of Dr. Weinreb is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\"> Defendant cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s determination to submit the informed consent issue to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> The colchicine was administered with 2cc of another drug. Using the old concentration, Brian had received 8cc of colchicine and 2cc of the other drug, filling a 10 cc syringe. Under the new concentration Brian should have received a total of 4cc of fluid. Dr. Weinstein used a 10 cc syringe. It should have been less than half full.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic Dr. Dugenio prescribed for Ms. Morlino to treat a \"sore throat\u201d which a throat culture had indicated was the result of Hemophi-lus influenza bacteria which is resistant to other antibiotics. Plaintiff alleged that the drug killed her fetus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> During cross-examination of Annette by counsel for Old Bridge and the Weinsteins, it was established that Annette had retained counsel within a few hours after Brian's death. In the absence of unusual circumstances, this line of questioning should not be permitted on retrial since the potential for undue prejudice is substantial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
