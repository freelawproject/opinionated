THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY IMPOSING CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In a <em>pro se </em>brief, defendant raises the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">1. WAS THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A PAIR TRIAL UNDER THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND <em>N.J.S.A. </em>CONST. ART. 1, PAR. 10 VIOLATED IN THAT DEFENSE COUNSEL WAS ALSO EMPLOYED IN THE SAME COUNTY, AND AT THE SAME TIME AS A PART-TIME PROSECUTOR?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">2. WAS THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL UNDER THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND <em>N.J.S.A </em>CONST. ART. I, PAR. 10 VIOLATED BY THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO HOLD AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING INTO THE APPROPRIATENESS/INAPPROPRIATENESS FOR MR. WRIGHT CONTINUING AS DEFENSE COUNSEL IN LIGHT OF HIS WORKING FOR BOTH THE PROSECUTOR AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER\u2019S OFFICE?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Defendant maintains in his <em>pro se </em>brief, which is uncontroverted by the State, that his trial counsel was also a part-time municipal prosecutor in New Brunswick, a municipality located in the county where defendant was tried. Defendant was unaware of his counsel\u2019s other position during trial and did not learn of it until long after the completion of his trial and sentence. We hold that it is impermissible for a part-time municipal prosecutor in a municipality located in the county where defendant is tried to represent a criminal defendant, and therefore reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The State produced evidence that defendant improperly touched two young girls, who were friends, in their \u201cprivate\u201d areas in April 1992 in Jamesburg. Both girls were less than thirteen years of age when the assaults occurred. At trial, both victims testified to defendant\u2019s conduct. The State also presented the testimony of the mother of one of the victims and a police officer who both testified to other statements by the child victims pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(27), following a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(a) hearing. Furthermore, the State produced two neighbors of one victim who witnessed defendant assault the other victim. Finally, the State presented the testimony of an inmate who was housed in a cell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>next to defendant\u2019s two weeks prior to trial. The inmate testified to inculpatory statements made by defendant. The inmate also testified that: \u201c[defendant] felt he was going to beat this in trial because [two] witnesses ... weren\u2019t available and the little kids were in foster care and the little kids [defendant] felt were too young, that a jury wouldn\u2019t believe the little kids.\u201d With this evidence the jury convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Defendant\u2019s defense was handled by E. Ronald Wright, an attorney with offices in New Brunswick, who was also a part-time municipal prosecutor in New Brunswick. Wright was apparently assigned to represent defendant by the Public Defender\u2019s office. Defendant was unaware of Wright\u2019s position as a part-time municipal prosecutor during the trial and only learned of his position when he read an article in the Newark Star Ledger newspaper dated August 18,1998. The article reported Wright\u2019s involvement as a part-time municipal prosecutor in New Brunswick from 1976 to 1980 and again from April 1992 to some point in 1998. Wright\u2019s last stint as municipal prosecutor encompassed the period he represented defendant, who was tried in January 1994 and sentenced on November 7,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">As we see the issue, the question is whether a municipal prosecutor can also serve as a defense attorney in an indictable criminal matter that is tried in the same county as the municipality where the attorney is a prosecutor. The answer to this question \u201crests on an evaluation of the potential for the appearance of impropriety.\u201d <em>In re Opinion 662 of the Advisory Comm. on Prof. Ethics, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>22, 27, 626 A.2d 1084 (1993). <em>RPC </em>1.7(c)(2) states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">in certain cases or situations creating an appearance of impropriety rather than an actual conflict, multiple representation is not permissible, that is, in those situations in which an ordinary knowledgeable citizen acquainted with the facts would conclude that the multiple representation poses substantial risk of disservice to either the public interest or the interest of one of the clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>To determine whether an appearance of impropriety is created we must look at the \u201cfrequency of antagonistic relations\u201d between a municipal prosecutor and a defense attorney. <em>Opinion 662, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 626 A.2d 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">\u201cA ... municipality may employ an attorney-at-law as a prosecutor, <em>under the supervision of the Attorney General or county prosecutor, </em>who may represent the State ... or municipality in any matter within the jurisdiction of the ... municipal court.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:12-27 (emphasis added). This statute makes clear that a municipal prosecutor is under the supervision of the Attorney General or county prosecutor, the offices that generally prosecute indictable offenses. Although the statute was enacted in 1996, after defendant\u2019s trial, it did not establish new law but simply set forth the long established relationship between municipal prosecutors and the two other prosecuting authorities in this State. <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>2A: 158-4 and 5 give the Attorney General and county prosecutors plenary jurisdiction to prosecute all criminal matters in this State.\u201d <em>State v. Downie, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 209 n. 1, 550 A.2d 1313 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>450, 569 A.2d 242, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>819, 111 S.Ct. 63, <em>112 L.Ed.2d </em>38 (1990). The power of the Attorney General and county prosecutors permits them to prosecute all \u201coffenders against the laws\u201d including those that are traditionally prosecuted by municipal prosecutors in municipal courts. <em>Ibid. </em>With this \u201cprimary authority to prosecute,\u201d the Attorney General and county prosecutors \u201cmay supersede the various municipal prosecutors.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, it is clear that a municipal prosecutor is the third level of a tripartite system of prosecution in this State. To permit a municipal prosecutor to act as a defense attorney in the same county creates a clear appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Moreover, the potential for conflict between a municipal prosecutor and a defense attorney representing persons charged with indictable offenses in the same county is clear in specific areas. County prosecutors often downgrade indictable offenses so that they are then tried in municipal courts and prosecuted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>municipal prosecutor. Municipal prosecutors may conduct probable cause hearings \u201cin the absence of the county prosecutor.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:4-3(a). In addition, municipal prosecutors may, on occasion, represent the State in a motion to suppress evidence. <em>R. </em>3:24(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Other instances of antagonistic relations between municipal prosecutors and defense attorneys in the same county include appeals from municipal courts, <em>R. </em>3:23, and the prosecution of certain indictable offenses in municipal court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:12-18. The county prosecutor or the Attorney General, in appeals from municipal courts not involving municipal ordinances, is the prosecuting attorney, <em>R. </em>3:23-9, using a record created in part by the municipal prosecutor. <em>R. </em>3:23-8. With respect to certain indictable offenses, where a defendant waives indictment and trial by jury in writing, and with the consent of the county prosecutor, the offense may be disposed of in municipal court and, therefore, potentially prosecuted by the municipal prosecutor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:12-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We acknowledge that a municipal prosecutor ordinarily prosecutes disorderly persons offenses and motor vehicle violations, <em>Opinion 662, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 626 A.2d 1084, and that defendant was charged with indictable offenses in a municipality other than the municipality where his trial counsel was a prosecutor. Despite the obvious differences between the two classes of offenses ordinarily tried in the municipal court and the Law Division, the appearance of impropriety is clear. \u201cProsecutors occupy a unique position in our criminal justice system. The primary duty of a prosecutor is ... to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 320, 524 A.2d 188 (1987). In ensuring that justice is done, every effort must be made to imbue the criminal process with integrity and fair play.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Just as the prosecutor occupies a unique position in our criminal justice system, so does the defense attorney. Their roles, however, must be distinct. \u201cThe prosecutor and defense attorney are advocates for their respective sides.\u201d <em>State v. Avena, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327, 336, 657 A.2d 883 (App.Div.1995). Because of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>positions, one attorney cannot be both a municipal prosecutor and a defense attorney in the same county at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">What happened here can \u201cundermine public confidence in our system of government and in the independence and integrity of the legal profession.\u201d <em>In re Opinion 452 of the Advisory Comm. on Prof. Ethics, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>45, 49, 432 A.2d 829 (1981). The integrity of our criminal justice system cannot permit a municipal prosecutor to confer or consult with a county prosecutor in connection with a defendant he intends to prosecute in municipal court one day, and then the next day represent a different defendant in a trial prosecuted by that same county prosecutor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">[A] lawyer must avoid even the appearance of impropriety ... to the end that the image of disinterested justice is not impoverished or tainted. Thus it is that sometimes an attorney, guiltless in any actual sense, nevertheless is required to stand aside for the sake of public confidence in the probity of the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\"><em>[State v. Rizzo, 69 N.J. </em>28, 30, 350 <em>A.2d 225 </em>(1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">In every trial the integrity of the process is at stake, <em>see State v. Wiggins, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 32, 385 A.2d 318 (App.Div.1978), and an attorney, who is a municipal prosecutor at the same time that he or she represents a defendant in the same county, undermines the integrity of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Moreover, a municipal \u201cprosecutor, like the [municipal] judge, must be impartial.\u201d <em>State v. Storm, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>245, 254, 661 A.2d 790 (1995). Because of the requirement of impartiality, the municipal judge is prohibited from practicing criminal law. <em>R. </em>1:15-1. We are satisfied that a municipal prosecutor is likewise prohibited from practicing criminal law as a defense attorney in the county where he or she holds the office of municipal prosecutor. This is necessary to maintain the prosecutor\u2019s impartiality and to ensure confidence and integrity in the judicial proceedings in which he or she participates. In our judgment, a municipal prosecutor representing a criminal defendant in the same county \u201ccreate[s] an appearance of impropriety in the mind of a reasonable and informed citizen.\u201d <em>In re Opinion 653 of the Advisory Comm. on Prof. Ethics, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>124, 133, 623 A.2d 241 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>We are-aware of <em>State v. Zold, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 251 A.2d 475 (Law Div.1969), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 264 A.2d 257 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>131, 270 A.2d 34 (1970), which held that a municipal attorney, who served as municipal prosecutor, was not disqualified to defend a person who was charged with robbery. There, the trial court dismissed defendant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we affirmed. Although the facts in <em>Zold </em>are similar to those presented here, we decline to follow it because we are satisfied that the viability of its holding is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In light of our holding, we must determine its retroactive effect. Our Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">This court has four options in any case in which it must determine the retroactive effect of a new rule of criminal procedure. <em>See State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 402-03[, 427 A.2d 525] (1981). The Court may decide to apply the new rule purely prospectively, applying it only to cases in which the operative facts arise after the new rule has been announced. <em>Ibid. </em>Alternatively, the Court may apply the new rule in future eases and in the case in which the rule is announced, but not in any other litigation that is pending or has reached final judgment at the time the new rule is set forth. <em>Id. </em>at 403[, 427 A.2d 525]. A third option is to give the new rule \u201cpipeline retroactivity,\u201d rendering it applicable in all future cases, the case in which the rule is announced, and any cases still on direct appeal. <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the Court may give the new rule complete retroactive effect, applying it to all cases, including those in which final judgments have been entered and all other avenues of appeal have been exhausted. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">[T]hree factors generally are considered to determine whether the rule is to be applied retroactively: \u201c(1) the purpose of the rule and whether it would be furthered by a retroactive application, (2) the degree of reliance placed on the old rule by those who administered it, and (3) the effect a retroactive application would have on the administration of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Nash, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>464, 471[, 317 A.2d 689] (1974); <em>accord State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 544[, 511 A.2d 1150] (1986); <em>Burstein, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 406[, 427 A.2d 525].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\"><em>[State v. Knight, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>233, 249, 251[, 678 A.2d 642] (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Considering these factors, we conclude that, except for its effect in the present case, our holding that counsel\u2019s representation of defendant created an appearance of impropriety will apply only to cases in which defense counsel\u2019s first appearance is made or filed on or after July 1, 1999, \u201cbut not in any other litigation that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>pending or has reached final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 678 A.2d 642. <em>See also State v. Donis, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>44, 58-59, 723 A.2d 35 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We reach this conclusion because the purpose of our holding is not furthered by giving it retroactive effect. \u201c[T]he old rule was [not] altered because it substantially impaired the reliability of the truth-finding process.\u201d <em>State v. Knight, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 251, 678 A.2d 642. Further, we are satisfied that there has been substantial reliance on the holding in <em>Zold </em>which had not been questioned in thirty years. Finally, we conclude that a retroactive application of our holding would impose \u201cunjustified burdens on our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 678 A.2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Because we are reversing defendant\u2019s convictions and remanding for a new trial, we deem it appropriate to comment on certain other points raised by the appeal because they may become issues during defendant\u2019s second trial. The first two points raised by defendant\u2019s counsel are raised as plain error. There was no improper admission of any character evidence during Christine Accordini\u2019s testimony. She testified that she observed defendant touching one of the victims and overheard him make sexually explicit statements to the child. The challenged testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">I wasn\u2019t really listening, but I mean for some \u2014 it just caught my ear. It caught me \u2014 It caught me by total shock. First of all I was looking at them because [the victim] was on his lap because my daughter has been told not to sit on his lap, and I saw this little girl sitting on his lap so it kind of threw me, and then periodically I would listen to what he was saying but not the whole conversation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Accordini\u2019s testimony that she told her daughter not to sit on defendant\u2019s lap was not \u201cextraordinarily prejudicial\u201d as defendant\u2019s counsel contends. Although one could draw an adverse inference from the fact that Accordini was concerned about her child associating with defendant, one could not reasonably interpret this testimony to mean that defendant had a reputation for sexually abusing children. A review of the testimony clearly reveals that Accordini\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d was not in response to seeing one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of the victims sitting on defendant\u2019s lap, but was in response to hearing what defendant said to the young victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Defendant did not raise any objection to the admission of this testimony at trial, thus the plain error standard applies and we should not reverse unless the error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Stated in terms of its effect in a jury trial, the possibility must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1(1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Further, defendant\u2019s failure to object below can be taken to mean that the error was not significant in the context of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 273 A2d 1. Also, in cases where other proofs are overwhelming, an error not contradicting the sufficiency of those proofs will not provide a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the jury\u2019s conclusion. <em>See State v. Tirone, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>222, 227, 314 A.2d 601 (1974). It cannot be said, in light of the evidence introduced by the State, that this testimony led the jury to a result it otherwise would not have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s other crimes argument in his second point is without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). The judge gave an instruction to the jury that adequately explained that it had to consider each count of the indictment separately and could not find defendant guilty of one offense because it found him guilty of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Next, defendant\u2019s counsel asserts that the trial judge erred in permitting the mother of one victim and a police officer to testify as to one of the victim\u2019s statements pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(27), after conducting a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(a) hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(e)(27) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">A statement by a child under the age of 12 relating to sexual misconduct committed with or against that child is admissible in a criminal, juvenile, or civil proceeding if (a) the proponent of the statement makes known to the adverse party his intention to offer the statement and the particulars of the statement at such time as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>provide him with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it; (b) the court finds, in a hearing conducted pursuant to Rule 104(a), that on the basis of the time, content and circumstances of the statement there is a probability that the statement is trustworthy; and (c) either (i) the child testifies at the proceeding, or (ii) the child is unavailable as a witness and there is offered admissible evidence corroborating the act of sexual abuse; provided that no child whose statement is to bo offered in evidence pursuant to this rule shall be disqualified to be a witness in such proceeding by virtue of the requirements of Rule 601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Under this rule, a trial judge may admit hearsay statements made by a child sexual abuse victim, if the judge first finds that the conditions of the rule have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">To this end, the trial judge must determine whether the out-of-court statements possess \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d in order to be admitted at trial. <em>State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 363, 537 A.2d 667 (1988). The judge should examine certain factors and look at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statements. <em>See State v. R.M., </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 517-18, 586 A.2d 290 (App.Div.1991). Factors that the trial judge may consider include spontaneity and consistent repetition, mental state of the declarant, the use of terminology not expected of a child of similar age, and the lack of motive to fabricate. <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>805, 821-22, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3139, 3150, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 656 (1990). Additionally, the judge should consider the partisanship of the interviewer and the interviewer\u2019s ability to recall. <em>R.M., supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 517-18, 586 A.2d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Following a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(a) hearing, the trial judge concluded that the statements possessed sufficient indicia of reliability and therefore allowed them to be introduced into evidence. The judge\u2019s finding is supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). The statements may therefore be admitted at the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In his fourth point defendant\u2019s counsel argues that the trial judge erred in not giving a charge pursuant to <em>State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>400, 129 A.2d 417 (1957). At retrial, if the circumstance presents itself, a <em>Kociolek </em>charge should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Finally, defendant\u2019s counsel raises issues as to defendant\u2019s sentence. Because we have reversed and remanded for a new trial, the sentence issues are moot. In the event they recur following retrial, we offer the following observations. The endangering the welfare of a child convictions should have merged with the sexual assault convictions because \u201cthe record suggests no basis for the endangering conviction[s] beyond the sexual assault[s].\u201d <em>State v. Still, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 259, 608 A.2d 404 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The judge also mistakenly imposed consecutive sentences on the sexual assault convictions because she believed such a result was mandatory. No mandatory consecutive sentence applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
