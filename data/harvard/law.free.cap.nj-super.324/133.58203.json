(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The law firm of Budd Larner Gross Rosenbaum Greenberg &amp; Sade (Budd Larner) appeals from a summary judgment invalidating a provision in its Shareholders Agreement which denied certain termination benefits to plaintiff Robert Novack, who was leaving defendant with the intention of practicing law with another firm in this State. In granting summary judgment, the Law Division concluded that the provision was anti-competitive and a violation of <em>RPC </em>5.6. We agree with the court\u2019s reasoning and its conclusion that invalidation is required under the decisions in <em>Weiss v. Carpenter, Bennett &amp; Morrissey, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>420, 672 A.2d 1132 (1996); <em>Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>10, 607 A.2d 142 (1992); and <em>Katchen v. Wolff &amp; Samson, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 610 A.2d 415 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>599, 617 A.2d 1222 (1992). Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Budd Larner is a law firm based in Short Hills. It also maintains offices in New York and Pennsylvania. Novak joined the firm as an associate in 1979, became a shareholder in 1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>and later became managing shareholder, a position he held until his resignation on September 19,1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In 1988, Budd Larner adopted a Shareholders Agreement (the Agreement) which remained in effect, essentially unchanged, throughout the period involved here. The dispute between Novak and Bndd Larner turns on paragraphs five and six of the Agreement. Paragraph five sets out a formula for payment to one who, in the language of the Agreement, \u201cretires, as hereinafter defined.\u201d One who does \u201cretire,\u201d and who has been a shareholder for at least ten years, receives substantial payments of so-called \u201cdeferred income.\u201d In Novak\u2019s case, those payments amount to approximately $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Paragraph six contains a formula for termination benefits for one who leaves but does not \u201cretire.\u201d Those benefits are substantially less and are paid over a period of time so that, in Novak\u2019s case, they would approximate $300,000 \u2014 roughly $100,000 less than he would receive under paragraph five.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Thus, the right to have one\u2019s termination benefits computed under paragraph five or paragraph six, turns on whether one \u201cretires.\u201d The Agreement defines that term in Section 5(e) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">(e) For the purpose of this Agreement a Shareholder shall be deemed to be retired if the Shareholder ceases the practice of law within all states in which the corporation maintains an office, determined as the date of retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appointment as a member of the judiciary or engagement as a full-time employee attorney by organization or individual other than by a law firm, shall be deemed retirement. If a shareholder returns to the practice of law within two (2) years of the date of his or her retirement, such Shareholder shall return to the Corporation all payments received on account of deferred income and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>all future payments of deferred income shall cease even if the Shareholder may subsequently retire ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>RPC </em>5.6 states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">(a) A partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The trial court held that the Agreement violated that provision. The court focused on the definition of \u201cretirement\u201d and found that, in essence, the question of whether a withdrawing shareholder would be deemed \u201cretired,\u201d turned almost exclusively on whether he or she was competing with Budd Larner. If the person were continuing to practice law at a firm in any of the three states in which Budd Larner practiced law, the person, no matter how little or how much work he or she performed, would be deemed <em>not </em>retired. On the other hand, if the person were practicing law at a firm in any state other than those three, then, despite how little or how much work he or she performed, or if the person was employed as a judge, corporate counsel or in a non-legal job, he or she would be deemed \u201cretired.\u201d The court concluded that the provision was \u201canti-competitive\u201d because \u201cthe definition of retirement is specifically geared to drawing a distinction between competing shareholders and non-competing retiring shareholders ----\u201d While the distinction was purportedly based on whether or not a departing shareholder was retiring, it was in reality based on whether the attorney would be competing with Budd Lamer. If the answer was \u201cyes,\u201d the individual would receive the lesser compensation package; if the answer was \u201cno,\u201d he or she would receive the larger package.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The trial court referred to the three decisions noted above, and we agree that those cases, particularly <em>Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus, supra, </em>are determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">In <em>Jacob, </em>the Court\u2019s invalidation of an anti-competitive provision in a law firm\u2019s shareholder agreement rested on two factors which make clear that the challenged provision here is as invalid as the one set aside in <em>Jacob: </em>first, an indirect \u201cfinancial-disincen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tive provision,\u201d which discourages attorneys from freely practicing law where and how they choose, violates <em>RPC </em>5.6 to the same extent as a direct restrictive covenant; and, second, it is the effect of such a provision, and not its formulation, or verbalization, which determines its validity. <em>Jacob, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 26-27, 607 A.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\"><em>Jacob </em>dealt with a shareholder agreement that drew \u201ca sharp distinction between competitive and non-competitive departures\u201d from the Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus law firm. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 607 A.2d 142. If, within one year of leaving, a departing attorney provides \u201cprofessional services\u201d to someone who had been a client of the firm when the attorney left, the departure would be deemed \u201ccompetitive.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In that event, the attorney\u2019s termination benefits would be substantially less than if the departure were \u201cnon-competitive\u201d \u2014 i.e., if the attorney refrained from dealing with any of the film\u2019s clients for at least one year. As the Court put it, the agreement \u201cthus creates a financial disincentive against a departing shareholder\u2019s retaining the firm\u2019s clients----\u201d <em>Ibid</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In its analysis of the validity of the provision in <em>Jacob, </em>the Court first noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">The history behind the <em>RPC </em>and its precursors reveals that the RPC\u2019s underlying purpose is to ensure the freedom of clients to select counsel of their ehoice, despite its wording in terms of the lawyer\u2019s right to practice. The <em>RPC </em>is thus designed to serve the public interest in maximum access to lawyers and to preclude commercial arrangements that interfere with that goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">lid at 18, 607 A.2d 142.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The Court then pointed out that, in <em>Dwyer v. Jung, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 336 A.2d 498 (Ch.Div.) <em>aff'd, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 348 A.2d 208 (App.Div.1975), this state had already held void a restrictive covenant barring an attorney\u2019s practicing within a geographic area. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 20, 607 A.2d 142. What it was dealing with now, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Court said, was somewhat different from \u201cdirect restrictive covenants\u201d: it was dealing with \u201cfinancial-disincentive provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 607 A.2d 142. Such provisions, the Court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">do not impose a blanket or geographical ban on the practice of law nor do they directly prohibit an attorney from representing former clients. By selectively withholding compensation, however, such provisions strongly discourage \u201ccompetitive\u201d activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The Court expressed no doubt, however, that its condemnation of the restrictive covenants employed in <em>Dwyer </em>applied equally to the so-called \u201cfinancial-disincentive provisions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">We believe that indirect restrictions on the practice of law, such as the financial disincentives at issue in this case, likewise violate both the language and the spirit of <em>RPC </em>5.6. Any provision penalizing an attorney for undertaking certain representation \u201crestricts the right of a lawyer to practice law\u201d within the meaning of the <em>RPC.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">By forcing lawyers to chose between compensation and continued service to their clients, financial-disincentive provisions may encourage lawyers to give up their clients, thereby interfering with the lawyer-client relationship and, more importantly, with clients\u2019 free choice of counsel. Those provisions thus cause indirectly the same objectionable restraints on the free practice of law as more direct restrictive covenants ... Because the client\u2019s freedom of choice is the paramount interest to be served by the <em>RPC, </em>a disincentive provision is as detrimental to the public interest as an outright prohibition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\n<em>Ubm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The Court also rejected an argument, similar to one urged by Budd Larner here, that it \u201cshould distinguish between agreements that require departing lawyers to forfeit their equity interest in a firm and those that merely deprive them of additional compensation unrelated to their vested interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 607 A.2d 142. It declined to rest its decision on a semantic difference between whether a particular sum of money is termed an addition to, or a reduction from, the amount otherwise payable to an attorney withdrawing from the firm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Regardless of whether the compensation in question represents \u201cearned\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d compensation, to condition payment on refraining from practice violates the <em>Rules of Professional Conduct. </em>The operative question is not what income the departing partner has a \u201cright\u201d to receive, it is the effect of the terms of payment on the lawyer\u2019s decision to decline or accept those clients who wish to chose him or her as counsel. If the agreement creates a disincentive to accept representation, it violates the <em>RPCs, </em>regardless of the lawyer\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to the compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 25, 607 A.2d 142.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">On that analysis, and its conclusion that \u201cthe provision [in question] operates as a penalty designed to protect the former law firm\u2019s turf,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 28, 607 A.2d 142, the Court concluded that the section of the Agreement providing <em>for </em>a smaller termination benefit for a competing lawyer was void. To effect a realistic and worthwhile remedy, the court deleted that provision from the agreement and retained those providing for the larger benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\"><em>Katchen v. Wolff &amp; Samson, supra, </em>is consistent with the holding in <em>Jacob. </em>There, the trial court had granted summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs attack on an agreement plaintiff claimed violated <em>RPC </em>5.6. <em>Katchen, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 475, 610 A.2d 415. That decision preceded the Supreme Court decision in <em>Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus, </em>but by the time the matter reached this court on appeal, <em>Jacob </em>had been decided. This court held the agreement invalid under the rule established in <em>Jacob.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Katchen was a so-called \u201cequitable stockholder\u201d in the Wolff &amp; Samson law firm. The shareholder\u2019s agreement provided that if an \u201cequitable stockholder\u201d should</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">voluntarily withdraw from the Corporation, he shall be deemed to have forfeited his equitable interest in the Corporation and the Corporation shall not be required to make any payment whatsoever in regard to such forfeited equitable interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\"><em>[Katchen, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 477, 610 A.2d 415.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Katchen decided to leave Wolff &amp; Samson, and he then challenged the agreement which provided for a forfeiture of his interest in the law firm upon his leaving. This court characterized the <em>Jacob </em>holding as a finding that \u201cfinancial-disincentive provisions contained in partnership termination agreements that have indirect restrictions on the practice of law are as violative of <em>RPC </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>5.6 as direct restrictive covenants and are, therefore, unenforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 610 A.2d 415. We therefore held that \u201cthe principles announced ... in <em>Jacob </em>apply to the facts of this case and require\u201d a conclusion that the Wolff &amp; Samson agreement is also void. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 610 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In reaching that conclusion, this court noted that the effect of the <em>Katchen </em>agreement was even more drastic than that in <em>Jacob. Id. </em>at 481, 610 A.2d 415. <em>Katchen </em>penalized <em>any </em>withdrawal from the Wolff &amp; Samson firm since a departing attorney lost all of his or her \u201cequitable interest\u201d in the firm regardless of whether he or she did or did not compete. <em>Ibid. </em>That difference, however, did not lead to a different conclusion in <em>Katchen </em>from that reached in <em>Jacob. </em>The provision in question was anti-competitive and that was determinative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">The ... Agreement violates <em>RPC </em>5.6 ... because it has the effect of discouraging competition and forces an attorney to decide whether he should stay with a firm ... or leave the firm at financial risk to himself in order to better serve his clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 481, 610 A.2d 415.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">This court then summed up the rule, which was applicable in <em>Jacob, </em>applicable in <em>Katchen </em>and which is applicable here;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">Where, under the facts of a given case, the financial disincentive has the effect of discouraging \u201ccompetitive\u201d activities, albeit indirectly, such a provision \u201cviolate[s] both the language and the spirit of <em>RPC </em>5.6. Any provision penalizing an attorney for undertaking certain representation \u2018restricts the right of the lawyer to practice law within the meaning of the <em>RPC.\"</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">[Id at 482, 610 A.2d 415 (quoting from <em>Jacob, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 22, 607 A.2d 142).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The third ease dealing with <em>RPC </em>5.6 is <em>Weiss v. Carpenter, Bennett &amp; Morrissey, supra, </em>which differs somewhat from <em>Jacob </em>and <em>Katchen </em>since it involves the Court\u2019s review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision. The arbitrator had found that a provision in the shareholders agreement of the Carpenter, Bennett <em>&amp; </em>Morrissey law firm was anti-competitive and thus violated <em>RPC </em>5.6. <em>Weiss, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 423, 672 A.2d 1132. The Court concluded that it would intervene in an arbitrator\u2019s decision on such an issue only if it found that the arbitrator\u2019s treatment of the issue \u201cwould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>violate a clear mandate of public-policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 672 A.2d 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In <em>Weiss, </em>the shareholder\u2019s agreement provided that if an attorney left the firm because he or she had reached the age of sixty-five, or to accept a judicial appointment, or because of disability, the attorney would receive a substantial separation package. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 672 A.2d 1132. However, if the departure was for some other reason (including a determination to practice law other than with the Carpenter, Bennett &amp; Morrissey firm, the attorney would receive a much smaller package.) <em>Id. </em>at 426-27, 672 A.2d 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The arbitrator concluded that the restriction \u201cdiscourages a partner from leaving and becoming competitive with the firm [and therefore] is violative of <em>RPC </em>5.6.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 672 A.2d 1132. Although the Court concluded, based on the limited standard of review cited above, that it would not address that issue <em>de novo, </em>it seemed almost to go out of its way to endorse the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">Wore we required to address that issue on its merits, we would agree with the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion and would hold, consistent with our ruling in <em>Jacob, supra, </em>that Paragraph 10 of the CB &amp; M agreement violates <em>RPC </em>5.6. The contention that Paragraph 10\u2019s impact would affect partners that withdrew from the firm to pursue any occupation, not only the practice of law, does not overcome the inescapable inference that the provision\u2019s dominant purpose was to dissuade partners from competing with the firm after withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 445, 672 A.2d 1132]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">We are satisfied that the trial court was correct in its conclusion that, tested by the holdings of <em>Jacob, Katchen </em>and <em>Weiss, </em>the provision challenged here must be deemed anti-competitive and thus a violation of <em>RPC </em>5.6. Indeed, that conclusion is clear, compelling and virtually beyond dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The restriction here is, in substance, simply a variation on the theme played out, with the same result, in the line of cases that began with the restrictive covenant in <em>Dwyer v. Jung, supra, </em>and then ran through the more sophisticated restraints in the trilogy of cases just discussed. In each of those cases \u2014 as here \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>effect of the agreement was anti-competitive. In each, the ability of the attorney to practice law, and thus the ability of the public to avail itself of the attorney\u2019s services, was either directly restricted or adversely affected by \u201cfinancial-disincentives.\u201d And as all of the cited cases make clear, the latter are as invalid as the former. The \u201cindirect restrictions on the practice of law\u201d violate <em>RPC </em>5.6 just as much as \u201cdirect restrictions, and a disincentive provision\u201d is as detrimental to the public interest as an outright prohibition. <em>Jacob, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 22, 607 A.2d 142; <em>Katchen, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 482, 610 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">There is no question that the Agreement here does involve precisely the kind of \u201cfinancial-disincentive\u201d condemned in <em>Jacob, Katchen </em>and <em>Weiss. </em>The difference between the payments a departing attorney would receive under Paragraph 5, as opposed to Paragraph 6, turns directly on whether that attorney will be competing with Budd Larner. In the case of plaintiff Novak, that difference will amount to $100,000. That is certainly a significant disincentive, and it is precisely the kind of deterrent condemned in <em>Jacob, Katchen </em>and <em>Weiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Budd Lamer argues that its agreement is valid under <em>RPC </em>5.6 because it is \u201can agreement concerning benefits upon retirement.\u201d We disagree. As the trial court noted, and as discussed above, the benefits to be paid or withheld under this agreement do not turn on any bonafide retirement. The size of the benefits depend not on age or years of service (beyond a minimum of ten years with the firm) but rather turn on competition or non-competition with Budd Lamer. Thus, a withdrawing attorney could move to any state other than New Jersey, New York or Pennsylvania, join or form a firm and make a good deal of money, and he or she would be entitled to the larger, non-competitive benefits payable under the Agreement. On the other hand, if that attorney decided to open a one-person law firm and practice in any one of the three proscribed states, he or she would only receive the smaller package of benefits. And the sole difference would be whether or not the person practiced in the same state as \u2014 and thus was able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>compete with \u2014 Budd Larner. Under no realistic analysis could this Agreement be deemed one providing retirement benefits. It is clearly a restrictive covenant, with substantial financial disincentives, cloaked as a retirement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Budd Lamer also argues that its agreement should be enforced under the \u201cequitable principles\u201d referred to by the Supreme Court in <em>Jacob. </em>Those principles, however, as subsequently limited and explained in <em>Weiss, </em>clearly have no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In <em>Jacob, </em>the Court referred to the possibility that \u201cequitable principles might bar a plaintiffs recovery if the plaintiff had been a senior partner instrumental in drafting a restrictive agreement, imposing it on his or her fellow partners or employees, and then sought to have the provision declared unenforceable when he or she decided to leave.\u201d <em>Jacob, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 36, 607 A.2d 142. However, in <em>Weiss, </em>the Court qualified and severely limited that proposition. As the Court put it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">[O]ur observation in <em>Jamb </em>about equitable estoppel should be understood to refer to a unique and extraordinary exercise of control by a dominant partner in a law firm, one who initiated and demanded the inclusion of the forfeiture provision in the firm\u2019s agreement and subsequently exerted a dominating influence in insisting that the forfeiture provision be enforced against withdrawing partners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">That narrowing construction of our language in Jacob demonstrates that its objective was to avoid the apparent unfairness of allowing an exceptionally influential dominant partner in a law firm to challenge the validity of a forfeiture provision tM he, \u00ae she MMed and implemented virtually single-handedly. The estoppel doctrine should not apply <em>to the </em>ordinary senior partner who merely participated in the partnership decisions to adopt and enforce the provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\"><em>\\Weiss, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 447, 672 A.2d 1132.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Nothing in this case indicates that Novak had the kind of role described in <em>Weiss: </em>that he \u201cvirtually single-handedly\u201d initiated and implemented the shareholders agreement; that his actions represented a \u201cunique and extraordinary exercise of control\u201d; that he was the \u201cdominant partner\u201d who \u201cinitiated and demanded the inclusion of the forfeiture provision\u201d in the agreement or that he \u201csubsequently exerted a dominating influence in insisting that the forfeiture provision be enforced against withdrawing partners.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>For all that appears, while Novak was a senior partner, he had none of those extraordinary contacts with, or influences over, the Agreement or the illegal restrictive clause he now challenges. In <em>Weiss, </em>the Court rejected the application of those so-called \u201cequitable estoppel\u201d principles, noting that, although Weiss served on the firm\u2019s Executive Committee, there was no evidence that he played a unique role in perpetuating or enforcing the forfeiture provision. <em>Ibid. </em>The same is true of Novak and there is no more basis for applying those principles here than there was in <em>Weiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that this ease was not ripe for summary judgment, and the matter should be remanded for trial. We see no bonafide issues of fact, nor does defendant point to any. Its claim seems to be that evidence should be taken \u25a0as to the subjective intent of the various individuals involved in preparing the Agreement. Such evidence, however, would not change the conclusion reached by the trial court and affirmed here. It is the effect of the Agreement that is determinative, regardless of whatever subjective motivation might be ascribed to one or another of the participants. And the effect of the Agreement here is clear: it is anti-competitive and void and summary judgment so declaring was entirely proper. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins.
