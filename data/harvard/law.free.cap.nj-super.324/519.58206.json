Appellant has a \u201clong psychiatric history\u201d and was committed because \u201c[h]e became non-compliant with his medications.\u201d Following a hearing on June 25, 1998, a final order of commitment was entered with a \u201creview in two weeks\u201d so that appellant\u2019s medication could be changed. Following his review hearing, appellant was \u201cconditionally discharged\u201d from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Appellant now appeals from the commitment order of June 25, 1998, arguing that the State failed to meet its burden of proof that he was a danger to himself, others or property. He also asserts that the State\u2019s physician provided a \u201cnet opinion\u201d and that this appeal is not moot despite his release from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">We agree that appellant\u2019s release from the hospital has not mooted the controversy. \u201cAn involuntary committee\u2019s property is subject to a lien for the cost of his hospital care.\u201d <em>In Re Commitment of A.A., </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 172 n. 1, 599 A.2d 573 (App.Div.1991) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.1). With such a potential monetary obligation, appellant\u2019s appeal is not moot. We also agree that the State failed to meet its burden of proof and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">To support appellant\u2019s commitment, the State\u2019s expert testified in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">Q. Doctor, if the patient were released from a structured setting such as this, would he be a danger to himself or others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-15\">A. Most likely if he\u2019s released at this point in time from this facility, he will become non-compliant with his medications, most likely decompensate and require rehospitalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Q. What is the hospital\u2019s plan toward continued commitment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">A. Continued hospitalization until we can stabilize him some more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">Q. Thank you, Doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">THE COURT: Doctor, I don\u2019t think you answered the question. The attorney asked whether if he were released from this environment at the present t\u00edme, would he be a danger to himself or others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">THE WITNESS: <em>He very well could be. </em>He does have a history of violence in the past. <em>That\u2019s a likely possibility.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">THE COURT: <em>Well, is it a possibility or a probability?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">THE WITNESS: Well, at this point in time I really can\u2019t tell you with a hundred percent certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not asking for a hundred percent certainty but to a degree of medical certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\">THE COURT: Cross-examine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-14\">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. FRIEDMAN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-15\">Q. Yes, possible, Doctor, or yes, probable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-16\">A. <em>Yes, possible.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-17\">Q. Thank you. I have no further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-18\">THE COURT: You\u2019re saying it\u2019s only possible that he would be a danger, not a probability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-19\">THE WITNESS: <em>I don't know that. I really can\u2019t </em>\u2014 it <em>all depends whether he remains compliant with his medications. </em>If he were to remain compliant with his medications, the likelihood that he would become violent is very very minimal. THE COURT: No, but the question is, you testified he was brought into the hospital because he was non-eompliant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-20\">THE WITNESS: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-21\">THE COURT: <em>If he doesn\u2019t comply with his medication, would he then probably be a danger to himself and others?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-22\">THE WITNESS: <em>He very well could be, yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-23\">Q. And when he\u2019s non-compliant with his medication, would he be able to take care of himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-24\">A. I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-25\">Q. Could he cook for himself, clean for himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-26\">A. Well, again, that depends on how psychotic he is. He may or may not. But most likely, if he doesn\u2019t take his medication, he will become psychotic, and will require rehospitalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-27\">[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Following the State\u2019s witness, appellant produced his aunt and uncle who both testified that he has never been violent toward \u201canybody\u201d nor \u201ctried to harm himself.\u201d They also stated that appellant cooks and shops for food for himself. Further, both testified that they have frequent contact with appellant and \u201ccan tell ... when he stops taking his medication.\u201d When appellant stops taking his medications \u201che walks up and down and he talks to himself.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019ll still take care of himself as far as cooking is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In ordering appellant\u2019s commitment, the judge found all of the witnesses to be credible, but concluded that appellant would be \u201ca danger to himself and others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2 defines the terms \u201cdangerous to self\u2019 or \u201cdangerous to others or property.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">h. \u201cDangerous to self\u2019 means that by reason of mental illness the person has threatened or attempted suicide or serious bodily harm, or has behaved in such a manner as to indicate that the person is unable to satisfy his need for nourishment, essential medieal care or shelter, so that it is probable that substantial bodily injury, serious physical debilitation or death will result within the reasonably foreseeable future; however, no person shall be deemed to be unable to satisfy his need for nourishment, essential medical care or shelter if he is able to satisfy such needs with the supervision and assistance of others who are willing and available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">i. \u201cDangerous to others or property\u201d means that by reason of mental illness there is a substantial likelihood that the person will inflict serious bodily harm upon another person or cause serious property damage within the reasonably foreseeable future. This determination shall take into account a person\u2019s history, recent behavior and any recent act or threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">To enter an order of involuntary commitment, the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is mentally ill and that the illness causes the patient to be dangerous to himself, others or property. <em>R. </em>4:74 \u2014 7(f)(1). Our review of this record convinces us that the State failed to meet its burden of proof. The doctor\u2019s testimony was equivocal in that appellant would only \u201cpossibly\u201d be a danger to himself or others if he again became non-compliant with his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">At one point in the hearing when asked if appellant would be a danger to himself if he stopped taking his medicine, the doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>answered: \u201c[T]hat depends on how psychotic he is. He may or may not. But most likely, if he doesn\u2019t take his medication, he will become psychotic, and will require rehospitalization.\u201d The doctor also testified that appellant had a history of violence, but no facts were presented to support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Further, appellant\u2019s witnesses testified that he had never been violent and the judge found them credible. Evidence that appellant, when he does not take his medication, is delusional and talks to himself is insufficient to meet the burden of finding by clear and convincing evidence that he will be a danger to himself or others \u201cwithin the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2h and i. <em>See In Re Commitment of Robert S., </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307, 311, 622 A.2d 1311 (App.Div.1992); <em>cf. In Re Commitment of A.A., supra, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 179, 599 A.2d 573 (holding the wife\u2019s testimony that husband\u2019s release would cause psychological harm to other family members was insufficient to support commitment court\u2019s finding that husband would cause serious bodily harm to another person).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u201cEvidence is \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 when it produc\u00e9is] in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable [the factfinder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.\u201d <em>In Re Jobes, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>394, 407, 529 A.2d 434 (1987)(citing <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 376, 471 A.2d 389 (1984) (citations omitted)). The proofs here do not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
