The alleged liability of the defendant, as such stockholder, was because of the nonpayment for defendant\u2019s stock in money or property, as required by the statute. The plaintiff was the assignee of claims of Messrs. Evarts, Choate &amp; Beaman and of William G. Wilson for professional services rendered by them to the Brush-Swan Electric Light Company, upon which judgment had been obtained, and an execution returned wholly unsatisfied. No question is raised as to the validity of the judgment or the return of the execution, nor to the rendition or value of the services to plaintiff\u2019s assignors; the principal point urged being that the learned referee erred in holding that the contracts made by the Brush-Swan Electric Light Company with two other electric light companies, by which it obtained electric light plants for sale, were not for \"property necessary for the business\u201d of the Brush-Swan Electric Light Company, and that the stock issued for such contracts was not fully paid, and that the defendant, as the holder \u25a0 of some of such stock, was liable for the debts of the corporation. As correctly held by the referee, this branch of the case is fully covered by Powell v. Murray, 3 App. Div. 273, 38 N. Y. Supp. 233, affirmed in 157 N. Y. 717, 53 N. E. 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">Another contention made before the referee, and again in this court, grew out of the fact that one of the plaintiff\u2019s assignors, William C. Wilson, was a stockholder in the Brush-Swan Electric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Light Company; and this, it is urged, afforded a defense to that portion of the cause of action derived from him. It is undoubtedly the rule in this state that an action cannot be maintained by one stockholder in a corporation against another stockholder therein upon the liability imposed by the manufacturing act of 1848. This rule, the referee held, did not apply to the case at bar, for the reasons (1) that Mr. Wilson held the stock in fact as trustee for another; (2) that the plaintiff himself was under no personal disability of this character, although one of his assignors might have been able to sue in his own right; and (3) that the defendant, to maintain this defense, must show affirmatively how much the claim of Mr. Wilson amounted to, as distinguished from that of Messrs. Evarts, Choate &amp; Beaman. Without deeming it necessary to concur with the referee upon the first and second grounds, which we therefore do not decide, we think that the judgment should be affirmed upon the ground that the employment and services of the attorneys were, upon the evidence, joint, and not several.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The other minor questions it is unnecessary to discuss, and the judgment accordingly should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
