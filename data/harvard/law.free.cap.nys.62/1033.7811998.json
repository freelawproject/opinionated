The special term justice, in addition, made the usual allowance of $30 costs to the judgment creditors\u2019 attorney. It was not intended by such provision to impose more than the burden usually imposed upon a judgment debtor wdien property of his has been discovered, as in this instance; that is to say, that an allowance of $30 was made to the judgment creditors\u2019 attorney, to be taken out of the proceeds of funds realized out of such property. In this case the special term justice declared him guilty of contempt because of the failure to pay such $30, and an order to that effect was entered. Another special term justice reversed said order; hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">We think the reversal was right. It was only intended, as before stated, to make the allowance usually made in this proceeding, and payable in the same manner. There was no apparent reason for departing in this instance from this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-17\">The order appealed from must be \"affirmed, but without costs or disbursements to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
