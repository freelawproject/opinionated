This constituted an accord and satisfaction, and called for a dismissal of the complaint. \u00b0 The plaintiff sought to avoid the effect of the transaction on the ground that when she signed the receipt she did not read it. But there is no claim or proof that she was. in any way imposed upon in the matter, so that the explanation offered in no way affects the legal effect of what she did. Bacon v. Proctor, 13 Misc.
