Such an allegation is material and necessary in an application for a bill of particulars, and without such an allegation the motion must fail because of such omission. Constable v. Hardenbergh (Sup.) 27 N. Y. Supp. 1024; Cycle Co. v. Dyer (Sup.) 52 N. Y. Supp. 159; Manufacturing Co. v. Lazzaro (Sup.) 43 N. Y. Supp. 1110; Villiers v. Railroad Co. (City Ct. N. Y.) 48 N. Y. Supp. 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs, but with leave to the plaintiffs to apply anew at special term if so advised. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
