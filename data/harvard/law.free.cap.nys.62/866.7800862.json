Lyman v. Insurance Co., 37 App. Div. 234, 55 N. Y. Supp. 770; Same v. Brucker, 26 Misc. Rep. 594, 56 N. Y. Supp. 767, affirmed on appeal in 42 App. Div. 624, 61 N. Y. Supp. 1141; Same v. Club, 39 App. Div. 459, 57 N. Y. Supp. 372. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant in support of his contention is forcible and able, but all of the views therein taken seem to have been met and answered by the decisions already rendered; and, if we were doubtful of the correctness of such answer, its overthrow, if it be overthrown, must properly come from the court of last resort. The evidence in the case is conflicting, and that adopted by the referee is not only contradicted, but in many respects contradictory, nevertheless there was clearly sufficient for him to render the judgment appealed from, and this court is powerless to interfere. Baird v. Mayor, etc., 96 N. Y. 567. The judgment should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
