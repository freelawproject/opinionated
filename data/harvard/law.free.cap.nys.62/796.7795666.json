The transaction in question was an exchange of equity for equity; the contract of the principals providing that, for the purposes of their agreement, the value of the property in question was fixed at $20,000. It satisfactorily appears, however, from the evidence, that the values mentioned in the contract were purposely inflated by both sides, and that the real value of the defendant\u2019s property did not exceed $16,000; that it was so-regarded by the purchaser; and that the equity in the property received by the defendant did not exceed the equity in the property sold. It is stipulated in the record that a broker\u2019s commission is 1 per cent, of the amount actually received by the vendor, and, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, the plaintiff was not entitled to more than $160, which amount was tendered to him before suit, and thereafter paid into court. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony touching the expenditure for advertising is contradicted by the defendant,, and, as the court below accepted the defendant\u2019s version of the transaction, we see no reason for interfering with its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-18\">There is no merit in this appeal, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
