J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amo\">This action was brought to recover for per-</p>\n<p id=\"Aiza\">sonal injuries sustained by the plaintiff while alighting from one of' the defendant\u2019s cars. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged, and the testimony on his part showed, that the car had come to a stop; that he had one foot upon the ground, and one foot upon the step; and that the car suddenly started with full force, and he was thrown to the-ground, receiving the injuries complained of. - The testimony of the-defendant\u2019s witnesses as to the occurrence was directly opposed to that of the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that the car -had not stopped, but was slowing up, in response to a signal by the conductor, and while so doing, and while the car was still under motion, the plaintiff, in attempting to get' off the car, fell and was injured. The defendant asks for\" a reversal of the judgment, and bases-its request upon alleged error of the trial judge in refusing to charge the jury in accordance with the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I ask your honor to charge that, if the jury believes that the defendant\u2019s car was in motion at the time the plaintiff attempted to get off, the verdict must be for the defendant. The Court: I decline so to charge. I charge that it is for the jury to say whether or not the plaintiff was negligent in attempting to get off the car while it was in motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">To this refusal the defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">While, as a general proposition, it may be said that an attempt to get off from a moving car is not negligence per se, under the facts and circumstances of this case, as disclosed by the evidence, and under the allegations of the complaint, the defendant had a right to have the foregoing request granted; and the refusal of the trial judge to charge as requested was error. Patterson v. Railway Co., 26 App. Div. 336, 49 N. Y. Supp. 796. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Ma CLEAN, J., concurring. LEVENTRITT, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
