The receiver failing to comply with the order of the appellate division, in force and unmodified, the trial court was left with nothing to do but to direct a verdict in favor of this plaintiff. At the time of the settlement of its order the appellate division, being apprised of the fact of the depletion of the funds, announced, \u201cWe have no right to consider the affidavit' submitted on behalf of the receiver, and which in this instance was presented without notice to the other side, tending to show that the receiver has not sufficient funds now in hand with which to pay Lesster\u2019s claim,\u201d and that \u201cthe receiver must seek his relief by a proper motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">As to the second cause of action, it appears that the plaintiff in foreclosure appealed from the same orders as did the receiver, even a month in advance of the latter, each appealing by separate notices, undertakings, returns, and notices of argument; that the appeals were never consolidated, but were argued together for the sake of convenience, and were dismissed, with costs,\u2014clearly leaving the plaintiff entitled to costs from each of said appellants. The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with leave, however, to apply to the appellate division.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs, with leave to appeal to the appellate division. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
