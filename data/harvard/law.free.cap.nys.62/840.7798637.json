Frounfelker was the conductor of one of the defendant\u2019s coal trains, and was killed on October 3, 1896, while riding in the caboose, by a rear end collision between his train and another coal train in charge of one Wallace. Shortly prior to the collision the deceased\u2019s train had been stopped by signal, somewhat to the west of the village of East Stroudsburgh. Rules 3 and 4 of the defendant company, in force at the time of the accident, provided that, whenever a train should be required to .stop between stations, the flagman should immediately go back a distance of half a mile, and display the danger signal, placing three torpedoes at intervals on the track. Rule 6 provides that conductors and engineers are required to carry out these instructions, and will be held strictly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>sponsible for their enforcement. A period estimated at from 5 to 12 minutes elapsed between the time of the stoppage of the deceased\u2019s train and the collision, yet it appears that the flagman went back a distance of not more than 300 feet, and, so far -as appears, placed no torpedoes upon the track. There is no direct evidence that the deceased took any step whatever looking to a fulfillment by the flagman of the duties prescribed. We think it was error to refuse to charge the defendant\u2019s third request, which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-3\">\u201cIt was Frounfelker's duty\" to observe and obey the rules prescribed by the defendant relating to the movement and management of his train. It was his duty, when his train was stopped on the morning of October 3, 1896, before reaching East Stroudsburgh station, to see that his flagman went back, as required by the defendant\u2019s rules, with flag and torpedoes, to warn any train that might be approaching. If he failed or neglected to observe this duty, and; his failure or neglect contributed to the collision which resulted in his death, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApQ\">The plaintiff contends that the rules were not binding upon the deceased, at least as matter of law, since there was no conclusive proof that he knew of them. It appeared that the rules were printed on the back of the time-tables; that whenever a new time-table was issued, copies were distributed to all the conductors; and that this course was followed with reference to the time-table in force on October 3, 1896. No witness was called who had a specific recollection of delivering one of these time-tables to the deceased, but there was sufficient evidence, prima facie, that this was done. Where a carrier of passengers and freight, like the defendant, formulates rules for the guidance of its employes, and establishes an adequate and operative system for the promulgation of those rules, the presumption is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that the employ\u00e9s were thus made acquainted with what it was essential for them to know. Presumably the system operates in the particular case. It would generally be impossible for such a corporation to give direct and specific evidence concerning every detail of its business. The presumption is fortified in the present case by the fact that the rules were printed on the time-table, and that without a time-table it was impossible for the deceased safely to run his train at all. The rules being thus presumptively known to the deceased, it seems clear that he was bound to obey them, and that, if his failure to do so caused or contributed to the accident, there can be no recovery. The cases of Eaton v. Railroad Co., 14 App. Div. 24, 43 N. Y. Supp. 666, and Moeller v. Railroad Co., 13 App. Div. 467, 43 N. Y. Supp. 603, seem to be direct authority for this proposition. In addition, it has often been held that the failure to obey a rule of a railroad corporation is negligence, which, if committed by a co-employ\u00e9 of the injured party, furnishes no basis for a recovery. Smith v. Railroad Co., 88 Hun, 468, 34 N. Y. Supp. 881; Bryant v. Same, 81 Hun, 164, 30 N. Y. Supp. 737; Drake v. Same, 80 Hun, 490, 30 N. Y. Supp. 671. If this negligence is attributable to the injured party himself, it seems plain that it must be contributory negligence, which will prevent a recovery, regardless of the independent negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">It is also urged, in substance, that the duty of the deceased under rule 6 was merely to give the proper instructions to the flag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>man, and see that he started out to signal following trains; that, as the flagman in fact did so start, it was immaterial whether the deceased was active or not; and thus that the negligence of the deceased did not cause or contribute to the accident. This argument overlooks a vital omission in the proof. The duty of the deceased; at the least, was to send out the flagman upon his mission with proper .instructions as to what to do, and proper materials with which to do it. There is no proof that he. fulfilled this duty. So far as appears, the flagman had no knowledge of rules 3 and 4, but was merely acting upon his own judgment. Certainly, he signally failed to comply with these rules. It cannot be presumed that, had the proper instructions been given to him, he would have deliberately disobeyed them, \u00a1and thus caused the accident. And he had ample time to give a warning to Wallace\u2019s train, which would most certainly have been effectual. At all events, it was perfectly competent for the jury to find, both that the deceased disobeyed rule 6 and that this disobedience caused or contributed to the accident; and the request to charge is so phrased that the plaintiff had no valid ground of objection to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">But it is said that the learned judge merely refused to charge the request \u201cexcept as I have charged it.\u201d All that he had previously charged, however (except in the general statement that, the plaintiff must show that the deceased was \u201cfree from contributory negligence\u201d), was that, \u201caccording to the rules of the company, and even without regard to rules, the obvious peril of the situation would require the exercise of proportionate diligence and care on the part of the conductor to properly warn trains,\u201d etc. This was not at all an equivalent for the third request. As already stated, the rules formulated by the defendant for the protection of its employ\u00e9s constituted the measure of care necessary to be exercised, and it was erroneous'to substitute some other and less definite standard. The error which we have been considering is emphasized by the action of the court in charging the plaintiff\u2019s eighth request, namely, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">\u201cIn determining whether Fronnfelker was negligent himself, or whether he failed in any way to discharge any duty imposed upon him by any regulation of the defendant railroad company, the jury may take into consideration the testimony of Wallace that Frounfelker was a careful man, and may also take into consideration Frounfelker\u2019s long period of continuous employment by the company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">These latter considerations, while they might possibly have a bearing upon the question whether a party acted prudently under some special and peculiar circumstances (as to which, however, we express no opinion), had no relevancy to the question of whether or not the deceased complied with rule 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">For these errors, without considering any of the other questions presented, the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with' costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
