The action was brought to recover for the rent of a store from May 1, 1887, to May 1, 1896, at $130 per year, amounting to the sum of \u2022$1,180.83. The defense was the statute of limitations for part of the rent prior to June 1, 1892, and for a second defense the defendant alleged a special contract made with the plaintiffs\u2019 testator in his lifetime, by which, in consideration of the defendant\u2019s looking after and caring for the building of which the \u25a0store occupied by the defendant was a part, the deceased agreed to give the \u25a0defendant the use of the store without rent. Upon the trial the defense of the \u25a0statute of limitations as to a part of the claim was sustained. As to the special contract alleged by the defendant, evidence was given of the performance by the defendant of services in and about the building, and also of a conversation had by one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses with the deceased, in which the deceased stated that he had not charged the defendant rent for some years. In answer to this testimony, one of the plaintiffs was called as a witness, and produced a book, in regard to which he testified as follows: \u201cI found this book in the desk of William F. Russell after his death. Page one of that book is the handwriting of William F. Russell, excepting the last two items charged. The general nature of the items shown upon that page of that book is store rent, beginning April 1, 1884, charged each year until April 1, 1895, and then one month added on afterwards, and then there is a credit for three years,\u2014 from 1884 to 1887,\u2014in William F.\u2019s handwriting.\u201d The defendant was then recalled as a witness, and was asked the following question: \u201cQ. Mr. Russell, in the year 1887,-\u2014the 1st day of April, 1887, until the time of his death,-\u2014did William F. Russell ever ask or demand of you any rent?\u201d This was objected to as calling for a personal transaction between the witness and William F. \u25a0Russell, the deceased, under section 829, Code Oiv. Proc. The objection was overruled. The plaintiff excepted, and the witness answered, \u201cNo\u201e\u201d In the view that is taken of the case, it is unnecessary to state any further facts.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b127-8\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Rogers, 153 N. Y. 343-350, 47 N. E. 452. I do not think that charging the matter upon his books in the absence -of the person so charged constitutes a personal transaction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the parties. Assuming, however, that it is such a transaction, it is a separate and distinct transaction irom that of demanding payment of the amount so charged. The entry of an alleged indebtedness upon one\u2019s books and the demand from the person so charged of its payment are separate and distinct transactions, and the question asked of the defendant, and which he was permitted to answer, was as to a separate transaction from that testified to by the plaintiff, and should not have been admitted. The error was material, and for that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
