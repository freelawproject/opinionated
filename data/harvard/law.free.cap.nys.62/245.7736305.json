The answer is a general denial. The proofs at the trial show that the parties litigant made a verbal lease for one year from May 1, 1896, at the yearly rental of $600, to be payable in monthly installments in advance, and that the defendant has not paid the rent for six months from November 1, 1896, to May 1, 1897. The appellant maintains that the court had no power to add interest to the jury\u2019s verdict. After the jury had rendered their verdict, interest was added to the verdict; and the jury was again asked to render their verdict for the amount of damages, with the interest added, and for the total amount the verdict was recorded. This the court had power to do. Warner v. Railroad Co., 52 N. Y. 437. In the case of Barber Asphalt-Paving Co. v. New York Postgraduate Medical School &amp; Hospital (decided by Mr. Justice Daly in October, 1897) 62 N. Y. Supp. 392, it was held that \u201cwhere the plaintiff is entitled to interest, and the jury has failed to allow it, the court may, on motion made, add interest to the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Exhibit B, the letter of the defendant\u2019s wife, was properly admitted in evidence, because the defendant testified, \u201cI authorized my wife to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">None of the exceptions present reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">FITZSIMONS, C.
