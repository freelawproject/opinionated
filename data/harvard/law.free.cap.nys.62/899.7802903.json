Hatton was issued to the plaintiff, as the sheriff of Kings county. On December 16th said defendant gave the plaintiff a bond for the jail liberties, which comprise the entire county, and the defendants Philip Bohner and William Hatton became sureties with the judgment debtor upon such bond. The bond was in the usual form, conditioned that the defendant Loftus D. Hatton should not escape, or go without the liberties of the jail of the county of Kings, as duly established, until he should be discharged by due course of law. The action was on this bond, on the allegation that the defendant Loftus D. Hatton did escape on the 24th day of March, 1896; and the defense litigated was that such escape was voluntary, and the result of the discharge of the said defendant by the plaintiff from confinement within the jail limits on the 16th day of March, 1896. On the trial Hatton testified that on the 16th day of March, 1896, he went to the sheriff\u2019s office, where he saw Mr. Robert B. Sedgwick, and that he asked Mr. Sedgwick if his time was up; that Mr. Sedgwick examined some of the books in the office, and then said to him, in substance: \u201cWhat are you doing here now? Why ain\u2019t you in New York? Your- time is up;\u201d that he replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from my lawyer,\u201d to which Sedgwick responded, \u201cGo to New York and attend to your business.\u201d This evidence was undisputed, and it necessarily follows that, if Mr. Sedgwick then had authority to speak and act for' the plaintiff in the premises, there could be no recovery upon the bond. It appears that Sedgwick was the under-sheriff. of Kings county at the time of Hatton\u2019s arrest. Lewis R. Worth had been undersheriff, but he resigned the position on December 3, 1895, and Sedgwick was appointed the next day, December 4th, and at once qualified by taking and filing the oath of office. The plaintiff testified that Worth\u2019s resignation and Sedgwick\u2019s appointment in his place were only intended to be temporary, and to cover the period of Mr. Worth\u2019s absence abroad. He further testified that Worth returned in January, 1896, whereupon Sedgwick tendered his written resignation of the office of undersheriff, but remained in the sheriff\u2019s office as chief executive clerk, and that the plaintiff, on receiving such resignation, did, on January 23, 1896, reappoint Worth undersheriff, by an instrument in evidence, signed- and sealed on that day. The prior resignation of Worth was preserved and read in evidence, but Sedgwick\u2019s resignation, the plaintiff testified, he had destroyed. Worth\u2019s reappointment was not filed until May 29, 1896, and he did not take the oath of office until June 10, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The statute (Laws 1892, c. 686, \u00a7\u00a7 181, 182) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">\u201cEvery appointment of an under-sheriff or of a deputy sheriff shall be in writing under the hand and seal of the sheriff and filed and recorded in the office of the clerk of the county; and every such under-sheriff or deputy sheriff shall, before he enters upon the execution of the duties of his office, take the constitutional oath of office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>It follows, therefore, according to the plaintiff\u2019s story, that he had no undersheriff qualified to discharge the duties of the office on March 16, 1896, when Sedgwick told Hatton to leave the jail limits, unless Sedgwick continued to perform those duties by an understanding, either express or tacit, which was to continue until Worth should duly qualify. Under these circumstances the learned trial justice very properly submitted to the jury the question^ of Sedgwick\u2019s official status at the time of the escape; instructing them, in substance, that the defendants were entitled to a verdict in ease they found either that Sedgwick was in fact undersheriff, or, not being undersheriff, was still vested by the plaintiff with authority to act as such. It is impossible to tell which conclusion the jury reached, but there was evidence to justify either, and, but for the improper admission of evidence of Sedgwick\u2019s declarations as to his position in the sheriff\u2019s office, the judgment should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Mr. Baker, the attorney for one of the defendants, testified to a conversation with Sedgwick in the afternoon of March 16, 1896. This was after the discharge, and is no part of the res gestae. It was not in the course of the transaction of any business incident to the position, or connected with the duties, of undersheriff. In this conversation Mr. Baker testified that Mr. Sedgwick told him that he was undersheriff, and had charge of all the business. He further testified that Sedgwick said he had discharged Hatton from imprisonment, telling him to go where he pleased. All this conversation was received subject to the plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception. Sedgwick was in the court house at the time of the trial, birt neither side called him. He would, of course, have been a competent witness to prove the scope and extent of the authority conferred upon him by the plaintiff, but his declarations were not competent evidence for that purpose. 2 Greenl. Ev. 63; 1 Rice, Ev. 445 et s\u00e9q. \u201cIt may be laid down as a general nrinciple that the declarations of a person assuming to act as the agent of another are not admissible in evidence to prove Ms agency.\u201d 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2d Ed.) 690, and cases cited. It is true, it was within the defendants\u2019 rights to prove that Sedgwick assumed to act as undersheriff, but in default of his testimony such proof could only be furnished by acts performed as undersheriff, and declarations so-connected with and accompanying them as to make them a part of the res gestae of the acts. But, upon the question whether a party has authority to do an act as the agent of another, evidence of the fact that he assumed to do the act cannot be made use of as evidence that the power so assumed actually existed. Reynolds v. Insurance Co., 36 Mich. 131. Under the charge the jury may have decided that Sedgwick was in fact the undersheriff, and this conclusion would be natural and irresistible, in view of his undisputed declaration to that effect. Without proof of the admission, they might not conclude that he was either undersheriff, or acting as such by authority. The error, therefore, compels a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
