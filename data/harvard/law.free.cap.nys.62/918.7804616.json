Manger sublet the contract to one Putts. Putts subcontracted part of the work, including the cellar and foundation, to one Scully, and Scully employed the plaintiff to build the foundation for the sum of $60. While the work was in progress, defendant visited the job, whereupon plaintiff stopped work and entered into a conversation with the defendant. He told the defendant, in substance, that he was afraid he would not be paid by Scully, and that he therefore intended to abandon the work. The defendant thereupon said to him: \u201cGo ahead and finish the work, and I will pay you. Fever mind about Scully.\u201d The plaintiff completed the work on the faith of this promise, and, in default of payment, has sued and recovered as on an original undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">The general rule, undoubtedly, is that an agreement to do what one is under contract to do will not furnish a sufficient consideration to support a promise. In the cases cited by the appellant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>existing engagement or contract was made with the promisor, and not, as in this instance, with a third person. The plaintiff here was under no engagement or contract with the defendant. The defendant could not compel the plaintiff to continue the work, inasmuch as the latter had not contracted with him to do it. Hor would an agreement to do what one is under contract to do be sufficient consideration to support a promise made by a third person, unless some new consideration exists at the time of the promise, as between the promisor and promisee. And that is the situation here. The defendant had an interest in the prompt prosecution of the work. The plaintiff, apprehensive of losing his pay, had concluded to throw up the job, and take the chances of any claim by Scully for damages. The defendant thereupon, in consideration of the benefit resulting to Mm from uninterrupted work upon the house, made a new and independent contract with the plaintiff, by the terms of wMch the latter consented to, and did, proceed with the work, instead of abandoning it, and in consideration of which the defendant promised to pay the entire $60. This was a valid and enforceable contract, under the authorities. King v. Despard, 5 Wend. 277; Lattimore v. Harsen, 14 Johns. 330; Alley v. Turck, 8 App. Div. 50, 40 N. Y. Snpp. 433; Stewart v.
