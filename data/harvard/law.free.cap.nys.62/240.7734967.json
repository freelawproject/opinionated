The defendant\u2019s time to serve an amended answer did not expire until November 10th. Thereafter the plaintiff filed a note of issue for the December term, and a notice of trial, together with a notice of motion for a preference, for the first Monday of December. There was no opposition to plaintiff\u2019s application for a preference, but the motion was denied on the ground of loches. It thus appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>note of issue was for the December term, and that the <em>notice o\u00ed </em>trial and the motion for a preference were for the first Monday of that term; and, in view of these facts, we fail to see upon what loches can be predicated. It is true that the answer was served on October 21st, and the plaintiff had till the 23d to notice the case for trial for the November term, but allowing two days to elapse before moving certainly could not be held to be loches. There is no provision requiring a notice of trial for any particular term after the joinder of issue, except that neglect for an unseasonable time to prosecute the action may result in its dismissal. In regard to a preference, the rule is that the notice of motion for the preference must be served with the notice of trial. This was done here; and the fact that the plaintiff had two days after the service of the original answer in which she might have noticed her case for the November term did not, for the reasons stated, make her guilty of loches in not having within those two days filed a note of issue, and served a notice of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The order accordingly should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
