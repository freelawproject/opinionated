Defendant answered, interposing a counterclaim. A reply was not served within 20 days, but before trial the plaintiff discovered that a reply should have been made, and asked leave to serve the same. An order to show cause why plaintiff \u201cshould not have leave to serve a reply to the defendant\u2019s answer, such reply to be in the form attached to said affidavit,\u201d was granted, the motion was argued upon this and the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, to which was attached the proposed reply, duly verified, and upon the complaint and answer, and the motion was granted. An order was made -granting leave to the, plaintiff to serve a reply in the form attached to the affidavit, and upon terms, and from this order appeal comes to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">While-we have no doubt of the power of this court to interpose to prevent an abuse of this discretion, the case here presented is not one for the exercise of that power. The proposed reply, verified by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who explains that \u201cthis verification is made by deponent because all the material facts are within his personal knowledge, and because, as he is informed, Bernard Strauss is not within the county of New York, where deponent has his office,\u201d is sufficient to show to the court that the reply of the plaintiff should be served in the furtherance of the ends of justice, and it was not necessary, under the circumstances, that there should be an affidavit of merits. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs arid disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
