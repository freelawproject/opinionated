In Prussak v. Hutton, 30 App. Div. 66, 51 N. Y. Supp. 761, we sustained a recovery against these defendants in favor of the plaintiff in that case for personal injuries caused by the same explosion. The recovery was not placed upon the ground of the defendants\u2019 negligence, but upon evidence sufficient to support the finding of the jury that the powder mill, in the place where it was situate, with reference to the dwelling in which the plaintiff in that case was injured, was a nuisance. The ,house in that case was 300 or 400 feet from the powder mill. In this case, the house in which the plaintiff lived and was sitting at the time of the explosion was 250 feet distant from the powder mill. The judgment in this case should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the Prussak Case, unless some error assigned by the appellants requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">1. In response to the question of her counsel as to the plaintiff\u2019s health since the explosion, she answered, \u201cAiling ever since; kind of hard of hearing in one ear;\u201d to which the defendants objected, and moved to strike out her testimony as to her hardness of hearing. The court overruled the objection, and denied the motion. The complaint alleged that by the explosion the plaintiff \u201creceived great and permanent injury, and was made sick, sore, lame, and disabled for a long period of time,\u201d and continues so, but without specifying deafness as one of her injuries. Special damages which, although a natural result of an injury, are not the necessary result, ought to be pleaded, and deafness has been placed in this class. Hergert v. Railway Co., 25 App. Div. 218, 49 N. Y. Supp. 307; Stevens v. Rodger, 25 Hun, 54. We are inclined, however, to think that, in the case of an explosion like the one before us, near to the person injured, it is a fair question of fact for the jury whether some deafness might not be such a natural and expected, and therefore necessary, result of the violent shock as to make the evidence of it, under a complaint like this, no surprise to the defendants, or to justify the amendment of the complaint, and thus make the evidence admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">2. The defendants requested the court to charge \u201cthat the jury may find in favor of the defendants, or in favor of any one of the defendants.\u201d In view of our decision in the Prussak Case, upon substantially the same acts of the defendants in maintaining the powder mill as are here presented, the liability of each defendant depended upon the question whether the powder mill, as placed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>operated, was a nuisance. That each one of the defendants contributed to that maintenance was not contested, and therefore there was no difference in their legal liability, and no reason why the .jury should be told that they might favor one and hold the others. If the jury should find that there was no nuisance, then they should find in favor of all the defendants. The counsel for defendants insist that this refusal was equivalent to a charge that the jury must find against all the defendants. The court said, in response to the request, \"I will charge them that; I decline to charge only in connection with what I have already charged.\u201d The .court had distinctly charged, \u201cIf you find that this powder magazine, in the lo cality in which it was kept, was not a nuisance, then your verdict will be for the defendants.\u201d We do not think the jury could have understood that they- must find against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">3. We do not think the court erred in pointing out, by way of illustrating his definition of a \u201cnuisance,\u201d a place near the court house where a powder house would be a nuisance, and a place in the wilderness of the town of Hardenberg, in Ulster county, where it would not be a nuisance. The court stated that the illustration was extreme, and hence the jury could not infer that the only place where a. powder house would not be\u201d a nuisance must be like the wilderness of Hardenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">4. The defendants were permitted to testify to the condition as to buildings and occupancy of the neighborhood where the powder mill .was located, but were not permitted to compare it with other designated portions of the city of Kingston. We think this was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">5. There was no error in excluding evidence that gunpowder was a necessity in conducting some of the principal industries in the city of Kingston. The jury knew as much, and the court told them that it was a lawful essential in many industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">6. The defendants asked the court to charge \u201cthat, if the plaintiff or any of her witnesses have knowingly testified falsely in any material master, this jury may disregard their entire evidence.\u201d The court: \u201cI decline to charge that as a proposition of law. They may take into consideration the entire testimony given by the plaintiff and her witnesses as well as other witnesses.\u201d The defendants excepted, and renewed the request as to the plaintiff alone. The court: \"The jury must take into consideration the entire testimony given and received here; and weigh it according to their best judgment.\u201d Defendants excepted. If the court had charged as requested, we should sustain the charge. Moett v. People, 85 N. Y. 373; Deering v. Metcalf, 74 N. Y. 501; Peyser v. Railroad Co., 81 Hun, 70, 30 N. Y. Supp. 610; Posthoff v. Schreiber, 47 Hun, 593. The request was relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. She had testified: \u201cI was laid up with those injuries for six weeks. It was about twelve weeks before I was able to do my regular work. Six weeks I was lying in bed, steady.\u201d On the other hand, one witness testified to seeing the plaintiff \u201cout by the door\u201d within a week after the explosion; another, to seeing her \u201con the street two or three times within a week of the explosion\u201d; another, to seeing \u201cher right along afterwards, day in and day out,- passing his house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>walking in the street.\u201d Two other witnesses gave similar testimony. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the attendance upon her by two physicians was contradicted. The testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s husband as to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries was also contradicted. The whole of this class of testimony was material upon the question of damages. It was important to know whether the plaintiff told the truth when she testified that she was \u201clying in bed steady for six weeks.\u201d If not, it was fair to argue that she knew it. The error in the refusal to charge, and in the charge as made without the qualification requested, cannot be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Judgment reversed, new trial granted, costs to abide the event.
