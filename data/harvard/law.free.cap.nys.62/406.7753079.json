Plaintiffs assignor entered into a contract with the defendants to furnish and set up a secondhand gas engine, which was guarantied for a period of one year.' It was provided in the contract, among other specifications, that plaintiff\u2019s assignor should instruct a competent man in defendants\u2019 employ in the operating and oiling of the engine; The engine was put in, and instructions were given as provided, and the defendants neglected or refused to pay the contract price for the engine. Plaintiff\u2019s assignor brought an action to recover the agreed price of the engine; alleging in his complaint, with the other necessary averments, fhe instruction of a competent man in defendants\u2019 employ. Defendants, in answering, admitted the instruction of the competent man in th,cir employ, but alleged that the engine \u201cwas never put up in good running order, and that the same would never operate in good running order, although the said defendants had a competent man to run the same.\u201d Upon the trial of the issue thus raised, the jury found for the defendants, and the judgment entered upon that verdict has never been appealed from.' Plaintiff, as the assignee of the original plaintiff, now seeks to bring a new action upon the same state of facts, except that he alleges in his complaint that plaintiff\u2019s assignor instructed \u201csuch men in the employ of the said firm as they furnished and designated for that purpose, how to run and clean said engine\u201d; and, because of the fact that the learned trial court in the original action withdrew the question of the competency of defendants\u2019 employ\u00e9 from the jury, plaintiff urges that the question was not litigated, and that he is not estopped from reopening the controversy by reason of the former adjudication. It is possible that, in a litigation in which the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>of the competency of defendants\u2019 employ\u00e9 was in issue, the judgment would not estop the plaintiff from showing the contrary; but in the action brought by plaintiff\u2019s assignor the issue tried was whether the engine put into the establishment of the defendants was capable of working in a proper manner,\u2014whether it was \"put up in good running order,\u201d\u2014and so long as the judgment is unreversed that question cannot be retried, even though the court erred in withdrawing from the jury the question of the competency of defendants\u2019 employ\u00e9 who is conceded to have been instructed as to the running of the engine. In the original action the plaintiff averred that he had instructed a competent man in the defendants\u2019 employ, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The defendants admitted that allegation, and averred that they had a competent man to run the engine, and the only question for the jury to determine was whether the engine was \"put up in good running order.\u201d Even should the plaintiff now be allowed to show that the defendants\u2019 employ\u00e9 was not competent, it would not disturb the question of fact determined upon the former litigation, that the engine was not put up in good running order, and the action would therefore be unavailing. If there was error on the former trial, the remedy was by an appeal, not by a new action in which the material question of fact disposed of would have to be re-litigated. The judgment in the original action cannot be attacked collaterally, and that is the effect of the action now before us. If the plaintiff has a right of action upon the original contract, because of an alleged error on the part of the trial court in not submitting an incidental question to the jury,\u2014a question which was not raised by the pleadings,\u2014then any litigant who is not satisfied with a verdict may allege error, and by amending his pleadings may have his whole controversy reheard. There is no such law in this state. \"The facts actually decided by an issue in any suit,\u201d say the court in Blair v. Bartlett, 75 N. Y. 150, 153, \u201ccannot be again litigated between the same parties, and are evidence between them, and that conclusive, for the purpose of terminating the litigation; and so are the facts alleged by one party, and directly admitted by the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
