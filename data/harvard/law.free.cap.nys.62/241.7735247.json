In the petition on which the order was granted the plaintiff states that the action is brought to recover moneys due as commissions upon sales of defendant\u2019s goods, and that the inspection is material, in the words \u00f3f the petition, \u201cin order to enable the plaintiff to properly determine the amount due to him from the defendant.\u201d Aside from the question of amount, the moving papers show that the plaintiff is in possession of all the facts requisite to the statement of his cause of action. Under the circumstances, an order for inspection should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>not be made before issue joined, only to enable the plaintiff to insert the ad damnum in his complaint. Taylor v. Ribbon Co., 38 App. Div. 144, 56 N. Y. Supp. 667. As the court said in the case cited: \u201cThere is no rule of pleading requiring that to be stated with accuracy. The plaintiff may name an arbitrary amount, and recover within it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.
