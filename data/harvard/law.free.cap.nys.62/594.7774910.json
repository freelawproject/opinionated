The revenue stamps on the barrel, while in the officer\u2019s possession, were unbroken, and less than a gallon had been taken out, and, though one witness testified-that five and a half gallons had been removed, he also stated the barrel was tight when he opened it. It was admitted that the barrel consigned to H. was the same as that seized, and there was no evidence as to its condition at the time of seizure. <em>Held </em>that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>since to have changed the contents without destroying the stamps would have been a crime, the evidence sufficiently proved the identity of the goods to entitle plaintiff to recover for their conversion.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">Appeal from municipal court, borough of Manhattan, Fourth district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">Action by Charles Connor against Edward L.

The defendant, a marshal, acting \u00fander process against Hemple, seized the barrel, with its contents, whatever they were, while in Hemple\u2019s possession, and sold both barrel and contents. For such seizure and sale was brought this action in conversion. It was testified to for the plaintiff that the stamps on the barrel, while in the marshal\u2019s possession at the auction rooms, were intact, and that less than a gallon had been taken from the original quantity (46.81 gallons), a wantage which might have been accounted for by the tests. On the other hand, a person who went to the sale to buy testified that he examined the barrel, and found there were five and a half gallons out, and that the proof of the goods was 90 per cent. He went to gouge it. Afterwards, on being asked on cross-examination whether it had been opened, he answered: \u201cNo. I think I took a bung-starter, and opened it. The barrel was tight. It was bunged up, but it must have been opened before, otherwise there would have been nothing out.\u201d He did not know, however, the original contents of the barrel. Neither the marshal, nor any one on his behalf, testified to the condition of the barrel at the time of the seizure, and as to whether it had been broached or tampered with. On this, the defendant recovered judgment according to his contention that the plaintiff had not proved ownership of the barrel and the identity of its contents. There was, however, no impeachment of the fact of delivery \u201con consignment,\u201d and the inference of identity was too strong to be disregarded; for not only was the barrel itself confessedly the same, but the contents were presumably so, inasmuch as any one emptying the barrel without effacing the stamps would have been liable, as for a felony, to a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000, and imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years (Rev. St. U. S. \u00a7 3324), and any one changing the contents for the purpose of selling other spirits would have been liable to forfeit $200 and to suffer a fine of not less than $100 or more than $1,000, and imprisonment for not less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>a month nor more than a year (section 3326). The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Judgment reversed, \u00e1nd a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant t\u00f3 abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">FREEDMAN, P.
