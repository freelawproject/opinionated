The referee found as a fact that the plaintiffs had performed the contract on their part, until the defendant refused to pay an installment of $4,535.51, for which a certificate was duly made by the proper officials on the 24th day of March, 1898, which certificate entitled the plaintiffs to payment. He further found that \u201cat many different times the plaintiffs demanded of the comptroller payment\u201d of this sum, but that the comptroller refused to pay it or any part of it; also, that the plaintiffs were \u201cinformed by the officers of the defendant that the contract was invalid, and that no further payment could or would be made thereunder.\u201d Thereafter the plaintiffs ceased work upon the contract,\u2014 having previously notified the defendant that they elected to treat the refusal to pay as a breach,\u2014and brought this action. The learned referee gave the plaintiffs judgment for the value of their services and materials down to the time when they ceased work, but refused damages for loss of profits on work not then done. We do not think this was an accurate conclusion from the facts found. There is undoubtedly a material distinction between the effect of a default in payment of an installment when it becomes due under such a contract as that under consideration, arising from mere temporary inability, and a deliberate refusal, based upon the asserted invalidity of the contract, and the denial of the contractor\u2019s right to proceed or to receive any payment thereunder. The former may be a breach which, while it would permit the contractor to abandon the work, and recover for that already done, would not entitle him to prospective profits. Moore v. Taylor, 42 Hun, 58. But the latter goes to the root of the contract, and is equivalent to an abandonment of it in its entirety. Under such circumstances the contractor is entitled to recover prospective profits. Wharton &amp; Co. v. Winch, 140 N. Y. 296, 35 N. E. 591. It was said in the latter case that even \u201cmere delay in making the stipulated payments might be so inexcusable or unreasonable, or so indicative of an utter inability to perform the entire contract, as to be equivalent to a refusal to perform, and a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right to proceed under it.\u201d What would be inexcusable or unreasonable delay, however, on the part of an individual or a partnership, or even a business corporation, might not be such in the case of a municipal corporation, with its complete system, operated through independent official agencies. The contractor who deals with such a public corporation should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>look for the same promptitude of payment as though he were dealing with private parties. He must expect occasional delay and inconvenience as the natural result of the necessary formalities prescribed by law, and also from unforeseen contingencies,\u2014such as the exhaustion of the fund applicable to the work. Drhew v. Altoona City, 121 Pa. St. 401, 15 Atl. 636. Here, however, the referee has found that the officers of the city deliberately repudiated the plaintiffs\u2019 contract. The \u201cacts, conduct, and declarations\u201d of these officers were equivalent to a deliberate refusal to perform on the city\u2019s part. It is said that the official who denied the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 contract, and informed them that no further payments could or would be made thereunder, had no authority to bind the city by such a declaration. The official in question was the deputy comptroller, and. he and the comptroller were probably the only officials who could thus speak for the city. They were the officials who had to do exclusively with the machinery of payment. When they asserted the invalidity of the contract, and declared that no payment could or would be made thereunder, the plaintiffs heard the final word on the practical side of the question. They could have no hope thereafter of payment, short of a lawsuit. It is also said that the statement made by the deputy comptroller (Daly) was not as broad as that found by the referee. What Mr. Daly actually said, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, was that they (meaning the comptroller and himself) \u201ccould not pay on contracts, on account of the debt limit being overdrawn, as the contract was invalid.\u201d We cannot, upon this appeal, quarrel with the referee\u2019s paraphrase of this language. It was certainly some evidence tending to support his finding, and, as the plaintiffs are the appellants, they have a right to a review of the legal conclusion drawn therefrom. We may, for the purpose of sustaining a judgment, look into the evidence to supply a fact not found (Foundry Co. v. Hersee, 103 N. Y. 25, 9 N. E. 487), or, possibly, to clarify a fact obscurely found, but not to eliminate or vary, for the benefit of the respondent,' a fact which is clearly and distinctly found. The respondent must abide by the finding against which he has not appealed, and upon which the judgment stands, and the appellant has a right to its acceptance by the court as true, and to a decision as to the correctness of the legal conclusion drawn therefrom. Indeed, the court is required, in cases of inconsistency, to accept those findings most favorable to the appellant, and the latter is entitled to rely upon them in aid of his exceptions. Israel v. Railway Co., 158 N. Y. 631, 53 N. E. 517; Parsons v. Parker, 159 N. Y. 16, 53 N. E. 710. We are constrained, therefore, to order a hew trial in this case. We do so with regret and reluctance, for we cannot resist the impression that the referee\u2019s finding was inadvertent. Mr. Daly distinctly denied the statement attributed to him. The plaintiffs\u2019 testimony with regard to it was only brought out in rebuttal, after the defendant had rested its case; and the statement itself might well have been otherwise paraphrased. As it is, however, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered before another referee, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
