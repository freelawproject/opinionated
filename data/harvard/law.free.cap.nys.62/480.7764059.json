His evidence tended to show that the defend ant, a city marshal, seized goods not embraced in a requisition in replevin or in the judgment entered in the replevin action. The plaintiff thus proved a cause of action against the marshal individually for the value of those items which were not and could not have been litigated in the prior suit. That concerned merely ilie title to the articles enumerated in the requisition. As no process in that action could protect the marshal for taking property the title to which was not then litigated, it was incumbent on him to controvert the plaintiff\u2019s proof. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
