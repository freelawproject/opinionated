After Mrs. Podmore\u2019s death, one Bridget Reilley presented the depositor\u2019s pass book to the defendant, stating that it had been given to her by Ann Caldwell, and she then demanded the balance. The defendant\u2019s secretary, Mr. Anderson, advised her to see the counsel of the bank, and told her that, if he was satisfied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>the bank would pay her. A report was subsequently made in favor of Mrs. Eeilley\u2019s claim, whereupon the bank paid the entire balance to her. The counsel did not see Mrs. Eeilley or her witnesses. His report was based upon affidavits furnished him by Mrs. Eeilley\u2019s attorney. These affidavits gave the date of Ann Caldwell\u2019s death and of the alleged gift causa mortis. The first question, therefore, is whether the bank was protected in thus making this payment to Mrs. Eeilley, with full knowledge of Ann Caldwell\u2019s death. The learned trial justice held as matter of law that it was, and denied the plaintiff\u2019s request to go to the jury on that head. He also denied the plaintiff\u2019s request to go to the jury upon the question whether there was a valid gift of the deposit by the deceased to Mrs. Eeilley. His decision is sought to be sustained upon three grounds: First, that the plaintiff failed to identify his intestate with the Ann Caldwell who made the deposit with the defendant; second, that the uncontradicted evidence showed that the defendant exercised due diligence before paying the money to Mrs. Eeilley, and was justified, under the circumstances disclosed, in paying it to her; third, that Ann Caldwell, the depositor, made a valid gift of the bank book and of the money represented by it to Mrs. Eeilley.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">As to the first point, no discussion is necessary. The learned trial justice ruled against the defendant on the question thus presented. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon the specific ground that it had \u201cnot been proved that Mrs. Podmore, the intestate, was the same person who deposited the money in the South Brooklyn Savings Institution, mentioned in the complaint in this action\u201d; and that motion was denied. The learned trial justice thus held, and we quite agree with him, that there was evidence enough to go to the jury on that point. He ruled in the defendant\u2019s favor, however, upon the second and third of the above propositions. As to the second, we are unable to agree with the respondent or with the learned trial justice. The uncontradicted evidence either showed a lack of due diligence, or, at the outside, presented a question for the consideration of the jury. It is, however, .contended that diligence was not required, and that the bank was justified in making the payment without any inquiry. This contention is based upon Mrs. Eeilley\u2019s possession of the pass book, with the depositor\u2019s agreement to be bound by the following by-law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-6\">\u201cAlthough the institution will endeavor to prevent frauds and impositions, yet all payments to persons producing the pass books issued by it shall he valid payments to discharge the institution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">This by-law, however, immediately succeeds another, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-8\">\u201cOn the decease of any depositor, the amount standing to the credit of the deceased shall be paid to his or her legal representatives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">We think the first-quoted by-law applies only to payments made in the lifetime of the depositor, or, at furthest, to payments made without knowledge of his decease. That by-law contemplates, and was aimed to secure, continuous vigilance on the depositor\u2019s part to prevent fraudulent possession of his pass book. It surely was not intended to apply when he was no longer here to guard his pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>book. That the contract on that head was to cease at his death is clearly evidenced by the independent by-law, providing for the bank\u2019s duty with regard to payment after that event. It was held in Farmer v. Institution, 60 Hun, 462, 15 N. Y. Supp. 235, treating of similar by-laws, that they operate upon an entirely different state of circumstances,\u2014the one being to protect the bank against the carelessness of the depositor, and the other to protect the depositor when he is no longer in a position to protect himself. This case is directly in point, and was correctly decided. We think the reasoning of Presiding Justice Van Brunt there is quite conclusive. It leaves nothing more to be said upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-3\">The defendant must, therefore, stand upon the right and title of Mrs. Reilley; and that brings us to the consideration of the respondent\u2019s third proposition. Was there a valid gift causa mortis to Mrs. Reilley? Two seemingly disinterested witnesses testified on the subject of this gift. One of them, Mrs. Madden, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-4\">\u201cI was present at a transaction between Mrs. Reilley and Mrs. Caldwell In Mrs. Reilley\u2019s room, in the afternoon of November 22d, two days before Mrs. Caldwell died. Mrs. Reilley was changing Mrs. Caldwell\u2019s clothes, and she had a bag around her, and she took from it a number of books. I can\u2019t say how many, or what they were, but she took the books from the bag, and handed them to Mrs. Reilley; and Mrs. Reilley said: \u2018You are a very sick woman.\u2019 She says: \u2018Yes, I am. I\u2019m afraid I am going to die.\u2019 She said: \u2018Take these books, and bury me out of them, and what is left out of it is yours,\u2019\u2014and handed Mrs. Reilley the books. Mrs. Reilley took the books, and put them in the drawer on the bureau.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The other witness, Mrs. Hurst, gave the following account of what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-7\">\u201cI am quite sure that Mrs. Caldwell presented the books to Mrs. Reilley, and said: T think I am going to die.\u2019 She told her she knew she was going to die. No; I don\u2019t think she said that mofe than once, but she did say that. She did say: T am going to die, and upon that account\u2019\u2014I am sure of that \u2014\u2018upon that account I am giving you these books. Bury me out of those, and what is left shall be yours.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Assuming that the pass book in question was one of those then and there delivered by the deceased to Mrs. Reilley, we think the language used in connection with the delivery constituted a valid gift causa mortis. There was no reservation or limitation attached to the gift. It was absolute and unconditional. It has been repeatedly held, both in England and in this country, that words of similar import to those here used, \u201cTake these books, and bury me out of them, and what is left is yours,\u201d do not limit or place a condition upon the gift. They simply impose upon the donee a trust duty to pay the expenses of the donor\u2019s funeral. Hills v. Hills, 8 Mees. &amp; W. 401; Bouts v. Ellis, 17 Beav. 121; Blount v. Burrow, 4 Brown, Ch. 72; Clough v. Clough, 117 Mass. 83; Pierce v. Bank, 129 Mass. 425; Curtis v. Bank, 77 Me. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">The testimony of these witnesses, however, failed the defendant in one important particular. They were unable to identify the particular pass book in question as one of those which were delivered by the deceased to Mrs. Reilley, This, of course, was essential. In re Wiegel\u2019s Estate, 76 Hun, 462, 28 N. Y. Supp. 95; Podmore v. Bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>29 Misc. Rep. 393, 60 N. Y. Supp. 533. Mrs. Reilley, however, supplied the proof of identification. She was called by the plaintiff for another purpose, and upon her cross-examination she testified* that the book in question was given to her by Ann Caldwell. The -only objection made to this testimony was that it was not cross-examination. The defendant\u2019s counsel then stated that he would make Mrs. Reilley his own witness for that purpose, and there was no further objection to the question. But while this testimony thus became a proper subject for the consideration of the jury, it was not conclusive. As the defendant practically stood in Mrs. Reilley\u2019s shoes, she was to all intents and purposes an interested witness, and \u25a0her testimony should have been treated as though she were her\u2022self the contesting party. The learned trial justice should certainly have submitted the question of her credibility to the jury. The validity of the gift depended upon the actual delivery of this particular pass book at the time and under the circumstances disclosed by the other witnesses, and consequently it was error to withdraw from the 'jury the question as to whether or not there was a valid gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">There were other rulings which would probably have necessitated a new trial; but, in view of the point discussed, we do not deem it necessary to consider them. AYe may say, however, that the affidavits which were furnished by Mrs. Reilley\u2019s attorney to the defendant\u2019s counsel should not have been admitted in evidence generally. They were evidence only upon the question of diligence, and yet they seem to have been placed unqualifiedly before the jury as evidence of the alleged gift. _ '</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The judgment appealed from, and the order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
