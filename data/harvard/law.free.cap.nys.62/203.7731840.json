Marcy against Adolph Reimer and another for damages for cutting a pipe which carried water to plaintiff\u2019s premises from a spring on defendants\u2019 adjoining land. The parties held under a common grantor, by deeds executed on the same day, but \u2022defendants had previously been in possession under a contract of -sale. From a judgment for defendants, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AqVd\">.Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b221-12\">The following is the opinion of the trial court:.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-13\">The deeds by which the parties obtained title to their respective lands were both delivered on the same day. Whose deed was delivered first? The parties and their witnesses differ on this point. A Mrs. White owned a tract of land. She agreed to sell a part of the tract to Reimer in January, 1894; deed to be delivered March 31, 1894, with possession delivered immediately. There was a spring on the piece Reimer bought, from which water was conveyed by underground pipes, which discharged in a tub above the surface of the ground on the part of the White land which she retained. No reservation of the right to have the water flow to the tub was contained in the agreement, .and Reimer knew nothing of the source of the water flow which discharged in the tub. On the 20th of March, 1894, one Feroe agreed with Mrs. White to buy the part of the tract not sold to Reimer, and to pay $500 on the 31st of March, 1894, and take a deed securing -the remainder by mortgage on the property. On the 31st March, 1894, Mrs. White attended, with her deeds,\u2014one to Reimer and the other to Feroe. It then, for the first time, was proposed by \u25a0Feroe that the plaintiff, who was his son-in-law, should take the deed, and he would secure the payment of the part of purchase money unpaid by an additional security on his (Feroe\u2019s) other lands. This made a change in the deed necessary, and also a new mortgage. This mortgage was drawn by a justice \u25a0of the peace. Feroe is dead; but the agent of the owner, Mrs. White, and \u2022others give evidence tending to show that the Feroe deed was delivered about \u25a0half past one or two o\u2019clock p. m., and before the Reimer deed. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ant\u2019s witnesses say that the Feroe deed was not completed until one or two-o\u2019clock p. m. I think the circumstances support the views of' the defendant. The parties all met at the same place, in respect to both deeds. Reimer had but. to pay the purchase price and take his deed. Feroe could not take his deed until after a new mortgage was drawn on other property, and this would naturally take time, and meanwhile the deed would be withheld. I find that theReimer deed was first delivered. There was no reservation in it of the right, to the water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-4\">There is another disputed question between the owner and Marcy; Mrs. White\u2019s agent, Smith, stating that the plaintiff, before the deed was given, saw the water running in the tub, and asked him about it, and he replied to-him that he would not guaranty that. The plaintiff denies this. I think the agent, Smith, is entitled to credit. He is uninterested, and it is natural that plaintiff should ask, before purchasing, whether or not the water flow in, the tub would be continued, and where it came from. Plaintiff\u2019s deed contained no grant of the right in direct words, or in any way, unless it passed, as an appurtenant to the land. In point of fact, it could not be an appurtenant when the Marcy deed was given, for the right of Mrs. White had then been-conveyed away. Mrs. White had no' right to it, and could convey none by deed. It was not a right which passed as an appurtenant, under the evidence in this-case. Root v. Wadhams, 107 N. Y. 384, 14 N. E. 281. The owner never intended to reserve the right, and sold by absolute conveyance. -The purchaser, Reimer, knew of no easement. None was visibly imposed on the same. Wells-v. Garbutt. 132 N. Y. 430, 30 N. E. 978. The complaint of the plaintiff should be dismissed, with costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b222-5\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAb\">We concur generally in the opinion delivered below by Mr. Justice BARNARD, and desire to add but a word in amplification. The learned trial judge properly found that the contract, the possession thereunder, the delivery of the deed to Reimer, the defendant, and the record thereof, antedated those of the plaintiff. It is, of course, clear that the plaintiff could take nothing from his grantor, Mrs. White, the former owner of both parcels, except what the grantor herself had at the time of the conveyance to him. The law is well settled that, in the case of implied grants or reservations of appurtenances or easements, a very different rule obtains between grantor and grantee. One is much more readily implied in favor of the grantee than in favor of the grantor. Wells v. Garbutt, 132 N. Y. 430, 30 N. E. 978; Paine v. Chandler, 134 N. Y. 385, 32 N. E. 18. Had Mrs. White owned the whole property at the time of her conveyance to the plaintiff, it may well be that, under the decisions cited, there would have passed to him the easement to the water flowing from the spring on premises not conveyed. But at that time she did not own the adjacent premises on which the spring was located; and, underlie cases cited, when Mrs. White conveyed to the defendant no-reservation of the easement over the land conveyed would have been, implied in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
