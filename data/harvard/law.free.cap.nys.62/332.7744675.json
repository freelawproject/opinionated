Mrs. Raab\u2019s executor rejected the claim, and thereupon it was referred, by agreement and order, to.a referee to hear and determine. We have gone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>over the evidence adduced before the referee, and we think it justified him in finding, as he did, that the services specified in the claim were rendered, and that they were so rendered with the expectation and upon the understanding that Mrs. Raab would compensate Mrs. Kuhn therefor. The circumstances under which the services were rendered were such as to warrant the implication of a promise to pay the claimant their reasonable value. The questions upon this head, both of fact and law, were carefully considered by the referee, and we see nothing in his opinion upon the merits which calls for criticism. We think, however, that his certificate allowing costs against the executor was unwarranted. Costs can be allowed against an executor in such a proceeding as this only when the referee certifies that the payment of the claim was unreasonably resisted or neglected. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1835, 1836, 2718; Whitcomb v. Whitcomb, 92 Hun, 443, 36 N. Y. Supp. 607, citing Matson v. Abbey, 141 N. Y. 179, 36 N. E. 11. No such certificate was given here; nor could the referee have properly so certified, for the claim, when and as presented to the executor, was certainly a doubtful one. Mrs. Kuhn apparently made no request for payment during Mrs. Eaab\u2019s lifetime, and her original demand upon the executor was materially reduced, namely, from $1,300 to $992.50, Anderson v. McCann, 14 App. Div. 365, 43 N. Y. Supp. 956; Ryan v. McElroy, 15 App. Div. 216, 44 N. Y. Supp. 196. It is conceded that the disbursements were properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The judgment should accordingly be modified by striking out the allowance of costs, and as modified affirmed, without costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
