Chase appeared, pursuant to said order, and was examined. Upon his testimony there given, and an affidavit made by Mr. Daley in which he states: \u201cI have made a search for the judgment debtor herein, but cannot find him. I have been informed by Horton Chase, the receiver of the property of the judgment debtor, that the said judgment debtor is now without the state of Hew York, and is somewhere in the South, and is not now within this state,\u201d\u2014the court was moved to dispense with notice to the judgment debtor, and to extend the receivership of Chase to this proceeding, which motion was granted. Two days thereafter the judgment debtor, upon an order to show cause, moved at special term to vacate the said order extending the receivership, and to dismiss the proceeding. This motion was denied. From the order denying that motion this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Section 2464 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">\u201cAt least two flays of notice of application for the order appointing a receiver must be given personally to the judgment debtor, unless the judge is satisfied that he cannot with reasonable diligence be found within the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">\u201cDue diligence\u201d has been defined in the case of McCracken v. Flanagan, 127 N. Y. 493, 28 N. E. 385. The facts set forth in Daley\u2019s affidavit, as above mentioned, do not amount to reasonable diligence. It simply says, \u2018T have made a search for the judgment debtor, and cannot find him.\u201d It does not state where he made the search. The section quoted says: If the judgment debtor \u201ccannot with reasonable diligence be found within the state.\u201d The affidavit further states that. Mr. Chase, the receiver, informed him that the judgment debtor was in the South; but there is no source whatever shown from which Chase derived his knowledge. For this reason the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>had no power to make the order dispensing with the giving of the two-days notice as required by said section 2464. Failure to give such notice is an irregularity for which the order should be set aside. Strong v. Epstein, 14 Abb. N. C. 342; Grace v. Curtiss (City Ct. N. Y.) 23 N. Y. Supp. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">The order appealed from, therefore, as far as it extended the receivership, etc., is reversed; and as far as it denies the dismissal of this proceeding it is affirmed, because the affidavit states that \u201cexecution against the judgment debtor was issued to the sheriff of the counties of New York and Kings.\u201d It is stated in the conjunctive, and not in the disjunctive; and for that reason we hold the affidavit sufficient to satisfy section 2458 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as far as New York county is concerned. The affidavit fully sets forth that judgment was obtained in the city court; that it was docketed in New York county; that an execution was issued to the sheriff of New York county, where said Furbish at the time of the commencement of this special proceeding resided, and now resides; and that the sheriff has returned said execution unsatisfied. It is to be considered that the defendant, the judgment debtor, makes no affidavit whatsoever on these motions; that his residence is nowhere disclosed; that the affidavit of Lounsbury, the father-in-law of said judgment debtor, is disregarded, because it is verified before John Naumer, as commissioner of deeds, who is the attorney for the judgment debtor on these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">No costs to either side on this appeal. Order modified as stated - herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">O\u2019DWYER, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
