According to his own testimony, he had driven along that track for some 300 feet, was familiar with the locality, and knew that cars were passing and repassing there very frequently. His use of the track was liable to a lawful interruption from a party having the right to an unobstructed way, and exercising that right for the public good in part. It was his duty not only to avoid collision, but also to cause no needless delay to the defendant, and he might not wait to hear a signal of the approach of a car, but he had needs at intervals to look backward for it.
