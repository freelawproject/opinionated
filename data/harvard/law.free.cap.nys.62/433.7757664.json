Pratt employed the plaintiff as traveling salesman on his own account, or on behalf of the defendants. While the plaintiff and Pratt pretend that the employment was for the defendants, we search the record in vain for any evidence of hiring. Kor is this failure of proof supplied inferentially by the evidence concerning the services rendered. At the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case, conflicting testimony of his acts and Statements pointed with equal consistency to either of the two alleged employers. The only solution of this uncertainty is found in the defendants\u2019 emphatic denial of any employment by them, and of the rendition of any services for them. Obviously, under those circumstances, the court was justified in finding for the defendants. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
