The affidavit upon which he was held states that he \u201cdid maliciously publish of and concerning the Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Association the following defamatory language, to wit: \u2018The Sun is against good wages,\u2019 and \u2018The Sun now practices what it long has preached, that workingmen have no rights that capital is bound to respect.\u2019 \u201d The affidavit shows the manner in which these defamatory words were published, but fails to connect the corporation therewith. The charge itself was sufficient. Code Cr. Proc. \u00a7 289. But there was no evidence to support it in the particular referred to. This section (289) of the Code of Criminal Procedure dispenses with an averment upon that head, but not with proof. On the contrary, after providing that an indictment for libel need not set forth any extrinsic facts for the purpose of showing the application of the defamatory matter to the party libeled, and that it is sufficient to state generally that the same was published concerning him, it adds: \u201cAnd the fact that it was so published [that is, concerning him] must be established on the trial.\u201d Conforming the preliminary inquiry before a magistrate to this provision, the charge was doubtless sufficient. There should, however, have been some evidence tending to support it. Otherwise the magistrate was withont jurisdiction to hold the relator. The libel complained of was a malicious publication, by writing or printing, which had a tendency to injure the corporation named in its business. But its business was. not stated, nor was it shown that it published the \u201cSun\u201d specified in the libel, nor that the \u201cSun\u201d so specified was a newspaper. There was in fact no proof in support of the charge that the defamatory words were published concerning the corporation, nor that they had any relation to its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The other points presented by the appellant are without merit, but, because of the lack of proof in the particular mentioned, the order should be reversed, and the relator discharged. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
