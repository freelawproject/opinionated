He testified that while feeding a cylinder press he slipped from a box or platform upon which he was standing; that a cogwheel caught the knee of his trousers, and tore his leg. Whether that wheel was or was not guarded according to the requirements of the factory act, does not appear. Assuming, however, that it was not, it does appear that the plaintiff was of discretionary age, and had worked at that press sufficiently long to be charged with obvious perils, and so could and must be held to have waived the protection of the act by accepting the employment, and working and continuing to work upon such a machine. Knisley v. Pratt, 148 N. Y. 372, 42 N. E. 986, 32 L. R. A. 367. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
