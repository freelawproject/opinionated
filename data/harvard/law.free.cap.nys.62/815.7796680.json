Without determining the question whether the action\u2014being for damages to plaintiffs\u2019 business and premises, of which they were in possession as lessees\u2014was entitled to a preference, w\u00e9 think the motion should have been denied upon the ground of waiver. Section 793 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides \u201cthat in the county of New York\u201d \u201cthe party desiring a preference of any cause shall serve upon the opposite party, with his notice of trial, a notice that an application will be made to the court at the opening thereof,\u201d and it has been held in many cases that the failure to make the motion at that time operates as a waiver of the statutory right to a preference. Marks v. Murphy, 27 App. Div. 160, 50 N. Y. Supp. <em>622; </em>Haskin v. Murray, 29 App. Div. 373, 51 N. Y. Supp. 542. Here the notice of trial was served for the November term, and at the bottom of such notice was a statement that a motion would be made \u201cto place the cause upon the short-cause calendar.\u201d On November 28th such a motion was made on an affidavit which stated that the trial of the action would not occupy mor\u00e9 than two hours. The judge did not, however, grant the motion upon the ground that the action was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>short cause, but for the reason, as stated, that it was, under the statute, entitled to a preference. To obtain such preference, the plaintiffs should have served, with the notice of trial, a notice of motion, and the failure to do so was a waiver of the statutory privilege. Notice of an intention to move to place on the preferred calendar on the ground that it is a short cause is not the equivalent of a notice of motion for a statutory preference, which should be served with the notice of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The order, accordingly, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
