Graves v. Blanchard, 4 How. Prac. 301. If stated in paragraphs separately numbered, it is sufficient. 4 N. Y. Law Bul. 31. But the statement of facts in separately numbered paragraphs, or alleged by mistake as separate causes of action, does not vitiate the pleading, if but a single cause of action or defense is in fact pleaded. Harris, J., in Hillman v. Hill-man, 14 How. Prac. 458, 459; Daniels, J., in Weeks v. Cornwell, 9 Civ. Proc. B. 28. The paragraphs of the answer here should be read together, and construed to contain but one defense,\u2014a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right of possession, and an allegation of a special property and right of possession in the defendant. But the complaint and answer are examples of the vicious practice of separately numbering the paragraphs of a pleading intended to set up only a single cause of action or defense,\u2014a practice which serves no useful purpose in pleading, and often tends to mislead or confuse. It is not required. The statement of the facts constituting each cause of action and each defense or counterclaim must be separately stated and numbered. No other numbering is required. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 438, 507. The answer sets up a complete defense, being expressly within the terms of section 1720 of the Code.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-7\">The complaint alleges that the plaintiff derived his title and right of possession from \u201cone\u201d David B. Cassel, and, after the denial in the answer, it is alleged that \u201cone\u201d David B. Cassel delivered the goods to the defendant upon an agreement that the defendant should hold and sell the same to satisfy his general balance of account against Cassel, amounting to $2,300, and return the surplus to Cassel, and that at no time since the consignment have the goods been worth more than $2,300, etc. It is somewhat hypercritical for counsel to urge that there is no allegation in the answer \u201cshowing who this Cassel was,\u201d when the plaintiff himself alleges the ownership of David B. Cassel as the source of his title. Demurrer overruled, with costs. Decision signed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b438-8\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
