Section 1336, Consol. Act. The mere presence of the sureties in court on the return day is not a compliance with the requirements of the statute. It is the plaintiff\u2019s duty to procure the justification, and, if he neglects to do so, the defendant, unless he consents to an adjournment of the justification, which was not done in this case, is entitled to the immediate return of the property taken by the marshal, and, in default of such-return, the marshal becomes personally liable therefor. Webb v. Hecox, 27 Misc. Rep. 169, 58 N. Y. Supp. 382; Goff v. Bliss, 12 Civ. Proc. R. 99. The rights of the plaintiffs in this case, who were the defendants in the replevin action, were in no wise impaired by consenting to the adjournment of the trial of the action from time to-time. Nothing transpired, so far as the record discloses,\" which could be held to he a waiver on plaintiffs\u2019 part. It appears that the chattels were delivered by the marshal to the plaintiff in the replevin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>action immediately after the levy. As this was done without the consent of the plaintiffs in this action, the marshal incurred a penalty of \u00a7100, in addition to the damages sustained. Section 1340, Consol. Act. These damages were shown to be \u00a735, and the plaintiffs, under the proofs in this case, thereby became entitled to a judgment for \u00a7135, besides the costs of this action. The judgment appealed from, which was rendered in favor of the defendant, is entirely unsupported by the proof, and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the plaintiffs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
