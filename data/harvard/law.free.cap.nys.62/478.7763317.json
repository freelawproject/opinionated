J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU4\">The plaintiff brought this action to recover for personal injuries, and damages to his horse and wagon, occasioned by a collision with one of the defendant\u2019s cars. The plaintiff was driving a covered wagon, and, coming out of Delaney street, drove a short distance up the Bowery, in the direction of Spring street, intending to cross the Bowery from east to west. As he was driving out of Delaney street he saw a car at Broome street coming up town, at' a distance of about 250 feet away. After proceeding northerly upon the track of the approaching car for some distance, he turned west; and, as a portion of his wagon got off the car track, it was struck by the car, and the injuries complained of were received. There was no testimony to show that from the time the plaintiff went upon the car tracks at or near Delaney street, and then saw the car near Broome street, that he again looked, or made any attempt to observe the approaching car. He voluntarily placed himself in a dangerous position by going upon the track, conscious of the approach of a car, and thereafter relied wholly upon the vigilance of the employ\u00e9s of the defendant to enable him to escape danger. Under such circumstances, it\" cannot be said that he was free from negligence. The judgment must there-\" fore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">MacLEAN, J., concurs.
