Thereafter the defendant took possession of the stock, upon the latter\u2019s premises, under sale in mortgage foreclosure, and now claims ownership of goods in controversy by bill of sale executed by Beyer, and dated December 15, 1893. There was sufficient evidence, however, to warrant the jury in finding, as they did, ownership and right to possession in the plaintiff, despite his act in clothing Beyer with actual and apparent power to sell, because the defendant, though innocent, was not a purchaser for value, surrendering nothing beyond an antecedent debt, insufficient in law. Barnard v. Campbell, 58 N. Y. 73. But under the circumstances of this case, and the decision of Tinsdale v. Murray, 9 Daly, 446, we cannot entertain this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Appeal dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
