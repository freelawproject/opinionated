We do not, however, decide that the judgment or the Kalb agreement is enforceable by the defendant. The parties to be affected by a decision of that kind are not all before the court. If the surety company seeks to enforce the judgment or the agreement against either of these parties, whatever defense^ they have can be interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">Orders affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
