Act, subd. 3, \u00a7 1420, as amended by Laws 1894, c. 750), but the nonpayment of these costs did not deprive the defendant of the right to take part in the trial on the adjourned day. Section 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure, providing for the staying of proceedings of the party defaulting in the payment of costs, has no application to the municipal court. Even where that section is applicable, the nonpayment of costs never impairs the defensive rights of a party. Randell v. Abrisqueta, 20 Abb. N. C. 292. The stay mentioned in section 779 of the Code is intended only to prevent an onward movement in the action by the party who owes costs of motion. When the plaintiff moved his case for trial on the adjourned day, the defendant should have been permitted to participate therein, and introduce his proofs. Where motion costs are granted in the municipal court, they are to be included in the judgment if the party is successful, or offset against the costs of the successful party if the party entitled to the costs should be finally defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-19\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
