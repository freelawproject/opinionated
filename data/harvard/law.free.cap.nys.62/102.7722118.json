Y. The defendant was at that time, and is now, the superintendent of such institution. On or about the 3d day of August, 1899, the board of managers of said House of Eefuge made written charges against the relator, and a copy of them was served upon her, and on the 7th day of August a copy of such charges was tiled with the civil service commission. Thereafter, and on the 10th day of August, a copy of these charges was delivered to the defendant by the president of the board of managers. On the 5th day of August the relator served upon said board of managers an answer, in writing, to such charges, which answer was delivered to the defendant ow the 10th day of August. On the 10th day of August, 1899, the defendant removed the relator from her office of general superintendent, and notice in writing of such removal was served upon her personally; On the same day a resolution was duly adopted by the board of managers of such House of Eefuge, approving and ratifying the\u2019 action of the defendant in removing the relator. A copy of such resolution was served upon the relator with the notice of removal. Thereafter the relator served upon the defendant a written demand that she forthwith reinstate the relator in the office of general superintendent of such House of Eefuge. The defendant refused to comply with such demand, whereupon the relator made application for a writ of peremptory mandamus to compel the defendant to reinstate her in such position, and from the order granting such writ of peremptory mandamus this appeal is taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b121-6\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Y., in violation of the civil service laws and the rules and regulations of the civil service commission, and for that reason seeks a reinstatement. In the view that I have taken of this case, it is of no consequence whether the rules promulgated by the state civil service commission in terms apply to the relator\u2019s case or not, and I therefore decline to discuss that question. There is no fixed or definite term of office for a general superintendent of the House of Refuge for Women at Hudson, or for any other officer or employ\u00e9 of that institution, so far as I can discover from an examination of the statutes of the state. The legislature has conferred upon the superintendent of that institution power to appoint and remove all subordinate female officers and employ\u00e9s, subject to the approval of the board. Laws 1896, c. 546, \u00a7 144, subd. 3. The relator was a subordinate female officer or employ\u00e9 of that institution. Section 3 of article 10 of the constitution of the state reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\u201cWhen the duration of any office is not provided for 1/ this constitution, it may be declared by law, and if not so declared, such office shall be held during the pleasure of the authority making the appointment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">It may be that a law making the term of office to last during good behavior, as is frequently done, would be a compliance with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u2022 section of the constitution. But neither the statute in \"relation to the House.of Refuge for Women at Hudson, the civil service law, nor any law of the state that I have been able to find, fixes any such tenure of office to persons occupying the position formerly held by the relator. Indeed, the law in relation to subordinate female officers and employ\u00e9s of the House of Refuge for Women at Hudson makes the term of such officers and employ\u00e9s dependent upon the will and pleasure of the general superintendent, subject to the approval of the board of managers, thus negativing the idea of any fixed tenure of office of such female subordinate officers or employ\u00e9s; and, in the absence of any law declaring the duration- of such term of office, it is, in the words of the constitution, to \u201cbe held during the pleasure of the authority making the appointment.\u201d The authority in this case was the defendant, the superintendent of said House of R\u00e9fuge. Assuming that the rules promulgated by the civil service commission are, in their terms, applicable to persons holding positions like those of the relator, it must be obvious that such rules cannot in any way limit or restrain the power conferred by the constitution. To hold otherwise would be to deprive the appointing authority of the power expressly conferred upon it by the section of the constitution I have cited. It therefore becomes of no consequence whether the rules of the civil service commission were complied with or not. The defendant could have removed the relator without any charges, without assigning any cause, and without giving- notice to any person except the relator herself, because, no duration being fixed for such office by the law, she held her position only during the defendant\u2019s pleasure; and, when the defendant signified her pleasure that the relator\u2019s occupancy should cease, that ended her right to hold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal, and the motion for the writ of peremptory mandamus denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
