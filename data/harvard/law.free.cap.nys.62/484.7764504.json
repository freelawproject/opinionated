He testified that, by his contract with the defendants, he was to receive commissions only on such goods as went out in response to Ms erders, and that he could not tell whether all the items included in Ms bill had been shipped or not. Furthermore, the amount of his sales, the basis of commissions\u2019 computation, was, as appears by his cross-examination, very materially less than the sum claimed in his bill, and for wMch he recovered.
