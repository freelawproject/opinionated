The pleadings were oral, and the answer was a general denial. The plaintiff placed with the defendant (one of the marshals of the city of New York), for collection, an execution against the property of one Morris Finklestein, issued by the municipal court of the city of New York upon a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>against the latter. Upon the return of the writ unsatisfied, an execution against the person was delivered to the defendant, which was likewise returned unsatisfied. But little evidence was introduced upon the trial. The plaintiff (the only witness called) testified that the defendant, after the executions had been intrusted to his care, admitted that he had collected part of the sum due, and that \u201cMr. Finklestein had got away from him.\u201d He also put in evidence two letters sent to him by the defendant. In one of them, bearing date August 13, 1898, the defendant states' that he has consented to accept payment of the execution in weekly installments of $5 each; and in the other, dated December 9, 1898, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">\u201cI received $8.00 on account, with the understanding that, if the balance was not paid in two weeks, the same should be returned, and body judgment executed. At that time Finklestein\u2019s wife was confined in bed, and through sympathy I entered into this agreement. Finklestein immediately moved, and I lost all track of him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">At the close of the case the defendant moved for a dismissal of the complaint on the grounds (1) that the court had no jurisdiction of the cause; (2) that the plaintiff had failed to establish a cause of action; and (3) that the execution against the person was void. The trial justice dismissed the action, and stated as his reason \u201cthat it nowhere appears that the defendant was ever in the custody of the-officer,\u201d to which the plaintiff noted an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Without passing upon the points urged in support of the first and third grounds of tire aforesaid motion, I am of the opinion that the court below was clearly right in making the \"ruling which is the subject of review upon this appeal. It is an elementary rule that, in order to maintain a charge against an officer for the escape of a prisoner, the plaintiff must show that such custodianship did in fact exist. 11 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2d Ed.) pp. 267, 268. Viewing the-proof in the most favorable light to the plaintiff, I cannot fairly reach, any other conclusion than that he has failed to establish this necessary prerequisite to the maintenance of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Entertaining, as I do, these views, it follows that the judgment-should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
