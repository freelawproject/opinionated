Hurry v. Coffin, 11 Daly, 180; Spiero v. Railway Co., 14 Misc. Rep. 21, 35 N. Y. Supp. 123; Schwartz v. Schendel, 24 Misc. Rep. 733, 53 N. Y. Supp. 829. In the case at bar the plaintiff failed to show in any way that the goods sold were her property, or that the transaction was had by her, or on her account, with the defendants. Her testimony shows that the sale was made by her husband, but what interest she had in the matter is not disclosed. In view of the conclusion which we have reached, that the proofs fail to sustain the judgment, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions raised on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
