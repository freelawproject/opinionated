Judgment is asked for the immediate possession of the wall, and, as damages, the rents and profits, and the value of the us\u00e9 and occupation. The answer denies the plaintiff\u2019s title. In the affidavit to obtain the order for examination it is stated that the defendants, who are billposters and displayers of advertising signs, have covered the plaintiff\u2019s property with signs, posters, billboards, placards, and other advertising mediums, and have let to a large number of persons and corporations spaces on the plaintiff\u2019s wall and premises, charging therefor different sums, varying with the form of advertising, the amount of space, and the duration of occupancy; and that from these rentals the defendants derive a large incom\u00e9. Additional facts are stated, tending to show that an\" examination of the defendants is material and necessary to enable the plaintiff to prove her damages at the trial. On this affidavit the plaintiff obtained an order for examination, which the defendants subsequently moved to vacate on numerous grounds, none of which were passed upon by the court below excepting the claim that the action, as alleged, in ejectment, would not lie. On that ground the order for the examination' was vacated, and it is from the conclusion thus reached that the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In vacating the order of examination for the reason that, upon the facts stated, the action was misconceived, and ejectment would not lie, the decision of the special term, as appears from the opinion, was based upon the recent case of Goldman v. Advertising Co., 29 Misc. Rep. 133, 60 N. Y. Supp. 275, in which the appellate term held that a contract by which an owner of real estate leased a wall of his house was not in fact a lease. In that case, however, there was no question of title, as there is here; nor were the facts therein, or in Reynolds v. Van Beuren, 155 N. Y. 120, 49 N. E. 763, 42 L. R. A. 129, or Lowell v. Strahan, 145 Mass. 1, 12 N. E. 401, like these set forth in the present instance. Here the allegations are directed to showing that the defendants have exercised acts of authority and dominion over the property as owners or lessees, and that for four years they have conducted their business or trade on the premises, and by the answer to the complaint the question of the plaintiff\u2019s title is raised. In view of the pleadings, therefore, we think that it was error for, the special term, in disposing of the defendants\u2019 motion, to determine the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action, and on that ground alone to vacate the order for examination. It is only where, upon the face, and by a bare inspection, of the complaint, it appears to be frivolous, that on such a motion the right to maintain the action should be determined. In this court we are not called upon, any more than was the special term, to determine the sufficiency of the complaint beyond stating that it is not, in our opinion, frivolous. We think, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action in ejectment was improperly disposed-of on the motion to vacate the-order for examination. The determination of that right should be left till the trial, or made when the question is raised by demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Though the ground taken below was erroneous, the order should be affirmed, if any of the other objections made by defendants are good. We are required, then, to consider such other objections as to whether the damages claimed could be recovered, whether the defendants could be compelled to submit to an examination which might tend to criminate them, and whether the affidavit upon which the qrder was obtained was defective. As to the first point, the Code provides that in ejectment the damages recoverable shall \u201cinclude the rents and profits or the value of the use and occupation of the property where either can be legally recovered by the plaintiff.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1496, 1497, 1531. Relating to this subject, the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit states that she \u201cdesires and expects to prove as her damages upon the trial of this action the amount of the rents and profits, or the value of the use and occupation of the plaintiff\u2019s wall; and, in order to prove said damages, desires to examine the defendants, to show the various leasings or hiring out of spaces, their duration, and the amount of rental or revenue derived by defendants therefrom, when and from whom received. * * *\u201d Assuming\u2014as we should till the question is properly disposed of\u2014that the plaintiff can maintain the action, then the facts sought to be proved are relevant and material upon the question of damages; and, as such facts are stated to be \u2018 peculiarly within the defendants\u2019 knowledge and control, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>plaintiff is entitled to an examination of either or both of them. It appears that one of the defendants\u2014William Keagan\u2014has been an invalid for 15 years last past, and during that period has not personally transacted business of any kind, and would be unable to testify to any facts relating to the premises in question. This is a perfect answer to so much of the plaintiff\u2019s motion as seeks to examine him; but it does not render her affidavit entirely defective, for, sickness not being a fact of which the plaintiff should know or will be presumed to have known, the only result is that the order appealed from must be affirmed as far as it affects Keagan. The question whether the information sought to be elicited by the examination of the defendants might tend to criminate them by showing that they were guilty of misdemeanor, is one to be left till the examination takes place. \u25a0 The privilege to which reference is made is at best but a personal one, which may be waived; and it may be that some of the information sought will not have a tendency to criminate. This matter, however, as stated, should be reserved till the examination occurs, and can then be disposed of by the judge before whom the proceedings are conducted. So, too, the objection as to the books which the plaintiff desires to have produced can only be determined at the time of the examination, when it will appear how far they will be necessary to enable the witness to testify. What the plaintiff is entitled to is the right to examine the defendant Clark; and if he, without the aid of books which he possesses, is unable to furnish the information sought, then he can be required to resort thereto for the purposes of refreshing his memory, or giving the facts desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">We think that the order below should be modified, without costs, by affirming it so far as it vacates the order of examination as to the defendant Keagan, but that it should be reversed so far as it relates to the defendant Clark, and that the motion to vacate the order for his examination should be denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
