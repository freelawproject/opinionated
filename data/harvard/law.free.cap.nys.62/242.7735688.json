In order to entitle the plaintiff to an injunction, he must show that the act of the defendant will inflict some special injury upon his rights. Milhau v. Sharp, 27 N. Y. 611. And an injunction will not be granted at the instance of a property owner, except so far as it is necessary to prevent interference with the special right of which the party is possessed. Beekman v. Railroad Co., 13 App. Div. 279, 43 N. Y. Supp. 174. In the present case it appeared that the plaintiff had given his consent to the construction of the defendant\u2019s railroad. So far, therefore, as his special property right is affected, such consent operated to make the act of the defendant, as to him, lawful. At least, it is so far to be regarded as conferring upon the defendant a legal right to construct its railroad as to deny to the plaintiff the right to a preliminary injunction, as prima facie he would not be entitled to relief. That the defendant is in possession of such consent does not appear to be disputed by the moving party. So far as Horan\u2019s affidavit is concerned, as to this subject, it is purely hearsay testimony. It should therefore be disregarded. For these reasons the order should be reversed, and the injunction dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Order reversed, and injunction dissolved, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
