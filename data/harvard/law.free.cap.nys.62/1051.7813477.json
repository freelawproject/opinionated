As to parcel No. 1, described in the petition, the averment was that it was not incumbered by any lien or liens, except the judgment upon which the proceeding is based. In fact, the heirs of the decedent had mortgaged this property to-Carl and Margaretha Drager, and such mortgage was a lien thereon at the time the proceeding was instituted. Upon discovery of these facts, the petitioner moved before the surrogate to amend the petition by setting out said mortgage as a lien, and further asked that a supplemental citation issue, bringing in the mortgagees as parties to the proceeding. The amendment having been granted, Helena Bachmann, a purchaser of the premises, appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">It is the claim of the appellant that the petition is insufficient in law to confer jurisdiction upon the surrogate to entertain the proceeding; that no authority exists to grant the amendment, and, if it did, the statute of limitations having run, the mortgagees\u2019 rights cannot be cut off. That the petition in the present case sets-out all of the facts showing the indebtedness of the decedent to the petitioner, as required by the. statute, is not disputed. This was sufficient to confer upon the surrogate jurisdiction to act. In re Bank, 39 Hun, 181; In re Bingham (Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 325. The-surrogate, having jurisdiction, had power to grant the amendment. The Code of Civil Procedure contemplates the bringing in of parties, after inquiry, by the surrogate, if it then appear that such, person or persons claim an interest in the property affected by the-proceeding, either as heirs or devisees, or who claim under or through them. Such person or persons, although not named in the-citation, may voluntarily intervene in. the proceeding and prove their debt or lien. Sections 2754, 2755. Authority abundantly supports this conclusion, and the fact that the statute of limitations-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>has run against instituting the proceeding is no bar to granting such an amendment. In re Bingham, 127 N. Y. 296, 27 N. E. 1055. Where jurisdiction of the particular proceeding exists, the authority to amend exists, and such rule is applicable to special proceedings. People v. Board of Assessors, 10 App. Div. 393, 41 N. Y. Supp. 769. The order granting the amendment was proper. It should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Order of surrogate\u2019s court of Kings county affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
