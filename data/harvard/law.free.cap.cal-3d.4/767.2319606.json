In filling out forms for applications for educational or occupational opportunities such a juvenile need not state that he has been \u201carrested\u201d or \u201cdetained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Petitioners ask for a more sweeping holding: they ask that the records themselves be immediately sealed and expurgated; they would accomplish this end by holding unconstitutional Welfare and Institutions Code section 781, which establishes a five-year waiting period for such sealing and specifies procedures to obtain it. Petitioners contend that the section denies the equal protection of the law and due process. We believe, however, as we shall explain, that such a charge does not stand and that the retention of the records of even the innocent juvenile serves certain salutary purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">To protect the juvenile who has been temporarily held and released we need not hold Welfare and Institutions Code section 781 unconstitutional; we need only invoke the provisions and policy of the existing law. Both the underlying policy of the Juvenile Court Law which enfolds its procedures within the cloak of confidentiality, and the careful exclusion of the language of arrest as to such an innocent juvenile from the sanctions of that law, support the conclusion that he need not state that he has been arrested or detained. Nor does that law permit the authorities to release to third persons any such information as to arrest or detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">1. <em>The facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">At about 9:45 a.m. on April 15, 1970, three youths were distributing anti-war leaflets outside Balboa High School in San Francisco. Two of the youngsters, petitioners in the present proceeding, were then and are now 15 and 16 years old. The third youth was 18 years of age. Two San Francisco police officers in civilian dress, viewing the three engaging in these activities, took them into custody for allegedly loitering near a school in violation of Penal Code section 653g.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The officers transported the three juveniles to the Ingleside police station where they were held for about two and one half hours. At about 11:20 a.m. the police officers completed a standard \u201cIncident Report\u201d describing the conduct of the youths and the circumstances of their detention. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>18-year-old youth was taken to the local jail facility and later released. The two petitioners were sent to the San Francisco Youth Guidance Center. At about 2 p.m. a juvenile probation officer considered the \u201cIncident Report\u201d and determined to release petitioners from custody. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 628.) Later that afternoon, the parents came to the center and took the children home.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The juvenile .probation department filed no petition for wardship or any other formal charges against the two petitioners. Neither youth was ever taken before the juvenile court or placed on formal or informal probation. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 654.) Neither petitioner has ever been detained, arrested, charged with any criminal conduct, or appeared before any court on any charges, but for the incident of April 15th.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On June 26, 1970, the two petitioners sought an order from the San Francisco Juvenile Court sealing their detention records pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 781.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 1, 1970, Judge Francis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>W. Mayer held a hearing on the petition for sealing, at which the petitioners, their attorney, one of their parents, and a representative of the Juvenile Probation Department appeared. After hearing testimony of the petitioners and argument of counsel, the trial court denied the petition for sealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Although the trial court did not prepare a written memorandum of decision, the transcript of the hearing reveals several reasons for the court\u2019s decision. Firstly, the trial court upheld the constitutionality of the five-year waiting period prescribed by section 781 before sealing may occur. The court observed, \u201cNow, I think there is a reason why the Legislature feels these records should not be sealed, and that is because on many occasions young persons come back before this court while they are still juveniles. And I think that in trying to eventually help these young men that these records should be made available to the Probation Officers and knowledgeable to the Court, so that if they come back that all of these matters can be considered in determining what is to the best interests of the minors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The court secondly questioned petitioners\u2019 contention that they would be subject to the stigma of an \u201carrest\u201d record or would be compelled to admit that they had been \u201carrested\u201d in applications for employment or college. The court pointed out that Welfare and Institutions Code section 625, under which the petitioners were temporarily detained, avoids the use of the term \u201carrest.\u201d Hence, they may properly deny that they had been \u201carrested\u201d and thus not suffer the consequences of an \u201carrest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On August 24, 1970, the San Francisco Municipal Court dismissed charges against the 18-year-old for allegedly violating Penal Code section 653g. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385) Two days later, pursuant to Penal Code section 851.7,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the 18-year-old youth filed an application to seal the record of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Since section 851.7 contains no waiting period for sealing misdemeanor arrest records of youths who are under 21 years old and whose charges in criminal proceedings are dismissed, the San Francisco Municipal Court ordered that all official records of his arrest be sealed on September 3, 1970. In this mandate proceeding we consider whether the record of petitioners\u2019 detention should also be sealed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">2.  <em>The Juvenile Court Law protects a juvenile who has been detained but who has never been the subject of wardship proceedings from the disclosure of his \u201carrest\u201d or \u201cdetention\u201d record to employers or other third parties and from the grave consequences of such a \u201cjuvenile record.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In the present proceedings petitioners seek an order of the court sealing the records of their short, and apparently unwarranted detentions. Primarily they hope to relieve themselves of the obligation of disclosing this \u201cdetention\u201d or \u201carrest\u201d in applications for college, employment, military service, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>business licenses, insurance, and other applications that line the threshold of future opportunities. We believe, however, that sealing is unnecessary to achieve the practical relief they seek and that such relief may rest upon the provisions, and legislative policy of confidentiality, of the Juvenile Court Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The purpose of the Juvenile Court Law has long been \u201cto secure for each minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court such care and guidance, preferably in his own home, as will serve the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the minor and the best interests of the State. . . .\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 502.)  The process of the juvenile court involves determination of the needs of the child and society, provision for guidance and treatment for the juvenile, and protection of the child from punishment and stigma.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">In recent years the courts, while preserving the beneficial aspects of the juvenile process, have held that certain procedural protections must be observed in order to guarantee the fundamental fairness of juvenile proceedings. <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 365-367, 372-374 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375-376, 380-384, 90 S.Ct. 1068]; <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 12-14, 74 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 537-539, 572, 87 S.Ct. 1428]; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541, 554-556 [16 L.Ed.2d 84, 93-94, 86 S.Ct. 1045]; <em>Joe Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 797, 801-802 [91 Cal.Rptr. 594, 478 P.2d 26]; <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 25-26 &amp; fn. 17 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737].) <em>Gault, Winship </em>and the other decisions which insure such procedural fairness in juvenile proceedings do not, however, suggest a surrender of the salutary protections of the juvenile court system.  As we observed in <em>In re Dennis M., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 444, 456, \u201ceven after <em>Gault\u201d </em>juvenile court proceedings \u201cretain a <em>sui generis </em>character\u201d and are \u201cconducted for the protection and benefit of the youth in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In order to protect the juvenile from the stigma of criminality often attached to adult penal proceedings, the Legislature has carefully avoided the use of the term \u201carrest\" for the type of detention to which the petitioners were subjected in the present case. Welfare and Institutions Code section 625 provides that juveniles are not subject to \u201carrest,\u201d but may only be taken into \u201ctemporary custody.\u201d The basic procedures of the juvenile court, as set forth in sections 600 through 660 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, similarly avoid the term \u201carrest.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 503 declares that juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>wardship \u201cshall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose, nor shall a proceeding in the juvenile court be deemed a criminal proceeding.\u201d Although the courts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the Legislature<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> have not been completely consistent in their terminology, the legislative purpose and intent to spare juveniles from the untoward and unjustified consequences of an \u201carrest\u201d record appears clear.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 365-367 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375-377]; <em>In re Colar </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 613, 617 [88 Cal.Rptr. 651].)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Furthermore, several sections explicitly reflect a legislative judgment that rehabilitation through the process of the juvenile court is best served by the preservation of a confidential atmosphere in all of its activities. Section 827 carefully prohibits the inspection of any \u201cpetition filed in any juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>court proceeding, reports of the probation officer, and all other documents filed in any such case\u201d by anyone other than court personnel, the juvenile, his parents, and his attorney, except with the express approval of the juvenile court judge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 676 provides that juvenile court proceedings are not open to the public. And section 781 insures that a juvenile may obtain an order, five years after his detention or when he becomes 21, which seals his juvenile court record even from inspection by juvenile court personnel and which requires the destruction of all records pertaining to the case in the custody of \u201cany other agencies, including law enforcement agencies, and public officials as petitioner alleges, in his petition, to have custody of such records.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>These factors justify the conclusion that the Juvenile Court Law and particularly Welfare and Institutions Code sections 625, 676, 781, and 827 establish the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings and vest the juvenile court with exclusive authority to determine the extent to which juvenile records may be released to third parties. The juvenile court must be in a position to effect the appropriate treatment for each individual juvenile. (See <em>Jimmy H. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 709, 714-715; <em>In re William. M., supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 16, 30; <em>In re Dennis M., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 444, 455-456.) Obviously, if prospective employers and sometimes third parties may obtain information as to juvenile records without the permission of the juvenile court and may use these records to deny opportunities to young persons,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the rehabilitative efforts of the juvenile court will often be thwarted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">At present this legislative policy of confidentiality suffers erosion, in practical terms, by the omnipresent inquiry \u201cHave you ever been arrested?\u201d This question appears on practically every application for employment, college admission, business license or other undertaking open to young persons.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed some employers often require a prospective employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>to permit actual inspection of his juvenile court files so that the employer may make his own check of the juvenile\u2019s history. (See <em>In re Smith </em>(Family Ct. 1970) 310 N.Y.S.2d 617, 619.) More often, however, employers and others will simply reject an application from anyone who admits to the fact that he has been the subject of juvenile court proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">We recognize that the exposure of innocent juveniles who have thus been \u201cdetained\u201d but never brought before a juvenile court, does find some support in an Attorney General\u2019s opinion which interprets the pertinent statutory provisions to require the juvenile to answer these inquiries as to prior arrests in the affirmative. (43 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 288 (1964).)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the present proceeding, however, the Attorney General has changed his position and concluded \u201cthat any minor under the age of 18 years old who is taken into custody by a peace officer for a violation of a criminal law has not been \u2018arrested.\u2019 This would be true whether the minor is later released by the police, with or without being \u2018booked\u2019 at the police station, whether he is referred to the Juvenile Court, or whether he is ultimately declared a ward of the Juvenile Court. In the present case, therefore, it would be inaccurate to declare that petitioners were \u2018arrested\u2019 or that they have an \u2018arrest record.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We concur in the Attorney General\u2019s present position in so far as it recognizes that a youth who has been thus subjected to juvenile court proceedings may deny that he has been arrested. By using the terms \u201ctemporary custody\u201d and \u201cdetention\u201d rather than \u201carrest\u201d the Legislature obviously sought to insulate the juvenile from the consequences of an \u201carrest record.\u201d The word \u201cdetained,\u201d however, has come to involve only slightly less stigma than the term \u201carrest\u201d as applied to adults. (See <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. 1, 23-24 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 544]; <em>In re Contreras </em>(1952) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>109 Cal.App.2d 787, 789-790 [241 P.2d 631].) A juvenile who states that he has been either detained or arrested will be subjected to economic and other sanctions. (See Gough, <em>The Expungement of Adjudication Records of Juvenile and Adult Offenders: A Problem of Status, </em>1966 Wash. U. L.Q. 147, 170.) Thus, in order to effectuate the legislative policy of confidentiality and the juvenile court\u2019s purpose of protective rehabilitation, we believe Welfare and Institutions Code sections 676, 781, and 827 should be interpreted to permit the juvenile, who has been temporarily detained by the authorities and subsequently released without further proceedings, not only to deny that he has been arrested, but, also, to deny that he has been detained or otherwise subjected to juvenile court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Similarly, the juvenile court need not disclose that any juvenile has been detained when he has never been brought before the court. The San Francisco Juvenile Court responds to inquiries from third parties as to youths who have not been found wards of the court by stating that they were \u201cnever officially known to the San Francisco Juvenile Court.\u201d Furthermore, the police and probation departments of San Francisco do not reveal detention records to third parties without court order. Welfare and Institutions Code section 827 reposes in the juvenile court control of juvenile records and requires the permission of the court before any information about juveniles is disclosed to third parties by any law enforcement official.  The police department of initial contact may clearly retain the information that it obtains from the youths\u2019 detention, but it must receive the permission of the juvenile court pursuant to section 827 in order to release that information to any third party, including state agencies.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>records in this regard become equivalents to court records and remain within the control of the juvenile court. (See Winslow, <em>In the Matter of Juvenile Court Proceedings </em>(1967) 14 Crime &amp; Delinquency 261, 262-267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Since the entire Juvenile Court Law places the responsibility of providing care and protective guidance for youths upon the juvenile court, section 827 provides the means for assuring to the juvenile court the authority to fulfill that responsibility without interference by third parties. In determining what information should be released, the juvenile court is in a position to determine whether disclosure would be in the best interests of the youth. The presumption of innocence, the legislative policy of confidentiality encompassing juvenile proceedings, and the hazard that the information will be misused by third parties fully justify the juvenile court\u2019s refusal to disclose information about juvenile detentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We cannot accept the contention that the juvenile court\u2019s policy of confidentiality fails to warn the community about possibly dangerous youths<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and permits the juvenile to \u201clie\u201d about his contacts with the juvenile court. The Legislature has made these policy decisions in section 827 in favor of confidentiality. Furthermore, we believe the relevant policy considerations certainly support that legislative determination. A young person who has been detained but has never been the subject of a petition for wardship certainly cannot be presumed a danger to society. If a particular youth does present a danger to the community or himself, the juvenile court possesses adequate means for dealing, with the problem. (Cf. <em>In re Gladys R., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 855, 865-867; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 782, 795-797 [73 Cal.Rptr. 240, 447 P.2d 352].)  If a youth has been merely detained without being declared a ward of the court, however, we must presume that he is innocent and does <em>not </em>present a danger to society. The risk that third parties will misuse information about juvenile detention far outweighs any speculative benefit to third parties. Finally, the juvenile\u2019s negative response to inquiries about detentions or arrests is tantamount to saying that this information is confidential and must be obtained, if at all, from the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Thus, the Juvenile Court Law affords much of the protection against abuse of detention records by an employer or other third parties which petitioners seek by the sealing of their records pursuant to section 781. As we have stated at the outset, however, petitioners contend that section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>781 violates the equal protection and due process clauses because it does not provide for immediate sealing of detention records. We turn to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">3.  <em>The five-year waiting period of Welfare and Institutions Code section 781 does not violate the equal protection or due process clause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code s\u00e9ction 781 provides that a juvenile record \u2014including information as to arrest, detention, and wardship\u2014may be sealed when the juvenile reaches his majority or upon the expiration of five years from the date on which the jurisdiction of the juvenile court terminates. In the present case no petition for wardship was ever filed so that the jurisdiction of the juvenile court terminated on the day the petitioners were released by the probation officer. Since one youth was 15 years old at the time of his detention, he will be required to wait five years, until April 15, 1975, to obtain an order sealing his record. The 16-year-old youth will reach his 21st birthday in 1974 and will then be able to petition for the sealing of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Section 851.7 of the Penal Code provides that any minor who has been arrested for a misdemeanor, treated as an adult, but not convicted of the offense, may at any time petition the court to order that the record in the case be sealed. Since Penal Code section 851.7, which permits immediate sealing, does not apply to \u201cany person taken into custody pursuant to section 625 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, or to any case within the scope of Section 781\u201d of such code, petitioners cannot obtain any relief under it. Nevertheless, the 18-year-old, who was arrested at the same time as petitioners, but who was not referred to juvenile court, has successfully petitioned for an order sealing the record of his case pursuant to section 851.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Petitioners contend that the only difference between the older youth and themselves rests simply upon age, and that, at least, if no adjudication occurs, a distinction based solely upon this chronological factor constitutes an arbitrary and invidious discrimination. Petitioners particularly argue that the difference between immediate sealing for minors under section 851.7 and the lengthy waiting period for sealing under section 781 violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioners point out that the five-year waiting period occurs at precisely the time at which most juveniles first apply for jobs or attempt to obtain entrance to higher educational institutions. Although all the commentators who have discussed the subject have praised California for its comprehensive sealing remedy, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>also unanimously criticize the five-year waiting period as far too long.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Section 781, however, does not frame a provision foreign to the Juvenile Court Law\u2019s design of protective rehabilitation of the juvenile and its necessary corollary of confidentiality.  \u201cEqual protection does not require that all persons be dealt with identically\u201d <em>(Baxstrom </em>v. <em>Herold </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 107, 111 [15 L.Ed.2d 620, 624, 86 S.Ct. 760]); it permits a state to \u201cprovide for differences so long as the result does not amount to a denial of due process or an \u2018invidious discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Douglas </em>v. <em>California </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 353, 356 [9 L.Ed.2d 811, 814, 83 S.Ct. 814].)  \u201cThe concept of the equal protection of the laws compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.\u201d <em>(Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 566, 578 [79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645]; see <em>In re Antazo </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 100, 110 [89 Cal.Rptr. 255, 473 P.2d 999].)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">A legitimate and substantial interest supports the policy of permitting juvenile court personnel to retain information about a juvenile\u2019s detention, even when such detention does not result in a wardship proceeding. In such a case the retention of the record of detention still rests upon a rehabilitative purpose. As the juvenile court in the instant matter pointed out, the detention record will assist the court\u2019s personnel in assessing any later conduct by the juvenile. A single incident may not reveal a pattern of behavior which would require action by the juvenile court. But the past record of the juvenile with the juvenile court may enable a probation officer to recognize a development which requires informal probation, a petition for wardship, or other appropriate treatment. (See <em>In re Dennis M., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 444, 456; <em>In re Donna G. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 890, 895 [86 Cal.Rptr. 421].)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Such rehabilitative need for retaining arrest records does not pertain to the case of a minor who has been dealt with as an adult in the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>courts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The adult criminal courts neither perform the special rehabilitative functions of the juvenile court nor provide the particular procedures for protective confidentiality of the juvenile court. Thus, the Legislature has reasonably provided to minors who are treated as adults in criminal courts the immediate sealing of any arrest record under Penal Code section 851.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Furthermore, we must reject petitioners\u2019 contention that the different provisions of the two sealing statutes\u2014sections 851.7 and 781\u2014turn solely on the question of age. The availability of the remedy depends upon whether the juvenile is treated as an adult or as a juvenile offender.  The juvenile court exercises exclusive jurisdiction with respect to all minors under the age of 16; it may not transfer such a case to an adult court. <em>(In re Gladys R., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 855, 862.)  If the minor is 16 or 17 years of age, the juvenile court still retains exclusive jurisdiction, but the case may under some circumstances be transferred to an adult court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 603, 707; see <em>Jimmy H. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal. 3d 709, 715.)  Adult and juvenile courts exercise concurrent original jurisdiction in the case of minors between the ages of 18 and 21. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 604, 707.) If a 16 year old is treated as an adult offender, the remedial provisions of Penal Code section 851.7 would be available if the charges do not culminate in a conviction. If an 18 year old is treated as a juvenile offender, the remedial provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 781 would apply.  Hence, the application of sections 851.7 and 781 does not devolve upon any invidious discrimination between youths of different ages. (See <em>In re S.A. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 241, 245-246 [85 Cal.Rptr. 775]; <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App. 3d 194, 200 [85 Cal.Rptr. 782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">To summarize, we believe that the Legislature in enacting the Juvenile Court Law clearly intended to safeguard juveniles from the adverse use of arrest and detention records.  We hold that the sections of the Juvenile Court Law, pursuant to its underlying policy of confidentiality, provide that a juvenile, who has been temporarily detained by the authorities and subsequently released without further proceedings, may deny having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>been arrested, detained, or otherwise subjected to juvenile court proceedings. To exorcise reference to arrest alone would not suffice if an equivalent word could be substituted. The prohibition must therefore cover any synonym of \u201carrest.\u201d  At the same time we hold that the records may be preserved for the use of juvenile court personnel for individualized guidance and rehabilitation of juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">No one could reasonably find a desirable social purpose in stigmatizing with the brand of an \u201carrest\u201d or a \u201cdetention\u201d the juvenile whom the authorities have taken into custody but released. To take the child into custody may itself cause him some emotional harm, but to expand that procedure into an \u201carrest\u201d or \u201cdetention\u201d must cause him a life-time disservice. No statute compels that result; certainly, the Juvenile Court Law does not.  As we have explained, that law abstains from the use of such terminology; indeed, the main reason for casting a protective cloak of confidentiality over the juvenile court proceedings is to prevent the exposure of the child to the ignominy that comes from such terms as \u201carrest\u201d or \u201cdetention.\u201d That the authorities take the child into custody should not produce the evil fruit of injury to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The alternative writ is discharged and the petition for writ of mandate is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Wright, C.

(See, e.g., <em>Jimmy H. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 709 [91 Cal.Rptr. 600, 478 P.2d 32]; <em>In re Ricky H. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 513 [86 Cal.Rptr. 76, 468 P.2d 204]; <em>In re Gladys R. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 855 [83 Cal.Rptr. 671, 464 P.2d 127]; <em>In re Dennis M. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 444 [75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296].) Attorneys have similarly not mentioned a minor\u2019s last name in briefs and petitions. We have largely avoided the word \u201cAnonymous\u201d in the title of opinions because of the confusion that would result from a series of \u201cAnonymous\u201d cases. Similarly, we have avoided the use of a juvenile\u2019s initials because of the possible confusion with the large number of agencies identified by their initials, e.g., C.Y.A., F.B.I., C.I.I., H.U.D., H.E.W., and O.P.D. In the present case, however, the peculiarly identifiable nature of the juvenile\u2019s first name requires that we depart from our preferred practice and use the juvenile\u2019s initials in the title of the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Penal Code section 653g provides, \u201cEvery person who loiters about any school or public place at or near which children attend or normally congregate is a vagrant, and is punishable by a fine of not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500) or by imprisonment in the county jail for not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d The Legislature in 1970 added, \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018loiter\u2019 means to delay, to linger, or to idle about any such school or public place without a lawful purpose for being present.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 781 provides, \u201c(a) In any case in which a petition has been filed with a juvenile court to commence proceedings to adjudge a person a dependent child or ward of the court, in any case in which a person is cited to appear before a probation officer or is. taken before a probation officer pursuant to Section 626, or in any case in which a minor is taken before any officer of a law enforcement agency, the person or the county probation officer may, five years or more after the jurisdiction of the juvenile court has terminated as to the person, or, in a case in which no petition is filed, five years or more after the person was cited to appear before a probation officer or was taken before a probation officer pursuant to Section 626 or was taken before any officer of a law enforcement agency, or, in any case, at any time .after the person has reached the age of 21 years, petition the court for sealing of the records, including records of arrest, relating to the person\u2019s case, in the custody of the juvenile court and probation officer and any other agencies, including law enforcement .agencies and public officials as petitioner alleges, in his petition, to have custody of such records.

Section 781 envisions that a sealed record may be opened for inspection upon the petition of the juvenile concerned, so we must conclude that the provision merely meant that records in the custody of the juvenile court may be closed to inspection. For .all other agencies, however, the provision clearly contemplated that records of the case be returned to the juvenile court for safekeeping or be destroyed in order to protect the juvenile from any risk of unauthorized disclosure. (See Comment (1967) 3 Cal. Western L.Rev. 121, 126.) Section 781 provides that the juvenile court shall send its sealing order to \u201ceach agency and official named\u201d in the petition for sealing, \u201cand each such .agency and official shall seal records in its custody <em>as directed by the order, </em>shall advise the court of its compliance, and thereupon shall seal the copy of the court\u2019s order for sealing of records that it or he received.\u201d (Italics added.) Hence, at the conclusion of the sealing process, no agency in this state, other than the juvenile court which ordered sealing, may retain any information which, might provide a link between .a particular juvenile and any contact with the juvenile \u2022 court. A California court, however, may not be able to compel the Federal Bureau of Investigation to destroy detention records it has received from California law enforcement authorities. (Note, (1966) 79 Harv. L.Rev. 775, 800-801.) Nevertheless, after a California court has issued a sealing order under section 781, the juvenile record loses .all force and effect, and the juvenile may file an action in federal court to have the record removed from FBI files.

Hence, 231,394 youths acquired \u201carrest\u201d or \u201cdetention\u201d records, .although no further proceedings were conducted in their cases.

In other words, almost a third of a million young persons.may be subject to the grave stigma of a \u201cjuvenile record\u201d without having been found responsible for any anti-social conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b810-5\">As the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice recognized, \u201cMuch is made of the confidentiality of juvenile court records to avoid stigmatizing the juvenile offender, but it is more often the CII and FBI arrest record that haunts him in later years.\u201d (Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice, Part 1\u2014Recommendations for Changes in California\u2019s Juvenile Court Law (1960) p. 47; see Reid, <em>The Presumption of Guilt </em>(Jan. 16, 1971), The New Republic, at pp. 15-16.) Although the Legislature did not adopt all the commission\u2019s statutory recommendations for this dissemination problem in Welfare and Institutions Code section 504, it did provide the juvenile court authority to control juvenile court records under section 827 so as to deal with the problem. For example, to protect a juvenile, who was detained but not placed on informal probation (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 654) or made the subject of any further proceedings, from acquiring an \u201carrest record\u201d with the CII and FBI and to preserve the juvenile court\u2019s power to protect the juvenile from the stigma of juvenile detention, section 827 authorizes the juvenile court to prevent the dissemination of such records of juvenile detention to the CII and FBI. Once a juvenile has been declared a ward of the court, however, the juvenile court may designate the CII and FBI as proper recipients under section 827 of relevant information about the minor. In short, without describing each factual situation in which dissemination would be appropriate or inappropriate, section 827 authorizes the juvenile court to establish procedures, by court rules or on a case-by-case basis, to regulate the dissemination of juvenile court records so as to protect the juvenile from potential abuse of detention records and to provide the needed care and guidance for juveniles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Baum, <em>Wiping Out a Criminal or Juvenile Record </em>(1965) 40 State Bar J. 816, 824; Kogon &amp; Loughery, <em>Sealing and Expungement of Criminal Records\u2014The Big Lie </em>(1970) 61 J.

In. 1967 the Legislature enacted, and the Governor signed, a provision which would have repealed the five-year waiting period for sealing and would have permitted the juvenile court to seal a minor\u2019s record when it determined that the juvenile had achieved rehabilitation, but the provision was chaptered-out and has not been re-enacted. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 9605; Boches, <em>Juvenile Justice in California: A Re-evaluation, </em>supra, 19 Hastings L.J. 47, 100.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201cThe mere fact that a man has been arrested has very little, if any, probative value in showing that he has engaged in any misconduct. [Footnote: Arrest, by itself, is not considered competent evidence at either a criminal or civil trial to prove that a person did certain prohibited acts. Cf. Wigmore, Evidence, section 980a.] An arrest shows nothing more than that someone probably suspected the person apprehended of an offense. When formal charges are not filed against the arrested person and he is released without trial, whatever probative force the arrest may have had is normally dissipated.\u201d <em>(Schware </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners </em>(1957) 353 U.S. 232, 241 [1 L.Ed.2d 796, 802, 77 S.Ct. 752] (reversing exclusion from practice of law because of three arrests without adjudication); see <em>Grudt </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 575, 590-593 [86 Cal.Rptr. 465, 468 P.2d 825] (arrest records inadmissible to show bias.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
