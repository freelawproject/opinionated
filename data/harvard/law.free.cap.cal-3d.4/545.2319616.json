Plaintiffs did not file a claim with the county within 100 days of the death, as required under Government Code sections 911.2 and 945.4; the superior court, however, granted their petition under Government Code section 946.6 for relief from the obligation of filing a claim.  We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ruling of the superior court does not constitute an act in excess of its jurisdiction and therefore cannot be reviewed by writ of prohibition. Since, however, the matter has been fully briefed and argued to this court, we treat the merits of the ruling, and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in relieving plaintiffs from the duty to file a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">When Konrad Deleersnyder suffered severe injury in an automobile accident on March 4, 1960, he was taken to the county hospital. There, according to plaintiffs, county employees negligently treated Konrad, injuring his spinal cord and causing permanent quadriplegia and other disorders. Upon denial of his claim against the county, Konrad filed suit for personal injuries. After extensive pretrial discovery, the action came to trial in February 1967. During the course of the trial, Konrad died. The death certificate indicates that chronic systemic conditions stemming from the 1960 spinal cord injury caused death.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On June 23, 1967, about 130 days after the death, plaintiffs filed a request with the county for leave to present a late claim. When the county denied the request plaintiffs petitioned the superior court for relief under Government Code section 912. Before the matter came to hearing, the Legislature replaced section 912 with section 946.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Section 946.6, subdivision (c), provides that \u201cthe court shall relieve the petitioner from the provisions of Section 945.4 [which bars claims not filed within 100 days] if the court finds the application [for leave to present a late claim] to the board under Section 911.4 was made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action . . . and that . . . the failure to present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect unless the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced if the court relieves the petitioner from the provisions of Section 945.4. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In support of their petition plaintiffs submitted a declaration of Daniel C. Cathcart, who was then serving as plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and who had previously acted as Konrad\u2019s attorney. It stated that \u201cno formal claim was filed with the County of Santa Clara by claimants until it could be determined that the claimants\u2019 decedent died of injuries proximately received at the defendant\u2019s hand and further determined whether or not the claimants wished to pursue their claim and cause of action. . . .\u201d In opposition to the motion Charles Brock, attorney for the county, declared that on March 23, 1967, Mr. Cathcart sent him a letter which stated that \u201cthere undoubtedly would be a medical correlation between the quadriplegia and the boy\u2019s untimely death,\u201d that the death certificate was filed on February 20, 1967, and that . Mr. Cathcart procured a copy of the certificate on April 21, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>At the conclusion of oral argument before the trial court, Mr. Cathcart stated: \u201cIt is not in my declaration but if I might amend it or I will be so happy to testify, the mother of this young boy nursed this young man five days plus being with him day and night. When he died her fife changed. You can imagine the emotional trauma involved and litigation was hardly \u2014I don\u2019t believe I represented to Mr. Brock the action might be abandoned. When my client died in the middle of the trial I was emotionally involved, also.\u201d The judge replied, \u201cYes, the matter is submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The superior court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion, stating that \u201chere the lateness is less than 30 days, no prejudice is involved and the Court feels that the neglect was reasonably incurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">1. <em>The order of the superior court was not in excess of its jurisdiction and cannot be reviewed on a writ of prohibition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The leading case of <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715], pronounced the rule that prohibition may be invoked only to restrain an act in excess of jurisdiction. One year later this court, in <em>Redlands etc. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 348 [125 P.2d 490], faced the problem of applying that decision to a case involving noncompliance with a claims requirement. There, the plaintiff brought a personal injury action in a justice court against the school district, but failed to file the claim that was then required under section 2.801 of the School Code. The justice court nevertheless gave judgment for plaintiff; the superior court, on trial de novo, affirmed. Since no appeal would lie, defendants brought certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Refusing to issue the requested writ, this court reasoned that: \u201cNot every violation of a statute constitutes, excess of jurisdiction on the part of a court. The doctrine relied upon by petitioners applies only where the clear purpose of the statute is to restrict or limit the power of the court to act and where the effective enforcement of such restrictions requires the use of the extraordinary writs of certiorari or prohibition. Where, as here, the statute does not restrict the power of the court but merely sets up a condition precedent to the esablishment of plainiff\u2019s cause of action, we think the violation of the statutory provision constitutes an error of law rather than excess of jurisdiction.\u201d (P. 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Decreeing in <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>County of Placer </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 624 [145 P.2d 570, 153 A.L.R. 323], that a county could be estopped from asserting a claims limitation, -we stated that compliance with such a statute does not involve jurisdiction. The county argued that \u201cthe claim statute is the measure of the power of the governmental agency in paying the torts claims involved, and hence any deviation from that procedure cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>dispensed with by waiver, estoppel or otherwise.\u201d (P. 630.) We replied: \u201cthat conclusion, at least with respect to the time of filing the claim, is not supported by the statute or reason. . . . This court has held that compliance with the claim statute is not jurisdictional with respect to the power of a court to give judgment against the governmental agency where no claim was filed. <em>(Redlands etc. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>20 Cal.2d 348 [125 P.2d 490]).\u201d (Pp. 630-631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Prior to <em>Redlands, </em>the decision in <em>Bekins V. &amp; S. Co. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1933) 135 Cal.App. 738 [28 P.2d 61], had held that a court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain an action for tax refund until the claimant presented his claim to the state board of control. In 1961 the court in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>198 Cal.App.2d 332, 335-336 [18 Cal.Rptr. 302], passing upon a claim against the state, held that compliance with claims requirements did not involve jurisdiction. Quoting Witkin (1 Cal. Procedure (1954) p. 322), the court noted that \u201cit would seem that <em>[Redlands] </em>overrules the <em>Bekins </em>case by implication, for no relevant distinction can be drawn between a suit against the state <em>(Bekins) </em>and against a school district <em>(Redlands).\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Thus, as of 1963, court decisions had clearly settled that a court which erroneously entertained an action against a governmental entity, despite noncompliance with claims requirements, committed only an error of law; it did not act in excess of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the statutes respecting claims and actions against public entities were extensively revised in 1963, nothing in the language of the 1963 legislation, nor of the Law Revision Commission study and recommendations which preceded it, suggests any intention to alter this rule. The only case discussing the issue under the new act, <em>Boyer </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 111 [45 Cal.Rptr. 58], relies on <em>Redlands </em>to arrive at the conclusion that filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of a bond for costs, as required by Government Code section 947, is not jurisdictional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Appellate review on writ of prohibition both delays trial and increases litigation expense (cf. <em>Oceanside Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 180, 185 fn. 4 [23 Cal.Rptr. 375, 373 P.2d 439]); yet, in view of the discretion given the trial judge and the principles of review outlined subsequently in this opinion, only in rare cases could an appellate court reverse a trial court order granting relief under section 946.6. Consequently, little benefit could accrue from opening this additional path of review of orders granting relief. The instant case represents neither a dramatic nor an extreme instance of failure to comply with statutory command; such cases may never arise;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the superior court here ruled on a contested matter committed to its discretion and within its subject-matter jurisdiction. Under the authority of <em>Redlands etc. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 348, we cannot categorize the ruling of the trial court as beyond its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">2. <em>The superior court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs\u2019 petition for relief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Although we have held in this opinion that a writ of prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>may not be appropriate to review that order, the merits of the superior court order have been thoroughly briefed and argued both before this court and the Court of Appeal. We believe that we should now adjudicate the merits, since a refusal to do so would leave the parties and the trial court without guidance and would serve no purpose but delay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The cases have held that the trial court exercises broad discretion in granting or denying petitions for relief under Government Code section 946.6;<footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an appellate court will be more rigorous in examining the denial of such relief than its allowance. \u201cIt has often been said that denials of such relief by the trial court are scanned more carefully than cases where the court granted the relief, to the end that wherever possible cases may be heard on their merits, and any doubts which may exist should be resolved in favor of the application.\u201d <em>(Viles </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 24, 29 [56 Cal.Rptr. 666, 423 P.2d 818].) Appellate courts will not interfere with the decision of the trial judge in relieving a party of default except for clear abuse of discretion <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 76, 79 [70 Cal.Rptr. 908].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In granting relief under section 946.6, which calls for a showing that the failure to present a timely claim resulted from \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect,\u201d the trial court here must necessarily have rested its ruling upon inadvertence and excusable neglect. Plaintiffs\u2019 original declaration asserted that they delayed filing a claim \u201cuntil it could be determined that the claimants\u2019 decedent died of injuries proximately received at the defendant\u2019s hand. . . .\u201d This assertion explains plaintiffs\u2019 delay from the date of Konrad\u2019s death until April 21, 1967, when plaintiffs first saw the death certificate and discovered the cause of death. Although their declaration presented no sufficient explanation of their further delay of some two months, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the superior court hearing offered to amend his declaration to show that plaintiffs\u2019 further delay resulted from the emotional trauma caused by Konrad\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In response to plaintiffs\u2019 offer to amend, the superior court replied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u201cyes, the matter is submitted.\u201d It has been urged that the court, by this language, impliedly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 offer, but we cannot so easily transform \u201cyes\u201d into \u201cno.\u201d To the contrary, as we shall explain, we may presume that the court, in giving an affirmative reply, permitted, and based its ruling in part upon, the oral amendment. \u201cIt is well settled that all presumptions and intendments are in favor of supporting the judgment or order. . . .\u201d <em>(Walling </em>v. <em>Kimball </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 364, 373 [110 P.2d 58].)  Consequently, applying the principle that \u201cwherever possible cases [should] be heard on their merits, and any doubts which may exist should be resolved in favor of the application [for relief]\u201d <em>(Viles </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 24, 29 [56 Cal.Rptr. 666, 423 P.2d 818]), we must presume that the superior court approved plaintiffs\u2019 offer to amend.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We likewise invoke the presumption that the superior court acted regularly (see, e.g., <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Baker &amp; Baker Roofing Co. </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d <em>765, 774 </em>[280 P.2d 39]); thus, we must presume that the court did not ignore plaintiffs\u2019 offer to amend, but ruled on that matter before taking the petition for relief under submission.  Finally, we observe that it is defendant here who questions the ruling of the trial court and thus assumes the burden of showing error; the presentation of a record which, although uncertain or ambiguous, does not demonstrate error does not meet that burden. (See <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Rose </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 327, 329 [32 Cal.Rptr. 919].)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We conclude, then, that the superior court accepted plaintiffs\u2019 offer to amend, and that their emotional trauma is part of the record on which the court based its order. Although the court did not require plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to file his amendment in written form and to detail the facts of the trauma, the superior court had observed Konrad and his parents during the trial of Konrad\u2019s suit, and did not require a detailed declaration to recall the emotional impact of Konrad\u2019s death in the midst of that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The argument has been raised that the plaintiffs\u2019 excuse for late filing pertains to subjective medical matters and must be supported by actual testimony.  Government Code section 946.6, subdivision (e), makes clear that when no testimonial evidence is offered, the court may decide whether to grant relief on the basis of the petition and declarations offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in support of, or opposition to, the petition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n                   Actual testimony is sometimes preferable to declarations, and direct declarations preferable to hearsay, but any preference for one mode or another of presenting evidence does not oust the superior court of its statutory discretion to determine whether or not to grant relief on the basis of the petitions and declarations before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The argument proceeds that regardless of plaintiffs\u2019 emotional condition, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney could have filed the wrongful death claim. The attorney, however, should not so act without the authorization of his clients.  The record speaks of delay until plaintiffs decided whether to pursue their claim, an indecision caused by their emotional trauma; it does not speak of any delay by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney once his clients had resolved to prosecute their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"A3k\">The total delay incurred by plaintiffs was only about 30 days, less than that encountered in most reported decisions denying relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs offered a reasonable and credible explanation of that delay. Defendant claims no prejudice. The superior court found that plaintiffs filed their claim within a reasonable time after accrual of the cause of action, and defendant does not challenge that finding. Under these circumstances, we cannot find that the superior court abused its discretion in granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The alternative writ of prohibition is discharged and the petition for a peremptory writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Mosk, Acting C. J., McComb, J., Peters, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In addition to the cases cited in the text, see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 255, 262-263 [4 Cal.Rptr. 209] (court did not exceed jurisdiction in proceeding with suit against city before city had rejected claim, citing <em>Redlands); Cruise </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1951) 101 Cal.App.2d 558, 562-564 [225 P.2d 988] (city may be estopped to assert claim limitation, since compliance with claims provisions is not jurisdictional, citing Farrell); cf. <em>Holden </em>v. <em>California Emp. etc. Com. </em>(1950) 101 Cal.App.2d 427, 435 [225 P.2d 634] (time limit for appeal from ruling of California Employment Commission is not jurisdictional, citing <em>Redlands); </em>see also Van Alstyne, California Government Tort Liability (1964) page 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The analogy between section 946.6 and Code of Civil Procedure section 473 has been noted in many cases (e.g., <em>Viles </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 24, 29 [56 Cal.Rptr. 666, 423 P.2d 818]; <em>Nilsson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 249 Cal. App.2d 976, 979 [58 Cal.Rptr. 20]); we observe that an order relieving a petitioner from a default judgment under section 473 on grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, even if erroneous, is not in excess of jurisdiction and cannot be reviewed on extraordinary writ. <em>(Moran </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1939) 35 Cal. App.2d 629, 632 [96 P.2d 193].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Former Government Code section 912 provided that a claimant must petition the superior court for leave to file a late claim within 20 days after his application for such leave is denied by the public entity. In <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>City of Holtville </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 595 [60 Cal.Rptr. 635], and <em>Dominquez </em>v. <em>County of Butte </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 164 [50 Cal.Rptr. 448], plaintiffs failed to file their petitions within the 20-day period. The Courts of Appeal affirmed superior court orders denying the petitions, stating that the 20-day limitation is \u201cmandatory and hence jurisdictional.\u201d <em>(Harvey </em>v. <em>City of Holtville, supra, </em>252 Cal.App.2d 595, 597; <em>Dominquez </em>v. <em>County of Butte, supra, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 164, 167.) Neither case involved a writ of prohibition; the issue in both was whether the superior courts should have considered plaintiffs\u2019 excuses for noncompliance with the 20-day limit, and the jurisdictional language of the opinions was directed to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The Courts of Appeal may have erred in reasoning that the limitation, because mandatory, was necessarily jurisdictional. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954) pp. 387-388.) A statute of limitations, for example, is mandatory in the sense that the court may not excuse a late complaint on grounds of mistake, neglect, or the like; it is not \u201cjurisdictional\u201d (see 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>pp. 322-323) and, if raised by demurrer, an erroneous overruling of the demurrer cannot normally be attacked by writ of prohibition <em>(Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841, 851 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379]; cf. <em>Tide Water Assoc. Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 43 Cal.2d 815, 827 [279 P.2d 35]).

Although a claimant may establish excusable neglect under Government Code section 946.6 by showing that his emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>condition made it impossible for him to act with reasonable diligence, there is no evidence whatsoever in the record that plaintiffs actually suffered such a condition, or that it precluded them, from filing a timely claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The record shows that plaintiffs\u2019 son died on February 15, 1967, that both plaintiffs and their attorney had actual knowledge of the facts underlying their claim no later than April 21, but that they delayed until June 23, before attempting to file that claim. (The 100-day statutory period expired in May 1967.) The majority point out that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, at the close of the hearing below, offered to amend <em>his </em>declaration to state that plaintiffs\u2019 delay resulted from \u201cemotional trauma\u201d resulting from their son\u2019s death. That bare offer of proof, which was impliedly rejected by the court, did not constitute evidence sufficient to support a finding of excusable neglect. Moreover, even had the offer been accepted, the declaration of an attorney attesting to the emotional trauma of his clients, and thus pertaining to highly subjective medical matters requiring actual testimony (either by experts or by plaintiffs themselves) to appraise, would have been of no evidentiary value. Finally, plaintiffs fail to explain why their own emotional difficulties prevented their attorney from acting with reasonable diligence on their behalf. That attorney had filed the previous claim for personal injuries to plaintiffs\u2019 son, was familiar with claims procedure, and had actual knowledge of the facts supporting the wrongful death claim. His lack of diligence cannot be explained or excused on the ground of emotional trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Since plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of proving excusable neglect, the fact that the county was not prejudiced by the late claim is immaterial. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 946.6, subd. (c); <em>Tammen </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, </em>66 Cal. 2d 468, 478 [58 Cal.Rptr. 249, 426 P.2d 753]; Van Alstyne, Cal. Government Tort Liability, Supp., \u00a7 8.30, p. 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Although, as the majority hold, prohibition does not ordinarily lie in these cases, the merits have been briefed and no purpose would be served in remanding the action to the trial court. Accordingly, I would grant the peremptory writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">On May 13, 1971, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
