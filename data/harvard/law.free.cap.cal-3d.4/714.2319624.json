Petitioner has been a state resident since September 1962, and a Santa Cruz resident since July 1, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Respondent contends that he does not have a duty to accept petitioner\u2019s nomination papers because petitioner has not complied with section 602 of the Santa Cruz City Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Section 602 in pertinent part provides: \u201cNo person shall be eligible to be ... a member of the Council unless he . . . shall have been for at least three (3) years preceding his election or appointment, a resident of the City of Santa Cruz. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">For reasons to be further elucidated in <em>Zeilenga </em>v. <em>Nelson, post, </em>p. 716 [94 Cal.Rptr. 602, 484 P.2d 578], we have concluded that the challenged Santa Cruz Charter provision violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Respondent City Clerk of the City of Santa Cruz is hereby directed, if petitioner complies with all other requirements for becoming a candidate for city councilman of the City of Santa Cruz on or before March 5, 1971, to place petitioner\u2019s name upon the ballot prepared for the municipal election of April 13, 1971. This order is final forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., and Burke, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
