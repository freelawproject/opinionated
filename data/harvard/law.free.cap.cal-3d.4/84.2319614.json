The trial court first denied the motion, but, after reconsideration, reversed its decision and set aside the indictment on the ground that the prosecution had failed to introduce any competent evidence of contemporary community standards by which the grand jury might be guided in determining whether there was probable cause to believe that defendants\u2019 books were obscene. The People appeal from the order setting aside the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">At the grand jury proceedings in June 1966 the prosecutor introduced copies of the four allegedly obscene books, \u201cSeed of the Beast,\u201d \u201cQueer Daddy,\u201d \u201cThe Experimenters,\u201d and \u201cJust for Kicks.\u201d He also introduced a fifth book, \u201cSex Life of a Cop,\u201d concerning which there had been established in other proceedings probable cause for the belief that it was obscene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The grand jury read and presumably compared the four allegedly obscene books with \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d to determine whether or not there was probable cause to believe the four books obscene. In introducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u201cSex Life of a Cop,\u201d the prosecution relied on our holding in <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 789, 798 [13 Cal.Rptr. 415, 362 P.2d 47], that there was probable cause to believe such book obscene. The lower federal courts held the book to be in fact obscene. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>West Coast News Company </em>(6th Cir. 1966) 357 F.2d 855, 857, 858.) However, after the instant indictment was filed but before the trial court ruled on defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the indictment, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d was not obscene. <em>(Aday </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 447 [18 L.Ed.2d 1309, 87 S.Ct. 2095].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">No evidence of contemporary community standards other than \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d was introduced before the grand jury. After reading all five books, and considering evidence of defendants\u2019 involvement in the publication and distribution of the four books charged as obscene, the grand jury returned the instant indictment. In setting the indictment aside, the trial court recognized that its ruling was in conflict with the holdings in <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 789, 798 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Aday </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 520, 531-532 [38 Cal.Rptr. 199], but was of the view that those cases had been overruled by more recent decisions. We conclude that those cases were correctly decided and have continued and undiminished vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 789, we reviewed the validity of a search warrant which authorized seizure of two named books alleged to be obscene, as well as a wide variety of other books, records and objects. Although we there determined that the warrant was in certain respects unconstitutionally broad, we concluded that it was not invalid as a whole and we upheld that part of it which authorized the seizure of the named books constituting the principal basis of the charge of obscenity. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 796-798.) The magistrate had read portions of the two named books before issuing the warrant, but had not received evidence as to contemporary community standards. We examined the books and held that there was probable cause to believe them obscene. After referring to the rule for determining obscene material announced in the <em>Roth </em>case <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304]), we said; \u201cIt should be emphasized that in applying these principles here we are concerned only with probable cause, not with the final determination as to the character of the named books or the guilt of petitioners. An examination of the two books convinces us there was probable cause for believing that they are obscene. Their text is such that an average person, applying contemporary community standards, could reasonably believe that their dominant theme appeals to a lascivious, shameful, and morbid interest in sex and that they are totally lacking in redeeming value, literary or otherwise. In view of their contents it was not necessary for [the magistrate] to . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>receive evidence as to contemporary community standards in order to determine the issue of probable cause.\u201d <em>(Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 798.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We went on to say: \u201cWhere, as here, the seizure occurs under a warrant, an ex parte determination of the issue of obscenity, so far as probable cause is concerned, has taken place before issuance of the warrant, and immediately after the seizure a determination of the issue to that extent can be obtained in adversary proceedings by controverting the warrant under sections 1539 and 1540 of the Penal Code. In the event the owner is unsuccessful in that proceeding, a final determination as to obscenity will be had in the criminal action which will ordinarly follow within a reasonable time, or other remedies such as mandamus will be available to secure return of the property.\u201d <em>(Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 799.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Our holding in <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>was followed three years later by the Court of Appeal in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aday, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.2d 520. In that case, as in the case at bench, the defendant challenged an indictment because no evidence of contemporary community standards had been submitted to the grand jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court there carefully set out both the standards and the procedures governing grand jury determination on the issue of whether there exists probable cause to believe material obscene: \u201c \u2018The standard for judging obscenity adequate to withstand the charge of constitutional infirmity is whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest.\u2019 <em>(In re Harris, </em>56 Cal.2d 879, 880 [16 Cal.Rptr. 889, 366 P.2d 305]; <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>354 U.S. 476, at p. 489 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 1509, 77 S.Ct. 1304]; <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 798.) Accordingly, it is a denial of due process for a trial court not to allow a defendant to prove contemporary community standards at his trial. <em>(In re Harris, supra, </em>at p. 880.) It is not necessary, however, that evidence of contemporary community standards be received on the issue of probable cause. (See <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at pp. 798-799.) A determination of obscenity may therefore be made by a grand jury, insofar as the issue of probable cause is concerned, without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>necessity of receiving evidence as to such standards.\u201d (226 Cal.App.2d at p. 531.) We denied a petition for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In the nine and a half years since our decision in <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>and the six and a half years since our denial of a hearing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aday, </em>we have not overruled, disapproved or in any way qualified the rules as to the determination of probable cause in obscenity cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   The <em>Aday </em>cases retain their full vitality as precedents on this question and we conclude, to use our former language, that it is \u201cnot necessary ... to . . . receive evidence as to contemporary community standards in order to determine the issue of probable cause.\u201d (55 Cal.2d at p. 798.) The failure to introduce evidence of contemporary community standards before the grand jury did not render the instant indictment defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Defendants contend, however, that even if an indictment is proper where no evidence of contemporary community standards is presented to the grand jury, the present indictment is invalid because \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d was introduced as an example of obscenity under contemporary community standards.  They argue that since the United States Supreme Court later held that \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d was <em>not </em>obscene <em>(Aday </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>388 U.S. 447), the grand jury in this case was permitted and advised to use an erroneous example of contemporary community standards in determining the obscenity of the challenged book. However, the grand jury did not determine that the challenged books were in fact obscene, but only that there was probable cause to believe them obscene. While the United States Supreme Court subsequently held that \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d is not, in fact, obscene, there is still, as we held in <em>Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 789, 798, probable cause to believe the book obscene. \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d might have been an erroneous example of contemporary community standards if the grand jury had heard testimony that the book <em>was obscene </em>by those standards. But in this case the grand jury was not misled because the testimony<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was only that the two <em>Aday </em>cases had held that there <em>was probable cause </em>to believe \u201cSex Life of a Cop\u201d to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>obscene. Such testimony was and remains perfectly accurate and proper. Under the circumstances, we cannot see how the reading of the fifth book dealt a fatal blow to the otherwise valid accusation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Finally, we reach defendants\u2019 contention that the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Stanleys. Georgia (1969) 394-U.S. </em>557 [22 L.Ed.2d 542, 89 S.Ct. 1243] requires a dismissal of the instant indictment. We summarize defendants\u2019 long and ingeniously concatenated argument: That <em>Stanley </em>held that the private possession of obscene matter cannot constitutionally be made a crime; that by its decision, the high court, \u201cmaking significant changes in its concept of \u2018obscenity\u2019,\u201d declared obscenity to be speech within the protection of the First Amendment; that no governmental regulation of speech within the First Amendment is valid unless there \u201cis a clear showing that the burden placed upon exercise of freedom of speech is justified by a compelling state interest\u201d which cannot be protected by means less burdensome to the exercise of First Amendment rights; that in <em>Stanley, </em>the court found only two compelling state interests which require regulation of obscenity\u2014the state concern for minors and the state interest in preventing intrusions upon the sensibilities or privacy of an unwilling audience; that since under the holding in <em>Stanley </em>a person has a constitutional right to <em>possess </em>obscene material, it follows that any governmental limitation upon the <em>sale </em>or <em>distribution </em>of such material also contravenes First Amendment rights; and that accordingly, individuals \u201chave the right to publish, prepare, print and sell such, material without governmental intervention, except in cases where the material is intended for minors or is distributed in such a manner as to intrude upon the sensibilities or privacy of the general public unwilling to be exposed to such material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Applying this interpretation to the case at bench, defendants urge that (a) since the indictment does not charge defendants with, and (b) the grand jury transcript is barren of any evidence establishing probable cause to believe that defendants participated in, distributing obscene material to minors or to unwilling persons in such a manner as to intrude upon their privacy or sensibilities,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the indictment must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>We believe that defendants\u2019 analysis of the <em>Stanley </em>rationale is incorrect, and that their contention based upon such analysis is without merit. In <em>Stanley, </em>officers investigating the defendant\u2019s bookmaking activities, obtained a search warrant for his home and entered pursuant thereto. They found little evidence of bookmaking but while looking through a desk in an upstair\u2019s bedroom found and seized reels of obscene films. The defendant was charged with and convicted of \u201cknowingly having possession of . . . obscene matter\u201d in violation of a Georgia statute. The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed but the Supreme Court of the United States reversed holding that \u201cthe mere private possession of obscene matter cannot constitutionally be made a crime.\u201d (394 U.S. at p. 559 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 546].) Such a state statute, the court held, constituted a drastic invasion of a person\u2019s right to receive information and his fundamental right to be free from \u201cunwanted governmental intrusions into one\u2019s privacy.\u201d (394 U.S. at p. 564 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 549].) It found no valid state interest<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in prohibiting the private possession of obscenity and therefore held the statute unconstitutional as an unwarranted intrusion on First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">At each step in its reasoning, however, the high court in <em>Stanley </em>was careful to distinguish the problem of <em>commercial distribution </em>of obscenity, involved in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>354 U.S. 476, and in the instant case, from the problem of <em>private possession </em>of obscene material, involved in <em>Stanley. </em>The court recognized that <em>Roth </em>and the cases which followed it had found state interests in dealing with the problem of obscenity sufficient to justify regulation of commercial distribution of obscene matter. The court concluded that no such state interest justified the state regulation of private possession of obscenity, but it distinguished <em>Roth </em>because \u201cthat case dealt with public distribution of obscene materials and such distribution is subject to different objections.\u201d (394 U. S. at p. 567 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 550].)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">As. <em>Stanley </em>recognized, a court, in deciding the constitutionality of a state regulation of obscenity must balance the state interests advanced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>such regulation against the constitutional rights affected by it. No legitimate state interest justified the drastic invasion of constitutional rights incident to regulation of private possession of obscenity; therefore, such regulation is unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court noted that public distribution of obscenity presents different dangers and is subject to different objections which support state regulation of such distribution. The essence of the court\u2019s reasoning is found in the following language of the opinion: \u201cWhatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity, we do not think they reach into the privacy of one\u2019s own home. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men\u2019s minds.\u201d <em>(Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>394 U.S. at p. 565 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 549].) \u201cWhatever the power of the state to control public dissemination of ideas inimical to the public morality, it cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person\u2019s private thoughts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 566 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 550].)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Finally, as if to leave no doubt as to the extent of its holding, the high court concluded: \u201cWe hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession of obscene material a crime. (Fn. omitted.] <em>Roth </em>and the cases following that decision are not impaired by today\u2019s holding. As we have said, the States retain broad power to regulate obscenity; that power simply does not extend to mere possession by the individual in the privacy of his own home.\u201d (394 U.S. at p. 568 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 551].)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We also find meritless defendants\u2019 argument that the holding in <em>Stanley </em>necessitates the conclusion that a state may not constitutionally regulate commercial distribution of obscene material because such regulation makes more difficult the full exercise of the right to possess obscenity privately.  The rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments are not \u201cabsolutes\u201d in the sense that where the constitutional protection exists it must prevail. <em>(Konigsberg </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1960) 366 U.S. 36, 49 [6 L.Ed.2d 105, 115, 81 S.Ct. 997]; <em>Breard </em>v. <em>City of Alexandria </em>(1951) 341 U.S. 622, 642 [95 L.Ed. 1233, 1248, 71 S.Ct. 920].)  As was said in <em>Breard: </em>\u201cFreedom of speech or press does not mean that one can talk or distribute where, when and how one chooses. Rights other than those of the advocates are involved. By adjustment of rights, we can have both full liberty of expression and an orderly life.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em> As we have discussed above, in the context of public distribution of obscenity, the balance of interests upholds the constitutionality of state regulation, even though that regulation imposes some burdens upon the exercise of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Therefore, we find that <em>Stanley, </em>as the United States Supreme court expressly stated, does not impair <em>Roth </em>and the cases following it. States retain broad power to regulate obscenity and regulation of the public distribution of obscenity falls well within the broad scope of that power.  <em>Stanley </em>does not require that an indictment charging public distribution of obscenity also charge that the obscene matter was distributed to a child or unwilling audiences. We conclude that <em>Stanley </em>has no application to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The order setting aside the indictment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Wright, C.

I therefore find it unnecessary to reach the issue of whether affirmative evidence of contemporary community standards must be presented at grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">It is no novel revelation that the passage of years since the United States Supreme Court first attempted a constitutional definition of obscenity in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304], has not produced a coalescence of judicial opinion but instead a multiplicity of standards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Throughout this period, courts have struggled to find' an accommodation between the constitutionally protected interest in free speech and the legitimate public interest in controlling activities which fall under the broad category of obscenity.

In <em>Stanley, </em>Justice Marshall, writing for a majority of five justices,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> declared unconstitutional a state statute which made the possession of obscene material a crime, concluding that the defendant had a First Amendment right to possess and read or view in the privacy of his home all communicative materials \u201cregardless of their social worth.\u201d Analysis of the rationale underlying this decision convinces me that our state and federal Constitutions compel a reexamination of the permissible scope of Penal Code section 311.2, regulating the preparation, publication, printing, and distribution of communicative material intended for the private use of adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In <em>Stanley, </em>the Supreme Court addressed for the first time a case of an adult defendant convicted of a crime because he possessed obscene films in his home. Led by these facts to examine the permissibility of governmental action in regulating the content of an adult\u2019s private library of books or films, the court concluded that the First Amendment demanded that the individual be free to choose what books he would read or what films he would view in the privacy of his home without fear of governmental sanction. The court reasoned: \u201cIt is now well established that the Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas. \u2018This freedom [of speech and press] . . . necessarily protects the right to receive. . . .\u2019 <em>Martin </em>v. <em>City of Struthers, </em>319 U.S. 141, 143 (1943); see <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 482 (1965); <em>Lamont </em>v. <em>Postmaster General, </em>381 U.S. 301, 307-308 (1965) (Brennan, J., concurring); cf. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510 (1925). This right to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social worth, see <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948), is fundamental to our free society. ... If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men\u2019s minds.\u201d (394 U.S. at pp. 564-565 [22 L.Ed.2d at pp. 549-550].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The People have suggested that this court has anticipated the broad holding of <em>Stanley </em>by its interpretation of Penal Code section 311.2 in <em>In re Klor </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 816 [51 Cal.Rptr. 903, 415 P.2d 791], and thus that <em>Stanley </em>works no substantial change in California law. In <em>Klor </em>we held that the mere preparation of obscene material was not a violation of section 311.2. In reaching that conclusion we reasoned in part: \u201cWithout the requirement that the defendant be shown to have prepared the material with intent to distribute it in its obscene form, [section 311.2] would apply to matter produced solely for the personal enjoyment of the creator or as a means for the improvement of his artistic techniques. Such a statute would approach an interdiction of individual expression in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) (64 Cal.2d at p. 820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Our emphasis in <em>Klor, </em>however, was not on the individual\u2019s right to receive all written ideas in the privacy of his home, but rather on an individual\u2019s right to express ideas. Thus we concluded in <em>Klor: </em>\u201cIn summary, we do not believe that the Legislature intended to inhibit the mere preparation of allegedly obscene material not intended for distribution. We cannot believe that the Legislature meant to freeze the creative process and cast the maker\u2019s unfinished product into forbidden form during its genesis. Thus to stifle individual expression would be to shackle creativity itself.\u201d (64 Cal.2d at p. 822.) (See also People v. <em>Noroff </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 791, 793 fn. 4 [63 Cal.Rptr. 575, 433 P.2d 479].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><em>Stanley, </em>in examining the right of an adult to possess all material, whether or not obscene, focuses on the individual as recipient of ideas, not creator. Nowhere in <em>Stanley </em>is there the slightest indication that the court saw its decision limited to material created by the possessor; indeed, the thrust of the whole opinion precludes such a construction. As the <em>Stanley </em>court viewed the interests before it, the defendant was \u201casserting the right to read or observe what he pleases\u2014the right to satisfy his intellectual and emotional need in the privacy of his own home. <em>He is asserting the right to be free from state inquiry into the contents of his library.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) (394 U.S. at p. 565 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 549].) It is these rights which <em>Stanley </em>determines are guaranteed to the individual by the Constitution; our decision in <em>Klor </em>was not so directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">As the <em>Stanley </em>court emphasized, the question of the government\u2019s effective control of a man\u2019s own library involves the added dimension of an intrusion into the individual\u2019s private domain. In our highly complex and increasingly interdependent society the need to preserve the individual\u2019s freedom of thought has become crucial. The individual has been confronted with the rise of tremendous power in government and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>so-called techno-structure that tends to compel conformity and standardization. The central issue of our time must be to preserve the identity of the individual in the face of a dangerous depersonalization and dehumanization. The censorship of the citizen\u2019s reading matter and the destruction of his access to reading matter, even though that censorship takes the form of prohibiting \u201cpornography,\u201d inevitably spills over into censorship of political reading matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These are the compelling reasons why, in today\u2019s society, the individual\u2019s choice of the books he desires to read in private should be inviolate.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><em>Stanley </em>demonstrates that our constitutional protections secure to all persons this right of individual choice. So long as he does not invade the rights of others, the adult should be free not only to say whatever he wants and to advocate whatever he believes, but also to choose what books he will read or what films he will watch in his home. (See <em>Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 901, 902 [31 Cal.Rptr. 800, 383 P.2d 152, 10 A.L.R. 3d 707].) <em>Stanley </em>thus insures the preservation of a private domain where the individual is the complete master of what he reads and what he thinks. (See <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1928) 277 U.S. 438, 478 [72 L.Ed. 944, 48 S.Ct. 564] (Brandeis, J., dissenting); <em>cl.

(394 U.S. at p. 564 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 549].) The <em>Stanley </em>court further elaborated its rejection of the limitation of First Amendment rights to matters having some \u201credeeming social importance\u201d : \u201cNor is it relevant that obscenity in general, or the particular films before the Court, are arguably devoid of any ideological content. <em>The line between the transmission of ideas and mere entertainment is much </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>too elusive for this Court to draw, if indeed such a line can be drawn at all </em>See <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>333 U.S. at 510.\u201d (Italics added.) (394 U.S. at p. 566 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 550].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Although <em>Stanley </em>thus dictates that the government \u201chas no business\u201d in regulating the content of an adult\u2019s reading matter, the opinion expressly declares that the states retain the power to regulate the public dissemination of obscene material. (394 U.S. at pp. 563, 568 [22 L.Ed.2d at pp. 548, 551].) The People contend that this declaration demonstrates that Penal Code section 311.2 accords with <em>Stanley </em>since the section proscribes only the distribution of obscene material and the printing, preparation and publication of obscene material with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The \u201cpower to regulate,\u201d however, does not encompass the authority to prohibit all means of distribution of material that is intended for the private use of adults. The rights of adults to possess, study, and enjoy all ideas in the privacy of their homes would mean little if the state could effectively foreclose all legal means of access to a designated category of material by penalizing anyone who distributed it. We should not be so disingenuous as to recognize, as we must, that our state and federal Constitutions protect an adult\u2019s right to possess all written material regardless of content, and simultaneously to acknowledge authority in the government to prohibit the dissemination of such material intended for private adult use solely because of that material\u2019s content.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The courts have long held that the right to disseminate material protected by the First Amendment is an integral and necessary part of that constitutional right. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>City of Struthers </em>(1943) 319 U.S. 141, 143 [87 L.Ed. 1313, 1316-1317, 63 S.Ct. 862] (\u201cThis freedom [of speech and press] embraces the <em>right to distribute literature, Lovell </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>303 U.S. 444, 452, and necessarily protects the right to receive it.\u201d); <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1965) 381 U.S. 479, 482 [14 L.Ed.2d 510, 513, 85 S.Ct. 1678] (\u201cthe right of freedom of speech and press includes <em>not only the right </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, </em>the right to receive, the right to read\u201d) (italics added).) Moreover, \u201cwhen expression protected by the First Amendment is involved \u2018It is of course no matter that the dissemination takes place under commercial auspices.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Weaver </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 235, 246 [49 Cal.Rptr. 537, 411 P.2d 289]; see <em>New York Times </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 265-266 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 697-698, 84 S.Ct. 710]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California </em>(1959) 361 U.S. 147, 150 [4 L.Ed.2d 205, 209, 80 S.Ct. 215].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The marketplace of ideas will surely be barren if all sellers are excluded. (Cf. <em>Lamont </em>v. <em>Postmaster General </em>(1965) 381 U.S. 301, 308 [14 L.Ed.2d 398, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1493] (Brennan, J., concurring).)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The constitutional interests involved in this criminal proceeding are thus broader than that of the defendant printer, publisher, or distributor (cf. <em>Interstate Circuit </em>v. <em>Dallas </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 676, 684 [20 L.Ed.2d 225, 232, 88 S.Ct. 1298]); they are the interests of every adult in realistically being able to exercise his constitutional right to decide which books he will read in the privacy of his home. <em>Stanley </em>commands that the individual, not the government, be the one who ultimately decides whether the individual will read a book or not; the state as effectively withdraws that individual choice by the criminal prosecution of all who print, publish or disseminate an \u201cobscene\u201d work as by the criminal prosecution of the reader himself. In either case the state eliminates from normal circulation those publications which are the subject of its censure. The alternative interpretation of <em>Stanley, </em>giving the state full authority to proscribe any dissemination of obscene matter, would effectively mean that the First Amendment protections apply only to an author\u2019s possession of his own works. I can find no indication in the Supreme Court decision that the First Amendment rights are to be so eviscerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Indeed, <em>Stanley </em>explicitly rejected as incompatible with the First Amendment the two main governmental purposes that have been proffered to support a general governmental prohibition of all distribution of such materials; (1) the governmental interest in protecting the morality of adults by controlling what reading materials they may legally obtain and (2) the governmental interest in curtailing potential criminal activity allegedly fostered by the reading of obscene matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The propriety of grounding governmental regulation of written and filmed expression on an asserted state interest in maintaining a certain standard of morality, an issue which created a great philosophical debate in the nineteenth century,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has recently become the subject of a dialogue between some of the leading legal theoreticians of our age.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Stanley, </em>the United States Supreme Court forthrightly declared that the state\u2019s exercise of control over morality by prescribing what materials can be read or observed by adults was incompatible with the First Amendment. \u201c. . . Georgia asserts the right to protect the individual\u2019s mind from the effects of obscenity. We are not certain that this argument amounts to anything more than the assertion that the State has the right to control the moral content of a person\u2019s thoughts. To some, this may be a noble purpose, but it is wholly inconsistent with the philosophy of the First Amendment. As the Court said in <em>Kingsley International Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>Regents, </em>360 U.S. 684,688-689 (1959), \u2018[tjhis argument misconceives what it is that the Constitution protects. Its guarantee is not confined to the expression of ideas that are conventional or shared by a majority. . . .\u2019\u201d (Fn. omitted.) (394 U.S. at pp. 565-566 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 550],)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I cannot perceive how such a purpose of \u201ccontrolling] the moral content of a person\u2019s thoughts\u201d is any more compatible with the First Amendment when used to justify the prohibition of distributing material intended for private use by adults than when used to justify the prohibition of reading or viewing such material.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The court similarly rejected the argument that would justify complete prohibition of dissemination on the grounds that exposure to such material might lead the adult recipients to antisocial conduct. While the court in <em>Roth </em>had not felt constrained to embrace this issue directly (see 354 U.S. at pp. 486-487 [1 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1507-1508]), the <em>Stanley </em>court did: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>. . Georgia asserts that exposure to obscenity may lead to deviant sexual behavior or crimes of sexual violence. There appears to be little empirical basis for that assertion. But more important, if the State is only concerned about literature inducing antisocial conduct, we believe that in the context of private consumption of ideas and information we should adhere to the view that \u2018[a]mong free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law. . . .\u2019 <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 378 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring.) See Emerson, <em>Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, </em>72 Yale L.J. 877, 938 (1963). Given the present state of knowledge, the State may no more prohibit mere possession of obscenity on the ground that it may lead to antisocial conduct than it may prohibit possession of chemistry books on the ground that they may lead to the manufacture of homemade spirits.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) (394 U.S. at pp. 566-567 [22 L.Ed.2d at pp. 550-551].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Although the constitutional right of adults to possess material, whatever its worth, thus necessarily means that government may not completely prohibit the dissemination of material intended for an adult\u2019s private use, <em>Stanley </em>makes it perfectly clear that the state retains authority to regulate the manner of public dissemination<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in furtherance of two legitimate governmental objectives. The Supreme Court, drawing from its experience garnered in previous obscenity cases, isolated two state objectives that are permissible bases for the regulation of public distribution of obscene material: (1) the protection of an unwilling individual from blatant and offensive assaults on his sensibilities and (2) the protection of children. (394 U.S. at p. 567 [22 L.Ed.2d at p. 550].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The People contend that since any public dissemination of obscene material presents the danger that public sensibilities may be assaulted or that children may obtain the books, the state is justified, in furtherance of these objectives, in proscribing <em>all </em>public distribution. This court, however, has long recognized that when the state regulates in the area of First Amendment rights \u201c[precision of regulation is required so that the exercise of our most precious freedoms will not be unduly curtailed except to the extent necessitated by the legitimate governmental objective.\u201d <em>(Vogel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 68 Cal.2d 18, 22 [64 Cal.Rptr. 409, 434 P.2d 961].) As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[E]ven though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(Shelton </em>v. <em>Tucker </em>(1960) 364 U.S. 479, 488 [5 L.Ed.2d 231, 237, 81 S.Ct. 247].) Indeed, the reasoning underlying the People\u2019s contention was rejected long ago by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Michigan </em>(1957) 352 U.S. 380 [1 L.Ed.2d 412, 77 S.Ct. 524],\u2018in which case the court overturned a state obscenity statute that prohibited the dissemination of First Amendment protected material that the state felt was unfit for its children. In <em>Butler, </em>Justice Frankfurter, writing for a unanimous court, declared: \u201cThe State insists that, by thus quarantining the general reading public against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield juvenile innocence, it is exercising its power to promote the general welfare. Surely this is to burn the house to roast the pig. ... We have before us legislation not reasonably restricted to the evil with which it is said to deal. The incidence of this enactment is to reduce the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children.\u201d (352 U.S. at p. 383 [1 L.Ed.2d at p. 414].)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Although California\u2019s criminal statute differs from the Michigan law in that its obscenity standard is ostensibly geared to adults, not children, <em>Stanley </em>holds that, as far as government regulation is concerned, no book is \u201ctoo rugged for grown men and women\u201d to read in the privacy of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>home. <em>Butler </em>teaches that a general proscription of reading matter cannot be countenanced by the state\u2019s concededly legitimate interest in protecting children. Thus California\u2019s contention here that all dissemination can be curtailed should be rejected. Similarly, I can perceive no reason why the state\u2019s interest in protecting the privacy and sensibilities of the public could justify a general proscription of <em>all </em>manner of distribution, including that which does not offend. The evils of the corruption of children and of obnoxious and offensive displays should be met directly and precisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Thus, as I read <em>Stanley, </em>the governmental authority to regulate the public distribution of reading material intended for the private use of adults extends only to measures reasonably related to the protection of juveniles or to the protection of the privacy of individuals from unsolicited assaults on their sensibilities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These limits do not leave the state without means to combat the very real evils that may arise as to these matters, but instead require the state to focus upon them and to provide criminal sanctions directed to such evils. The prohibition of intolerably obnoxious advertising campaigns that reach individuals unsolicited certainly falls within such permissible goals of state laws. (See <em>Rowan </em>v. <em>United States Post Office Dept. </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 728, 736-738 [25 L.Ed.2d 736, 742-744, 90 S.Ct. 1484]; cf. <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 463 [16 L.Ed.2d 31, 86 S.Ct. 942]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klaw </em>(2d Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 155, 163-164.) Further, the state may proscribe the display of patently offensive posters, billboards, and book covers<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in public areas where indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>viduals, unwilling to be confronted with such material, cannot avoid them. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stover </em>(1963) 12 N.Y.2d 462 [240 N.Y.S.2d 734, 191 N.E.2d 272] (Fuld, J.).) Similarly, the state may enact legislation that seeks to protect juveniles by prohibiting the sale of certain harmful matter to them (see <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 629 [20 L.Ed.2d 195, 88 S.Ct. 1274]); indeed, the California Legislature has recently approved such a statute (Pen. Code, \u00a7 313).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Given the above constitutional considerations, I believe that the indictments in the instant case, charging defendants with conspiring to violate Penal Code section 311.2 by preparing, publishing, printing, and distributing obscene books, material intended for the private use of adults, is constitutionally infirm. Although section 311.2 also prescribes criminal sanctions for individuals who \u201cexhibit\u201d obscene matter, sanctions which under proper circumstances would be compatible with one of the legitimate governmental objectives set out above, the present indictment includes no reference to any exhibition of such materials by the defendants. Nor was any evidence presented to the grand jury which returned the indictment that would warrant such a charge. Under these circumstances, I conclude that the indictment should be dismissed. (See, e.g., <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 319, 322 [121 P.2d 713].)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">This approach to the regulation of obscenity, necessitated by the rationale of <em>Stanley, </em>concededly would work a substantial change in the relevant legal aspects of this area. From the standpoint of the administration of the judicial task, however, such a change would surely be welcome. The past efforts of the courts, and especially the United States Supreme Court, have largely centered on attempts to define constitutionally unprotected obscenity; the task has proven to be Herculean and almost unachievable. Judicial fear of the potential erosion of the definition has necessitated that each level of appellate courts independently review the challenged material<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in terms of this elusive,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> nonuniform, concededly subjective definition, an undertaking not only personally distasteful for most judges and enormously time-consuming for all, but one which is essentially non-legal, for the determination of \u201csocial worth\u201d cannot be reached by resort to precedent or rational principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>Stanley\u2019s </em>illumination of the permissible fields of governmental regulation would serve to extricate the judiciary from the legal quagmire of obscenity. When materials intended for private individual use are in question, law enforcement officials, courts, and private individuals would no longer be faced with the necessity of performing the nearly impossible process of framing an abstract definition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instead, legislative regulations and judicial interpretations could focus upon the defined harms of offensive psychic assaults and the corruption of children.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This approach would enable judges and lawyers to step back from merely subjective responses and return to reasoned analysis.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">To be sure, this reevaluation of legitimate state purposes would not obviate all problems in the field of obscenity. Courts would be obligated to continue to scrutinize regulations directed at fulfilling, the above stated goals since they border on constitutionally protected areas. (See, e.g., <em>Bantam Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 58, 66 [9 L.Ed.2d 584, 590, 83 S.Ct. 631].) The regulation of material not covered by the rationale of <em>Stanley </em>would still necessarily be judged by present constitutional standards of obscenity. Nonetheless, the judicial task would undoubtedly be lightened by the refocusing of a substantial proportion of obscenity litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">My conclusion, however, does not emanate merely from a desire to relieve the judiciary of an unpleasant task. It is instead the recognition of one principle of our governmental system, a principle articulated by Justice Brand\u00e9is over 40 years ago: \u201cThe makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized the significance of man\u2019s spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the right to be let alone\u2014the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized man.\u201d <em>(Olmstead v.

Although many may find the proposed reordering of morality personally offensive, and others may find the strategy utilized unwise or even counterproductive, the preservation of the right of free expression of all \u201cpolitical\u201d views lies, of course, at the heart of the First Amendment.

Perhaps Chief Justice Warren, concurring in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476, 495 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 1513, 77 S.Ct. 1304], laid the foundation for the approach to obscenity problems embraced in <em>Stanley </em>when he wrote: \u201cIt is not the book that is on trial; it is a person. The conduct of the defendant is the central issue, not the obscenity of a book or picture. ... A wholly different result might be reached in a different setting.\u201d (P. 495 [1 L.Ed.2d p. 1513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The initial articulation of the legitimate state interest in protecting the sensibilities of the public from offensive assaults also appeared in <em>Roth. </em>Justice Harlan, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, proposed that: \u201cthe State has a legitimate interest in protecting the privacy of the home against invasions of <em>unsolicited </em>obscenity.\u201d (Italics added.) (354 U.S. at p. 502 [1 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1516-1517].) This concern with interferences with the privacy of the public is apparent throughout the entire opinion of Justice Brennan, joined by Chief Justice Warren and Justices Clark, White, and Portas, in <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 463, 469-470 [16 L.Ed. 2d 31, 37-38, 86 S.Ct. 942]. In concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cpandering\u201d could properly be taken into account in an obscenity case, the court expressed concern with the \u201cbrazen\u201d public dissemination of offensive material (383 U.S. at p. 470 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 38]), the \u201cindiscriminate . . . solicitation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 469 [16 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>at p. 37]), and the \u201cflooded mails\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 473 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 39]). As the court explicitly noted, \u201c[PJublic confrontation with the potentially offensive aspects of the work . . . heightens the offensiveness of the publications to those who are offended by such material.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 470 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 38].) (See Note, <em>More Ado About Dirty Books </em>(1966) 75 Yale L.J. 1364, 1404 fn. 156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Justice Stewart explained the legal rationale for such concern more fully two years later, in his concurring opinion in <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 629, 649 [20 L.Ed.2d 195, 209, 88 S.Ct. 1274]: \u201cWhen expression occurs in a setting where the capacity to make a choice is absent, government regulation of that expression may co-exist with and even implement First Amendment guarantees. So it was that this Court sustained a city ordinance prohibiting people from imposing their opinions on others \u2018by way of sound trucks with loud and raucous noises on city streets.\u2019 <em>[Kovacs </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>336 U.S. 77, 86.] And so it was that my Brothers Black and Douglas thought that the First Amendment itself protects a person from foisting his uninvited views upon the members of a captive audience. <em>[Public Utilities Comm. </em>v. <em>Poliak, </em>343 U.S. 451, 466 (Black, J., dissenting), 467 (Douglas, J., dissenting)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The court\u2019s very recent unanimous decision in <em>Rowan </em>v. <em>United States Post Office Dept. </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 728 [25 L.Ed.2d 736, 90 S.Ct. 1484], upholding a federal statute permitting a householder to insulate himself from mailed advertisements he finds \u201cerotically arousing or sexually provocative,\u201d represents the full crystallization of this concern for protection from unsolicited and undesired \u201cpsychic\u201d affronts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The state interest in protecting its children from obscenity has similarly emerged in a number of obscenity decisions. In <em>Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 184 [12 L.Ed.2d 793, 84 S.Ct. 1676], Justice Brennan, joined in concurrence by Justice Goldberg, stated forthrightly: \u201cWe recognize the legitimate and indeed exigent interest of states and localities throughout the nation in preventing the dissemination of material deemed harmful to children. . . . State and local authorities might well consider whether their objectives in this area would be better served by laws aimed specifically at preventing distribution of objectionable material to children, rather than at totally prohibiting its dissemination.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) In a separate opinion in <em>Jacobellis </em>Chief Justice Warren suggested: \u201cA technical or legal treatise on pornography may well be inoffensive under most circumstances but, at the same time, \u2018obscene\u2019 in the extreme when sold or displayed to children.\" (Fn. omitted.) (378 U.S. at p. 201 [12 L.Ed.2d at p. 806].)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 629 [20 L.Ed.2d 195, 88 S.Ct. 1274], Justice Brennan, writing for six members of the court, upheld the constitutionality of a special statute directed at the sale of \u2018obscene\u2019 material to minors. The court concluded that it was constitutionally permissible for a state to prohibit the dissemination of certain material to minors, even though a general prohibition on such dissemination would have violated the First Amendment. Justice Stewart, in his concurrence quoted in part above, found state regulation of obscenity for the protection of children analogous to the permissible regulation to prevent offensive \u201cpsychic\" assaults on a captive public. Viewing the still maturing minor as not fully capable of exercising a non-coerced, informed, individual choice, Justice Stewart reasoned that in both situations the government was acting to preserve the promise of free choice implicit in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>First Amendment. (390 U.S. at p. 649 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In <em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 767, 769 [18 L.Ed.2d 515, 517, 87 S.Ct. 1414], before listing the various standards of obscenity espoused by the individual justices, the court expressly noted: \u201cIn none of the cases was there a claim that the statute in question reflected a specific and limited state concern for juveniles. See <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158; cf. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>State of Michigan, </em>352 U.S. 380. In none was there any suggestion of an assault upon individual privacy in a manner so obtrusive as to make it impossible for an unwilling individual to avoid exposure to it. Cf. <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>v. <em>City of Alexandra, </em>341 U.S. 622. . . . And in none was there evidence of the sort of pandering which the court found significant in <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 463.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Prior to <em>Stanley, </em>two federal cases interpreted this paragraph in <em>Redrup </em>as limiting the obscenity inquiry to interference with the various interests expressly designated. The courts dismissed the cases before them because there was no evidence that any of the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d designated in <em>Redrup </em>were present. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>127,295 Copies of Magazine </em>(D.Md. 1968) 295 F.Supp. 1186 (two-judge court); <em>United States </em>v. <em>4400 Copies of Magazine </em>(D.Md. 1967) 276 F.Supp. 902 (en banc).) See also <em>Grant </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1967)) 380 F.2d 748, 749 fn.*)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">As I understand it, the state interest in preventing \u201cpandering\u201d is substantially equivalent to its interest in prohibiting other offensive public displays or exhibitions which are foisted on unwilling individuals. Insofar as the \u201cpandering\" concept represents an independent element relevant to a decision of whether material is obscene or not, the approach in <em>Stanley </em>obviates the importance of the concept in cases involving material intended for the private use of adults. Thus, the <em>Stanley </em>court significantly noted only two general state interests and did not mention \u201cpandering\u201d at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In this regard, the general conclusions reached recently by the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography are particularly pertinent. The Commission concluded: \u201cIn general outline, the Commission recommends that federal, state, and local legislation should not seek to interfere with the right of adults who wish to do so to read, obtain, or view explicit sexual materials. On the other hand, we recommend legislative regulations upon the sale of sexual materials to young persons who do not have the consent of their parents, and we also recommend legislation to protect persons from having sexual materials thrust upon them without their consent through the mails or through open public display.\u201d (The Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, p. 57 (Bantam Edition, 1970).)

The use of pictorial aids to illustrate the contents of such \u201crugged\u201d books, however, may be such as to offend the average member of the unwilling public, and such illustration could be proscribed (see <em>City of Youngstown </em>v. <em>DeLoreto </em>(1969) 19 Ohio App.2d 267 [251 N.E.2d 491, 504-505]); only the display of the offensive book cover, however, would be subject to the proscription.
