By this proceeding they seek a writ of prohibition restraining respondent court from enforcing, by contempt proceedings or otherwise, the provisions of a preliminary injunction issued by respondent on October 8, 1970. We have concluded that enforcement of a substantial portion of the preliminary injunction would violate petitioners\u2019 constitutional rights of free speech and that a peremptory writ should issue accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">Real party in interest Bud Antle, Inc. (\u201cAntle\u201d), is engaged in the growing, harvesting, and shipping of various agricultural products. Since 1961, Antle has been a signatory to various collective bargaining agreements entered into with the General Teamsters, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local 890 (\u201cTeamsters\u201d), covering a number of categories of Antle\u2019s employees. On July 16, 1970, Antle and Teamsters executed a collective bargaining agreement which, for the first time, cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ered Antle\u2019s agricultural field workers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On or about August 19, 1970, petitioner Huerta approached officials of Antle and requested that UFWOC be recognized as the bargaining agent for Antle\u2019s agricultural workers. When this request was rejected by Antle, petitioners called a strike and established picket lines at various of Antle\u2019s agricultural operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">On August 24, Antle filed an action against petitioners alleging, inter alia, that the strike and picketing activities violated the provisions of the California Jurisdictional Strike Act. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1115-1120.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 14, respondent court granted Antle\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction prohibiting petitioners from engaging in strikes, work stoppages or picketing at any of its agricultural operations. Petitioners do not here challenge the provisions of that injunction and it is not involved in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On September 21, 1970, an unfair labor practice charge was filed by another Salinas Valley agricultural employer alleging that UFWOC, by engaging in secondary boycott activities directed against Antle and several other agricultural employers, had violated section 8, subdivision (b), subsection (4) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 19, the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board notified the complainant of his decision not to issue a complaint, on the ground that UFWOC is not a \u201clabor organization\u201d within the meaning of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because it represents only agricultural laborers who are specifically exempted from the coverage of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complainant in that action has taken an appeal to the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>counsel of the N.L.R.B., in which appeal Antle has joined. The disposition, if any, of that appeal does not appear in the record herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Meanwhile, on September 25, Antle filed a supplemental complaint, alleging, inter alia, that petitioners \u201cwrongfully and unlawfully instituted a boycott against plaintiff\u2019s agricultural products ordering pickets to be placed at and around various grocery stores and other businesses selling plaintiff\u2019s products, throughout the State of California and the United States urging the patrons of such stores not to buy products bearing plaintiff\u2019s trade name.\u201d An order to show cause was issued on that date and, on October 8, 1970, respondent court issued a second preliminary injunction, in part prohibitory and in part mandatory, which provides in substance that (1) Petitioners are enjoined from publicizing that Antle is engaged in a labor dispute; (2) Petitioners are enjoined from publicizing that Antle\u2019s employees are not represented by a labor organization; (3) Petitioners are enjoined from in any way boycotting Antle\u2019s products; (4) Petitioners are required to do anything reasonably required to ensure the cessation of boycott activities by members of UFWOC; (5) Petitioner Chavez is required to notify in writing all responsible personnel that all boycott activities against Antle must cease, and to file a copy of such writing with respondent court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The preliminary injunction also provides, however, that nothing in it shall be construed as \u201cenjoining conduct which reasonably could be construed to be an unfair labor practice under 8, subdivision (b), subsection (4) of the Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 . . . The injunction then specifies that the following described conduct is <em>not </em>within the purview of section 8, subdivision (b), subsection (4): \u201c(1) Handbilling to advertize [sic] that a labor dispute exists between plaintiff and defendant UFWOC unless the same has the effect of inducing any individual employed by any person other than plaintiff in the course of his employment to refuse to pick up, deliver or transport any goods, or not to perform any services, at the establishment of the employer other than plaintiff engaged in distribution of plaintiff\u2019s products. (2) Picketing, handbilling, or advertising to encourage consumers of plaintiff\u2019s products not to buy such products, or to buy the products of producers other than plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">On November 9, petitioners filed a notice of appeal from the preliminary injunction entered on October 8. Respondent, on November 17, issued an order specifying that petitioners\u2019 appeal would not stay the enforcement of the injunction unless petitioners filed an undertaking in the sum of two million dollars. On the same day, respondent issued an order to show cause directed to petitioners Chavez and UFWOC, requiring them to appear on December 4 and show cause why they-should not be held in contempt of court for failing to comply with the provisions of the October 8 injunction. On December 4 the hearing was held and UFWOC was fined $1,000 for violation of the prohibitory provisions of the injunction. Chavez was sentenced to and served five days in jail for violation of the prohibitory provisions of the injunction, and was further ordered to remain in jail until such time as he agreed to comply with the mandatory provisions of the injunction.  In light of the serious constitutional issues raised by petitioners, we issued an alternative writ of prohibition, staying enforcement of all provisions of the injunction except that which prohibits petitioners from representing that Antle\u2019s employees are not represented by a labor organization, and ordering Chavez released on his own recognizance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Petitioners challenge the validity of the injunction on two distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>grounds: First, they allege that the activities restrained by respondent are arguably subject to regulation under sections 7 or 8 of the Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, hence, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> second, petitioners contend that the provisions of the injunction infringe upon their rights of free speech and the injunction is, therefore, unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to' the federal Constitution. We have concluded that the jurisdiction of respondent court is not preempted by federal law, but that the injunction is, in major part, overly broad and violative of petitioners\u2019 First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"> Turning first to petitioners\u2019 contention that jurisdiction has been preempted, we note that it is well settled that if the activity restrained by respondent is subject to regulation under the Act, state court jurisdiction is preempted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And even though the conduct in question is not clearly so subject, if it is arguably within the scope of the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, the state courts must defer to the jurisdiction of the board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here petitioners place substantial reliance on the fact that unfair labor practices were alleged in a charge filed with the regional director. But as we have noted above, the director refused to issue a complaint in the matter. We deem it of no consequence that the charging party has chosen to appeal that decision,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> since the bare assertion by an interested party that certain conduct is within the scope of the Act is obviously insufficient to oust a state court of jurisdiction. Petitioners\u2019 contention must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>therefore stand or fall on UFWOC\u2019s being either a \u201clabor organization\u201d or the agent of a labor organization, within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">For purposes of the Act, a \u201clabor organization\u201d is defined in section 2, subdivision (5), of the Act, as an organization \u201cin which employees participate and which exists for [certain enumerated purposes].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The term \u201cemployee\u201d is defined in section 2, subdivision (3), of the Act specifically to exclude \u201cany individual employed as an agricultural laborer.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Petitioners concede that UFWOC represents only agricultural laborers and, therefore, is not a \u201clabor organization,\u201d but they contend that since section 8, subdivision (b), subsection (4), of the Act<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> prohibits unfair labor practices by a labor organization \u201cor its agents,\u201d they are arguably subject to the provisions of the Act, as \u201cagents\u201d of the AFL-CIO.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The AFL-CIO is a \u201clabor organization\u201d for purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hence, if UFWOC were acting as the agent of the AFL-CIO in engaging in the activities in question, it might well come within the cited provisions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nowhere, though, is there an allegation of any facts on which such agency might be predicated; indeed, there is not even to be found a conclusionary allegation of agency. Nor is it alleged that UFWOC represents both agricultural and nonagricultural workers, in which case it would not likely be exempt from the Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In short, we conclude, as did the regional director, that the cited exclusion plainly applies to UFWOC and that respondent court therefore had jurisdiction to hear the complaint filed by Antle.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Turning then to the contention that the provisions of the injunction are violative of petitioners\u2019 First Amendment rights, we review briefly the history of the California Jurisdictional Strike Act (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1115-1120) under the terms of which the challenged injunction was issued. The heart of the legislation, which was enacted in 1947, is Labor Code section 1118, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>which defines a jurisdictional strike as \u201ca concerted refusal to perform work for an employer or any other concerted interference with an employer\u2019s operation or business, arising out of a controversy between two or more labor organizations as to which of them has or should have the exclusive right to bargain collectively with an employer on behalf of his employees, or any of them, or arising out of a controversy between two or more labor organizations as to which of them has or should have the exclusive right to have its members perform work for an employer.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In 1953, the Jurisdictional Strike Act was held constitutional against a contention that the prohibition of peaceful picketing violated the constitutional right of free speech. <em>(Seven Up etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Grocery etc. Union </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 368 [254 P.2d 544, 33 A.L.R.2d 327] (revd. on other grounds) (1959) 359 U.S. 434 [3 L.Ed.2d 931, 79 S.Ct. 939].) Specifically, <em>Seven Up </em>held that the state may constitutionally enjoin picketing for purposes declared to be illegal or contrary to public policy. However, <em>Seven Up </em>and its two companion cases <em>(Voeltz </em>v. <em>Bakery etc. Union </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 382 [254 P.2d 553]; <em>Sommer </em>v. <em>Metal Trades Council </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 392 [254 P.2d 559]), shed little light on the extent to which the Act was intended to be, or may be enforced against conduct other than picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>Seven Up, </em>the court\u2019s discussion of the free speech aspects of the case., was limited to a defense of regulation of picketing. (40 Cal.2d at pp. 373-380.) In <em>Voeltz </em>v. <em>Bakery etc. Union, supra, </em>40 Cal.2d 382, defendants were enjoined from picketing, calling a strike, and threatening to picket to enforce secondary boycotts. And in <em>Sommer </em>v. <em>Metal Trades Council, supra, </em>40 Cal. 2d 392, defendants were engaged in picketing and secondary boycott activities. Although the specifics of the latter were not set forth in the opinion, they were viewed by the court as \u201ccoercive activity\u201d (see <em>id. </em>at p. 401). In none of those cases was a consumer (as opposed to a secondary) boycott involved, nor was the court faced with the need to define the concept of \u201ccoercive\u201d activity, or to establish limits beyond which the Act could not constitutionally be employed. Those cases, therefore, stand for the proposition (1) that peaceful picketing for purposes declared to be illegal or contrary to the public policy of the state may be enjoined, under some circumstances, and (2) that some forms of activity other than picketing may be enjoinable, if the activity is coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>One reported appellate decision appears to have gone further in enjoining specific activity,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but several trial courts have held that the Act could not be applied to conduct other than picketing unless such conduct was accompanied by some element of coercion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The question, therefore, of what \u201cother concerted interference with an employer\u2019s operation or business\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> may be properly enjoined has not been conclusively established.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The United States Supreme Court, in the landmark cases of <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 88 [84 L.Ed. 1093, 60 S.Ct. 736], and <em>Carlson </em>V. <em>California </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 106 [84 L.Ed. 1104, 60 S.Ct. 746], established the applicability of the First Amendment to picketing and other forms of activity in connection with a labor dispute.  In the language of the court, \u201cpublicizing the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way through appropriate means . . . must now be regarded as within that liberty of communication which is secured to every person by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a State.\u201d <em>(Carlson </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>p. 113 [84 L.Ed. p. 1108].) Eventually, \u201cthe broad pronouncements, but not the specific holding of <em>Thornhill </em>[yielded] \u2018to the impact of facts unseen\u2019 or at least not sufficiently appreciated.\u201d <em>(Teamsters Union </em>v. <em>Vogt, Inc. </em>(1956) 354 U.S. 284, 289 [1 L.Ed.2d 1347, 1351, 77 S.Ct. 1166].) As a result, the court engaged in a more refined effort to define \u201cthe power of the State to set the limits of permissible contest open to industrial combatants.\u201d <em>(Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra, </em>p. 104 [84 L.Ed. p. 1103].)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">That those limits include the power to enjoin peaceful picketing for purposes violative of state laws or public policy was made clear in <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1949) 339 U.S. 460 [94 L.Ed. 985, 70 S.Ct. 718], affg. 32 Cal.2d 850 [198 P.2d 885]. In <em>Hughes, </em>this court suspended an injunction banning picketing to secure compliance with a demand for racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>quota hiring. In affirming that decision, the court discussed the special characteristics of picketing as \u201cmore than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated. . . . The loyalties and responses evoked and exacted by picket lines are unlike those flowing from the printed word.\u201d <em>(Hughes </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>p. 465 [94 L.Ed. p. 992].)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, it is apparent that the more limited protection given picketing as a concomitant of free speech is predicated on the dual nature of the activity and the fact that, of itself, picketing (i.e., patrolling a particular locality) has a certain coercive aspect. Yet even with respect to picketing, there must be alternative means available for making known a grievance if the activity is to be enjoined. (See <em>Bakery Drivers Local </em>v. <em>Wohl </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 769 [86 L.Ed. 1178, 62 S.Ct. 816].)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In <em>Bakery Drivers Local </em>v. <em>Wohl, supra, </em>315 U.S. 769, 775 [86 L.Ed. 1184], the court, in holding the provisions of an injunction against picketing to be \u00e1n unconstitutional invasion of the right of free speech, laid great stress on the fact that, although \u201cA state is not required to tolerate in all places and all circumstances even peaceful picketing by an individual,\u201d nevertheless \u201crespondents\u2019 mobility and their insulation from the public as middlemen made it practically impossible for petitioners to make known their legitimate grievances to the public whose patronage was sustaining the . . . system.\u201d Similar considerations impelled this court, in <em>Park &amp; T. I. Corp. </em>v. <em>Int. etc. of Teamsters </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 599 [165 P.2d 891, 162 A.L.R. 1426], to modify the broad provisions of an injunction which precluded a rejected union from attempting to persuade employees and the public of the legitimacy of its grievances. As we then said, \u201cIn seeking to enjoin defendants\u2019 lawful activities plaintiff in effect asks this court to preclude any possibility that public sentiment will crystallize in favor of a closed shop in plaintiff\u2019s business. The court could not do so without denying to defendants their constitutional right of freedom of speech. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Park &amp; T. I. Corp. </em>v. <em>Int. etc. of Teamsters, supra, </em>p. 608.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In the leading case of <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Fruit &amp; Vegetable Packers &amp; Warehousemen </em>(1968) 377 U.S. 58 [12 L.Ed.2d 129, 84 S.Ct. 1063] (\u201cTree Fruits\u201d), the court held that picketing in support of a consumer boycott was protected activity under the so-called \u201cpublicity proviso\u201d of section 8, subdivision (b), subsection (4) of the Act. In <em>Tree </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>Fruits, </em>the Teamsters Union had a dispute with certain growers of Washington State apples. The union stationed pickets outside certain retail grocery stores, carrying placards which importuned the customers not to purchase the struck product\u2014i.e., Washington State apples. It was made clear on the placard that the Teamsters had no dispute with any store or market. This distinction\u2014between merely following the struck product and attempting to force a cessation of all purchases from the picketed establishment\u2014was emphasized in the court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Similarly, in the case before us, petitioners\u2019 efforts are not directed at those establishments which serve as the situs for some of the challenged activity\u2014rather, those efforts are directed to following the \u201cstruck product\u201d\u2014i.e., the agricultural products of Antle. Such activity obviously does not have the same coercive effect as a secondary boycott of all stores dealing with Antle.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Section 8, subdivision (b), subsection (4), protected \u201cpublicity other than picketing for the purpose of truthfully advising the public\u201d that a dispute existed between an employer and a union. In construing the language as it did, the court was extremely cognizant of the difficult constitutional questions which would have been raised had the section precluded peaceful picketing in the circumstances of a consumer boycott. (377 U.S. at pp. 63, 69 [12 L.Ed.2d at pp. 133, 137].) Mr. Justice Black concurred specially on the ground that, in his view, the statute did preclude peaceful picketing in support of a consumer boycott and, so construed, was unconstitutional (377 U.S. 58, 76 [12 L.Ed.2d 129, 141], Black, J., concurring). And even Justice Harlan\u2019s dissent, in which Justice Stewart concurred, laid great stress on the \u201cdiscriminating eye\u201d with which Congress had prohibited certain picketing, in asserting the constitutionality of the proviso. \u201cThe decision of Congress to prohibit secondary consumer picketing during labor disputes is, I believe, not inconsistent with the protections of the First Amendment, <em>particularly when, as here, other methods of communication are left open.\u201d </em>(Italics added; 377 U.S. 58, 80, 93 [12 L.Ed.2d 129, 143, 150], Harlan, J., dissenting.) That such serious constitutional doubts were asserted not only by the court, but also by the Senate (see <em>id. </em>at p. 69 [12 L.Ed.2d at p. 137]) is not, we think, without significance in considering petitioners\u2019 constitutional challenge to the injunction issued in the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Judicial efforts to circumscribe the legitimate activities of industrial combatants have thus been a response to more than abstract questions involving the right to speak freely; they have taken into account, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>overtly or tacitly, the unique problems involved when freedom of expression is so intimately entwined with economic effects and the shifting economic balance of power.  So although we have seen that activities may be circumscribed, nonetheless, we believe that \u201cAn order issued in the area of First Amendment Rights must be couched in the narrowest terms that will accomplish the pinpointed objective permitted by constitutional mandate and the essential needs of the public order. In this sensitive field the State may not employ \u2018means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Carroll </em>v. <em>President &amp; Commissioners of Princess Anne </em>(1968) 393 U.S. 175, 183-184 [21 L.Ed.2d 325, 332-333, 89 S.Ct. 347].) And, in another context, we have recently reaffirmed the primacy of First Amendment freedoms when their exercise conflicts with other legitimate and well recognized property rights. <em>(Diamond </em>v. <em>Bland </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 653 [91 Cal.Rptr. 501, <em>477 </em>P.2d 733].)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Instructive on the constitutionally permissible breadth of an injunction which touches on First Amendment rights is the'recent case of <em>In re Berry </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 137 [65 Cal.Rptr. 273, 436 P.2d 273], There, certain persons were arrested for picketing in support of the demands of a social workers union. This court assumed that the state could lawfully prohibit strikes by public employees, but held that the injunction which petitioners had been charged with violating was both unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. As we there pointed out \u201cOther language in the order compounds the effect of the indicated intrusion into the area of protected expression. Section (4) forbids \u2018inducing others to participate\u2019 in demonstrations. Section (3) forbids \u2018inducing or calling a strike, work stoppage or <em>other concerted activity\u2019 </em>against the County. It is clear that this language is broad enough to include the distribution of literature, the circulation of petitions, the publication of articles, and much other Union activity in connection with its grievances against the County. Even if we assume, as we have done above, that all such activity would be properly enjoinable insofar as it advocated a strike by public employees, still a vast area of constitutionally protected activity falls within the wide reach of the ban.\u201d <em>(In re Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 137, 154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Turning to the specific injunction issued by respondent court, we believe that, like the injunction issued in <em>In re Berry, </em>it brushes with too broad a stroke to be sustained. As noted above,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the injunction prohibits petitioners from \u201cin any way promulgating or advertising\u201d that a dispute exists; it precludes petitioners from \u201curging, encouraging, or recommending, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>or asking any other persons to urge, encourage or recommend, that any customer of plaintiff\u2019s boycott plaintiff\u2019s agricultural products\u201d; it effectively enjoins petitioners from making any appeal whatever to the consuming public to purchase the products of Antle\u2019s competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Antle contends that such activities are enjoined only to the extent that they have as their purpose the execution of a collective bargaining agreement between petitioners and Antle. It is true, of course, that a theoretical distinction exists between publicity which is solely intended to inform the public of certain alleged inadequacies in the conduct of a business, and publicity which has a further purpose\u2014e.g., to persuade the employer to recognize the labor organization conducting the campaign. Such a distinction has been utilized to enjoin <em>picketing </em>for the purpose of forcing an employer to bargain with a specific union, while allowing picketing which has as its purpose the truthful dissemination of information concerning working conditions. <em>(Corrigan </em>v. <em>Barbers &amp; Beauticians Union, supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 490.)  Whatever merit such a distinction has in the context of picketing,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we are persuaded that a state may not constitutionally enjoin other noncoercive truthful efforts to communicate the facts of a labor dispute to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We therefore believe that the injunction at issue is too broad to withstand the constitutional challenge mounted by petitioners.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Petitioners may properly be enjoined from making false and untruthful statements in connection with a labor dispute. <em>(Magill Bros. </em>v. <em>Bldg. Service etc. Union </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 506 [127 P.2d 542]; <em>Globe D. Lunch </em>v. <em>Joint Culinary Wkrs. </em>(1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 190 [255 P.2d 94] (hg. den.).) But the application of the Jurisdictional Strike Act to other activities enjoined by respondent court suffers from the same fatal defect noted in <em>Bakery Drivers </em>V. <em>Wohl, supra, </em>315 U.S. 769, and <em>Tree Fruits, supra. </em>That is, it effectively precludes petitioners in any effective manner, from informing the general public of the nature of their dispute with Antle. We deem it of significance in this connection that, unlike the federal Act, there is no provision in the Labor Code for certification of a Union and all the concomitant protections offered both employer and union. Hence, for aught that appears, none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Antie\u2019s employees may have wanted to be represented by Teamsters.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But once a contract is signed, a union effort to challenge the appropriateness of the representative with which the employer has contracted is, for all practical purposes, precluded if the injunction issued by respondent court were valid. In light of these considerations, we hold that peaceful and truthful attempts to persuade the general public not to purchase a specific product or products, unaccompanied by picketing<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or coercive tactics, is not the \u201cother concerted activity\u201d contemplated by the Jurisdictional Strike Act.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We have also concluded that the language of the injunction\u2014except for that portion enjoining untruthful statements\u2014is not that which would allow the application of the doctrine of severance (see <em>In re Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 137, 156), to sustain portions of the challenged order.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Let a peremptory writ of prohibition issue restraining respondent court from enforcing, by contempt proceedings or otherwise, all portions of the challenged injunction save that section which enjoins petitioners from representing that Antie\u2019s products are not handled by union personnel or that Antie\u2019s field workers are not represented by a bona fide union.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Wright, C.

Prior to 1970, other agreements between Antle and Teamsters did cover a number of categories of employees often subsumed under the generic label \u201cagricultural workers.\u201d The employees so covered were categorized by Antle as \u201charvesting workers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">In this proceeding petitioners do not attack the validity of the Antle-Teamster contract, nor do they assert that their dispute with Antle predated the execution of the Teamsters contract.
