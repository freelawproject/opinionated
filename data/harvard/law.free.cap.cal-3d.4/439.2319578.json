Code, \u00a7 209), five counts of kidnaping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207), one count of attempted kidnaping (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 207 and 664), six counts of rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. 4), one count of attempted rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 261, subd. 4, and 664), and two counts of first degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211). The judgment was affirmed <em>(People </em>v. <em>Norman (1960) 177 </em>Cal.App.2d 59 [1 Cal.Rptr. 699]); we denied a petition for hearing in March 1960, and certiorari was denied in October 1960. In 1969 Norman filed an application with the Court of Appeal for recall of the remittitur, presenting the sole contention that his case should be reconsidered in the light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225]. The Court of Appeal denied the application, and we granted a petition for hearing and transferred the application to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In the course of the robbery-rape of which Norman was convicted in count I, he caused his victim to move across the living room and into the bedroom of her house. These movements were merely incidental to the robbery and did not substantially increase the risk of harm beyond that inherent in the robbery itself. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) <em>supra, 71 </em>Cal.2d 1119,1139.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">For the reasons stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mutch, ante, </em>p. 389 [93 Cal.Rptr. 721, 482 P.2d 633], Norman was therefore convicted of kidnaping to commit robbery under a statute which did not prohibit his acts at the time he committed them, and is entitled to a recall of the remittitur in his appeal and an order vacating the judgment on count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The cause is retransferred to the Court of Appeal for the Second Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>late District with directions to recall its remittitur in <em>People </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>Crim. 6674, and to issue a new remittitur vacating the judgment on count I and affirming the judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The contrary is true of the movements of the victims in the other kidnapings of which Norman was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b471-4\">SULLIVAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0BX\">For the reasons set forth in my concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mutch, ante, </em>p. 389 [93 Cal.Rptr. 721, 482 P.2d 633], I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b471-5\">BURKE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZb\">I dissent for the reasons set forth in my dissent in <em>People</em></p>\n<p id=\"Atz\">v. <em>Mutch, ante, </em>p. 389 [93 Cal.Rptr. 721, 482 P.2d 633].
