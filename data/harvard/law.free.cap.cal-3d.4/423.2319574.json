Code, \u00a7 209), kidnaping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207), and first degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211). The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in an unpublished opinion in 1968, and we denied a petition for hearing in February 1969. In October 1969 our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225], was filed. Thereafter Killean and Leahy filed an application with the Court of Appeal for recall of the remittitur, presenting the sole contention that their case should be reconsidered in the light of <em>Daniels. </em>The application was denied, and we granted their petition for hearing and transferred the application to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In the course of robbing a jeweler and his companion in the former\u2019s apartment, Killean and Leahy caused them to move across the threshold and through various rooms in search of valuables. These movements were merely incidental to the robbery and did not substantially increase the risk of harm beyond that inherent in the robbery itself. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) <em>supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, 1139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">For the reasons stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mutch, ante, </em>p. 389 [93 Cal.Rptr. 721, 482 P.2d 633], Killean and Leahy were therefore convicted of kidnaping under a statute which did not prohibit their acts at the time they committed them, and are entitled to a recall of the remittitur in their appeal and an order vacating the judgment on the kidnaping counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The cause is retransferred to the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District with directions to recall its remittitur in <em>People </em>v. <em>Killean &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Leahy, </em>Crim. 14188, and to issue a new remittitur vacating the judgment on counts II and III and affirming the judgment on count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Tobriner, Acting C.
