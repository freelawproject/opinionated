The respondents stand at the threshold,of this appeal objecting to its consideration upon the merits on the ground that no properly authenticated transcript on appeal has been perfected or filed. The transcript oh appeal herein has attached to it the certificate of the clerk of the superior court from which the appeal is taken, \u201cthat the papers and orders therein contained are tine, full and correct copies of the originals on file and of record in this office, and of the whole thereof, together with the proof of service and filing thereof, and the indorsements thereon\u201d; but there is no certificate of the judge of the court that the papers and records which the transcript contains were any or all of the papers or records which were used, upon the hearing of the motion for a new trial. That a transcript lacking such certificate is insufficient under either the old or new method of perfecting and presenting the record on appeal, is settled under the authority of <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>American Fruit Co., 21 </em>Cal. App. 338, [131 Pac. 878], and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">It follows that the respondent\u2019s objection to the further consideration of this appeal must be held to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Lennon, P. J., and Kerrigan, J.\u201e concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
