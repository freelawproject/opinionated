The complaint averred that the note had not been paid, and that the executrix had neglected and refused and still neglects and refuses to approve the claim. The defendant did not demur to the complaint, but answered to the merits, and went to trial and judgment without, so far as the record shows, making any point as to the sufficiency of the complaint in the lower court. At worst, we think the complaint was only subject to a special demurrer upon the ground of uncertainty, which not having been presented, the point was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Aside from this suggestion, however, it may be said that in an early and well considered case differing in no material respect from the case at bar, it was held that a complaint, alleging the nonpayment of .the original obligation and its due presentation to and rejection by the administrator, sufficiently stated a cause of action, and that it was not necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>further aver that the administrator had not paid the claim. (Wise v. <em>Hogan, </em>77 Cal. 184, 188, [19 Pac. 278].)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The appellant also contends that the findings are insufficient to support the judgment; but since this objection is wholly-based upon the first contention of the appellant as to the sufficiency of the complaint it must necessarily fall with that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Lennon, P. J., and Kerrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
