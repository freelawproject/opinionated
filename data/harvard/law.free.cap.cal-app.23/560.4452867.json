We now move for a judgment against the Three Star Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the territory of Arizona, in accordance with the prayer of; the amended complaint, the default of said defendant having been duly entered by the clerk, the record showing service upon the secretary of said corporation.\u201d This motion was denied \u201con the ground that the court has no jurisdiction of said corporation.\u201d Whereupon the action was dismissed with costs in favor of the individual defendants who had appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The refusal of the court to enter judgment against the corporation is justified on two grounds: 1. There was no sufficient proof of service upon said corporation, the affidavit as to the summons showing that N. W. Mahaffey served it on the said Three Star Company \u201cby handing to and leaving with George A. Brown, Jr., personally, who was secretary of said corporation, in the county of San Joaquin, state of California, a copy of said summons,\u201d etc., and there is a similar affidavit of the service of the amended complaint. There was no showing that at the time of said service or, indeed, at any time, the said foreign corporation was <em>doing business </em>in California. In fact it sufficiently appears that when the attempted service was made, the corporation was not doing and had no authority to do business in this state. \u201cSection 411 of the Code of Civil Procedure declares that the summons in a civil action must be served by delivering a copy thereof ... \u20182. If the suit is against a foreign corporation, doing business in this state and having a managing or business agent, cashier or secretary within this state, to such agent, cashier or secretary. \u2019 Under the provisions of this section, in order that the court may get jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, it is requisite that such corporation shall be \u2018doing business\u2019 within the state at the time the summons is served, and that the service shall be made upon its agent who is managing that business, or upon its cashier or secretary. . . . By reason of the allegation in the complaint that the appellant is a foreign corporation, it became incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that, at the time of the service, it was doing business within the state.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>(Jameson </em>v. <em>Simonds Saw Co., </em>2 Cal. App. 586, [84 Pac. 289]. See, also, <em>Herron Co. </em>v. <em>Westside Electric Co., </em>18 Cal. App. 778, [124 Pac. 455].)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Again, the corporation was not a proper party defendant. The cause of action, if any, could be maintained only against the directors as trustees of said corporation. As stated in <em>Reed &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Harshall, </em>12 Cal. App. 704, [108 Pac. 719]: \u201cBy section 102 of an act of the legislature of 1907 (Stats. 1907, pp. 746, 747), amendatory of the act of 1905 (Stats. 1905, pp. 493, 494), requiring the payment by corporations of an annual license-tax to the state, it is provided that the directors or managers in office of a domestic corporation, whose charter is forfeited, or of a foreign corporation whose right to do business in this state is forfeited, because of failure to pay such tax, are deemed to be the trustees of such corporation and the stockholders and members of such corporation, and have full power as such trustees, to settle the affairs of the corporation and to maintain or defend any action or proceeding then pending in behalf of or against any of said corporations, etc.\u201d It is further provided in said statute that \u201cSuch directors or managers, as such trustees, may be sued in any of the courts of this state by any person having a claim against any of said corporations.\u201d Such foreign corporation is not exactly \u201cdefunct,\u201d as claimed by respondents, as the state cannot take away its charter, but it is at least a case of \u201csuspended animation.\u201d It can do nothing as a corporation in this state and the only recognition to be accorded it by the courts here is in the settlement of its affairs and this is to be accomplished through the agency of said trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The cases cited by respondents, <em>Kaiser Land &amp; F. Co. </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>155 Cal. 638, [103 Pac. 341]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>156 Cal. 95, [103 Pac. 493], and <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Miller &amp; Lux, </em>156 Cal. 102, [103, Pac. 496], directly involve domestic corporations, but the opinions are instructive as to the significance and scope of the license-tax legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In the last of these it is said: \u201cThe directors of the corporation having taken charge of its affairs as trustees as provided in section 400 of the Civil Code and the corporation having ceased to exist, neither the corporation itself nor its directors can be compelled to continue to do business by re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>issuing stock transferred from one of its stockholders to another person.\u201d Although it may not be accurate to say here that the \u201cThree Star Company,\u201d being a foreign corporation, has \u201cceased to exist,\u201d yet, as far as its powers and activities in this state are concerned, it is in exactly the same situation as the corporation considered in the said Miller &amp; Lux case. If the statute already quoted left any doubt as to this it should apparently be removed by a consideration of section 9 of said act of 1905, providing that \u201cAny person or persons who shall exercise any powers of a foreign corporation which shall have forfeited its right to do business in this state, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The said corporation and its directors having no authority to transact any corporate business or to exercise any corporate power whatever in this state, the court was right in finding that the defendants could not be compelled to make the requested reissue of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">It does not follow, however, that plaintiff is without remedy. If he has succeeded to the interest of one of the stockholders he is entitled to an accounting and to participate in any distribution of the assets of the corporation. It is said, in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Miller &amp; Lux, </em>156 Cal. 102, [103 Pac. 496]: \u201cThe holders of such stock by assignment, of course, have a right to participate in the division of the corporate assets by virtue of such ownership, but the machinery of the corporation has been superseded by that of the parties in liquidation, and they cannot be allowed or required to perform further functions in their capacity as a corporation or as directors thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Appellant contends that the refusal of defendants to issue the stock and to recognize his right to any interest in the property amounted to \u201can unlawful conversion for which action would lie; and this would be true even if the defendant had been a domestic corporation and had forfeited its charter; and in such ease it would have been legally obligated to recognize plaintiff\u2019s right or interest in the corporation or its property <em>(Kimball </em>v. <em>Union Water Co., </em>44 Cal. 175, [13 Am. Rep. 157]; <em>Ralston </em>v. <em>Bank of California, </em>112 Cal. 208, [44 Pac. 476]; <em>Ashton </em>v. <em>Heggerty, </em>130 Cal. 516, [62 Pac. 934]; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Hesperia Land etc. Co., </em>113 Cal. 8, [54 Am. St. Rep. 316, 35 L. R. A. 306, 45 Pac. 10 ]), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>interest in the value of the stock would be the damages that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. <em>(Black </em>v. <em>Vermont Marble Co., </em>137 Cal. 683, [70 Pac. 776]; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>McKibben, </em>54 Cal. 192.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The cases cited apply to \u201cgoing\u201d concerns, but, if we accept the theory of appellant as thus stated, it can be of no avail to him as he declined to offer any evidence that he was damaged by the action of defendants, the answer of the individual defendants having denied \u201cthat any shares of stock of said corporation at the time alleged in said complaint, or at any other time was, or that the same is of the value of one dollar per share or of any value whatever. \u2019 \u2019 It may be said that all the other material allegations of the complaint were denied in said answer and no attempt was made to prove any of them with the single exception hereinbefore pointed out. In fact, appellant rested upon the contention that it was the duty of defendants to reissue to him the said stock. It may be that his complaint was broad enough to entitle him to the relief hereinbefore suggested if he had insisted upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">It may be observed, also, that the determination of the trial court was in effect a judgment of nonsuit and, of course, .it will not preclude appellant from hereafter asserting and maintaining by an appropriate method of procedure whatever legal claim he may have to any assets of said corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Chipman, P. J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on February 18, 1914.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
