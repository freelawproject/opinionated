J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALE\">The defendant, having been found \u201cguilty of assault with intent to commit the crime of rape as charged in the information,\u201d moved the court for a new trial \u201con the ground that the court erred in the decision of a question of law arising during the course of the trial.\u201d Judgment having been duly entered on the verdict, defendant appeals from the order denying said motion-for a new trial. No appeal was taken from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">The reporter\u2019s transcript shows only one objection made on behalf of defendant during the course of the trial, and we may assume that the ruling made on that objection constitutes the error to which the defendant\u2019s counsel referred. This also appears from his brief on the appeal. By the ruling referred to the court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to a question propounded by the district attorney to the prosecuting witness. As the fact testified to by othe witness in response to that question had already been proved by necessary inference from answers previously given, and is established without conflict as a fact in the case, the court\u2019s ruling, even if it was wrong, could not be prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">The suggestion in appellant\u2019s brief, of a defect in the information, cannot be considered, since there is no appeal from the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>39 Cal. 370; Pen. Code, secs. 1012, 1239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">The order denying the motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">James, J., and Shaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
