(Stats. 1911, p. 599, et seq.) The\" specific charge against the petitioner is that it solicited the sale of certain alcoholic liquors within the limits of the city of Woodland, a municipal corporation, it being admitted by the petitioner, for the purposes of this case, that, prior to the time at which the petitioner is alleged to have committed the offense with which it is charged in the complaint objected to here, at an election, held in said city, in pursuance of the provisions of said local option law, the electors voted in .favor of the application of the provisions of said law to the territory embraced within the corporate limits of said city and thus de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>elared that said municipality should thereafter be no-license territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">From the petition in this proceeding it appears that the petitioner \u201cis and was at all the times herein mentioned a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of California; that its principal place of business is in the city and county of San Francisco, in said state of California, and is and at all times herein mentioned was lawfully engaged in the business of selling, furnishing and distributing alcoholic liquors.\u201d It is further alleged that said petitioner was not at any of the times mentioned in the complaint filed against it \u201ca person, company, association or club being or existing within the limits of the county of Yolo\u201d; that it has no place of business within the limits of the said county of Yolo, but, \u201cas said complaint shows upon its face, has its principal place of business in the city and county of San Francisco,\u201d etc.; that, \u201cas appears upon the face of the said,complaint the said alleged violation of the said act consisted solely of the mailing of certain letters, price lists, and an order sheet at the city of San Francisco, . . . addressed to a resident of the city of Woodland, in said county of Yolo, the said circular letter, price lists and order sheet constituting an advertisement of certain alcoholic liquors offered for sale by your petitioner; that it appears upon the face of the said complaint that all and singular the acts constituting the alleged offense as aforesaid were committed wholly in the city and county of San Francisco, . . . and wholly without the said city of Woodland and the said county of Yolo.\u201d The petition then alleges that it does not appear upon or from the face of the complaint that the offense, purporting to be therein and thereby charged against the petitioner, or that any offense whatever, was committed within the limits of the county of Yolo or within the jurisdiction of the said court of Woodland township; \u201cthat the said court of Woodland township has no jurisdiction of your petitioner or of the attempted criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The complaint filed in the respondent court against the petitioner and to restrain proceedings under which this proceeding is instituted is made a part of the petition and attached thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>It is charged in said complaint that, on or about the twenty-eighth day of May, 1913, the de fendant corporation mailed a letter at the city of San Francisco addressed to a Mr. James Monroe, at Woodland, California; that said letter, which characterized itself as a \u201ccircular,,\u201d contained an offer, designated therein as \u201cour final offer,\u201d to consign to the said Monroe, at any time within thirty days from the date of the letter, \u201cone full quart of this fine \u2018Old Reserve\u2019 whiskey, by return express, for only 50 c./\u2019 (no doubt-meaning fifty cents).

That the respondents, as a magistrate\u2019s court and the presiding magistrate thereof, are wholly without legal authority or jurisdiction to examine the charge set forth in the complaint assailed by this proceeding, is sought to be sustained upon the following grounds: 1. That, within the meaning of the language of the Local Option Law, there can be no solicitation of orders for the sale of alcoholic liquors within no-license territory unless the sale and delivery of such liquors are made or intended to be made within such no-license territory;'2. That section 15 of said act contemplates and intends that the solicitation interdicted thereby must be prosecuted in person within such territory by the persons or corporations, etc., mentioned in said section; or, in other words, that the solicitation contemplated by the section cannot be effectuated except it be done in person by such persons or corporations themselves or their agents, which proposition implies, of course, that they or their agents must be physically present within such territory when such solicitation takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">\u2022 In addition to the points above specified, it is urged by Messrs. Golden and Pritchard, in a brief filed by them as <em>amici curiae, </em>that section 15 of said act. contravenes certain constitutional guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Section 15 of the Local Option Law reads as follows: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, company, association or club, within no-license territory, to solicit' orders, take orders or ' make agreements for the sale or delivery of alcoholic liquors; <em>provided, </em>that this shall not apply to the taking of such orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>from a registered pharmacist at Ins place of business, or to the taking of orders for alcohol s liquors on the premises where stored or manufactured, un lor the conditions stated in section 16 hereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Section 16 provides: Nothing in this act shall be interpreted as rendering it unlawful to keep a'eoholic liquors for distribution, or to sell or distribute such liquors, in no-license territory in the manner following: 1. The serving of such liquors by any person at his own home ti&gt; members of his family or to his guests, as an act of hospital) <em>_y, </em>when no money or thing of value is received in return therefor, and when said home is not a place of public resort; 2. The serving or dispensing of such liquors by a registered pharmacist for <em>bona fide </em>medical purposes, upon certain specified conditions, among which is that such liquors so dispensed stall not be drunk upon the premises where dispensed; 3. The felling of alcohol by a registered pharmacist for other than beverage purposes, upon certain designated conditions; 4 and &gt;. The selling of wine by a regularly licensed pharmacist for aeramental purposes only, on certain conditions, and the di .tributing of wine, at the sacramental service of any religious organization; 6. \u201cThe keeping of alcoholic liquors at cellars, vaults or warehouses, receiving orders at such cellars, et&lt;., for said liquors, and the shipping of the same therefrom; <em>provided, </em>said liquors are not distributed or delivered to any person or place in no-license territory within the county in which such cellars, etc., are located, except when delivered to a common carrier for shipment to a place outside of i:- '-license territory; 7. The keeping of alcoholic liquors on the premises where manufactured, receiving orders at said premises for such liquors, and the shipping of the same from such premises; <em>provided, </em>said liquors are not distributed or deliv red in no-license territory within the county in which such premises are located in quantities of less than two gallons, and are not delivered to any person, or place in such territory within said county except as follows: (a) to a common carrier for shipment to a place outside of said no-license territory; (b) to other manufacturers of alcoholic liquors at the premises where they manufacture such liquors; (c) to cell rrs, vaults or warehouses where such liquors \u00e1re stored or dis' ributed as provided in the sixth paragraph of this section; (:!) to any person at his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>her permanent residence; (e) to registered pharmacists at their place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">It will be observed that section 15 exempts from its operation, to the extent of <em>talcing orders </em>for alcoholic liquors, registered pharmacists and. those places where such liquors are stored or manufactured, as provided by paragraphs 6 and 7 of section 16. There is no exception made as to the soliciting of orders, unless it may be said (and perhaps it may reasonably be so held) that such authority is necessarily implied from the provision that such orders may be taken from registered pharmacists. The provision authorizing the taking of orders on the premises where alcoholic liquors are stored or manufactured undoubtedly has reference to sales by the manufacturers of intoxicants, and does not, therefore, authorize the soliciting or taking of orders for such liquors <em>from, them,, </em>to be delivered <em>to them. </em>It is quite clear, then, that, except possibly as to registered pharmacists, regularly licensed to engage in the prosecution of their business in no-license territory, no one has a legal right to solicit or take orders for intoxicants from persons within such territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Now, as above indicated, the first point urged by the petitioner is that the provisions of the Local Option Law do not and were not intended by the legislature to prohibit the solicitation within no-license territory of orders for the sale or delivery of alcoholic liquors, unless the liquors to which such solicitation relates are to be delivered within such territory. Indeed, the contention goes so far as to involve the maintenance of the proposition that, while the legislative department of the government may, in the exercise of the police power, prohibit the solicitation or the making of agreements for the sale of intoxicating liquors within no-license territory where such liquors are to be delivered therein, legislation inhibitory of such solicitation or the making of such contracts within no-license territory, where the liquors are to be delivered outside the limits of such territory, would be invalid as in restraint of trade or in contravention of the right of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In the case of <em>Ex parte Anixter, 22 </em>Cal. App. 117, [134 Pac. 193], the petitioner sought to be relieved, through the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>of the effect of a judgment of imprisonment imposed upon him by the recorder\u2019s court of the town of Winters upon a conviction of the crime of soliciting orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>within the limits of said town for intoxicating liquors, contrary to the provisions of an orcb nance adopted by the governing board of Winters. It was there argued, as here, that the ordinance could not validly b: so construed as to prevent persons from soliciting orders williin the incorporated limits of Winters where the liquors to which such orders related were to be delivered outside of raid limits, -since such construction would operate in restrai ..it of trade. \u25a0 In remanding the prisoner, and reviewing the point thus suggested, this court in effect held that the righi of contract or the principles supporting inhibitions again\u00bb? legislation in restraint of trade could have no application 'n eases of prohibitory or regulatory legislation with respect to the traffic in alcoholic liquors. The writer of this opinion is the author of the opinion in the Anixter case referred \u00cd:.', It was then his impression that, since it is settled beyond all per adven ture that the traffic in such liquors is, in a legal aspect, a nuisance <em>per se, </em>which is merely to say that the traffic may exist, if at all, only by and through the sufferance of the government and not as of right, the state, or any of its subdivisions to which such powers are committed, may, in tlv. exercise of the powers of police, not only suppress the traffic entirely, but, in addition thereto, may adopt any regulation or character of legislation which will tend to remove every manner or form of temptation which might be introduced and which might have the effect of encouraging the use of such liquors or of generating in the people living within the territory in which the traffic is prohibited a sentiment favorable to the resumption therein of such traffic. In other words, I had always been of the opinion that all legislation, whose purpose was to minimize the use of intoxicants as beverages, whether such legislation was of a prohibitory or merely of regulatory character, solely applied to and operated upen the personal conduct of the inhabitants constituting the community or territory affected thereby, and, as stated, could have no relation .to or in any manner affect or impair, in le;; al contemplation, the right of contract; that, therefore, the s. <em>ate, </em>or any of its political subdivisions to which it had con, Med the right to execute within their respective limits the police power, could legitimately declare, if it so elected, that no transactions of any kind or character whatsoever resp cting intoxicating liquors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>either as to the use thereof or the traffic therein, shall be inaugurated, conducted, or carried on within its boundaries. This power in the state with respect to the subject of intoxicating liquors I assumed had become absolutely complete and, indeed, supreme, since by the act of Congress, known as the \u201cWilson Act\u201d (26 Stats. 313, chap. 728, [U. S. Comp. Stats. 1901, p. 3177, 3 Fed. Stats. Ann. p. 853]) intoxicating liquors had been expressly exempted from the operation of the commerce clause of the federal constitution. <em>(Delamater </em>v. <em>South Dakota, </em>205 U. S. 93, [10 Ann. Cas. 733, 51 L. Ed. 724, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 447].) I hence concluded that it was within the rightful power of this state and its municipalities, to which has been delegated by our constitution full power in matters of the public police (Const., art. XI, sec. 11), to declare that the mere act itself of soliciting orders for intoxicating liquors or the making of agreements within its limits for the sale thereof, irrespective of the place where it was proposed or intended to deliver the liquors to which such solicitation or agreements related, whether within or without the boundaries of the state or political subdivisions within which such transactions were prohibited, and regardless of whether the result of such solicitation was a sale or an agreement to purchase any such liquors, shall constitute a public offense, punishable as the legislative power might deem necessary or wise to direct. I believed that such legislation could not be held to have extra-territorial operation, nor, therefore, operate in restraint of trade, since its effect was directly upon those within the territory affected thereby, and could in no manner or degree interfere with the right of persons living or being in a license territory to solicit or contract for orders for such liquors in such territory. I conceived that, in the views thus entertained and expressed, I was supported by many, if not all, of the cases in which the power of the state with respect to the use and business of trafficking in alcoholic liquors has been fully and exhaustively reviewed and expounded and held to be (particularly since the Wilson Act, removed such liquors from among the subjects affected by interstate commerce), plenary, and, indeed, unhampered by any of the constitutional guaranties whereby certain other occupations, in themselves useful and necessary, yet subject to police regulation, are justly shielded against the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>discriminatory legislation. Of tlnse cases, I need mention only two, of which the one which tnay first be mentioned is that of <em>Ex parte Christensen, </em>85 Cal. 208, 213, [24 Pac. 747], where it is said that the governing power may impose such conditions upon the existence of thi \u2022 traffic in alcoholic liquors as it pleases, and that, \u201ceven if it be conceded that <em>the conditions were arbitrary, they were within the 'power of the board.\u201d </em>The other is the case of <em>Delamater v. South Dakota, </em>205 U. S. 93, [10 Ann. Cas. 733, 51 L. Ed. 724, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 447], wherein the court was called upon iso consider and pass upon certain objections, based upon com-.titutional grounds, urged against the validity of a statute of the state of South Dakota, imposing an annual license charge rpon \u201cthe business of selling or offering for sale\u201d intoxicating liquors within said state, \u201cby any traveling salesman, who solicits orders by the jug or bottle in lots less than five galle.'is.\u201d Upholding the statute and replying to a branch of tin argument set up in support of the claim that the legislation involved therein was invalid, the court, among other thin us, said: \u201c . . . The proposition here relied on is widely different, since it is that, despite the Wilson Act, the state d: South Dakota was without power to regulate or control ilie business carried on in South Dakota of soliciting proposals for the purchase of liquors, because the proposals reli ted to liquor situated in another state. <em>But the business if soliciting 'proposals in South Dakota was one which that state had a right to regulate, wholly irrespective of when or where it was contemplated the proposals would be accepted </em>oi <em>whence the liquor which they embraced was to be shipped.\u2019\u2019 </em>Again, in that case, the court, after referring to certain ca/ns, notably <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>California, </em>155 U. S. 648, [39 L. Ed. 297, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207], in which it was held that a state ha:; the authority to prohibit and penalize the act of procuring, \u00ed \u25a0\u25a0 agreeing to procure, any insurance from any foreign insurance company, unauthorized to do business within the borders o.l such state under the laws thereof (Pen. Code, sec. 439), use; the following language: \u201cIt follows that the authority of the states, so far as the sale of intoxicating liquors within their borders is concerned, is just as complete as is their right to regulate within their jurisdiction the making of contrae!:, of insurance. It hence must be that the authority of the /states to forbid agents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>nonresident liquor dealers from coming within their borders to solicit contracts for the purchase of intoxicating liquors which otherwise the citizen of the state \u2018would not have thought of making\u2019 must be as complete as is such authority in relation to contracts of insurance, especially in view of the conceptions of public order and social well-being which it may be assumed lie at the foundation of regulations concerning the traffic in liquor. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">From the foregoing authorities and many others which might be mentioned, I concluded that, if it be within the power of the states to prohibit the soliciting of orders for the sale of intoxicating liquors within their territorial limits, regardless of where such liquors were to be consigned or delivered, it was equally within their right in the exercise of the supreme control which it must be conceded that they possess over the subject of intoxicating liquors, to delegate like power to the municipalities within their borders (Const., art. XI, sec. 11), or to other of their political subdivisions, whose electors may themselves, by virtue of legally exercisable authority, invoke the application, within their respective jurisdictions, of the provisions of a general law, which determines the extent and conditions to and upon which such liquors may be used. (Stats. 1911, p. 599.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The foregoing observations, let it be understood, are not here made for the purpose of overthrowing the position of the petitioner in this proceeding upon the question to which they relate or of confuting the argument advanced in support of said <em>position; </em>but they are merely ventured as explanatory of the reasons which led to what now appears from a recent decision of our supreme court, to have been an erroneous conclusion reached by this court in the Anixter case, as to the point referred to. The former court, in the ease of <em>Ex parte Anixter, </em>166 Cal. 762, [138 Pac. 353], the self-same case which was before this court and above referred to (the petitioner, after being remanded by this court, having petitioned the supreme court for and there claimed the right to his release, through the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>for the identical reasons urged in this court), has held that the petitioner here is right in his contention that the legislative authority of a political subdivision of the state cannot enforce penalties against those soliciting orders within its jurisdiction for intoxicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>liquors, in cases where such liquors are to be delivered outside the limits of such subdivision. The court, in an opinion in that case, prepared by a justicof acknowledged learning and acumen and noted for the marked clearness with which he invariably expounds and applies to concrete cases the principles of jurisprudence, says: The incorporated town of Winters in law cannot exercise control over the welfare of those beyond its corporate limits, aud touching the liquor traffic its utmost right of control is to prevent soliciting and contracts of sale made within its limits for delivery of intoxicants therein. As a court, between two permissible constructions of a statute, will always give to it that which sustains its validity, so here it will be held that the ordinance applies, and applies only to the soliciting and contracting for the sale of intoxicants to be delivered within the town limits. But the town of Winters has no legal right to say that a contract may not be made within its limits for the sale of intoxicants to be delivered without those limits. Such an ordinance would not be a reasonable exercise of the police power and would plainly be in restraint of contract and of trade. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">I take it that the principle thus enunciated is no less applicable to the Local Option Law where the provisions thereof are invoked by the electors of a municipality or of any other territory in the state to which the provisions of said law may be made to apply than to a municipal ordinance, and that, therefore, although the Local Option Law has been adopted by the electors of the city of Woodland and its provisions made applicable to the territory embraced within the incorporated limits of said city, the act of soliciting orders or making agreements within said city :or the sale or delivery of intoxicating liquors cannot be prevented or penalized, where the intoxicants as to which such \u00a1.elicitation is prosecuted or agreements are made are to be delivered without or beyond such incorporated limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The proposition thus decided, however, is of no importance here, so far as is concerned the decision of the question presented for determination in this proceeding. As before stated and as is obvious, the sole question submitted here is whether the respondents have jurisdiction of the subject matter of the complaint and of the person of the petitioner. It is true that, while the complaint charges that the solicitation was carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>on within the incorporated limits of Woodland, it does not directly appear from or upon the face of that document where th'e liquors to which such solicitation related were to be delivered\u2014whether within or without the limits of said city. But the complaint nevertheless states an offense of which the respondents have jurisdiction, not as a justice\u2019s court and the justice thereof, but as a magistrate\u2019s court and a magistrate, since the penalties prescribed for a violation of the provisions of the act are in excess of those within the power of a justice\u2019s court to impose under the law. (Pen. Code, sec. 1425.) The language of the complaint is, in other words, so far as the element of the offense of which I am now speaking is concerned, in the language of the statute, and, abstractly viewing it, the complaint alleges facts constituting a charge which the respondents, as a magistrate\u2019s court and a magistrate, have the legal authority to preliminarily examine arid to pass upon for the purposes of such hearing (assuming, of course, that the solicitation of orders by mail is an act which comes within the inhibitions of the statute), and it is sufficient to charge the offense in the language of the statute; for it would be a perfect defense to the charge of soliciting and \u201cthe defendant would be completely exonerated\u201d if, either at the examination or the trial, he should make \u201ca showing that in fact the delivery was not to be made within the territorial limits of the town.\u201d <em>(Ex parte Anixter, </em>166 Cal. 762, [138 Pac. 353].)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The next point urged against the validity of the proceedings pending before the respondents is, as seen, that the crime of soliciting orders, taking orders' or making agreements within no-license territory for the sale or delivery of intoxicants therein cannot be committed, within the contemplation of section 15 of the statute, unless such solicitation or making of agreements be carried on within such territory in person by a party or his agent. In other words, the contention is that, to constitute either or any of the offenses denounced by said section, the party charged or his agent must be shown to have been physically present within the no-license territory and there in person have solicited or taken such orders or made such agreements. This construction of said section is arrived at by a grammatical analysis of the phraseology thereof, whereby, considering the construction concretely, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>is sought to be established that ihe legislature intended the language of the section to be understood as it may be paraphrased as follows: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, firm, company, etc., being at the time within nolieense territory, to solicit orders, take orders or make agreements within such territory for the sale or delivery of alcoholic liquors,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In support of the construction thus arrived at, it is asserted that, grammatically, the phrase, \u201c within any no-license territory,\u201d as used in the section, \u201cnecessarily qualifies the series of nouns commencing with the word, \u2018person\u2019 (as used therein), rather than the verb, \u2018solicit,\u2019 or the still more remote phrase, \u2018for the sale or delivery.\u2019 \u201d As sustaining that theory of the legislative intent, so far as said section is concerned, attention is directed to the rule laid down in section 73 of Black\u2019s \u201cInterpretation of Laws\u201d as follows: \u201cAs a general rule, relative, qualifying or limiting words or clauses in a statute are to be referred to the next preceding antecedent, <em>unless the context or the evident meaning of the enactment requires a different construction.\u201d' </em>(The italics are mine.) Or, as the rule is stated in <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Boston etc. R. R., </em>75 N. H. 435, [75 Atl. 1041], \u201cthe general rule of grammar and law is that relative terms refer to the next preceding antecedent, <em>unless it is clear from the context that a different one was intended.\u201d </em>(Italics mine.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Not only by implication, from the fact of their reliance upon the rule of interpretation above quoted, do counsel for the petitioner concede that the construction of laws or contracts according to strict grammatical rules will not prevail where such construction is <em>clearly </em>opposed to the context or evident spirit or purpose of such laws or contracts, but they expressly admit the soundness of the proposition in their brief. They vigorously contend, however, that their construction of section 15 is in perfect harmony with the spirit and purpose of the local option law. The argument is that the sole and paramount object of said law is, as is claimed to be true of all laws licensing, regulating, or prohibiting the sale of liquor, to control, regulate, or prohibit the <em>public traffic </em>in intoxicants; that it is directed against the saloons and places where intoxicating liquor is sold and drunk upon the premises ; that the act does not, even if it were competent for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>legislature so to ordain, attempt to \u201ccontrol or direct individual use of liquor, since it expressly exempts from the operation of its penalties, the act of keeping intoxicants at one\u2019s home in no-license territory for family use or the purposes of hospitality; that, therefore, the solicitation for orders for intoxicants to be used for such purposes is an essential incident of said right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">But, so the argument runs, even assuming that the soliciting of orders from individuals within no-license territory was intended to be and is proscribed, since the law cannot punish for sales of liquor committed outside of such territory, \u201cit cannot be presumed that the usual and ordinary incidents of sales are prohibited. Accordingly,\u201d so it is then declared, \u201cit is the personal soliciting by those within the territory rather than advertising or the mailing of circulars by those outside the territory that is sought to be prevented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">I cannot agree with the petitioner in its construction of section 15 of the Local Option Act, nor am I impressed with the various arguments offered in support of such construction, some of which are briefly given in the foregoing statement of its conception of the intent and scope of said section. It may well be conceded that the language of said section, when tested solely by the strict rules of grammar, appears, upon its face, to be involved in some obscurity. At any rate, it can be said that the legislative intent as to the scope of the section could well have been expressed with a greater degree of perspicuity, or, in other words, its phraseology so arranged as that there would be left no ground upon which there could exist any difference of opinion as to what I conceive must be its true import. But, when examined under the test of familiar rules of statutory construction, aided by the light afforded by the vital object which is obviously sought to be accomplished by the legislation of which it forms a part, no doubt can reasonably arise that said section was intended by the legislature to prevent, if possible, or to penalize, if committed, the solicitation of orders, the taking of orders or the making of agreements within no-license territory for the sale or delivery of intoxicating liquors in such territory, irrespective of the manner in which such acts may be accomplished. By this I mean to say that one who solicits orders or makes agreements through the instrumentality of letters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>sent to the addresses in no-license territory of persons residing or being therein, thus brings liimself as clearly under the ban of the statute as if he were 1;; prosecute such solicitation or make such agreements in person within the boundaries of such territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\">A fundamental canon of construction is that every statute must be construed with reference to the object intended to be accomplished by it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>22 Cal. 11.) \u201cIn order to ascertain this object it is proper to consider the occasion and necessity of its enactment, . . . and the statute should be given that construction which is best calculated to advance its object, by suppressing the mischief and securing the benefits intended.\u201d (36 Cyc., p. 1110, and cases cited in the foot notes.) And, where a statute \u201c s fairly susceptible of two constructions, one leading inevitably to mischief or absurdity, and the other consistent with so .md sense and wise policy, the former should be rejected and the latter adopted.\u201d <em>(In re Mitchell, </em>120 Cal. 384, 386 [52 Pac. 799].) The rule last stated is merely a repetition n another form of the rule relied upon by the petitioner and above quoted, and has peculiar force in its application to the proposition that where a statute may be given a grammalical construction leading to a result in manifest opposition to its purpose and intent or in circumvention of its paramount object, such construction will be rejected and one adopted which will effectuate or carry out the object designed by the legislature to be accomplished by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Aided by the foregoing rules, no difficulty seems to be in the way of reaching an accurate conclusion as to the meaning and scope which it was .the legislative intention that section 15 of the act in question, particularly i.he words, \u201csolicit orders,\u201d should bear and possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">As to the general object and the legality of the legislation involved in the local option law, and incidentally noticing some of the arguments set up in support of the petitioner\u2019s position, it may first be conceded that the real root of the mischiefs and evils which too frequently directly result from the use of intoxicants is in the public retail traffic therein, and that it is true, as counsel for the petitioner maintain, that legislation bearing upon the question of intoxicating liquors is primarily directed against such traffic. It is also true that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>.the individual act of using or consuming intoxicants appertains to or comes within the category of a citizen\u2019s personal liberties and with which act governmental interference can legally be interposed only where the individual use of such liquors becomes intoxication or alcoholism and thus an infringement of the personal rights and liberties of others. But, while, as stated, this is all true, it cannot for a moment be doubted that the great ultimate object of all legislation upon the subject of intoxicating liquors is, as is obviously true of the statute in question, to reduce to the lowest minimum the individual use and consumption of such liquors as beverages and thus diminish intemperance. And, while the state may not interfere with the individual act of consumption, where such act does not develop a condition of which it may legally take cognizance, it may, nevertheless, adopt such reasonable regulations relative to such private or individual use and consumption as will prevent it from becoming a public evil or responsible for conditions or mischiefs equal in enormity or degree to those proceeding directly from the traffic itself. Indeed, it is, as before intimated, within the constitutional rights of the legislature, in the exercise of the police power of the state, to establish any regulation which may tend to remove every temptation to use intoxicants as beverages under any circumstances and, which, if permitted to exist, might have the effect of creating a general sentiment in no-license territory favorable to the revival of the traffic therein. It is,</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">. therefore, within the constitutional competence of the legislature to prohibit, and to authorize punishment for a violation of the prohibition, every act and form of soliciting for orders within no-license territory for the sale of intoxicants, to be delivered in such territory, regardless of the use to which they may be intended to be put\u2014that is to say, irrespective of whether the orders so solicited related to individual or other uses. In the case here, the statute has made it unlawful to solicit such orders from all persons within no-lieense territory, except, perhaps, as before suggested, registered pharmacists, and, although, as shown, individual use of liquors at one\u2019s home for the purposes specified in section 16 is permitted, it is very clear, not, alone from the manifest general purposes of the law, but also from the fact that the taking of orders from individuals for liquors to be used at their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>homes is not, as is true in the case of pharmacists, authorized by section 15, either expressly or by implication, that the act of soliciting orders from individuals for household purposes was intended to be and is enjoined by the statute. It is, in other words, contrary to said act to solicit orders from or make agreements with any person within the limits of no-lieense territory for intoxicants, to be delivered therein, except registered and licensed pharmacists. If this be not true, then, manifestly^, the law has little, if any, practical meaning for the purposes for which it was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Nor is it important, so far as is concerned either the act of soliciting orders or that of making agreements for the sale or delivery of intoxicants, whethe; the <em>sale </em>contemplated by such solicitation or agreements is consummated outside of the territory, for the gist or gravamen of the offense of soliciting orders or that of making agreements for intoxicants within such territory is in the solicitation or the making of the agreements <em>with the purpose and intent of delivering such liquors therein. </em>It is, in other words, not unlike the crime of burglary, which consists of the mere entering of a building with the intent to steal or commit some other crime, irrespective of whether or not any property be actually stolen or any other act which in itself would constitute a different crime was actually committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The foregoing views are, I think, in perfect accord with those of the supreme court as expressed in the Anixter case, above referred to, concerning an ordinance whose language is very much like that contained in section 15 of the act under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">It has already been declared that by section 15 it was intended to enjoin every form of solicitation of orders for intoxicants. By this it was intended to be said that, viewing section 15 by the light of the obvious paramount purpose sought to be achieved by the legislation represented by the act, no other reasonable meaning can be deduced from it than that thus it was intended to prevent every kind and character of solicitation, whatever may be its form, whether in person or by letter or other like communications sent either from without or from within no-license territory through the United States mail or by messengers and addressed to persons within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>such territory, except pharmacists, at their residences or places of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">The construction for which the petitioner contends would render the act woefully impotent for the accomplishment of its purpose as a prohibitory measure. It would, indeed, open up an avenue whereby the central object of the statute could be frustrated, almost, if not quite, to the extent of rendering it nugatory. It would, in brief, countenance a gross evasion of the evident spirit and intent of the statute, for liquor dealers engaged in business outside the borders of no-license territory could, with impunity, and immunity from punishment carry on a mail order liquor traffic within such territory <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 Ga. App. 588, [62 S. E. 117]), and thus impart to the act an effect which would make it practically prohibitory of prohibition rather than prohibitory of the liquor business. Besides, such a construction would have the effect of granting to persons licensed to conduct the liquor trade outside the limits of no-license territory privileges exercisable within such territory which cannot be enjoyed by persons residing or doing business therein\u2014that is to say that, while persons engaged in the liquor business outside the boundaries of no-license territory could solicit orders and make agreements touching intoxicants, manufacturers of such liquors maintaining and carrying on their business as such within the limits thereof cannot legally do so, a discrimination which the legislature doubtless has the right to make as to the liquor traffic but which, from \u2019 the manifestly absurd consequences which would follow therefrom, it cannot reasonably be supposed to have intended; for thereby the city embracing such territory or the county in which it is situated would not only be deprived of its revenues, but of the power of exercising the proper control of the traffic which results from the imposition of the license. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>162 Mich. 397, [127 N. W. 302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Counsel, however, perceive no difference between the act of soliciting orders by means of letters or circulars sent through the mail to particular individuals in no-license territory and the circulation in such territory of newspapers, containing among others relating to other matters, advertisements extolling the quality and giving the prices of certain brands of liquor. But there is an obvious distinction between the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>propositions, and it lies in the fact that, in the one case, the minds of particular persons are directly addressed upon a single subject and their attention thus specially called to the subject matter of the letter or circular, while in the other no particular person is appealed to upon any one of the various matters which are usually referred to in or given publicity through the medium of the advertising columns of a newspaper of general circulation, \u201ciiolicit,\u201d according to Webster\u2019s dictionary, is \u201cto apply to for obtaining something; to awake <em>or </em>excite to action; to a-nuse a desire in,\u201d etc., and it may apply to cases where one asks another for \u00e1 bribe or asks another to commit bribery or larceny and other offenses. (Black\u2019s Law Dict., p. 1105.) It implies <em>personal </em>petition and importunity addressed to a particular individual to do some particular thing, and it is unquestionably in this sense that the term is used in the statute. If our statute against bribery in terms, as in effect it Ones, had been made to say that a public officer who <em>solicited </em>a bribe for the performance of some act within his official duties, and the officer should, by letter, solicit the payment to him of a bribe, it would not for a moment be questioned that such, act of the officer would constitute a solicitation of a bribe wiihin the meaning of the law. So it is and must be true here. A letter or circular, such as the one involved in this case, addressed to a particular person, and emphasizing in alluring terms the superior quality of certain commodities, giving the prices at which they may be purchased, and vigorously importuning the addressee to buy and use the same, can be no les:; a <em>personal </em>solicitation for orders for such commodities than would be the solicitation of a bribe through the medium of a letter or, indeed, than would be the ease of like solicitation prosecuted <em>in person </em>by the party by whom such letter or circular is sent out. An advertisement can in no sense be held to be a <em>personal </em>petition or request addressed to any parti c dar person. The ordinary advertisement so published has 1he effect only of directing attention, in a general way, to the matter advertised, and is, as before stated,- addressed to the general public, wherever such newspaper is circulated. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">But there is ample judicial authority for holding that a solicitation of orders by mail for the sale of liquors to be delivered in no-license units within- which solicitation of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>orders is in general terms forbidden by law is a violation of the legislative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">In <em>Rose </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 Ga. App. 588, [62 S. E. 117], the question is elaborately and ably examined in a case calling for the construction of a section of the Penal Code of the state of Georgia which provided: \u201cIf any person shall sell, contract to sell, take orders for or solicit personally or by agent, the sale of spirituous, malt or intoxicating liquors in any county or town or municipal corporation or militia district or other place where the sale of such liquors is prohibited by law, high license or otherwise, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The counties of the state of Georgia are given the authority by a general \u00e1ct of the state legislature to prohibit the traffic in intoxicating liquors within their respective jurisdictions. The defendants were accused of personally soliciting the sale of intoxicating liquors within Bartow County in said state, \u201csaid soliciting being made by and through the United States mail, by mailing letters to the citizens of Bartow County from the city of Chattanooga, Tenn., containing self-addressed envelopes, order blanks, and other printed and written matter soliciting the sale of said liquor, said letters having been mailed and delivered\u201d to certain named citizens of said county. It was claimed in that case, as here, that the solicitation of orders for liquor by mail did not constitute the solicitation contemplated or intended by the code section, but that the section applied only to solicitations made by one in person, \u2018 and that for that reason the solicitation of sales, referred to, whether it be by the seller himself or by his agent, must be by personal visit to the locality where such sales are prohibited.\u201d In support of that contention, special emphasis was placed upon the language of the section, \u201csolicit <em>personally.\u201d </em>The court rejected the construction thus given the section and the argument advanced in support of it, saying, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cWhen we consider that the intention of the act, to which we have already referred, was to make criminal the introduction of intoxicants from a county where the sale of such intoxicants was legal into a county where the sale was prohibited, it is readily to be seen that, while the solicitation which was made penal could be a personal solicitation, it was none the less made a crime for any person, either himself or by an agent, <em>in cmy way, </em>to solicit the sale of intoxicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>liquors where it was prohibited.\u2019 Again the court said: \u201cWe have no difficulty, therefore, in holding that it was the intention of the legislature (in order to make the prohibition laws of those counties that might adopt them'effective) to absolutely prohibit the encouragemen t of purchases of intoxicating liquors in counties which had prohibited the sale, <em>by any kind or form of solicitation </em>(italics mine), except that licensed sellers might solicit orders from licensed druggists and licensed physicians. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In <em>Hayner </em>v. <em>State, </em>83 Ohio St. 178, [93 N. E. 900], the Ohio supreme court sustained a verdict whereby the defendant was convicted of the crime of soliciting orders within \u201cdry\u201d territory for intoxicating liquors, said soliciting having been done by mail, under circumstances precisely the same as those disclosed by the complaint in this ease, the court, among other things, saying: \u201cWe assume thal the act of soliciting may be done by letter as well as in person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>68 Wash. 7, [122 Pac. 345], the defendant had been convicted of the charge of soliciting orders for intoxicating liquors within a dry unit, under a statute of the state of Washington making such solicitation a misdemeanor. The soliciting was done, precisely as here, by means of a circular letter sent through the United States mail by the defendant from the city of Seattle, where the sale'of intoxicating liquors was then permitted by law, to a citizen of the city of Everett, in said state, which vas a unit in which the sale of such liquors was then unlawful. The supreme court of that state upheld the judgment following the verdict of conviction upon the authority, principally, of the case of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>State, </em>of which it had this to say in its opinion in the Holmes case: \u201cUpon every point discussed, we regard that opinion as logical, unanswerable, and v-mll sustained by authority. Its reasoning and conclusions, which we approve and adopt, when applied to the facts in this, case, not only support the proposition that appellant\u2019s act was an unlawful solicitation of orders for intoxicating liquor\u00bb in a dry unit, but are also convincing to the effect that such unlawful act was committed in the city of Everett, where appellant\u2019s letter was received by Swalwell.\u201d (See, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>209 U. S. 39, [52 L. Ed. 673, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426]; <em>In re Palliser, </em>156 U. S. 266, [34 L. Ed. 514, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. <em>1034]; Horner </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number><em>United States, </em>143 U. S. 207, [36 L. Ed. 126, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. <em>407]; Burton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>202 U. S. 344, [6 Ann. Cas. 362, 50 L. Ed. 1074, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 688]; <em>Danciger </em>v. Stone, 187 Fed. 861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">As is shown by the above cited cases, and, indeed, as necessarily follows from the conclusion arrived at here with respect to the scope of the language, \u201csolicit orders,\u201d as employed in the statute in question, the crime charged against the petitioner was committed upon the receipt of the circular letter in the city of Woodland by the party to whom it was addressed, and the venue of the offense is consequently in Tolo County, in which the city of Woodland is situated. (See cases above cited, particularly <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thayer.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">I have carefully examined the brief filed here by counsel <em>amici curiae. </em>It is unnecessary to review in detail the arguments and authorities presented therein. It is enough to say that most of the points made in said brief are in' effect answered in the foregoing views of the vital questions submitted by this proceeding. It may be remarked, however, that many of the cases cited by counsel in the brief referred to have no application to the case at bar. The eases referred to have to do with legislation purporting to control, as a police regulation, businesses which are in themselves legitimate, and which, though subject to the police power, are essential to the well-being of society and which can neither be suppressed nor so regulated as that unjust, burdensome, or discriminatory conditions may be imposed upon them or the right to conduct them. For instance, the slaughter house, the cemetery, and other like eases, cited by counsel as <em>amici cu\u00f1ae, </em>obviously deal with occupations in which people have the inherent right to engage, because they are, unlike the liquor traffic, necessary and useful; yet they are of a character that, unless managed in a proper way, they may become a source of great injury to the comfort and health of communities. Therefore, as stated, the state, in the exercise of its powers of police, may regulate the manner of their management so as to prevent, as far as possible, the injurious results to others which are known to come from the prosecution of such occupations; but, as declared, such regulations can neither be prohibitory nor discriminatory in their effect, as is true, in my opinion, as to legislation affecting the liquor traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>I think, for the reasons herein \u00a1stated, that the respondents have jurisdiction of the proceeding of which complaint is here made, and the order to show cause is, therefore, discharged and the writ dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Chipman, P.
