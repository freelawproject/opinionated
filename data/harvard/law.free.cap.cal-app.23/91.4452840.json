The statement of the case before us contains no specification nor attempted specification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of the particulars in which it is claimed that the evidence is insufficient to justify the findings and decision. This being so, the settled statement of the case could not be rightfully resorted to in the court below upon the hearing of the motion for a new trial in so far as the insufficiency of the evidence to support the findings is concerned; nor can this court resort to such statement either upon the appeal from the judgment or the order denying a new trial, for the purpose of determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings. <em>(Winterburn </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>91 Cal. 170-185, [27 Pac. 658]; <em>Matter of Baker, </em>153 Cal. 537, 542, [96 Pac. 12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The findings, assuming them to be correct\u2014as we must\u2014 fully support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Kerrigan, J., and Richards, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
