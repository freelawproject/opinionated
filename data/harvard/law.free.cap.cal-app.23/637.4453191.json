The return shows that said child is in the custody of the probation officer by virtue of a commitment issued out of said juvenile court which is based upon a petition praying that said child be taken into custody as a dependent child. No facts such as are required by the statute to constitute said child a dependent child are stated in the petition. The order was made without jurisdiction, and said Richard Watts Burner is hereby ordered to be discharged from the custody of such probation officer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
