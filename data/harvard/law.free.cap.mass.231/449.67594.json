L. c. 209, \u00a7 1.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b473-13\">The \u201cintent to injure or defraud\u201d which is included in the definition of forgery contained in R.

If the jury shall find that the reason for the actions of the defendant in making the alterations of the receipts put in evidence by the government was the request of Mr. Atteaux that he should so procure his money which was due him from the corporation that the repayment of the money to him should not disclose facts to an expert bookkeeper, which would result in an investigation of the disposition of the moneys which had been paid to Atteaux for the purposes of the business by the defendant and that the bookkeeper had been thrown off his guard, it is not evidence of an intent to defraud, because the said bookkeeper could not in that way be put to any loss whatever by the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>complained of, and if that were the reason and the jury should so find they- cannot find the defendant guilty of forgery because of the lack of intent to defraud.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">\u201cAs to the larceny counts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">\u201c2.

It is perfectly true that if one was in error even in regard to his right to procure money for the payment of a debt due him, and he acted improperly in regard to the matter and in the manner of procuring it, still if he honestly thought he had a right to the money, it must exclude the idea of a felonious taking.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">\u201c6.

Even if the jury should find that the defendant used altered receipts for the purpose of making false and fraudulent representations in order to obtain money which he believed to be absolutely his due and which was his due, and by that means obtained no more than was rightfully due him from the corporation, he cannot be convicted of larceny, for no man can have a fraudulent intent when he obtains no more than is actually due him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201c 10.

The nineteenth count charges him \u25a0with the larceny of $2,200, and twenty-four counts are \"for forgery, uttering. and larceny in relation to the other eight- occurrences. The facts with reference to these last, as proved by the Commonwealth and admitted by the defendant in his testimony, are substantially these: Peakes was the treasurer of F. E. Atteaux and Company, Incorporated, a corporation organized in Massachusetts in 1914, to take over the business of a similar corporation organized in 1900 under the laws of New Jersey. The corporation (by which we refer to both the present concern and its predecessor). was a manfacturer and importer of dyestuffs and chemicals. The defendant, in the eight transactions referred to, obtained from the company\u2019s cashier a check signed in blank by her, telling her that he was going to the bank to buy exchange to send to a foreign customer, and that on learning what the exchange would cost he would fill in the check for that amount and return with a receipt. As matter of fact he filled in the checks for larger amounts, cashed them, and retained for himself the excess over what the exchange cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The defendant concealed his appropriation of his employer\u2019s money by many acts that were calculated to deceive the bookkeepers, auditors and others. The receipts which the bank gave him, showing payment of the foreign drafts he purchased, were raised by him to the amount for which he had filled in 'the corporation\u2019s checks, either by altering the figures on the bank\u2019s receipt, or by inserting items indicating that additional drafts had been purchased. In the alterations he simulated the handwriting and the ink of the originals. He dictated letters which were supposed to accompany the exchange drafts that he pretended to have bought, and then destroyed the letters, leaving copies on the files, but sending others in their place. He removed from the files acknowledgments received from the foreign creditors. And he caused fictitious invoices to be entered on the accounts of these creditors in the corporation\u2019s books, to avoid the appearance of overpayment. As to the nineteenth count for the larceny of $2,200: After purchasing with the corporation\u2019s check two drafts for ten thousand francs each, he sent but one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>(although the books and correspondence indicated that he sent both), sold the other to a trust company and appropriated the proceeds after deceiving the cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The defendant testified substantially as follows: that in 1905, while he was treasurer, a shortage was discovered in certain accounts of the corporation, and that he was accused as the person responsible for it; that, although he did not in fact take any money, and was not permitted to examine the books to learn what the shortage represented, he agreed to pay to the corporation the sum of $21,000; that thereupon he paid over money he had saved, conveyed his real estate and borrowed funds wherewith to pay this sum, the last payment being made in 1909; that Atteaux, the president of the corporation, orally agreed that, if he (Peakes) would pay in this money and so prevent an investigation of the books, the corporation would repay him; that in 1914, after reminding Atteaux of this agreement and being told that what he should take to repay himself must not show on the books, he began to take these sums of money; that he had paid himself \"somewhere about $16,000,\u201d but had no memorandum of the amount and had destroyed his check books. He testified that he believed the corporation owed him the money; that he thought Atteaux, the president, had a right to agree that this money should be repaid to him; and that he only intended to carry out the arrangement made with Atteaux in repaying himself what he believed was due to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The principal contention of the defendant is that the presiding judge erred in the instructions he gave and in Ihe refusal to give certain rulings requested on the issue of his criminal intent. Apparently his claim is, that if he took the money in payment of a debt which the corporation owed him and acted under an honest belief that he had a legal right to resort to the methods shown by the evidence, he could not be found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Plainly there was no error in charging the jury that the defence fail\u00e9d if there was no debt due to the defendant from the corporation. That was the very basis of his present claim of supposed right to appropriate the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Even assuming that, the jury believed the unsupported and contradicted testimony of the defendant as to the alleged indebtedness of the corporation to him for the money he had paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>as restitution between 1905 and 1909, that would afford him no legal justification for the fraudulent alteration of the receipts for foreign drafts issued by the bank. The description of these receipts in the indictment as \u201can accountable receipt for money\u201d seems appropriate, especially as copies of them were set forth in the specifications filed by the Commonwealth, which must be read in connection with the indictment. R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 39. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>205 Mass. 128, 145. The false making or altering of such instruments would, constitute forgery, within the definition of the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawless, </em>101 Mass. 32. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boutwell, </em>129 Mass. 124. R. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1. See R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 22. The \u201cintent to injure or defraud,\u201d referred to in the statute establishing the penalty for forgery (R. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1) is a general intent to defraud any one. R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 30. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>120 Mass. 358. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Segee, </em>218 Mass. 501, 504. As to uttering see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>188 Mass. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The defendant admitt\u00e9d that in making the alterations in the receipts from the bank he intended to deceive the cashier and the auditor; the alterations and additions affected the liability of the bank by making it appear that it had obligated itself to transmit a larger sum in foreign money than it had contracted to do and had received a corresponding amount of current funds. R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 38. The inevitable effect of the defendant\u2019s acts, knowingly and designedly committed, was to \u201cinjure or defraud,\u201d and the inference of intent to defraud is necessarily drawn from those acts. His \u201cbelief\u201d that he had a right to resort to forgery and otherjllegal acts in collecting a debt which he claimed the corporation owed him, does not deprive the forgery of its criminal character, nor excuse its commission. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tenney, </em>97 Mass. 50, 59. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>118 Mass. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Manifestly the alleged authorization by Atteaux would not purge the defendant\u2019s acts of their criminality. He could not as president or stockholder of F. E. Atteaux and Company, Incorporated, authorize the defendant fraudulently to forge or alter the receipts of the bank. See <em>England </em>v. <em>Dearborn, </em>141 Mass. 590; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taintor, </em>11 Blatchf. C. C. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">What we have said with reference to the counts charging the defendant with forgery and uttering are largely applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the defendant\u2019s contention under the larceny counts, that he acted under a claim of right and' with an honest purpose. The statute provides that \u201cWhoever steals, or, with intent to defraud, obtains by a false pretence, or whoever unlawfully and, with intent to steal or embezzle, converts or secretes with intent to convert, the money or personal chattel of another, whether such money or personal chattel is or is not in his possession at the time of such conversion or secreting, shall be guilty of larceny. . . .\u201d R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 26. The defendant knowingly and designedly obtained the money of the corporation, whose treasurer he was,'by the use of forged receipts and other wrongful acts. The principle in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffy, </em>126 Mass. 467, on which he relies, goes no further than this: \u201cthat if the sole purpose of a false pretence is to procure from the person deceived the performance of a duty owed by that person to the prisoner, like the payment of a liquidated debt which is in fact due, there is no intention to defraud.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>183 Mass. 461, 466. The McDuffy case is not applicable here, where the alleged debt was not created by any one authorized to bind the corporation, was designedly kept off its books, was tainted with fraud in its origin, and apparently was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The charge of the presiding judge was more favorable than the defendant was entitled to in stating, \u201cIf the defendant did the acts here, which would otherwise constitute the crimes of forgery, or uttering a forged instrument, or larceny, if the defendant here in good faith honestly did the acts charged without any intent on his part to injure or defraud, then the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.\u201d The criminal intent involved in the charge was an intent to deprive the corporation permanently of its money. The defendant was guilty of larceny on the . evidence, even though the motive which induced him to steal from his employer was the payment of a debt which he claimed to be due him, and even though he believed his conduct was justified. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>8 Gray, 492. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>105 Mass. 163. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Ohio St. 219. <em>Fort </em>v. <em>State, </em>82 Ala. 50. <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Spurgeon, </em>2 Cox C. C. 102. <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>3 Cox C. C. 245. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U. S. 145. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>11 Blatchf. C. C. 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The exceptions to the admission and exclusion of evidence may be disposed of briefly. The question to the defendant on cross-examination, whether he intended to make the stenographer believe he was going to send the letter that he dictated to her (and later destroyed) was competent as tending to show that he was acting with a fraudulent intent, and not honestly, as he claimed. The offer to prove, by the cashier of the Waltham National Bank, that the bank had held certain notes which were signed by the defendant and indorsed by F. E. Atteaux, was excluded rightly. The notes were not produced in court, and the witness stated that he did not know Atteaux\u2019s signature. The application for a fidelity bond, made by the defendant, and purporting to be signed by one Stuart, the vice president of the corporation, was offered for the purpose of contradicting the witness Atteaux. It is enough to say that the document was not signed by Atteaux.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The defendant has shown no error in the conduct of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
