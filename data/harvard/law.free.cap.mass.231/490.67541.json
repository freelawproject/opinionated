Did the American Surety Company, on December 17,1914, ratify the action of the plaintiff in extending the time for completion of the building from November 1, 1914, to Christmas, 1914?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">\u201c2. Did the plaintiff himself, or by his attorney or architect, contract with the Hancock Engineering Company for extras in excess of the sum of $287.50?\u201d The jury answered \u201cNo.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">\u201c3. \"What was the amount reasonably necessary to complete the house according to plans and specifications, including liens paid by the plaintiff?\u201d The jury answered, \u201c$4,610.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-9\">\u201c4.

The time was extended, in other words, from November to Christmas, and it is not claimed that at the time it was done the surety company knew of and assented to it. It is claimed that subsequently, to wit, on December 17, the surety company through its officers who have appeared here was notified of the change knew of the change and knowing of it ratified the change.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-3\">\u201cIf Mr. Philbrick, or the other officer at that interview, in substance told the parties, Mr. Clark, and the plaintiff, to go home and finish the building and the insurance company would pay the bills, or if the representative of the company used words the natural import of which was to indicate that they agreed to be responsible for any demand on any bills given in finishing that building, then they ratified the extension for all time. It must be presumed that they knew that the date was down on the contract as November 1. If they made any such agreement as that in the middle of December, six weeks or more after the contract ought to have been completed and they knew the contract had not been completed by November 1 and with that knowledge, if they made such an agreement, they must be bound by it as a ratification of something which the plaintiff and the defendant could not hold the company to unless ratified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\">\u201cYou have a right to determine, then, from the testimony of these various witnesses as to what took place, as to what was said at that interview and whether or not a true and fair and reasonable construction of what was said at that time consisted of such a ratification, the burden being upon the plaintiff to satisfy you there was such a ratification.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">The defendant surety excepted to the part of the judge\u2019s charge quoted above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff against the defendant surety in the sum of $2,875, the penal sum of the bond, and returned a verdict against the principal on the bond in the sum of $3,275.93.

A bond was given to the owner for the faithful performance of the contract, with the contractor .as principal and the American Surety Company of New York as surety. The condition was that, if the contractor should indemnify the owner against all loss or damage \u201cdirectly arising by reason of the failure\u201d of the contractor to perform faithfully the building contract, the bond was to be void, \u201cotherwise to remain in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">The contract was dated June 22, 1914. By its terms the house was to be completed November 1, 1914. Without the knowledge of the surety, by agreement of the owner and contractor the time for completion was extended to Christmas, 1914. The surety asked the judge to instruct the jury \u201cThat there was no evidence of any waiver by any person authorized to make a waiver for the defendant, the American Surety Company\u201d and \u201cThat upon all the evidence there was no waiver by this defendant.\u201d The jury, in answer to a question, found that on December 17, 1914, the surety ratified \u201cthe action of the plaintiff in extending the time for completion of the building from November 1, 1914, to Christmas, 1914,\u201d and returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The obligation assumed by the surety was that the contractor should complete the building on the first of November, 1914. The extension of time to Christmas, 1914, was a substantial change in the contract and as modified it was not the contract for the faithful performance of which the surety bound itself. The agreement for the extension without its knowledge or consent, discharged the surety. <em>Greely </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>2 Met. 176. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Boylston Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. 5 </em>Met. 439. <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>15 Gray, 173. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>152 Mass. 310. There was no evidence that the surety knew of the modification in the contract extending the time of its performance, either when the change was made or subsequently thereto, before the action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The plaintiff in his brief contends that the time stipulation of the contract was waived, and to show this he relies on certain statements made December 17, 1914, by Philbrick and Roberts, representatives of the American Surety Company. At that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the plaintiff and his attorney met Philbrick and Roberts at the office of the American Surety Company of New York, in Boston. The plaintiff testified that at this interview Philbrick and Roberts were .told \"the Hancock Engineering Company had failed and that now they wanted the company to complete the house,\u201d to which Philbrick said, \"We will not finish the building, why don\u2019t you people go ahead \u2014 go ahead and finish \u2014 you have that right and produce the bills for us.\u201d Although the surety knew that the contractor had not performed its contract, there is nothing in the conversation or in any of the evidence to show that when this conversation took place 'the surety knew that the contract had been altered and the time for performance'had been extended; indeed, there was evidence that the defendant was ignorant of this fact until the time of trial. Assuming, but not deciding, that the \u2019representatives of the surety were authorized to waive the terms of the original contract and bind the surety by a new and different agreement from the one stipulated in the bond, there is nothing disclosed in the record to indicate such a waiver.' To constitute a waiver there must be knowledge of the right which is claimed to have been waived. <em>George N. Pierce Co. </em>v. <em>Beers, </em>190 Mass. 199, 205. When the owner agreed with the contractor to extend the time for performance beyond November 1, the .surety was discharged, and it did not waive the right to rely on this discharge without knowledge of the facts. Even if we assume that all the other elements of waiver are present, there is no evidence to show that the surety knew the time had been extended; nor did the facts disclose anything from which an inference could be drawn that it had knowledge of the modification and change in thccontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\">Without intimating that the surety could be held to have ratified, the agreement made by the owner and the contractor for their own benefit and convenience, (see, in this connection, <em>New England Dredging Co. </em>v. <em>Rockport Granite Co. </em>149 Mass. 381, 382,) it is enough to say that when the principle of ratification is applicable in order to becom\u00e9 effective it must appear that the ratifier had full knowledge of the essential facts of the act or contract to be ratified. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>12 Allen, 487. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>153 Mass. 510, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">As the case was tried in the Superior Court and on the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tians before us, it is unnecessary to consider the effect of article seven of the building contract, providing for an extension of time if the contractors were delayed in the prosecution of the work through the fault of the owner, the architect, or other contractors employed by the owner, for a period fixed by the architect, if the claim is presented in writing within forty-eight hours after the delay. Nor is it important to pass upon the bearing of article five of this contract, or on the first condition of the bond, requiring notice to the surety within ten days after knowledge of the default of the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The only questions open on this bill of exceptions are these: Was there any evidence for the jury that the surety ratified the action of the plaintiff in extending the time, and should the surety\u2019s request that there was no waiver have been given. In submitting to the jury the question of the ratification and in refusing the surety\u2019s request, there was error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">We do not deem it necessary to discuss the question raised by the plaintiff in his brief, that no written motion was made by the surety to direct a verdict in its favor. The request of the defendant surety, that on all the evidence there was no waiver, should have been given and the instructions to the jury were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
