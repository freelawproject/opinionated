L. c. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14. The probate decree is alleged to have been entered on December 11, 1916. The record does not show when this, petition was filed. See <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>229 Mass. 508. No evidence is reported. There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the findings of the single justice that the petition was pot filed within the time allowed by \u00a7 14 of the statute, and that the petitioner has not brought himself within the provisions of \u00a7 13. These were pure questions of fact, which cannot be reviewed in the absence of a report of the evidence. There is no support whatever in the record for the contention of the petitioner that the case was not before the single justice for a hearing on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\"><em>Decree denying petition </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
