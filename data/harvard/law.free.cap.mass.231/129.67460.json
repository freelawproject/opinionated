Lavery and Francis W. Lavery, paid to the plaintiff the sum of six thousand (6,000) dollars in accordance-with the terms and conditions of their said agreement [mentioned in the opinion] and said sum of six thousand (6,000) dollars was taken, accepted and received by the plaintiff under and by virtue of said agreement, but the plaintiff, in violation of its said agreement, refused to cause an entry of judgment satisfied to be made in the said action of the plaintiff against Francis W. Lavery and John W. Lavery; that said action went to judgment on the first Monday of June, 1915, and has been satisfied by the receipt and acceptance by the plaintiff of said sum of six thousand (6,000) dollars, according to said agreement and that said satisfaction is a bar to the action now pending between the parties hereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-19\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Hitchcock, </em>J., without a jury. The bill of exceptions contained the following; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>statement: \u201cTo expedite the trial of said action, it was agreed by the counsel for the parties in open court that for the purposes of this case all the allegations contained in the defendant\u2019s amended answer are to be taken as true and to be so considered by the court, and in this agreement the court acquiesced. No other evidence was offered except the promissory note, a copy of which is annexed to the plaintiff\u2019s substitute declaration, which note bears the indorsements \u2018Francis W; Lavery\u2019 and \u2018John W. Lavery &amp; Son\u2019 as alleged in the defendant\u2019s amended answer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-3\">The judge refused to rule at the request of the defendant that the action could not be maintained, and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $663.65. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-5\"><em>H.

Lavery &amp; Son,\u201d caused the note to be protested at maturity for non-payment. The note remaining unpaid, the plaintiff on January 8, 1914, brought suit against the defendant and on February 18, 1914, began another action against John W. Lavery and Francis W. Lavery as indorsers to recover the face of the note with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum from October 12, 1913. While the actions were pending the plaintiff agreed in writing that, upon payment by the indorsers on or before a certain date of the face of the' note, it would accept the amount in full satisfaction of all demands, and that an entry should be made in the second case of judgment satisfied. A verdict by order of the court and agreement of parties was subsequently returned for $6,510.04, and the case was continued for judgment to June 7, 1915, the date named in the agreement. The indorsers on that day paid to the plaintiff the amount agreed upon which \u201cwas taken, accepted and received by the plaintiff under and by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of said agreement.\u201d But the plaintiff \u201crefused to cause an entry of judgment satisfied to be made,\u201d and prosecuted its action, which is the ease at bar, under a \u201csubstitute declaration\u201d whereby it sought to recover the unpaid interest from the date of maturity of the note to the date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It is plain upon these material facts that the presiding judge, instead of finding and ordering judgment for the plaintiff for the amount demanded, should have ruled as requested by the defendant, that the action could not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The maker and indorsers by the tenor of the note having been under no contractual obligation therefor, interest was not recoverable except as damages for non-payment of the principal, and, when the plaintiff accepted the principal in full payment, the right to recover the interest either against the indorsers or the maker was extinguished. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>9 Pick. 368, 388. <em>Whitcomb </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>217 Mass. 558, 565. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>160 Mass. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">It follows that the exceptions must be sustained and judgment should be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
