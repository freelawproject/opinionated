Swift, late of Beverly, against the city of Lowell, for the sum of $9,540 paid under protest by the plaintiffs as a tax and alleged to have been assessed illegally because no trustee or beneficiary of the trust resided in Lowell. Writ dated November 13, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Chase, </em>J., without a jury. The question at issue and the essential evidence are stated or described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant filed a motion asking the judge to rule that upon all the evidence the finding should be for the defendant. The judge denied the motion. The defendant then asked the judge to make, among others, the following findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-13\">\u201c3. The plaintiff Bailey\u2019s domicil in 1916 was in the city of Lowell and he was properly taxed by the board of assessors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>\u201c4. </em>The plaintiff Bailey\u2019s domicil on April 1, 1916, was in the city of Lowell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-3\">The judge refused to make either of these findings, and found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $9,897.75. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVg\"><em>W. D. </em>Regan, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-5\"><em>F. Hutchinson &amp; P. B.

Bailey testified to facts which showed that his domicil was in Greenfield. It is manifest from the general finding in favor of the plaintiffs that the judge believed this testimony. The credibility of this evidence was wholly for the determination of the trial judge. Therefore there was no error of law in the refusal to make the findings requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"ADf\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
