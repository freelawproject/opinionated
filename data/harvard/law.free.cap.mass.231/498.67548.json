The driver presented this order to the brewery and received the beer described in it. He then \u201cplaced upon the various cases and packages\u201d tags of the dealer on which were written the names and addresses of the various customers to whom the beer was to be delivered. Under the terms of his employment the driver \u201cwas required to collect the price of the liquor on delivery, and, in the event of failure to collect the price, to withhold delivery and to return the merchandise to the\u201d dealer. In an action, in which the validity of the contract of employment of the driver was involved, these facts appeared by the record, and it was assumed by the parties that the sales of the packages of liquor delivered in Boston were lawful. <em>It seems, </em>that this assumption was wrong, as a license authorizes a^sale on the premises described in it and the premises described in the dealer\u2019s fourth class license were its place of business owned by it; and on the facts stated above it did not appear that the sales in Boston were made on the premises of the dealer described in its license.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-12\">Contract upon the bond printed below, against the defendant O\u2019Neill as principal and the defendant Noonan as surety, alleging that the defendant O\u2019Neill was employed'by the plaintiff as a driver and collector and that he committed a breach of the bond by failing to account for certain packages of\u2019 property of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>plaintiff received by him.

The condition of the bond is that \u201csaid Patrick William O\u2019Neill, who is about to be employed by said Boylston Bottling Company, shall render a faithful account of all merchandise delivered to him aid money collected by him and shall return all packages received by him from the company or account to the company for the value of any not so returned.\u201d The breach alleged is that O\u2019Neill \u201c received from the plaintiff ten hundred and sixty-four dozen bottles of the value of thirty cents a dozen and three hundred and sixty-one cases of the value of forty cents apiece, for which he has failed to account.\u201d The surety on the bond pleaded <em>(inter alla) </em>that, \u201cif it shall appear that the principal upon the bond, . . . ever did any of the things set out in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, that the same were done or performed under contract in violation of the laws of this Commonwealth.\u201d At the trial the judge refused to rule \u201cthat upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover\u201d and reported the case to the Appellate Division of the Municipal Court. The Appellate Division directed that the report be dismissed and from that order the surety took the appeal which is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">We agree with the plaintiff that in deciding the question before us (whether as matter of law the plaintiff was not entitled to\" recover) the evidence favorable to the defendant must be laid on one side. The surety\u2019s contention is that on the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence O\u2019Neill (the principal defendant) as matter of law was employed for a single sum to do work which was illegal in part; that for this reason the whole employment was illegal and that as a result the law will leave the parties where it finds them. If this be so, the ruling asked for ought to have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">It is stated in the report \u201cthat the plaintiff employed O\u2019Neill to deliver intoxicating liquor sold by it in Roxbury and in Brook-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>line and agreed to pay him for his services in that connection the sum of $60 a week.\u201d It is further stated that \u201cthe defendant O\u2019Neill was the holder of a license from the selectmen of the town of Brookline, under which he was permitted as an expressman to make deliveries of intoxicating liquor in Brookline.\u201d It must be taken that this license was granted to O\u2019Neill under St. 1906, c. 421, and the acts in amendment of that statute. From this it follows that on this record it must be taken that Brookline was a no-license town.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201cIt appeared that the plaintiff was engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquor on Lamartine Street in the city of Boston under a license of the fourth class issued by the licensing board of the city of Boston.\u201d The surety\u2019s contention is that the contract between the plaintiff and O\u2019Neill by which \u201cthe plaintiff employed O\u2019Neill to deliver intoxicating liquor sold by it in Roxbury and in Brookline\u201d was an illegal contract so far as it provided for the delivery of \u201cintoxicating liquor sold by it [the plaintiff] ... in Brookline\u201d and that the consideration paid O\u2019Neill being an undivided sum ($60 a week for all his services) the contract was an illegal one although the delivery of liquors sold in Boston was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">It is established that a party to an illegal contract will be left by the law where the law finds him. A collection of authorities on that point is not necessary. For a' recent case in which the proposition is well stated and a collection of some of the authorities is made, see <em>Pelosi </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>217 Mass. 579. It is also established that a contract for a single consideration is wholly void if that single consideration is paid in part for an illegal act. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>146 Mass. 469. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>196 Mass. 592. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>151 Mass. 118. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>104 Mass. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The answer of the plaintiff to this contention is, that \u201cthere is no evidence that the goods referred to in the declaration were delivered to O\u2019Neill for transportation to points in Brookline and not to points in Boston.\u201d The objection which the plaintiff has to meet is, that O\u2019Neill was employed for a single sum in part \u201cto deliver intoxicating liquor sold by it [the plaintiff]' ... in Brookline\u201d and that that part of the employment being illegal and the consideration being single the whole contract is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s next contention is that this case comes within the established rule that where money is placed by A and B in the hands of a stakeholder to be paid over to the winner of a bet between A and B, A or B can revoke the stakeholder\u2019s authority before the money is paid over and recover from the stakeholder the money paid him by the person revoking the stakeholder\u2019s authority. This is established by the cases of <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>117 Mass. 558, and <em>McKee </em>v. <em>Manice, </em>11 Cush. 357. Those cases go on the ground that the payment of the money to the stakeholder in such a case is not an illegal transaction and that so long as the matter is executory and the money has not been paid over either party can revoke the authority to pay the money in the illegal way theretofore authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\">The plaintiff has also placed great reliance on the case of <em>Bone </em>v. <em>Ekless, </em>5 H. &amp; N. 925. The decision in that case went on the same ground. In that case the plaintiff had sold a vessel to the Turkish government for \u00a36,500 under an authority from the defendant to pay \u00a35Q0 of the purchase money as a bribe to certain Turkish officials to secure the sale to the Turkish government. Later the plaintiff sued the defendant for the sum of \u00a3426 due from the defendant to him and the defendant pleaded in set-off that of the \u00a36,500 received by the plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s use he had paid over to them \u00a36,000 and that he had paid in bribes \u00a3300, but that he had kept in his own pocket the remaining \u00a3200. To this the plaintiff answered that he had promised to pay the \u00a3200 (which he kept) as a bribe to an official of the Turkish government, although he had not yet paid it over. The court held that the \u00a36,500' received by the plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s money and that the defendant had a right to revoke the plaintiff\u2019s authority to pay over as a bribe the \u00a3200 which he had not paid over. This conclusion was reached on the ground on which it is held in this Commonwealth that the authority of a stakeholder to pay the money deposited with him to the winner of a bet can be revoked so long as the matter is executory and the money has not been paid over. The sale of the ship in <em>Bone </em>v. <em>Ekless </em>was not an illegal transaction although it had been procured by fraud and so could have been avoided by the Turkish government. The illegal transaction there in question consisted in the payment of the \u00a3500 as bribes. But in the case at bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>O\u2019Neill\u2019s employment was an illegal one. It was an illegal one because he was employed in part to deliver liquor sold in violation of law and was paid a single sum for all his services. It is not necessary to examine in detail the cases in other jurisdictions which have been cited. . If they go beyond this they are not law in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We have decided the case at bar on the footing on which it was argued. But a word must be added to prevent its being misunderstood. The case was argued on the footing that the sales made in Boston were legal. On the record it would seem that ,they were illegal. It is stated in the report that \u201cthe employment [of O\u2019Neill by the plaintiff] was carried out in the following manner.\u201d The plaintiff recorded on its books at its store on Lamartine Street all \u201corders for liquor\u201d received by it. It delivered to O\u2019Neill a written order on Haffenreffer and Company (\u201ca brewery located in the city of Boston, which furnished the plaintiff with beer\u201d) for the beer necessary to fill these orders. O\u2019Neill then drove with his truck to the brewery, presented this order to it and received from it the beer called for. He then \u201cplaced upon the various cases and packages\u201d tags (bearing the name and address of the plaintiff) on which there was written the name and address of the customer to whom the beer was to be delivered. \u201cO\u2019Neill also entered in a book which he kept for the purpose the date of reception, a transcript of the marks on the packages and the dates of delivery of the liquor which he so received and delivered. Under the terms of his employment, O\u2019Neill was required to collect the price of the liquor on delivery, and, in the event of failure to collect the price, to withhold delivery and to return the merchandise to the plaintiff.\u201d The beer so sold by the plaintiff was not sold on the premises owned by the plaintiff \u201con Lamartine Street\u201d and it must be taken on the record that the premises described in the plaintiff\u2019s fourth class license were its premises on Lamartine Street. A license authorizes a sale on the premises described in it. A sale by the person licensed made elsewhere than on the premises described in the license is not protected by it and is an illegal sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The result is that the.order dismissing the report must be reversed and judgment entered for the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
