McCarthy; late of Boston, who was employed as a helper on a wagon of Rueter and Company, Incorporated, for the death of the employee from tuberculosis on February 2, 1915, alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>resulted from an injury received by him on September 14, 1914, which aggravated and accelerated the disease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The case was heard by McLaughlin, J. It appeared by the \u2022report of the Industrial Accident Board that the arbitration committee found, \"Upon all the evidence, that the personal injury received by the employee on September 14, 1914, had no causal relation to his death by reason of a condition of acute miliary tuberculosis on February 2, 1915, and therefore dismissed the claim for compensation filed by his widow.\u201d At the hearing before the Industrial Accident Board no new evidence was introduced, the case being considered by the board upon the facts reported by the arbitration committee. The character of that evidence is described in the opinion. The board, having reviewed the evidence as reported to them, affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the arbitration committee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">The judge made a decree in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Accident Board; and the dependent widow appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-8\"><em>B.

The only question in that connection is whether there is any evidence to support the decision. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51. <em>Moran\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 500. <em>Knight\u2019s Case, ante, </em>142.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The crucial question in the case at bar was, whether any causal connection was shown between the disease known as acute miliary tuberculosis, which resulted fatally to the employee on February 2, 1915, and the abrasions on his leg and foot, received in the course of and arising out of his employment on the fourteenth of the preceding September. The record shows that while there was some testimony tending to show that there was such connection, there was other testimony tending to show that there was no such connection. Its weight and credibility were for the Industrial Accident Board. The decision of the board in favor of the insurer has ample support in the evidence and cannot be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
