The facts in favor of the plaintiff which could have been found upon the evidence are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant made a motion asking the judge to order a verdict for it. The judge denied the motion.

Upon all the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-10\">\u201c2.

If the jury find that the plaintiff looked in the direction of B Street while on the sidewalk, in front of her house, and while walking on the sidewalk approximately half way toward the Polish Church, and then left the sidewalk without looking again and walked half way across the street paying no attention to a team that might be coming toward her and was stfuek by the team when she was in the middle of the road, they cannot find that she was in the exercise of due care.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-14\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $960.

They were warranted in finding that at about half past six o\u2019clock in the morning she started to cross Fifth Street in South Boston, from her home to the church; that after stepping from the northerly sidewalk she stopped, looked to her right and left,'and no vehicle was in sight; that she proceeded slowly across the street, in a slightly diagonal course, for a distance of fifteen feet or less; that meanwhile the defendant\u2019s delivery wagon, going very fast, turned into Fifth Street from B Street (which was less than two hundred feet distant); and although the driver saw the plaintiff with her back partly toward him, he made no effort to check the speed of the horse or to warn the plaintiff of his approach, \u2014\u25a0 and she was struck by the horse and run over. Plainly she was entitled to go to the jury on the issues of the defendant\u2019s negligence and her own due care) even regardless of St. 1914, c. 553. <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583. <em>Crimmins </em>v. <em>Armstrong Transfer Express Co. </em>217 Mass. 155. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>223 Mass. 179. She had a right to cross the street between cross walks, using due care. <em>Slee </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>162 Mass. 405.
