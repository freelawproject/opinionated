The plaintiff contended that a previous judgment of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston in favor of the plaintiff precluded the defendant from showing that the plaintiff had broken his contract before the date of that judgment. It appeared that the previous action was brought, seven months after the date of the contract of employment, upon an account annexed, the first three items being of $50 each for services rendered by the plaintiff as a salesman in three successive weeks, each of the last two weeks ending after the date of the writ, and the other items being for expenses. The judge of the Municipal Court had found that the plaintiff was discharged by the defendant without justification. He had ruled that the plaintiff could not recover on the two items for salary that became due after the date of the writ and had found for the plaintiff upon the first item for salary and for certain expenses. Judgment was entered in the Municipal Court for the plaintiff in accordance with this finding. <em>Held, </em>that this judgment was conclusive of the fact that the plaintiff had performed his contract up to the end of the week for which he was held to be entitled to his salary, and that the defendant in the action in the Superior Court was precluded from showing the contrary.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">Contract for the alleged breach of an agreement in writing to employ the plaintiff as salesman for one year from September 15, 1913, at a salary of $50 a week and all travelling and other reasonable expenses and a further compensation payable at the end of the term of two hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of the defendant of the par value of $10 a share.

By the terms of the contract the defendant agreed to employ the plaintiff as a salesman for one year from September 15, 1913, at a salary of $50 a week, and to pay his travelling and other reasonable expenses; and at the end of the year, upon full performance by the plaintiff, to assign and deliver to him two hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\">It is the contention of the plaintiff that a judgment recovered by him against^ the defendant in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston is <em>res judicata </em>upon the question whether the plaintiff performed the contract in accordance with its terms,, and whether a breach thereof was committed by the defendant. In other words, the question is, whether the judgment in the first action precludes the defendant from showing ini the case at bar that there was a breach of the contract by the plaintiff, and that the defendant did not wrongfully discharge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In order to determine that question it is necessary to consider what was properly tried in the action in the Municipal Court. It appears from the record that it was an action of contract upon an account annexed, \u2014 the first three items being $50 each for the weeks ending respectively April 11, 18 and 25, 1914, for services rendered by the plaintiff as a salesman, and the other items for travelling and other expenses, and credits given for cash received. The defendant\u2019s answer was a general denial and payment. The judge of the Municipal Corut properly ruled that the plaintiff could not recover upon the second and third items \u2014 as the writ was dated April 13, 1914, it is plain that the plaintiff could not recover for services rendered after that date \u2014and found for the plaintiff upon the first item and for certain expenses. Judgment was entered in accordance with the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Where services are rendered in accordance with the terms of a written contract of employment, the employee may maintain an action upon an account annexed for such services and expenses as are then due and payable. <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>112 Mass. 299, 308. In an action upon an account annexed the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff to show that he had performed the written contract in order that he might prevail. Under the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>eral denial it would have been competent for the defendant to have proved that the plaintiff hadxnot performed his part of the contract. <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Mandell, 125 </em>Mass. 562, 563. <em>Starratt </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>148 Mass. 570. <em>Wylie </em>v. <em>Marinofsky, </em>201 Mass. 583, 584. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>229 Mass. 467, 470. It would not be performance of his contract by the plaintiff for him so to conduct himself as would warrant his discharge by the defendant. The judge of the Municipal Court found that on April 11, 1914, the plaintiff was discharged by the defendant without justification; and that on April 13,1914, the action was brought. He also found that on April 11, the treasurer of the defendant company said to the plaintiff \u201cDalton you are discharged. You discharged yourself by leaving Pittsburg . . .;\u201d and that the plaintiff left Pittsburg and came to Boston on April 9 or 10, 1914. It is apparent that, if the defendant was justified in discharging the plaintiff, it would have, been a defence to the original action, and presented, an issue which could have been tried and adjudicated in that action. There is nothing to show that the defendant waived that defence. Upon this issue the judge of the Municipal Court found that on April 11, 1914, the plaintiff was discharged by the defendant without justification. The issue whether the plaintiff had performed his contract during the week ending April 11, 1914, was directly involved on the pleadings. That was a question which in law not only might have been tried but which the record shows was actually tried and adjudicated. Hence the rule of <em>ires judicata </em>must apply. <em>Foye </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>132 Mass. 105, 110, <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>160 Mass. 464. <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>193 Mass. 30. <em>Newburyport Institution for Savings </em>v. <em>Puffer, </em>201 Mass. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The exceptions to the refusal of the court to give the plaintiff\u2019s requests two, six, seven, twelve and thirteen,, must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"A6j\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
