The Industrial Accident Board found that the cause of the employee\u2019s death was conjectural and dismissed the claim. <em>Held, </em>that the finding of the board was one of fact which could not be set aside, there having been evidence to support it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">Appeal to the Superior Court under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 14, from a decision of the Industrial Accident Board dismissing the claim to compensation of Bertha H.

The deceased at the time of his death was in the employ of the town of North Attleborough, as a laborer, and had charge of a stone crusher owned and operated by the town. As a part of his duties, he was required to break stone into small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>pieces with a sixteen pound sledge hammer, \u2014 the broken pieces to be put into the crusher. At the time of the alleged injury he was breaking stone with the sledge hammer; he had struck several blows and was in the act of striking another, when he collapsed and fell to the ground, dying in about five minutes without regaining consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">It is the contention of the claimant that death was due to the strain of swinging the hammer causing an injury to the heart, which at that time was in a weakened condition from arteriosclerosis. The insurer contends that upon the evidence the cause of death was a matter of conjecture. This contention was sustained by the Industrial Accident Board on review of the report filed by the arbitration committee, a majority of whom had found that the employee\u2019s death was the result of an injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment, and the widow\u2019s claim for compensation was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The findings of the Industrial Accident Board, under the act, on all questions of fact are final and cannot be set aside-if there is any evidence to support them. St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 14. Whether the deceased received an injury which caused his death, and whether the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, were questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Upon the question whether the employee\u2019s death was due to the strain of swinging the heavy sledge hammer, thereby causing an injury to an already weakened and diseased heart, or was a matter of speculation and conjecture, the evidence was conflicting. Accordingly the finding of the board must stand. The case is governed in principle by <em>John T. Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 99, <em>Sanderson\u2019s Case, </em>224 Mass. 558, and similar cases. See also <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Glasgow &amp; South Western Railway, </em>1 B. W. C. C. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"Apg\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
