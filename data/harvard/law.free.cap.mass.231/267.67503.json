He refused to make certain rulings of law requested by the plaintiff, for the reason that it was not within his province to make such rulings. The plaintiff excepted to the master\u2019s report on the ground of his refusal to make such rulings. The rulings of law which the master refused to make as beyond his- province included rulings, that the alleged taking did not comply with the provisions of R. L. c. 28, \u00a7 2, and that the taking as made was illegal and void. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-8\">The case was heard by <em>Callahan, </em>J., upon the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s report and on the defendant\u2019s motion that the report of the master be confirmed. The judge made an interlocutory decree ordering that the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions be overruled and that the report be confirmed. He made a memorandum of decision as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-9\">\u201cI find and rule that the taking was illegal and void. The plaintiff is'entitled to a decree enjoining the defendant, its boards, commissions and all other agents and servants, from making or setting up any claim of right to or in the land in controversy by reason of the attempted taking, or exercising any dominion over the land, or interfering in any way with the plaintiff\u2019s use or enjoyment of the same; and ordering the defendant to execute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to the plaintiff a quitclaim deed of all right, title or interest in and to it which it ever claimed to have by reason of the attempted taking.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">Later the judge made a final decree in accordance with his memorandum of decision; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">The material part of R.

The case is here on an appeal from a decree in favor of the plaintiff. In their attempt to take the plaintiff\u2019s land the park commissioners of the defendant city reversed the order of proceeding laid down in the statute under which they undertook to act. The statute (R. L. c. 28, \u00a7 2) provides that no land shall be taken until an appropriation has been made. The park commissioners first undertook to take the plaintiff\u2019s land and afterward an appropriation was made by the defendant city. The defendant contends that the subsequent'appropriation made the previous taking a valid one. That contention is concluded by the decision of this court in <em>Lajoie </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>214 Mass. 8. The defendant would have us lay that decision on one side because the statutory requirement there in question was enacted for the direct benefit of the landowner. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>do not stop to consider whether the requirement of R. L. c. 28, \u00a7 2 (that the taking should not be made until the money had been appropriated) was not made in part for the benefit of the landowner. That fact is not of consequence. The doctrine on which <em>Lajoie </em>v. <em>Lowell </em>was decided is that the taking of property by eminent domain is an act <em>strictissivii juris </em>and is valid only when the statutory requirements are performed with exactness. When the railroad company in <em>Lajoie </em>v. <em>Lowell </em>attempted to take the plaintiff\u2019s land lying outside of its five rod location it had no jurisdiction to do so because it had not obtained permission from the county commissioners. After jurisdiction was obtained by the subsequent act of the county commissioners no taking was made. That doctrine applies in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">There is nothing in the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff has mistaken his remedy and should have brought a petition for certiorari. A taking which is invalid for lack of jurisdiction can be shown to be a nullity whenever it is set up in a court of law. See, .for example, <em>Lajoie </em>v. <em>Lowell, ubi supra; Whitten </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>204 Mass. 95. <em>A fortiori </em>such a taking can be made the subject of a bill to remove a cloud on title.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
