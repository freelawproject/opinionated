T. E. Libby, Treas.\u201d and February 5, 1915, it became operative as a contract when signed \u201cWheeler Condenser and Engineering Company, Approved, ... By Thos. Bostocke, Treas.\u201d The machinery referred to in the contract was shipped by the plaintiff to the defendant, was duly delivered, and it is admitted that the prices specified in the contract were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The contract provided that \u201cPayments [were] to be made in four months\u2019 notes bearing interest at 6% \u2014 notes to be secured by Purchasers\u2019 bonds held by and guaranteed by Liggett, Hitch-born &amp; Co. Inc.\u201d After the delivery of the machinery the purchaser sent the seller two notes, to cover the first payment of fifty per cent and the second payment of thirty per cent, and never sent a note to cover the remaining twenty per cent. It did not send with either note its bonds and the plaintiff has been unable to collect anything on the notes. It was admitted that no bonds of the Vinal Haven Electric Power Company were held by or guaranteed by Liggett, Hitchborn &amp; Co. Inc., at the time the contract was signed. The evidence would warrant a finding that no bonds were in existence when the contract was signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>or at the time when the notes were, and were to be, delivered to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We think the clause \"Payments to be made in four months\u2019 notes bearing interest at 6% \u2014 notes to be secured by Purchasers\u2019 bonds held by and guaranteed by Liggett, Hitchborn &amp; Co. Inc.\u201d as a matter of interpretation must be read connectively, and that, so read, they constitute a promise to have bonds \u201cheld by and guaranteed by Liggett, Hitchborn &amp; Co. Inc.\u201d ready for delivery to the plaintiff as security for the notes which were to be given by Vinal Haven Electric Power Company to the plaintiff, should the plaintiff \u201cwithin four weeks after approval of drawings\u201d furnish and deliver the machinery described in the schedule and specifications \u201cf. o. b. cars Carteret, N. J.\u201d It follows that when the contract became operative the quoted words cannot be construed to have been a representation that the bonds were then in physical existence, or, if so, that they then were held and guaranteed by Liggett, Hitchborn &amp; Co. Inc. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>C. A.
