Writ dated December 16, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-13\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Pana, </em>J. There was evidence that the defendant was a master stevedore who was performing a contract to unload a cargo of sugar from the steamship Gulf axe at the wharf of the American Sugar Refining Company in the part of Boston called South Boston, that the plaintiff had been appointed by the United States marshal for the district of Massachusetts custodian of the vessel for the marshal and was on board of the vessel in the performance of his duties as such custodian, when he was struck by four bags of sugar, that were being hoisted by the defendant\u2019s servants from the deck of the vessel to the wharf, and was jammed against the rail of the vessel, sustaining the injuries which resulted in his death sixteen days later.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-14\">At the close of the evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions, with a stipulation of the parties that, if this court \u201cshall decide that the action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Superior Court in ordering the verdict was right, final judgment pha.ll be entered for the defendant upon the verdict.

The defendant has undertaken to uphold the ruling of the presiding judge on the ground that to make out liability for conscious suffering the plaintiff had to prove reckless and wanton misconduct on the part of the defendant\u2019s servants and that he had to prove gross negligence to make out liability for death.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">At the time in question the Gulfaxe was in the custody of the United States marshal who had appointed the intestate his custodian. The defendant was a stevedore engaged in unloading the cargo of the steamship.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The defendant\u2019s contention as to the measure of the defendant\u2019s liability for conscious suffering is based on the assumption that the deceased was a licensee. But, if the deceased was a licensee of the owner of the Gulfaxe, that fact is immaterial in this action against the stevedore. <em>Boutlier </em>v. <em>Malden, 226 </em>Mass. 479. Even if the defendant had been the owner of the Gulfaxe and the intestate nothing but a licensee, the duty owed by the defendant in unloading the cargo would have been to use ordinary care. <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>Union Sugar Refinery, </em>98 Mass. 577. The truth is, however, that the defendant owed the intestate the duty of exercising due care in unloading the cargo for the same reason that one traveller on a public way owes another traveller on the way the duty of exercising due care not to injure him. In that case and in the case at bar both persons are rightly where they were. For the reasons stated the decision in <em>Kjaer &amp; Isdahl </em>v. <em>Etier, 222 </em>Fed. Rep. 243, has nothing to do with the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Since St. 1907, c. 375, amending R. L. c. 171, \u00a7 2, it is only necessary to show ordinary negligence to hold a defendant liable \u2022 for the death of a\u2018 person in the position, of the plaintiff. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of opinion that the jury could have found that the intestate was in the exercise of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\">It was stipulated that, if the presiding judge \u201cwas wrong in directing a verdict . . . , judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,500.\u201d That means that, if the plaintiff had a right to go to the jury on either count, judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,500. We are of opinion that the judge was wrong in case of both counts. It follows that judgment must be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
