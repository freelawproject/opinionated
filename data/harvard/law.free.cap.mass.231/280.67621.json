The buyer made the first two payments of $250 each, but the seller failed to deliver the motor hearse within the time required by the contract, whereupon the buyer rescinded the contract, cancelling his order and demanding back the $500 paid by him. In an action by the buyer against the seller to recover this sum, the defendant contended that the plaintiff was entitled to recover only $250, the $250 first paid having been forfeited under the terms of the contract. <em>Held, </em>that the contract was not susceptible of the construction contended for by the defendant, the meaning of the provision being that, if the order was not accepted, the money paid in advance would be refunded, but that, if the order was accepted and the buyer became bound to pay the stipulated price, the payment of $250 would be credited, leaving a balance, as stated, to be paid in cash and notes; and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the whole amount of $500 paid by him, the consideration for which had failed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Contract for $500 paid by the plaintiffs under a contract in writing for the purchase of a motor hearse.

The order was accepted by the defendant, and work was begun under it, but the motor hearse was not shipped to the plaintiffs on August 1, and had not been shipped to them by October 2,1917. On that date the plaintiffs wrote to the defendant cancelling the order. Considerable correspondence between the parties followed, and on October 17, 1917, an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ney wrote to the defendant on behalf of the plaintiffs, demanding the return of the $500 paid by them under the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-3\">The defendant introduced evidence that the motor hearse was finally completed the latter part of October, 1917, but the first intimation that it was ready for shipment was received by the plaintiffs in a letter from the defendant dated November 17,1917. The motor hearse finally was sold by the defendant after notice to the plaintiffs at a price $250 less than the contract price:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\">Under the clause in the contract providing that \u201cstrikes and other delays unavoidable or beyond your control will relieve you from the prompt fulfillment of this order,\u201d the defendant introduced evidence tending to show that the delay was caused, in the first place, because the motor required a particular kind of transmission, which was only made by a certain gear company, an independent contractor, that this company did not deliver transmissions as agreed, but was several months behind in its deliveries; that the particular type of transmission could not be obtained elsewhere, and that a different kind of make could not be used without altering the engine and rebuilding the entire hood of the car, entirely changing its appearance and causing more delay; and, in the second place, because of illness in the family of the body builder working upon this order which kept him from work about four weeks, and because it was impossible to hire a competent substitute in his place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">\u201c1. On all the evidence, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">' \u201c2. If the delay in delivery of the motor hearse was due to a cause unavoidable or beyond the control of the defendant, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-8\">\u201c3. By the terms of the contract, the defendant fully performed, if it was ready to deliver the hearse as soon as practicable after August 1 as the delays unavoidable or beyond its control would permit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-9\">\u201c4. The plaintiffs in any event are not entitled to recover the first payment of $250, which by the terms of the contract was to be returned only if the order was not accepted, the order having been accepted and the hearse having been built.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-10\">Upon these rulings, the judge made the following memorandum: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c 1st and 4th refused, 2d and 3d allowed as academic questions, but I do not find facts premised in the requests.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-3\">Thereupon the judge found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $500 with interest from October 17, 1917, and, at' the request of the defendant, reported the case to the Appellate Division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-4\">The Appellate Division ordered the clerk to make the following entry: \u201cFinding for the plaintiffs for $250 and interest thereon from October 17, 1917.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-5\"><em>A. D. Welch </em>of Maine, <em>(G. F. James </em>with him,) for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-6\"><em>L. C. Doyle, for </em>the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b308-7\">B raley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9L\">The evidence is not reported and, the questions of fact on which the first, second and third requests are predicated having been decided adversely to the defendant, nothing remained but the assessment of damages, the measure of which as presented by the fourth request is the only question raised on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The plaintiffs having advanced $500, which is the amount awarded by the trial judge, contend, that the decision of the Appellate Division, that only $250 could be recovered, should be reversed. The defendant is the vendor, and, because of its material failure in performance, the plaintiffs, in whom title to the motor hearse never vested, had the right to rescind. <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>136 Mass. 307, <em>Earnshaw </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>194 Mass. 187, 192, and cases cited. And the consideration having entirely failed, they are entitled to recover back the money paid on account of the contract price. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>112 Mass. 13. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Hatch Storage Battery Co. </em>186 Mass. 226, 230. <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Allis, </em>115 U. S. 363. The clause relating to the price and mode of payment reads as follows: \u201cA payment of Two Hundred &amp; Fifty dollars accompanies this order, which is to be returned only if the order is not accepted. Two Hundred &amp; Fifty Dollars in 30 Days. $500.00 dollars to be paid on arrival of said vehicle . . . and the balance in equal monthly notes of $150 each . . . with 6 per cent interest from date of arrival.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">It is urged by the defendant that the purpose of the \"preliminary payment was to guarantee this amount if the order after acceptance was subsequently cancelled by the plaintiffs. But the contract, the printed form of which in blank was furnished by the defendant, is not so worded, and the plaintiffs are not shown to have been in default. The whole clause means, If your order is not accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the money will be refunded, but if it is accepted you become bound to pay the stipulated price, and the money will be credited, leaving a balance, the amount of which is stated, to be paid in cash and notes. <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Moors, </em>168 Mass. 354, 360. The defendant having accepted the offer or proposal thereupon entered\" on the performance of a contract under which the amount in dispute was to be applied in part payment of the entire price. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>161 Mass. 496, 499. <em>Lennox </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>171 Mass. 370, 373. If the payment is treated as in the nature of liquidated damages for anticipated non-performance, the answer is that the plaintiffs have fully performed the agreement. If upon acceptance it is treated as in the nature of a forfeiture, they must be deemed to have intended to make a gift of the amount to the defendant. The plaintiffs moreover, who have acted in good faith, instead of being made whole will lose one half of their money, while the defendant, although cast in damages, obtains an equivalent pecuniary benefit or enrichment; a result not to be reached unless the express wording of the instrument admits of no other construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">The defendant also cites <em>International Text Book Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>221 Mass. 1, as decisive that this provision is to be deemed an independent covenant. But in that case the agreement expressly provided that when accepted it should not be subject to cancellation, and that in no event would the plaintiff, who had never made default, be required to refund any part of the money paid for the scholarship which he agreed and was ready to furnish.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We are of opinion for the reasons stated, that the decision of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the report of the trial judge should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
