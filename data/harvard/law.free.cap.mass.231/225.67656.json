It appeared that the autopsy revealed a septic condition of the left knee with general septicemia and also disclosed that the knee joint was the primary seat of the infection. There was medical testimony by members of the hospital staff, which, if accepted as conclusive, showed that the employee\u2019s condition did not arise from his injury but was attributable solely to the general septicemia in his system. But the testimony of the dependent widow and of the physician who attended the employee and arranged for his admission to the hospital warranted a finding that the blow from'the plank would be sufficient to cause the septic condition which followed it and resulted in his death. The Industrial Accident Board awarded \u2018 compensation and their award was confirmed by a decree of the Superior Court and, on appeal, it was <em>held </em>that this court could not say as matter of law that the finding of fact was wrong.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-11\">Appeal to the Superior Court under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 14, from a decision of the Industrial Accident Board awarding compensation to Mary A.

Mallory, received a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment, on April 17, 1917, that as a result of conditions due to the said injury of April 17, the employee died on April 21,1917; that the claimant, Mary A. Mallory, widow of the employee, lived with him at the time of his injury and death and that the said Mary A.

But it appears that a notice in writing as required by the statute was actually given to the insurer, the only possible error in which-was that the date of the accident was given as April 18 instead of April 17, and it is .unnecessary to consider the effect, if any, of any question of variance, for, the counsel for the insurer having expressly stated before the Industrial Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>cident Board that \u201che did not wish to raise any question as to the giving of the notice of the injury,\u201d it cannot when defeated contend for the first time in this court on appeal that the notice was insufficient. <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>4 Mass. 591. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>6 Cush. 560, 563. <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Boutwell, </em>1 Allen, 286, 287. <em>Oulighan </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>189 Mass. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The argument for reversal on the merits is, that there was no evidence warranting a finding that the deceased employee received an injury in the course of or arising out of his employment and that, the finding of the board having been based on mere conjecture, the decree awarding compensation to the widow must be reversed. We are not concerned with the weight of evidence or the credibility of witnesses, and the findings of fact in the report of the single member of the board which were affirmed and adopted on review must stand unless plainly unwarranted. <em>Herrick\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 111. The uncontroverted evidence recited in the report shows that the employee, a stock cutter, while carrying a plank from a pile of lumber in the mill yard to the saw where he worked dropped the plank on his foot, and on his own statements, which were admissible, and the evidence of his wife and of the physician who attended him before his removal to the hospital, it properly could be found that the blow injured the big toe of his left foot causing a ragged cut extending perhaps three quarters of an inch across the base of the nail from which blood oozed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">But, if the finding that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment is amply sustained, the further finding is, that the employee died of septicemia, or blood poisoning. It is upon this finding that the principal contention of the insurer rests, that the injury described was not the cause of the employee\u2019s' death. It was said in <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 495, \u201cThe substantial question is whether the diseased condition was the cause, or whether the employment was a proximate contributing cause.\u201d The narration of'his objective symptoms as given by his wife after he returned home on the day of the accident is, that both the toe and foot were swollen and \u201cturned a purplish red\u201d and the next day \u201cthe foot was puffed up; the toe, the foot and leg were puffed up to about the knee. It looked as if it were burst open. ... It was a dark color, a reddish purple, dark red.\u201d The physician who attended him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>arranged for his admission to the hospital where he died three or four days after the injury \u2022 substantially corroborated the evidence of the widow. It is argued that his injuries were insufficient to cause septicemia in so brief a period, and the autopsy revealed a septic condition of the left knee vfith general septicemia. It also disclosed that the knee joint which was found to be infiltrated with from three to four ounces of thin pus was the primary seat of the infection. If in connection with these apparently undisputed facts the question of the cause of death rested solely on the medical evidence of the hospital staff, the employee\u2019s condition did not arise from the injury, as he was then suffering from septic arthritis which had developed general septicemia in his system to which his death was solely attributable. The widow and claimant, however, was not conclusively bound by the evidence introduced by the insurer and, having presented evidence which warranted a finding that the blow from the plank would be sufficient to cause the septic conditions previously described and which caused his death, we cannot say as matter of law that the conclusion was wrong. <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 288, 289. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The rulings requested by the insurer were refused rightly and the decree sht\u00eduld be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
