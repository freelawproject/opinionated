Later the case was heard by <em>J. F. Brown, </em>J., who made a memorandum of decision as follows: \u201cIt not appearing that the Northern Brass Company, the mortgagor in the two mortgages in question, has acted in the matter or has been requested to act and has refused to act, I am of the opinion that these plaintiffs cannot maintain their bill. Let a decree be entered dismissing the bill with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-4\">Later by order of the judge a final decree was entered in accordance with the memorandum of decision dismissing the bill with costs. The plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b470-5\"><em>A.

The bill alleges that the meeting of the directors at which the mortgages were authorized was not a legal one, and that the mortgages as executed were not authorized by the votes that were passed. The trial judge dismissed the bill on the ground that the mortgagor, the Northern Brass Company, had not acted nor been requested to act in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The judge was right. The remedy should be sought and recovered by the corporation which suffered the wrong complained of. It does not appear that the plaintiffs have made any effort to obtain relief through the corporation itself, nor do they allege or prove a legal excuse for not-doing so. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>221 Mass. 530; <em>S. C. </em>226 Mass. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The plaintiff Boyajian also alleges that he. is a judgment creditor of the corporation. The bill was not demurred to as being multifarious. It appears from the master\u2019s report not only that Boyajian had full cognizance of and acquiesced in the execution of the mortgages in controversy, but that he obtained his judgment by misleading the officers of the corporation and prevent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ing them from contesting his action. The question of his right to maintain the bill as a judgment creditor apparently was not urged in the Superior Court. But assuming that it is properly before us, it is enough to say that on the facts found by the master he would be estopped from maintaining this bill, even if otherwise entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\n<em>Bill dismissed with costs,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
