The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant made a motion that the judge should order a verdict for it. The judge denied the motion and submitted the case vto the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $750.

The only exception taken at the trial is one to the refusal of the presiding judge to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The accident happened on Main Street in Worcester, where there were double street railway tracks. The plaintiff had backed his automobile from a garage on the easterly line of Main Street across the sidewalk and into the street, and was in the act of turning the machine to go forward in a northerly direction when a north bound car of the defendant struck the automobile and drove it diagonally across the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">There was ample evidence of the motorman\u2019s negligence, \u2014\u25a0 and we do not understand that the defendant argues to the contrary. The jury could find that the motorman should have seen the sign warning him to \u201cgo-slow \u2014 4 miles an hour,\u201d yet he ran his car down grade at a speed of twenty or twenty-five miles an hour until just before the collision; and that, although the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>was within view continuously after the car reached Jackson Street, four hundred feet from the place of the accident, the motorman was talking with others, and did not observe the automobile until it was too late to prevent a collision. <em>Sughrue </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">The issue of the plaintiff\u2019s due care was rightly submitted <em>to </em>the jury. In the first place, the St. 1914, c. 553, made contributory negligence on the part of the' plaintiff \u201can affirmative defence to be set up in the answer of, and proved by the defendant.\u201d It could not be ruled as matter of law that the defendant had sustained that burden on the oral and conflicting testimony. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 370. Further, the jury could find these facts: the plaintiff was obliged to back out of the garage, and to go as far as the north bound track before turning; at this \u201c rush hour \u201d electric cars were passing or approaching the garage in \u201calmost a continuous chain,\u201d and the nearest rail was only twelve feet from the curb line; when the plaintiff was on the sidewalk he looked and saw this car beyond Jackson Street, or more than four hundred and forty feet away; he looked again when he reached the gutter and saw the car near Jackson Street, or about four hundred feet distant; he knew that he \u201chad plenty of time,\u201d but when he had come to a stop and was about to go forward, the car came upon him at an unusual and rapid speed, and without warning. While it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care for his own safety at this dangerous place, he well might trust something to the expectation that the motorman also would act with due regard for the safety of others lawfully using the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
