There is no evidence on which the jury can find that Clarence Sawyer was authorized as the plaintiff\u2019s agent to purchase any motor cycle with title to be conferred upon said Sawyer at the time of the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If the jury find on the evidence that at some time after-the delivery of the coal concerned the defendant learned that said coal was the property of the plaintiff, and the defendant did not return said coal to the plaintiff, but continued using it, or the remainder thereof, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">\u201c3.

If the jury find that the circumstances under which the defendant entered into the contract with Clarence Sawyer, as claimed by the defendant, were such as should have put a reasonable man on his guard, and caused him to suspect that said coal was not owned by Sawyer, but by the plaintiff, and it appears that said coal actually was owned by the plaintiff, and that the use and benefit thereof was derived by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">The judge refused to give any of these instructions to the jury and as a part of his charge gave the following instruction, to which the plaintiff excepted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-11\">The question is \u201cwhether those five tons were delivered to the defendant as. the property of Farnum, or when delivered to Ramsey through other persons reached Ramsey as the property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Sawyer and in payment for Sawyer for that debt and that was authorized by Farnum or whether Farnum directly or indirectly authorized Sawyer to deliver this coal before the coal was delivered as Sawyer\u2019s coal and in payment of Sawyer\u2019s debts. If so, of course it is paid in payment of Sawyer\u2019s debt. On the other hand if that coal went to Ramsey without any authority of Farnum and treated as his own and not to apply on Sawyer\u2019s debt and it was Farnum\u2019s coal and was always Farnum\u2019s coal and reached Ramsey as Farnum\u2019s coal, not having been paid for is the plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-7\"><em>F.

The defendant had a verdict and the case is here on exceptions taken to the refusal to give the four instructions printed on page 287 and on one exception taken to that part of\" the charge of the presiding judge there set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The defendant was put on the witness stand by the plaintiff.' He testified \u201cthat he bought the coal of Sawyer and not of\u201d the plaintiff; that Sawyer wanted the defendant to sell him a motor cycle and offered to* \u201cgive as the first payment five tons of coal, which he [Sawyer] said was his personal property;\u201d that he (the defendant) \u201cagreed to this and made out a conditional bill of sale of the motor cycle to Sawyer;\u201d that \u201clater\u201d he \u201creceived from Sawyer\u201d a bill on Farnum\u2019s \u201cregular bill head\u201d in these words: \u201cUxbridge, Mass., Oct. 22,1915. . . . Sold to Mr. Howard Ramsey. 5 tons Lehigh Chestnut Coal at $8.50. . . . $42.50 (for later delivery). This amount is paid when applied as partial payment .on Indian motor cycle No. 79 F. 816. E. S. Farnum.\u201d This was marked and will be referred to as exhibit I. The defendant further testified that the coal was delivered \u201cin the latter part of October\u201d by Sawyer; that he knew at the time that \u201cSawyer was employed by the plaintiff as the driver of a team by which coal was delivered.\u201d In addition the defendant testified that \u201cat some time later the plaintiff\u201d asked him to change the lease of the motor cycle \u201cfrom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Sawyer to him\u201d and he refused to do so \u201cuntil he []Sawyer3 broke the bargain\u201d that Sawyer made with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The plaintiff testified that Sawyer told him \u201cthat he, Sawyer, was anxious to have a motor cycle but could not get one as Ramsey would not trust him; that the plaintiff said that if Sawyer would stop drinking the plaintiff would buy the motor cycle and that Sawyer could use it and then buy it from the plaintiff, paying for it out of his, Sawyer\u2019s, wages; that the plaintiff further, suggested that Ramsey would probably be willing to credit his winter\u2019s supply of coal in part payment and directed Sawyer to go to Ramsey and see if the trade could be made; that later, Sawyer returned and reported that Ramsey was willing; that the bill signed as produced by Ramsey was then sent to Ramsey to be delivered by Sawyer.\u201d There was no evidence connecting the defendant with the facts so testified to. The plaintiff further testified that \u201cSawyer broke his promise to stop drinking\u201d and the plaintiff-told the defendant that the sale of the motor cycle \u201c should have been made to Qiim3 the plaintiff;\u201d and told him that \u201che would have to be paid for the coal or have the lease of the motor cycle made to him which the defendant said he could not do because Sawyer had bought it and had not broken the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Sawyer was not put upon the witness stand by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">There is a short answer to the first ruling asked for and to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint that the title to the motor cycle ought to have been taken in his (the plaintiff\u2019s name) and not in Sawyer\u2019s name. The short answer is that on the assumption on which the plaintiff proceeded it was immaterial whether the title was put by the defendant in Sawyer\u2019s name or in the plaintiff\u2019s name. The plaintiff went on the assumption that Sawyer acted as his agent in selling the coal and buying the motor cycle. If he did the title to the motor cycle was in the plaintiff as between the plaintiff and Sawyer although the defendant put the title in Sawyer\u2019s name. Since Sawyer acted as the plaintiff\u2019s agent any title taken in his agent\u2019s name was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">There are other objections to this request for a ruling which are fatal. But it is not necessary to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">A short answer to the second, third and fourth rulings asked for is that the money due for the coal had been paid by being applied as partial payment on the motor cycle in accordance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>terms of the bill for the coal delivered by Sawyer to the defendant if that is to be taken to be a bill for the sale of the coal by the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">It is apparent from the pleadings and the terms of the bill of exceptions however that the case was not tried on the issue of payment. The defence set up at the trial was that the coal was bought by the defendant of Sawyer as Sawyer\u2019s coal and for this reason that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff as purchaser of the coal from him. In that aspect of the case also the second, third and fourth rulings asked for were rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In his argument here the plaintiff has relied on <em>Orcutt </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>1 Gray, 536, and similar cases in support of his contention that the facts set forth in the second, third and fourth requests are as matter of law decisive in his favor. The contention now put forward by him is this: The defendant must be taken to have bought the coal of the plaintiff as matter of law because (1) exhibit I was as matter of law notice to him that the plaintiff claimed to have sold the coal to him and'because (2) he used it after receiving that notice. But that contention is not set forth in these requests. There is no reference to exhibit I in any one of these requests. The second and third requests are based on the legal effect of using the coal after notice from the plaintiff that the coal was his and not Sawyer\u2019s. And the fourth is based on the effect of using the coal under circumstances that ought to have led him to suspect that it was the plaintiff\u2019s coal and not Sawyer\u2019s. These facts might have had a bearing upon the defendant\u2019s liability if the plaintiff had sued him in tort for conversion of the coal. But they were not decisive (if indeed they had any bearing as matter of law) upon the issue then on trial, namely, Did the defend\u00e1nt buy the coal from the plaintiff and not from Sawyer?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We do not intimate that the contention now made by the plaintiff but not set forth in his request for rulings was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The part of the charge to which the plaintiff took an exception is obscure. For all that appears this part may have been made plain by the rest of the charge. The rest of the charge is not set forth in the bill of exceptions. The burden is on the excepting party to show error. Under these circumstances the plaintiff has not sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
