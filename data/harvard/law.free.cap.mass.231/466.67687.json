The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant filed a motion in each case asking the judge to rule that the plaintiff could not recover and to order a verdict for the defendant. The judge denied these motions and submitted the case to the jury in a charge which included the following \u2019instruction: \u201cThe truss-beam being there, the question for the jury is whether they treated the situation in a reasonably careful manner, no duty resting on the defendant to take away the truss-beam, but, the- truss-beam being there, the floor being there, did they do what reasonably careful men would do, treating that situation that actually existed? If they did, they were not negligent. If they did not, they were negligent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in each case, in the first case in the sum of $1,700 and in the second case in the sum of $800.

It manufactured and installed for the plaintiff Alcid A. Barabe one of its patent baking ovens in accordance with the terms of a conditional contract, under which title did not pass to the vendee upon completion and installation but was to be transferred by a bill of sale when the contract price had been fully paid. The plaintiff, who never has acquired title, used the oven in his bakery, and within four months from the date. of the contract and while it was being operated at the requisite temperature for baking bread, fire broke out between the top of the oven and the ceiling, which the jury would have been warranted in finding was caused solely by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>defendant\u2019s negligent workmanship. The defendant had bound itself to furnish an oven which was not defective when subjected to the conditions of operation shown by the contract.. And the jury were correctly instructed that, while the defendant was under no obligation to remove the truss-beam directly over and in contact with the masonry of the arch at the top of the oven to which, as the jury could find, the fire bursting through the bricks was communicated because the interstices had not been sufficiently filled with mortar, it was required to use reasonable care to protect the truss-beam from combustion. If the company\u2019s faulty performance of-the work caused the fire, it is liable in damages even if the exact form in which injury to the plaintiff might result was not foreseen. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Winsor, </em>118 Mass. 251. <em>Dulligan </em>v. <em>Barber Asphalt Paving Co. </em>201 Mass. 227, 231. <em>D\u2019Almeida </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>209 Mass. 81, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The plaintiff in the second case is the mother of Alcid, and, when the oven was built and when the fire occurred, she was the owner of the \"real estate\u201d occupied by her son for the purposes of his business. It is contended that the verdict assessing damages for the injury to the buildings should be set aside because the fact of her ownership was unknown to the defendant and no contractual relations existed between them. The defendant, even if the contractee .used that part of the premises where the oven had been placed, owed to the plaintiff as the landowner the duty of not causing injury to her property by its tortious acts or misfeasance. It was uncontroverted that it had annexed to the premises 'an oven to which it retained title under a contract, the performance of which by the conditional vendee until he acquired the ownership recognized the maintenance and use of the oven as previously stated. If the jury found that, when so used and because of insufficient construction, it became a dangerous instrumentality which would be likely to set the plaintiff\u2019s building on fire, the defendant is liable in damages. <em>Derry </em>v. <em>Flitner, </em>118 Mass. 131, 134. <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>125 Mass. 232, 240. <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>154 Mass. 163, 164. <em>Dulligan Barber Asphalt Paving Co. </em>201 Mass. <em>227, </em>231. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>102 Va. 824, 832.
