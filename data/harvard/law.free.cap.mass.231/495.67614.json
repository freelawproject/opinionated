When the contract was offered in evidence at the trial, there was written in typewriting below the signature of the plaintiff\u2019s president these words: \u201cNot valid unless countersigned by an executive of the Packard Motor Car Co. of Boston.\u201d The contract was not so countersigned. The plaintiff\u2019s president testified in regard to these words, that when the contract was signed he \u201cdid not see anything there and didn\u2019t know whether they were there,or not.\u201d The defendant\u2019s salesman testified that he saw no change in the contract and.specifications \u201cfrom the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Mr. S Cthe plaintiff\u2019s president] signed them.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled'to go to the jury, who might refuse to believe the testimony of the defendant\u2019s salesman to the effect that there had been no change in the contract, and on the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s president, that he did not see the typewritten words below his signature, could find that they were not a part of the contract when it was signed, notwithstanding the witness\u2019s further statement that he did not know whether the words were there or not.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-5\">In the case above described it was <em>said </em>that,-in view of the decision stated above, it was unnecessary to consider whether there was evidence that the requirement of the signature of an executive officer was waived by the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\">Contract against Alvan T.

The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that upon all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover and to order a verdict for the defendant. The judge so ruled and ordered and by agreement of the parties reported the case for determination by this court, with the stipulation that, if such ruling and order were right, judgment should be entered on the verdict for the defendant; if the case ought to have been 'submitted to the jury, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $400 and taxable costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-8\">J. <em>E.

K. and he is now making arrangements for the body with the Woonsocket Wagon Co.\u201d Kimball testified that when the contract was shown to Prime he said, \u201cthe transaction was good work;\u201d that the letter showing Prime\u2019s approval was written in Prime\u2019s office and that he told Kimball to notify Sullivan that \u201cthe contract was all right.\u201d Kimball further testified that he saw no change in the written contract and specifications \u201cfrom the time Mr. Sullivan signed them.\u201d The case is here on the report of a judge of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">The jury could have refused to believe the evidence of Kim-ball to the effect that there was no change in the contract after it was signed; they could have believed the evidence of Sullivan that he did not see the typewritten words below his signature and on this evidence could have found that these words were not a part of the contract when it was signed. They could have so found, notwithstanding Sullivan\u2019s further testimony that he did not know whether the words were there or not. The latter statement was not necessarily inconsistent with the former statement that \u201che did not see anything there.\u201d Plainly it was a question for the jury to decide how far, if at all, Sullivan\u2019s testimony was to be believed; and what part of it was to be relied on and what part of it was to be rejected. If they believed that the words requiring the signature of an executive officer were not a part of the contract when signed by Sullivan and Kimball, they could have found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">As there was evidence of a breach of the contract binding upon the parties, it becomes unnecessary to discuss the question of the waiver by Prime of the stipulation requiring the signature of an executive officer, even- if this stipulation were a part of the contract when signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The statute of frauds is alleged in the answer, but this defence has not been argued and we treat it as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">As the case should have been submitted to the jury, according to the report judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for $400 and taxable costs. <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
