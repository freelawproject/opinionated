Buckley, who was run over by a motor truck of the defendants on September 14, 1916. He was eleven years of\" age. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the defendants moved that a verdict be directed in their favor. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">It was admitted that the defendants did business under the name of the Mansion House Ice Cream Company. There was evidence that the words \u201cMansion House Ice Cream Company\u201d were on the truck which injured the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and that it was operated by one Giganti, who was employed by the defendants. It was a \u201cWhite truck\u201d and \u201cthere were a couple of barrels on it.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cIf he [\u00a1Giganti] was out with an automobile truck of the Mansion House Ice Cream Company, you would say that he was about your business?\u201d one of the defendants answered, \u201cNaturally, yes.\u201d This was some evidence that at the time of the accident Giganti, who was in charge of the defendants\u2019 motor truck, was in the defendants\u2019 employ and was engaged in their business. <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Ogasapian, </em>224 Mass. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was riding on another motor truck which was proceeding along the northerly side of Cambridge Street in Cambridge, in front of the defendants\u2019 truck. There was evidence that the left hand wheels of the truck on which the intestate was, were on the right hand rail of the outward bound car track. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate got off the truck and started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to walk in a diagonal direction across Cambridge Street toward the southerly side. He looked toward First Street, toward the point where other vehicles were coming-in the opposite direction. Giganti attempted to pass the truck on which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had been riding. A boy, who had been with the intestate on that truck and who remained on it when the intestate got off, tesified that, \u201cWhen the Buckley boy was about within, six feet of the gutter, the witness yelled to him.\u201d The intestate then started to run and was struck about two feet from the curbstone of the southerly side of Cambridge Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\">The intestate\u2019s due care was for the jury. He looked in the direction from which vehicles might be expected. The street was paved with wooden blocks and the jury could say that the defendants\u2019 truck made little or no noise and that no signal of its approach was given. The boy was near the curb when struck, and on that side of the street where the defendants\u2019 truck going toward Cambridge would not be expected. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 370. <em>Mullin </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>229 Mass. 214. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Flash Chemical Co. </em>230 Mass. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">There was evidence that the day was clear, that no horn was sounded, and, as the boy started to run toward the sidewalk, \u201cthe automobile started toward that side thatfhe was running to,\u201d and there was evidence from one witness that, when the boy was walking, the defendants\u2019 motor truck \u201cturned to the left and went after him and kept going after him until it finally caught him, about one foot from the left hand curbstone on Cambridge Street.\u201d There was ample room to pass without running down the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. On this evidence the defendants\u2019 negligence was plainly a question for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
