Tobt for personal injuries sustained by a teamster on January 9, 1916, by being thrown from a wagon in which he was driving when the horse shied at the canvas cover of a machine for grinding tracks and smoothing the joints of rails which the defendant was alleged negligently to have placed and to have allowed to remain on one of its tracks on Southbridge Street, a public highway in Worcester. Writ dated February 2, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-4\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Morton, </em>J. The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant moved that a verdict be ordered for the defendant. The judge denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,000. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-5\"><em>C. C.

The jury however would be warranted in finding that the horse driven by the plaintiff, although ordinarily gentle and well broken, becoming frightened by the sudden flapping of the canvas cover on a grinding machine owned by the defendant and left on its railway track located in the public way, over which the plaintiff as a traveller was passing, \u201cbolted or shied,\u201d throwing him out of the carriage against a pole, causing serious injuries. It is settled that in common with other travellers the plaintiff had the right to a free and unobstructed use of the street in so far as it had been wrought for travel, subject only to the lawful right of the defendant to maintain, its track and to operate its cars. <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Blue Hill Street Railway, </em>186 Mass. 446, 449. The machine which was heavy and cumbrous had been used in grinding joints in another street the day before the accident, which occurred on Sunday. But instead of being placed in the defendant\u2019s storage house, which the jury could say was easily accessible, it had been transported on a \u201ccrane car\u201d and left in the position previously described where it remained until used on the following Monday. It is unnecessary to decide whether the machine would have been an unjustifiable obstruction if it had been in operation, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>city ordinance then in force required that, \u201cNo person shall in any highway or street place any obstruction of any kind without a written license from the street commissioner,\u201d which license the defendant admits had not been obtained. The question, whether under the circumstances the machine rendered the street dangerous to travellers, was for the jury, and, if they found that it constituted an obstruction, the defendant\u2019s failure to procure a license could be properly considered in passing upon its negligence. <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, </em>224 Mass. 352, 364. <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, 228 </em>Mass. 365, 367. <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Winslow Skate Manuf. Co. </em>189 Mass. 580, 582. The question of the defendant\u2019s liability was properly submitted tb the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\">The plaintiff, when injured, having been a teamster in the employ of a corporation which had become a subscriber under St. 1911, c. 751, and amendatory acts, and having given notice to the insurer of a claim for compensation, the remaining contention is, that he cannot maintain the present action. By St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1913, c. 448, \u201cWhere the injury for which compensation is payable under this act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the subscriber to pay damages in respect thereof, the employee may at his option proceed either at law against that person to recover damages, or against the association for compensation under this act, but not against both, and if compensation be paid under this act, the association may enforce in the name of the employee, or in its own name and for its own benefit,'the liability of such other person, and in case the association recovers a sum greater than that paid by the association to the employee four fifths of the excess shall be paid over to the employee.\u201d If for the purposes of our decision it is assumed that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment, he could not concurrently proceed at common law for damages and under the statute for compensation. <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, 222 </em>Mass. 366, 371. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Henry Thayer &amp; Co. 225 </em>Mass. 151. And where compensation is accepted the insurer at once is subrogated to the employee\u2019s cause of action. <em>Turnquist </em>v. <em>Hannon, </em>219 Mass. 560. The plaintiff, who is not shown to have been ignorant of his rights or to have lacked knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>edge of all material facts, had at his command the choice of remedies or of remedial rights which were inconsistent and not analogous. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Alley, </em>156 Mass. 193. <em>Cripps\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 586, 589. <em>Turnquist </em>v. <em>Hannon, supra. </em>It was for him to decide whether he would bring suit, or rely on the statute. The action at law, having been begun and pending before he gave notice to the insurer of any claim for compensation, is therefore under these circumstances an election by which he as well as the defendant is bound. <em>Frisch </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>200 Mass. 429, 431. <em>Cripps\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 586. <em>Turnquist </em>v. <em>Hannon, supra. Hall </em>v. <em>Henry Thayer &amp; Co. supra. </em>St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 15. St. 1913, c. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The right of recovery not having been barred, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether the payment by the plaintiff\u2019s employer of his wages during the first week of disability was made under the statute, or was a gratuity because of his unfortunate condition, or whether his subsequent notice of withdrawal to the insurer operated as a waiver of the claim to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
