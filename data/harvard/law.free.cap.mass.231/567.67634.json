It further appeared that the amount of $150 originally lent by the plaintiff to the defendant, for which the defendant\u2019s note was given, was procured for and wholly expended for the benefit of the corporation that afterwards became bankrupt. <em>Held, </em>that the contract was a valid one, the consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise being the surrender by the plaintiff of the defendant\u2019s note in exchange for the note of the corporation, and that the plaintiff was entitled to go to the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-5\">Contract on an alleged agreement in writing, described in the opinion, to pay the plaintiff a balance of $135 remaining unpaid on a promissory note of the Hub Curtain Company for $150.

The facts favorable to the plaintiff which could have been found upon the evidence are stated in the opinion. At the close of the- evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-7\">\u201c1. A verdict for the defendant should be directed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s action is prematurely brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-9\">\u201c3. If the plaintiff ever lent the defendant $150, then said debt was paid by a note of the Hub Curtain Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-10\">\u201c4. The allegations set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration constitute a fraud and the plaintiff cannot recover on the agreement set forth in the second paragraph of his declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-11\">\"5. If the jury find that the plaintiff agreed with the defendant to prove in bankruptcy a claim against the Hub Curtain Company which was not a valid claim, he cannot recover in this-action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-12\">\u201c6. The plaintiff cannot recover for money alleged to have-been lent to the defendant on or about October 21, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-13\"><em>\u201c7. </em>If a note was executed by the defendant to the plaintiff on. or about October 21, 1910, and this note was surrendered by the-plaintiff for a note of the Hub Curtain Company, then this alleged note of the defendant given on or about October 21, 1910, was. paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-14\">\u201c8. The plaintiff, having elected to prove his claim in bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>rup'tcy against the Hub Curtain Company, cannot press his claim against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-5\">\u201c9. In the absence of evidence that the plaintiff will receive no more dividends from the Hub Curtain Company\u2019s bankrupt estate, he cannot recover on the alleged agreement set forth in the second paragraph of his declaration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZB2\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings. In regard to the seventh ruling requested by the defendant the judge instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe claim is that the corporation bought up the old note and the old note was surrendered for the purpose \u2014 one purpose, at any rate \u2014 of having the substituted note proved, in bankruptcy to get a dividend, with the collateral agreement on. the part of this defendant that he personally would pay any difference between the amount of the dividend and the amount due on the note. If there was such a purchase and it was a genuine transaction, a real transaction such as might take place where one man buys up a note, or buys it by giving another note for it, then from that time on the debt would be the debt of the Hub Curtain Company and not the personal debt of the defendant; and from that time on the only possible reliance the plaintiff could have on the defendant would be by reason of an agreement to pay a balance, and that would have to be based upon a consideration, and a legal consideration.\u201d The defendant excepted to this portion of the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-7\">The judge submitted to the jury seven special questions,, which, with the answers of the jury, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-8\">\u201c 1. Did the defendant Parrott at any time execute and deliver to the plaintiff his personal note for the money advanced by the plaintiff for the Hub Curtain Company?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-9\">\u201c2. Was the note in evidence given as a substitute for and in settlement of a note previously held by the plaintiff? \u201d The jury-answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-10\">\u201c3. Did the Hub Curtain Company owe the plaintiff the amount of the claim which he proved against it in the bankruptcy case? \u201d The jury returned no answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-11\">\u201c4. Did the defendant Aldine O. Parrott on or about February 24,. 1911, promise the plaintiff to pay a debt due him from the Huh Curtain Company?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c5. If such a promise was made, was it in writing?\u201d The jury-answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-3\">\u201c6. If such promise was made, was there a consideration for it?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-4\">\u201c7. Were the bankruptcy proceedings in the case of the Hub Curtain Company closed at the time this case was brought? \u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-6\"><em>J. H. Duffy, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-7\"><em>N. D. A. Clarke, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b594-8\">Pieece, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6X\">The evidence taken in its aspect riiost favorable to. the contention of the plaintiff would warrant the jury in finding that on October 21, 1910, the plaintiff lent the defendant, personally, $150 to enable the defendant to meet the payroll of the Hub Curtain Company; that a few days before the note became due the defendant asked and received an extension \u201cbecause he hadn\u2019t sufficient funds to meet it;\u201d that later the defendant' telephoned the plaintiff that the Hub Curtain Company had assigned, and asked the plaintiff \u201cto give up his personal note and accept the note of the Hub Curtain Company\u201d in payment; that the Hub Curtain Company was \u201ccontemplating going into bankruptcy proceedings\u201d and that the common law assignee of the Hub Curtain Company would make arrangements with the plaintiff to that effect; that the assignee, appbinted in January, 1911, agreed with the plaintiff that the personal note of the defendant should be surrendered and a substituted note \u201cdrawn on the Hub Curtain Company\u201d should be delivered to the plaintiff together with a written agreement signed by the defendant to pay the plaintiff any balance unpaid on the substituted note after \u201ca dividend\u201d was received; that afterwards the assignee gave and the plaintiff received the note of the Hub Curtain Company as a substitute for and in settlement of a note previously held by the plaintiff; that at the time the note of the Hub Curtain Company was substituted for the personal note of the defendant, and the last named note surrendered, as a part of his agreement the assignee gave the plaintiff a written agreement, signed by the defendant, the substance of which was that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $150; that the plaintiff should give up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>personal note and accept the Hub Curtain Company\u2019s note, and that \u201cas soon as a dividend was paid\u201d to him the defendant would pay the plaintiff the difference between the dividend and the amount the defendant owed; that the Hub Curtain Company filed a petition and was adjudicated a bankrupt on February 6, 1911; that the petition scheduled the plaintiff as a creditor holding the bankrupt\u2019s note for $150; that on February 24, 1911, the plaintiff executed a proof of claim, which was filed and allowed; that a dividend of ten per cent was declared and paid on April 11, 1911; that no other dividend has been declared; that the defendant has not paid the balance of $135, and that the absence of evidence of other proceedings in the bankruptcy court warrants a finding that the proceedings in that court were closed at the time this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Upon the above alleged facts, many of which are disputed by the defendant, the judge rightly could not have directed a verdict for the defendant. The surrender of the individual note of the defendant for the note of the bankrupt Hub Curtain Company was in itself a consideration for the written promise of the defendant to pay the plaintiff the difference between a declared dividend and the amount owed the plaintiff, $135, \u201cas soon as a dividend was paid\u201d the plaintiff. There is no evidence in the record that the note of the Hub Curtain Company was given the plaintiff without the authority of the company. Indeed, the contrary may be inferred readily from the undisputed fact that the money obtained from the plaintiff was procured and used for the direct benefit of the company. Manifestly the fund available to the general creditors of the company could not be affected by the substitution of the plaintiff as a creditor in place of the defendant, if the amount owed the defendant was equal to or more than the obligation in its substituted form.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The action was not prematurely brought, in that it could rightly be found that the proceedings in bankruptcy had been closed before the action was brought; as also that the written agreement is to pay as soon as \u201ca dividend\u201d is paid and not when all proceedings have closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The remaining requests were refused rightly and are covered by what has been said concerning the motion to direct a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
