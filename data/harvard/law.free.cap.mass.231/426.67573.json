In a suit in equity by the lessee under the lease above described to restrain the lessor from letting 431 Park Avenue for a grocery or a provision, meat or fish business in alleged violation of the covenant quoted above, it was <em>held </em>that there was nothing in the language of the covenant indicating an intention to permit the lessor to let the store numbered 431 for another competing grocery after the Cloverdale Company should vacate the premises, and that the plaintiff was entitled to the injunction prayed for.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-10\">In the same case it was <em>said </em>that, the Cloverdale Company having ceased to occupy any store in the defendant\u2019s building, it was not necessary to consider, whether the words \" Cloverdale Store\u201d in the excepting clause of the covenant referred to the business then carried on by the Cloverdale Company at No. 431 and would authorize a transfer of that business to another store in the defendant\u2019s building.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-11\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on June 12, 1918, by the lessee under a lease in writing dated July 1, 1915, of the store numbered 423 on Park Avenue in Worcester against the lessor praying for an order restraining the defendant from letting another store in the same building numbered 431 on Park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Avenue to be used for a grocery, a provision, meat or fish busi ness in alleged violation of a covenant in the lease.

The material covenant in the lease is quoted in the opinion, where also the evidence in r\u00e9gard to the circumstances existing at the time of the execution of the lease is described. The judge filed a memorandum of decision, which concluded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">\u201cThe provision in the plaintiff\u2019s lease which is the principal cause of the controversy is, that the defendant shall not rent any part of the building on premises in which the above said stores are located for any grocery, provision, meat or fish business except the Cloverdale _Store now located at No. 431 Park Avenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">\u201cThere seems to have been no reason for making this exception, except the fact that the Cloverdale Company then had a right to continue to do business at 431 Park Avenue because of its written lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-8\">\u201cThe parties apparently intended to eliminate competition in the plaintiff\u2019s business so far as they could legally do so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-9\">The judge found that the provision in the plaintiff\u2019s lease above referred to created, an exception in favor of the Clover-dale Company only, and that it was not intended to give and did not give the defendant the right to lease 431 Park Avenue for a provision, grocery, meat or fish business after it ceased to be occupied by the Cloverdale Company, as the Cloverdale Store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-10\">He ordered that a decree should be prepared enjoining the defendant from permitting the store at 431 Park Avenue to be rented, leased or occupied for the purpose of carrying on any grocery, provision, meat or fish business, and awarding costs to the plaintiff taxed as in an action at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-11\">Later by order of the judge a final decree .in accordance with the memorandum of decision was entered; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-12\">The case was submitted on briefs at the sitting of the court in September, 1918, and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.

The plaintiff hired the store numbered 423 and 425, for five- years from July 1, 1915, the lease providing that he should \u201ccarry a general line of groceries, meat, provisions and fish.\u201d The Cloverdale Company then was carrying on a similar business in the defendant\u2019s building at number 431, under a written lease. This company had a series of stores, the one at 431 Park Avenue being known as Cloverdale Store numbered fifty. On the outside were the words \u201c Clover-dale Company\u201d and \u201cCloverdale Store.\u201d The covenant in controversy in the plaintiff\u2019s lease, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ANW\">\u201cAnd the lessor, in consideration of one dollar and other valuable considerations, hereby promises and agrees to and with the lessee that she shall cause the fish market at No. 425% Park Avenue to be discontinued immediately and further promises and agrees that during the term of said lease she shall not rent any part of the building on premises in which the above said stores are located for any grocery, provision, meat or fish business, except the Cloverdale. Store now located at No. 431 Park Avenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Before April 26, 1918, the Cloverdale Company vacated the store it had occupied; and the defendant executed a lease of it to the Community Stores Company, a corporation which maintained a series of stores for the sale of provisions, meats, groceries and fish. The plaintiff thereupon brought this bill in equity to restrain the defendant from permitting said No. 431 to-be occupied for this competing business. A decree was entered in his favor, from which the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The contention of the defendant is, that while she covenanted not to rent any part of her building for carrying on the same business in which the plaintiff was engaged, she excepted from that covenant the premises numbered 431. ' If' such were the intention of the parties presumably they would have expressly so stated. What they did in fact take out of the covenant was not \u201cNo. 431 Park Avenue\u201d but the \u201cCloverdale Store\u201d which then was \u201clocated at\u201d that place. There is nothing in the language they used which indicates an intention to permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>lessor to let the store numbered 431 for another competing grocery business after the Cloverdale Company \u2022 should vacate the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">If the. language itself left any doubt as to whethere the parties intended entirely to exclude these premises from the operation of the covenant, that doubt would be removed by reading the lease in the light of the facts surrounding the parties when it was executed. The plaintiff was binding himself for a period of five years, not merely to pay rent for the store numbered 423-425 Park Avenue, but \u201cto keep said stores open for business every business day during the continuance of this lease, and to carry a general line of groceries, meat, provisions and fish, except by special permission.\u201d There was then a fish market in the adjoining store, numbered 425%. This was to be discontinued immediately. In the same-building, at number 431, was another grocery and provision business, carried on by the Clover-dale Company; but that company had a written lease, not yet expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In the opinion of a majority of the court' the trial judge rightly ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s rights were violated by the defendant when she undertook to lease to the Community Stores Company the premises numbered 431 Park Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"AGbm\">As the Cloverdale Company vacated the building before the present controversy arose, it is unnecessary to consider whether the words \u201cCloverdale Store\u201d in the clause limiting the covenant refer to the business then conducted by that company at No. 431, and would authorize a transfer of the business from that place to another store in the defendant\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
