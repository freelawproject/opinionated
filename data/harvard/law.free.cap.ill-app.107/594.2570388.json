A demurrer to this declaration, including the common counts, seems to have been sustained. It does not appear that any exception was preserved to this ruling. Appellee amended her declaration adding three additional counts. To these additional counts, Sophia Burton Gagnon, one of the appellees, filed her demurrer, which was sustained. Appellant seems to have amended each count of her declaration by interlineation on its face, and also filed amended additional counts. The same appellee again demurred to the whole declaration,as thus amended, and this demurrer seems to have been sustained only as to the amended additional counts. The court at the same time refused appellant\u2019s motion for time to file a further amended declaration. Some days thereafter the suit was dismissed at plaintiffs\u2019 cost. Appellant has preserved an exception to the order of dismissal and judgment but to none of the other orders entered.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-8\" pgmap=\"616\">LT.

Justice Freeman</author> <p id=\"AsO\" pgmap=\"617\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b617-5\" pgmap=\"617\">It is urged by appellant\u2019s attorney that at the time the order of dismissal was entered, appellee George S. Gagnon was in default, having failed to plead or demur to the amended declaration and the amended additional counts, and that the demurrer of the other appellee, Sophia Burton, to the amended declaration was undisposed of, the court having sustained it to the amended additional counts only. An examination of the record apparently shows the objection to be well taken. Ho exception is preserved to the order sustaining the demurrer to the common counts, and we can not consider the alleged error in that respect. But to dismiss a suit where a declaration is on file to which there is no plea or demurrer filed by one defendant and with a demurrer by another in part undisposed of, is clearly erroneous.</p> <p id=\"A987\" pgmap=\"617\">There were affidavits filed by appellees\u2019 attorneys, containing statements which it might be proper to show by evidence at a trial, but which were not entitled to consideration upon demurrer, and have no bearing upon the propriety of the order of dismissal. The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
