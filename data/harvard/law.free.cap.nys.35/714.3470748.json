The answer alleges that, for a valuable consideration, the defendant surrendered, and the plaintiff accepted, the demised premises, prior to the time the rent sued for accrued. The plaintiff moved that the answer be made more definite and certain, by specifying the valuable consideration referred to by the defendant in his answer, and the date of the surrender, or that a bill of particulars setting forth such information be served. This motion was denied. We think that the motion was properly denied in this instance, because the plaintiff positively swears that he never accepted a surrender of the demised premises. Therefore it appears from his own affidavit that he had definite information and knowledge concerning said allegation in defendant\u2019s.answer, and therefore it was unnecessary to have the answer more definite by alleging the date or consideration of such alleged surrender. Under such circumstances, the information desired would perhaps be satisfactory, but was not necessary for plaintiff to. know, in view of his said affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">The order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
