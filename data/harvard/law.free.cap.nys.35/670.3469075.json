The motorman had testified that the plaintiff attempted to drive his horse and wagon across the track when the approaching car was about 20 feet off, and that the car was moving at the usual rate of speed. On cross-examination, he was asked: \u201cQ. Within what distance can you stop your car? A. Well, there are different cars. You can stop in different distances. Q. What is the greatest distance, and what is the shortest distance? A. You can stop a car in fifteen feet or less.\u201d In view of the testimony of the motorman, we are of opinion that the charge before set forth was error, and that the learned trial judge properly granted a new trial. It is therefore not necessary to examine the other questions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">Order granting new trial affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
