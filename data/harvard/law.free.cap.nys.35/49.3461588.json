None of them married, and now all have been declared insane. Susan took Elizabeth to Bellevue last Friday, and asked that an inquiry might be made concerning her mental condition. The doctors soon decided that the woman was insane, and, while the examination was going on, Susan acted so strangely that she, too, was detained. She was pronounced a lunatic yesterday. The third sister had been in a Brooklyn hospital, suffering from nervous troubles, and when she heard of her sisters' whereabouts she insisted upon visiting them. She was allowed to do so yesterday, in company with a nurse, and upon arriving at Bellevue she, too, became insane. She was taken back to Brooklyn, and the others were sent to the Blackwell\u2019s Island Asylum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-15\">Third.

That such scandalous and defamatory matter was and is untrue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">Fifth. That, as plaintiff is informed and believes, defendant knew the same to be untrue at the time of publishing the same.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">Sixth. That such scandalous and defamatory matter was so published by defendant recklessly, and without investigation, or adequate investigation, as to the truth of the same, before such publication, and was so published for the sole purpose of sensation, as plaintiff is informed and believes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">Seventh.

M.

The case of Moore v. Francis, 121 N. Y. 199, 23 N. E. 1127, so much relied on by appellant, is an authority against it. We think the complaint states a plain cause of action for libel. We fail to find in the opinion in that case the words apparently quoted in defendant\u2019s points. Judgment affirmed, with costs, with leave to defendant to answer within 20 days, on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
