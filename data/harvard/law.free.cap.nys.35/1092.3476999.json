The case is a peculiar one, and not likely to be of frequent occurrence. It is that of a tenant who acquires an overdue mortgage upon the demised property and desires to set off the debt against the rent in a summary proceeding. This we held he could not do, and we pointed out the ample remedies at his disposal in an action to foreclose his mortgage. The question is not one which would authorize us to grant the motion asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
