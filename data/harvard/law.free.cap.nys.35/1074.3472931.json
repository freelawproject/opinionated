McNamara v. Nolan (Com. Pl.) 34 N. Y. Supp. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-18\">The action was for \u201cforcibly and wrongfully entering and taking possession on February 1, 1892, of certain premises, 160, 162, East Fifty-Ninth street, in the city of New York, of which plaintiffs were the lessees, under a lease from the defendant, expiring May 1, 1892,\u201d and resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for six cents damages. It was conceded by the pleadings that, \u201cby agreement between the parties, the defendant was allowed to enter and take possession, and to try and find a tenant for the premises for the unexpired term of the plaintiffs\u2019 lease,\u201d and the only issue tried and submitted was \u201cwhether, having permission from the plaintiffs to enter for one purpose,\u201d- the defendant \u201cavailed himself of such permission for a totally different purpose, to wit, to put the premises in repair for the term commencing alter the plaintiffs\u2019 lease expired.\u201d Bloomingdale v. Steubing, 12 Misc. Rep. 429, 33 N. Y. Supp. 584. Obviously, the allegation of the complaint that the plaintiffs, as lessees, were \u201centitled to the full possession of\u201d the demised premises was a conclusion of law, immaterial and not traversable. Scofield v. Whitlegge, 49 N. Y. 259. Hence, its denial by the defendant created no issue. People v. Commissioners of Town of Marlborough, 54 N. Y. 276. The answer expressly admitted the plaintiffs\u2019 title and right of possession as lessees of the defendant. The issue, being wholly with regard to the terms and extent of the license from the plaintiffs to the defendant, therefore, presented no \u201cclaim of title to real property,\u201d within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 3228 of the Code of Civil Procedure, so as to entitle the plaintiffs to the costs of the action notwithstanding the fact that the recovery was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>less than $50 for damages (Utter v. Gifford, 25 How. Prac. 289); and, pursuant to the provisions of section 3229, the defendant was entitled to such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The orders of the general and special terms of the court below, by which the plaintiffs were awarded the costs of the action, are reversed, with costs and disbursements of the several appeals to the defendant All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
