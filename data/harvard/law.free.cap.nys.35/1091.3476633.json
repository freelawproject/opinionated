The only alleged error urged by the appellant for the reversal of the judgment is that the testimony of Mr. Leopold Wallach disclosed professional communications between him and his client, the plaintiff, and was consequently erroneously admitted. The proper ground of objection was, however, not specified upon the trial.. The objection made was to \u201cany conversation in respect to professional opinion,\u201d and in view of the facts and the context this cannot be understood, and could not have been understood by the justice or adverse counsel, as referring to professional communications between attorney and client, but rather to the general incompetency of opinions as evidence; and hence, under well-established rules, it should be disregarded. Mead v. Shea, 92 N. Y. 122; Baylies, Trial Prac. p. 202, and cases cited. As we are satisfied, from a careful consideration of the evidence, that the decision of the justice was in all respects correct, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
