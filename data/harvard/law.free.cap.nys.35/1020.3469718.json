There was certainly evidence showing that a wagon bearing upon it the defendant\u2019s name and business address did collide with Hoeffler\u2019s wagon, which in turn, and because of such collision, was forced over against plaintiff's wagon, breaking it, throwing him out and against the sidewalk, from which he suffered the injuries related by him. Such testimony certainly authorized the jury in finding that said wagon was one owned by defendant. It also appears that plaintiff\u2019s wagon was being driven along Eighth avenue, a public highway, in a lawful manner, and that such was also the case with Hoeffler\u2019s and defendant\u2019s wagons; that when they were all three abreast, and going up town, the defendant\u2019s horses and wagon were by their driver suddenly swung out of their course, and he endeavored to cross in front of the wagons of plaintiff and Hoeffler; that in doing so it (defendant\u2019s wagon) struck violently against Hoeffler\u2019s wagon, and because of such collision, as before stated, Hoeffler\u2019s wagon was forced over against, and struck, plaintiff\u2019s wagon, breaking it and casting plaintiff out and upon the walk. Such testimony undoubtedly justified the jury in deciding that the defendant\u2019s driver was careless in the management of his horses and wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">The question, was plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence? was certainly for the jury to decide, and was properly submitted to them by the trial j ustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the verdict is excessive, and for that reason should be set aside, is not justified by the evidence, I think, because it appears that for several months plaintiff was under medical treatment; that he suffered from headaches and stomach and liver troubles, and several other things, as related by the attending physicians; and that \u201cprobably he may feel the trouble in his liver and spine all his life,\u201d to use the words of Dr. Ahlstrom. If the plaintiff was so severely injured,\u2014and evidently the jury believed the testimony to be true,\u2014I think that it would be improper for us to declare the verdict herein ($1,500) excessive. That question was one for the jury, and their finding should be sustained, unless it appears to be the result of passion, prejudice, a disregard of the evidence, or some such consideration,\u2014something which, in our judgment, did not occur herein. The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
