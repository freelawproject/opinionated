From the testimony of the plaintiff it appears that he complied with the conditions of the contract on his part, that he constructed the skylight according to the directions given him, and that he used the material approved by the defendants or their representative. The testimony on the part of the defendants, on the other hand, tended to show that the plaintiff, instead of using No. 24 galvanized iron, as called for by the contract, used an entirely different kind, known as No. 26, a kind of iron lighter and of less power of resistance, that the skylight was so improperly constructed that it leaked, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the plaintiff did not work in accordance with the defendants\u2019 instructions. The facts were fairly submitted to the jury, which determined the conflict of testimony in plaintiff\u2019s favor. We are satisfied from a careful examination of the evidence that it is sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury, and we find no reason to interfere with their determination of the facts, in the absence of the elements which are requisite to review the same. The defendants\u2019 exceptions, taken to the rulings of the court, are, in our opinion, without merit, and for the foregoing reasons we think the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
