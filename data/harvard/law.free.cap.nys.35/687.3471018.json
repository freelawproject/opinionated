A ratification by the defendants of Nugent\u2019s act, however, appeared from the testimony of one Deutsch, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, such testimony being to the effect that, subsequent to the sale and the delivery of the merchandise to Nugent, one of the defendants, \u2014Wehnke,\u2014with knowledge of all the circumstances, told Deutsch, with reference to the merchandise, that it was \u201call right,\u201d and in his presence instructed one Fansten, the defendants\u2019 representative, to pay the plaintiff the amount of its demand. The motion for dismissal of the complaint, made when the plaintiff rested its case, was, therefore, properly denied. The motion for dismissal of the complaint was not renewed, nor was the direction of a verdict for the defendants asked for, when both sides had concluded their introduction of evidence, and the cause was about to be submitted to the jury. Hence we are precluded from all inquiry as to whether at that stage of the action there was sufficient evidence to support a verdict for the plaintiff. Schwinger v. Raymond, 105 N. Y. 648, 11 N. E. 952; Paige v. Chedsey, 4 Misc. Rep. 183, 23 N. Y. Supp. 879; Meyers v. Cohn, 4 Misc. Rep. 185, 23 N. Y. Supp. 996. In his charge to the jury the trial justice, commenting upon the defendant Wehnke\u2019s promise to pay the plaintiff\u2019s demand, said: \u201cIf you believe this testimony, such a promise would be sufficient consideration for the payment of this bill, and Avould make the defendants liable as original debtors\u201d; to which the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted as follows: \u201cI except to the proposition that, if this promise was made, it made the defendants the original debtors.\u201d It is beyond all controversy that the ratification by the alleged principal of a contract made by another, who assumed in that regard to act as the farmer\u2019s agent, is an adoption of the contract by such alleged principal, and subjects him to liability thereunder, the same as if the contract was sanctioned by him at its inception. 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, tit. \u201cAgency,\u201d subtit. \u201cRatification,\u201d p. 429, etc., and cases collated in note 2. One error appears in the charge, but, as the attention of the trial justice was not called thereto by an exception sufficiently explicit, in which event it might have been obviated, such error does not now afford ground for reversal.
