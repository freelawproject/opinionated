O\u2019Rourke against Margaretha Hanchett on a promissory note indorsed by defendant.

Meyer v. Hibsher, 47 N. Y. 265. The rule laid down in that case is as follows: \u201cA promise, to work a waiver, must be made with full knowledge of all the facts.\u201d The exceptions should be overruled, and judgment ordered upon the verdict, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
