The referee did not report the form of the judgment, and therefore it was settled by the court. The constitution provides that no judge shall sit in review of his own decision, and, technically, I am disqualified from taking any part in this appeal, for the reason that the form of the judgment was settled by me, and I granted an allowance. On the argument I suggested that there was a doubt in my mind on this question, and the attorneys agreed to waive the point. The disqualification of a judge cannot be waived, and, if judgment is rendered by this general term, the same could be set aside on motion, for the reasons stated. Oakley v. Aspinwall, 3 N. Y. 547.</p>\n<p id=\"Act\">A reargument is therefore ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
