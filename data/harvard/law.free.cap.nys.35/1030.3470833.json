There is no rule requiring the trial justice to charge'every request asked for by counsel on a given subject of the law. The court is bound only to charge such propositions as are applicable to the facts in the case before it, and therefore has a right to refuse to charge a correct proposition of law when it has no bearing on the case. We do not find any substantial error, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
