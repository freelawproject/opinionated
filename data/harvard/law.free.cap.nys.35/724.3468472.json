SJ\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b753-6\">The action in the superior court resulted in a judgment against Dean &amp; Co. for the sum of $1,742.38. 17 N. Y. Supp. 375. Defendants did not elect to pay the judgment and take the brandy, but paid the government tax thereon, and sold the brandy, and, after deducting from the proceeds the amount of the tax, deposited the balance in a trust company to the joint order of themselves and Dean &amp; Co. The plaintiffs appealed from the judg- \u25a0 ment to the general term, and subsequently to the court of appeals, in both of which the judgment was affirmed, and upon the remittitur from the latter court a judgment was entered for $1,984.21. 32 N. E. 1108. The plaintiffs, claiming that the judgment entered on the trial of the action was the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d referred to in the stipulation, which was for less than $1,750, demanded the payment of one-half of the counsel fees and expenses of the trial and of the amount of the original judgment entered thereafter.\" The defendants, claiming that the judgment entered upon the remittitur of the court of appeals was the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d referred to in the stipulation, refused to pay or accede to plaintiffs\u2019 demands. Upon the trial the court construed the stipulation in accordance with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, and rendered a decision upon which the judgment was entered from which this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b753-7\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The Code of Civil Procedure provides for two forms of judgment, one interlocutory and one final; but, as the action in the superior court was to recover a sum of money, in which no interlocutory judgment could be entered, it is evident that the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d was not used in the stipulation to distinguish it from such interlocutory judgment. The term is susceptible of two other significations,\u2014one, which, in a strict legal sense, is its true meaning, viz. a determination of the rights of the parties after a trial, whether siich is the subject of review or, not; and the other, its colloquial use or signification, which makes it synonymous with \u201cdecisive,\u201d or a judgment that cannot be appealed from, and which is perfectly conclusive upon the matter adjudicated. In Kinney\u2019s Law Dictionary and Glossary (page 318) a final judgment is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u201cA judgment which puts an end to an action by declaring that the plaintiff either has or has not entitled himself to recover a judgment from which there is no appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In Abbott\u2019s Law Dictionary (volume 1, p. 497), where quotations from cases are given, showing the two meanings of the term, it is said, in speaking of \u201cfinal adjudication, decree, judgment, order, or sentence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\u201cThese expressions may, indeed, signify a judicial decision which is superior to review; one which conclusively determines the questions involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">And in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (page 493) it is thus defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201cA judgment which puts an end to an action at law by declaring that the plaintiff either has or has not entitled himself to recover the remedy he sues for. 3 Bl. Comm. 398. So distinguished from interlocutory judgments, which merely establish the right of the plaintiff to recover, in general terms. Id. 397. A judgment which determines a particular cause. A judgment which cannot be appealed from, which is perfectly conclusive upon the matter adjudicated. 24 Pick. 300. A judgment which terminates all litigation on the same right. The term \u2018final judgment\u2019 in the Judiciary Act of 1789, \u00a7 25, includes both species of judgments as just defined. 2 Pet. 494; 1 Kent, Comm. 316; 6 How. 201, 209. A judgment is final and conclusive between the parties when rendered on a verdict on the merits, not only as to the facts actually litigated and decided, but also as to all facts necessarily involved in the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">See, also, 1 Bouv. Law Dict. p. 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">The question is, in which of these senses was the term used in the stipulation? Does it mean the judgment entered after the trial of the superior court action, or a judgment finally settling- the rights of the parties to that action beyond all appeal? From a reading of the stipulation itself, we think the meaning and intent of the parties clear. It will be noticed that in the clause numbered second it is provided that, should plaintiffs be defeated in the first trial of the action on its merits, then defendants should have the election to pay the judgment, and have possession of the brandy; if the latter should not so elect, then the goods were to be sold on joint account, and the proceeds deposited, \u201cto await the final determination of the action\u201d; and this language is followed by the clause in dispute, which provides what is to happen in the event that the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d shall be more or less than $1,750. When we recall that express provision was made as to what was to happen in the event of the first trial going against the plaintiffs on the merits, it is made apparent that the term \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d as subsequently used, is synonymous with the expression \u201cfinal determination of the action,\u201d employed in the preceding clause. If this latter term were the one in dispute, we should have little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that by it was meant the final settling of the rights of the parties to the action beyond all appeal. We think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
