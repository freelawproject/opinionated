Smith and John W. Smith, impleaded as \u201cSmith &amp; Bro.,\u201d partners. Judgment was rendered against defendants after personal service of summons and complaint on James B. Smith, and after service of a general notice of appearance for both defendants by an attorney. Defendant John W. Smith never authorized any attorney to appear for him, was not a member of the firm of \u201cSmith &amp; Bro.,\u201d and moved to set aside the judgment as soon as the facts came to his knowledge, in 1895. From an order denying a motion to set aside and vacate a judgment against him, defendant John W. Smith appeals.

Upon the facts, then, it appearing that the defendant never was served with the summons, and that he states that he was not a partner, and therefore not liable to the plaintiff, a judgment against him would be mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>festly unjust. It appeared, moreover, that the motion was made as soon as the knowledge of the existence of the judgment came to the defendant, and we do not see how, under these circumstances, loches can be imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, to abide the event of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
