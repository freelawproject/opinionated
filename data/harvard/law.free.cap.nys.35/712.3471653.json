It is a fact that defendants\u2019 firm was not in existence at the time it was signed. Therefore, it is clear that no cause of action was established against the defendants. The plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment against Charles P. Rogers individually. The agreement in question was not one upon which he might be sued alone. It was not his individual agreement, but the agreement of his firm as it then existed; and no action could be maintained against Rogers individually upon such agreement, and could only be brought against him and his (then) copartners. This being, in our judgment, the law, it follows that in this action no judgment could be entered against him; and therefore, as against him, the complaint was rightfully dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
