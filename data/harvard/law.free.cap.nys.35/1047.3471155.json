There was evidence that the car could have been stopped in about 5 feet, if it was running at the speed claimed by defendant <em>Held </em>that, whether the parties each used reasonable care to avoid the injury was properly submitted to the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1075-11\">8.

The right of way of plaintiff and defendant was equal at the intersection of these two streets. Each had to cross the line of passage of the other, to enable them to proceed on their journey. Each should have used reasonable care in the exercise of such right, so as not to have interfered with the right of the other. Whether they did or did not use such reasonable care to avoid such interference with or injury to one another was properly submitted to the jury, and we see no cause for disturbing the decision of the jury that defendant was negligent, and the plaintiff free therefrom. Buhrens v. Railroad Co. (Sup.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 224, affirmed 125 N. Y. 702, 26 N. E. 752; O\u2019Neil v. Railway Co., 129 N. Y. 125, 29 N. E. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">There is medical testimony which shows that plaintiff\u2019s injuries from this accident are of a most serious character, viz. a permanent paralysis of the large muscle that i caps the shoulder, impairing the lifting power of the arm, and also a permanent curvature of the spine. For such injuries we think the jury was fully justified in giving a verdict of $4,000. Judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
