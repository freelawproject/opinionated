The fact that he may have assisted at fires, or worn the costume of a fireman, is immaterial. He was in the employ of the department as a day laborer, and could have been called upon to perform any duty. Therefore the writ should be quashed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
