The motion having been denied, defendant excepted, and, as no testimony was offered in his behalf, and the case went to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>on the testimony for the plaintiff, and, upon their rendering a verdict, no motion having been made for a new trial, the single question before us on this appeal is as to whether the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case. An examination of such testimony will show that every fact which it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove to justify a favorable inference of the jury was established, and as it is not the province of this court to disturb a verdict which is fully supported, it follows that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
