This is a position as laborer, and is not within the class of persons under the statute entitled to trial before they can be discharged. It also appears upon the minutes of the fire department that his original appointment was \u201ctemporarily as a laborer\u201d in the department. I therefore find he was not at any time a member of the force for extinguishing fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">Writ quashed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
