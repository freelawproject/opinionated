Y. Supp. 722, is conclusive as to the correctness of the rulings of the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-14\">It is claimed that the verdict for $10,000 is excessive. The jury found, on conflicting testimony, that the wife of the plaintiff, just prior to her injury, was a strong, healthy woman, about 38 years of age, and that ever since the injury she has been a confirmed invalid; that her health will not improve, and that during her future life she will be a burden to her husband, and not a comfort; that she never can be a wife to him again. The future damages to the plaintiff are, in a certain sense, speculative; and yet the law leaves it to a jury to decide the amount, in actions of this kind, provided such damages are reasonably certain. The preponderance of evidence is with the plaintiff as to the good health of his wife prior to her injury, and it appears that at the date of trial she was a physical wreck, and will always so continue. The verdict, though large, does not seem to us, in view of the evidence, to be the result of passion, prejudice, or sympathy. Judgment and order denying new trial affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
