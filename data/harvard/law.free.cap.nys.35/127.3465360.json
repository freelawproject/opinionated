No ratification of J.\u2019s promise by plaintiff was shown, defendant testifying that after plaintiff acquired title he promised to give him the lease on the terms proposed by J., and drew a lease, which defendant refused to execute because it did not include the premises in question. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence that plaintiff leased the premises to defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-12\">Appeal from Second district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-13\">Summary proceeding by John Boyce Smith against Vincenzo Caputo to recover the possession of land.

The respondent, Caputo, had been in possession of the premises Nos. 197 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>197J Worth street, as undertenant of one Moriarty, whose lease from the original owners of the property expired May 1, 1895, after which date the appellant claimed that Caputo unlawfully held possession of No. 197J. No question was raised with regard to his possession of No. 197. On behalf of the respondent it was shown that one James Z. Smith promised him a lease of \u201cthe house,\u201d at a rental of $80 a month, \u201cwhen he [Smith] got his deed.\u201d As a matter of fact, James Z. Smith never obtained a deed of the property, it having been sold to' the appellant at auction, and the latter thereafter took title. Moreover, there was no proof of agency in James Z. Smith to make any contract of lease for the appellant; hence, no question of estoppel, as relied upon by the respondent, appears in the case. The only evidence in this regard was that the appellant and James Z. Smith were \u201cconnected in business.\u201d This, of course, was no sufficient proof of a general agency. No subsequent ratification by the appellant is predicable of James Z. Smith\u2019s acts, since it does not appear that the latter assumed to act for the former. Kirchner v. Schmid, 7 Misc. Rep. 455, 460, 25 N. Y. Supp. 85. The remaining evidence in support of the defense was that after the appellant took title he personally agreed to give \u201cthe lease\u201d at $80 a month, and at that time, in the respondent\u2019s presence, drew a lease of the premises No. 197 Worth street, which lease the respondent took away with him for examination. That instrument was never executed by either party, and, furthermore, was repudiated by the respondent because it did not embrace the premises 197J. It thus appears that there was a complete failure of proof that the appellant at any time agreed to lease the premises in suit\u2014197J Worth street\u2014to the respondent. The respondent failed to show that these premises were in the contemplation of both parties, and the appellant\u2019s understanding was clearly set forth in the written proposed lease, drawn at the time of the alleged oral agreement. The aggregatio mentium essential to a valid contract was conspicuously .wanting. Final order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
