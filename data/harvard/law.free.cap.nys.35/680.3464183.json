No objection to the sureties was made, and the justice retained the undertaking, but refused to discontinue the action, which refusal forms the appellants\u2019 chief grievance upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">If the answer was in proper form, the justice\u2019s retention of the undertaking sufficed to oust him of jurisdiction (Harding v. Ellston, [Co. Ct.] 13 N. Y. Supp. 549; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2954; Consolidation Act, \u00a7 1286, subd. 1); and therefore the judgment must be reversed if compliance with section 2951 of the Code, as to the form of the pleading, is disclosed. The defendant is required by that section to set forth in his answer \u201cfacts showing that the title to real property will come in question,\u201d and \u201ctitle\u201d in this connection means \u201cright of possession.\u201d Dunster v. Kelly, 110 N. Y. 561, 18 N. E. 361; Heintz v. Dellinger, 28 How. Prac. 39; Ehle v. Quackenboss, 6 Hill, 537. The \u201cright of possession\u201d was certainly a material question in this action; and, there being an allegation that defendants were the \u201cowners in fee\u201d of the premises at the time of the alleged trespass, the answer sufficiently raised an issue of \u201ctitle,\u201d without further particularity as to surrounding circumstances. Abb. Trial Brief, tit. \u201cPleadings,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 356, 956, and cases cited. It results that the judgment must be reversed, with costs, and the cause -remanded to the court below, for removal into the supreme court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
