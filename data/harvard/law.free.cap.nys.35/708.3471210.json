Upon his direct examination, Water-low, called for.the plaintiff as an expert^touching fee and rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>values, was asked: \u201cCan you state more specifically what that difficulty has been in renting property on Sixth avenue since the erection of the elevated road, as compared with a period before its erection on Sixth avenue north of 42d street?\u201d The question did not necessarily call for hearsay testimony, and the objection of the defendants\u2019 counsel upon that ground was therefore properly overruled. The witness, however, answered: \u201cThere would be the objection of parties who applied to rent apartments. When I tell them I have certain property on the line of Sixth avenue, mentioning different places, they would state\u2014on an average, three, probably, out of every five, at least\u2014that they would not live along that line with the nuisance of the road running there.\u201d The record as printed reads: \u201cThere would be the objection to parties,\u201d etc., but by oral stipulation of counsel in open court, upon the argument of the appeal, the record was corrected as above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The motion of the defendants\u2019 counsel to strike the last-mentioned answer out as hearsay; should have been granted. Mooney v. Railroad Co. (Com. Pl.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 522; Saxton v. Railroad Co. (Super. N. Y.) 18 N. Y. Supp. 188. The statements of the persons applying to rent apartments, more particularly in premises other than those in suit, were not admissible as part of the res gestae. They were in no sense concomitant with any fact in issue, which latter the statements would serve to illustrate. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 108 et seq.; 1 Rice, Ev. p. 375, \u00a7 212; Underh. Ev. \u00a7 54 et seq.; Waldele v. Railroad, 95 N. Y. 274; People v. O\u2019Neill, 112 N. Y. 355, 361, 19 N. E. 796. The witness\u2019 entire answer was affected with the vice alluded to. Hence, it cannot be successfully urged that the motion of the defendants\u2019 counsel was properly denied, because it comprehended the elimination of matter which was not open to the objection stated. Again, the objectionable testimony bore upon a material point,\u2014the agency of the defendants\u2019 elevated railroad in the lessening of the rental value of the plaintiff\u2019s premises,\u2014and from the record we are unable to say that the testimony found no lodgment in the mind of the referee, and that it was not considered by him prejudicially to the defendants in reaching the conclusions made and required in support of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to the appellant\u00bb to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
