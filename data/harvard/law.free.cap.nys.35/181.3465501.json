Plaintiff sold and delivered the chattel to one Magnus, the sale being conditional upon the payment of the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>chase price, title to remain in the vendor meanwhile; those terms being expressed in a bill of sale, which was never placed upon record. Magnus subsequently mortgaged this chattel to Hartman, Goldsmith &amp; Co., as security for the payment of certain promissory notes held by that firm; they promising, in return, to forbear suit upon one of the notes, which was lately due and protested. It does not appear that such forbearance was to endure for any fixed period. Upon foreclosure of the mortgage, defendant purchased the chattel, and on his refusal of plaintiff\u2019s demand for its return this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The judgment in favor of the plaintiff was based upon the theory that the defendant\u2019s vendors were not mortgagees \u201cin good faith,\u201d such mortgagees alone being protected by the statute which declares that \u201call conditions and reservations which provide that the ownership of such goods and chattels is to remain in the person so contracting to sell the same, or other person than the person so contracting to buy them, until said goods or chattels are paid for, or until the occurring of any future event or contingency, shall be absolutely void as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, and as to them the sale shall be deemed absolute, unless such a contract for sale with such conditions and reservations therein, or a \u2019true copy thereof, shall be filed as directed in the succeeding section of this act.\u201d Laws 1884, c. 315, \u00a7 1. We agree with counsel for the appellant that the promise to forbear suit upon the note matured, and at the time enforceable against the mortgagor, constituted the mortgagees such \u201cfor value\u201d; and,though such forbearance was not to endure for any fixed time, the agreement was to be construed to imply forbearance for a reasonable time, the measure of which time was. supplied by the circumstances of the particular case. Bank v. Parker, 130 N. Y. 415, 29 N. E. 1094. But that the mortgagees were such \u201cfor value\u201d alone did not constitute them mortgagees \u201cin good faith.\u201d It was requisite to invest them with the latter quality that at the time of the taking of the mortgage the mortgagees acted in honest ignorance of the adverse claim of the plaintiff to the mortgaged chattel. 8 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, p. 161; Bronner v. Loomis, 17 Hun, 442; Institution v. Duryea, 67 N. Y. 84. Obviously, if the mortgagees, though parting at the time with adequate consideration therefor, accepted the mortgage with notice of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, and with intent to defeat his claim to the mortgaged chattel, or to secure some advantage over him, they were not such \u201cin good faith.\u201d To say that a man takes in good faith when he acts with notice, and, of course, under conscious hostility to another, who has before taken a similar title, would be a legal solecism. The object of the statute here is that of all the other registry acts,\u2014to prevent imposition upon subsequent purchasers and mortgagees, who must many times govern themselves by appearances. When everything is actually explained to them, they have the best kind of notice, and must be holden to take subject to the prior incumbrance. Gregory v. Thomas, 20 Wend. 17, 19. For omission to file the contract, or a copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>thereof, th'e statute declares that the sale shall be deemed absolute only as to subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith. \u201cGood faith,\u201d therefore, is the tabula in naufragia of the mortgagees who claim in hostility to the vendor\u2019s otherwise superior rights. With its invocation by them, the mortgagees, and all persons claiming under them, necessarily assert that they are of the class of persons the statute designs to protect; and assuming, as they do, the affirmative in that regard, the burden of proving their \u201cgood faith\u201d rests upon them. Abb. Tr. Ev. 715,- and cases there cited. Without proof of their \u201cgood faith,\u201d the statute has no application to them. Upon the trial of this action, however, the-defendant utterly failed, even of the attempt, to show that at the time his vendors took the mortgage they were without notice of the plaintiff\u2019s rights to the mortgaged chattel, and the record of the appeal is destitute of- all evidence from which the absence of such notice can be inferred. A judgment for the plaintiff, therefore, for the value of the chattel, was the only conclusion which was warranted by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">By stipulation of counsel, which apnears in the trial minutes, the value of the chattel in suit was fixed at $100, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff in that amount. \u00a1Nothing in the record indicates that the value of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the chattel was reduced by payments on account of the purchase money which Magnus had agreed to pay. Hence the contention that the judgment was excessive is without surroort.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Lastly, it is urged for reversal that there was no proof of default in payment on Magnus\u2019 part, and, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s right to the possession of the chattel, at the time of his demand for its return, did not appear. This position is in conflict with the one assumed by the defendant upon the trial, which conceded \"the plaintiff\u2019s right to possession, except as against the defendant\u2019s vendors as mortgagees \u201cin good faith,\u201d and those claiming title under them. The position last assumed is for that reason unavailing. Fay v. Muhlker, 1 Misc. Rep. 321, 323, 20 N. Y. Supp. 671, and cases cited. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
