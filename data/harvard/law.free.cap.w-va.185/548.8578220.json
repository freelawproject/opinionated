By order dated September 20, 1990, the Circuit Court of Mercer County set aside a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs below, Wilma J. Peak and David C. Peak, her husband, for injuries sustained by Mrs. Peak when the car she was driving collided with a pickup truck driven by David Brian Akers. At the time, Mr. Akers was being pursued by members of the West Virginia Department of Public Safety (the Department).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The circuit court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of liability on the part of the police officers and entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">The accident giving rise to this proceeding occurred in the late afternoon of September 15, 1987, near the intersection of State Route 19/33, also known as Glen-wood Road, and U.S. Route 460 in Mercer County. Trooper Jerold E. Ratliff and Corporal Ralph Daniel Fulknier, members of the Department, were engaged in a high-speed vehicular pursuit of Mr. Akers, a burglary suspect who had previously eluded capture by the police, on Glenwood Road. As they approached the intersection with Route 460, the vehicle driven by Mr. Akers entered the oncoming lane of traffic and collided head-on with the car driven by Mrs. Peak, seriously injuring her. The po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>lice vehicle driven by Trooper Ratliff was not involved in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">On September 20, 1988, the plaintiffs instituted a civil action in the Circuit Court of Mercer County against Mr. Akers, Trooper Ratliff, and the Department. The complaint alleged that Trooper Ratliff was negligent and acted in reckless disregard of the safety of the public in initiating and continuing a high-speed pursuit of Mr. Ak-ers and that such actions were the proximate cause of Mrs. Peak\u2019s injuries. Suit was brought against the Department on grounds of <em>respondeat superior.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Mr. Ak-ers filed a cross-claim on the same grounds, alleging that the fault of Trooper Ratliff and the Department equaled or exceeded his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On August 7, 1990, trial commenced on the issue of liability alone. Mr. Akers admitted fault. The defendants moved for directed verdicts at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief and at the end of all the evidence. Both motions were denied. On August 9, 1990, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, finding the Department, through Trooper Ratliff, guilty of acting in reckless disregard of the safety of Mrs. Peak. The jury allocated 80 percent of the fault to Mr. Akers and 20 percent to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">On August 16, 1990, Trooper Ratliff and the Department filed with the court a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, alleging that the evidence was insufficient to permit a finding that they had acted in reckless disregard of the safety of the public. By order dated September 20, 1990, the circuit court granted the motion. The plaintiffs and Mr. Akers now appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">The threshold issue on appeal is whether a cause of action exists against Trooper Ratliff and the Department. The plaintiffs recognize that their claims rest on an interpretation of our emergency vehicle statute, W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5 (1971). This statute permits the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle, including a police officer in vehicular pursuit of known or suspected lawbreakers, to disregard certain traffic regulations when responding to an emergency call with warning lights and/or sirens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute also provides, however, that \u201c[t]he foregoing provisions shall not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.\" W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">This provision, which is common to the statutes of other states, appears to contain a dual standard of care. The provision states that the driver of an emergency vehicle has the \u201cduty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons,\u201d implying a negligence standard. However, this is followed by the statement that the driver is not protected \u201cfrom the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.\u201d This language clearly suggests that the emergency driver is accountable only for reckless acts or gross negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Most courts which have considered emergency vehicle statutes similar to ours have not commented on this dichotomy. In <em>Thornton v. Shore, </em>283 Kan. 737, 666 P.2d 655 (1983), the Kansas Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cdue care\u201d requirement \u201capplies exclusively to the operation of the emergency vehicle itself,\u201d and declined to apply the reckless disregard standard to a police officer who was sued after a vehicle he was pursuing crashed into a third vehicle, killing the occupants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court concluded that a police officer \u201cis not liable, as a matter of law, for reckless and negligent acts committed by the fleeing law violator.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One of the dissenting justices pointed out that while the majority had recognized the provisions of its emergency vehicle statute which imply liability on the part of an emergency vehicle driver for the consequences of his reckless or grossly negligent conduct,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it had failed to apply those provisions in the <em>Thornton </em>case. 233 Kan. at 757-58, 666 P.2d at 670 (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\"A police officer operating his emergency vehicle in compliance with K.S.A. 8-1506(d) while pursuing a law violator is granted privileges and immunities by the statute and is not liable, as a matter of law, for reckless and negligent acts committed by the fleeing law</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">The approach used in <em>Thornton </em>and followed by several other courts bypasses the statutory language suggesting a \u201creckless disregard\u201d standard of care and focuses on the police officer\u2019s right to pursue and on a proximate cause analysis. In <em>Thornton, </em>the following language was quoted from <em>Roll v. Timberman, </em>94 N.J.Super. 530, 536, 229 A.2d 281, 284, <em>certif. denied, </em>50 N.J. 84, 232 A.2d 147 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">\u201c \u2018The reasoning which underlies the rejection of liability in these cases is twofold: (1) it is the duty of a police officer to apprehend those whose reckless driving makes use of the highway dangerous to others; (2) the proximate cause of the accident is the reckless driving of the pursued, notwithstanding recognition of the fact that the police pursuit contributed to the pursued\u2019s reckless driving.\u2019 \u201d 233 Kan. at 748, 666 P.2d at 664.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-13\"><em>See also Chambers v. Ideal Pure Milk Co., </em>245 S.W.2d 589 (Ky.1952); <em>Jackson v. Olson, </em>77 Or.App. 41, 712 P.2d 128 (1985), <em>review denied, </em>300 Or. 605, 717 P.2d 1182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>(1986); <em>Nevill v. City of Tullahoma, </em>756 S.W.2d 226 (Tenn.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Other jurisdictions have recognized that the duty of the police to pursue law violators must be balanced with a duty of care to the public. Typical of the reasoning of these courts is this language from <em>Tetro v. Town of Stratford, </em>189 Conn. 601, 609, 458 A.2d 5, 9-10 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201cOther courts, construing similar statutory language, have explained that emergency vehicle legislation provides only limited shelter from liability for negligence. The effect of the statute is merely to displace the conclusive presumption of negligence that ordinarily arises from the violation of traffic rules. The statute does not relieve operators of emergency vehicles from their general duty to exercise due care for the safety of others. <em>Brummett v. County of Sacramento, </em>21 Cal.3d 880, 886-87, [148 Cal.Rptr. 361,] 582 P.2d 952 (1978); <em>City of Sacramento v. Superior Court of the State of California, </em>[131 Cal.App.3d 395, 182 Cal.Rptr. 443 (1982) ]; <em>Mason v. Bitton, </em>[85 Wash.2d 321, 534 P.2d 1360 (1975)].\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\"><em>See also Fiser v. City of Ann Arbor, </em>417 Mich. 461, 339 N.W.2d 413 (1983); <em>Lee v. City of Omaha, </em>209 Neb. 345, 307 N.W.2d 800 (1981); <em>Stanton v. State, </em>29 A.D.2d 612, 285 N.Y.S.2d 964 (1967), <em>aff'd </em>26 N.Y.2d 990, 311 N.Y.S.2d 28, 259 N.E.2d 494 (1970). However, these courts appear to focus exclusively on the \u201cdue care\u201d language of their emergency motor vehicle statute and make no reference to the \u201creckless disregard\u201d provisions of their statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Our most factually analogous case is <em>McClanahan v. Putnam County Commission, </em>174 W.Va. 478, 327 S.E.2d 458 (1985). In <em>McClanahan, </em>an ambulance driver responding to an emergency traveled left of center and collided with another vehicle, injuring the driver. We recognized that while the emergency vehicle driver may be exempt from complying with certain traffic regulations pursuant to W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(b), the driver can still be liable for failure to exercise due regard within the meaning of W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(d). As we stated in Syllabus Point 4 of <em>McClanahan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\">\u201cBy virtue of W.Va.Code, 17G-2-5(d), the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle is not relieved of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">We emphasize that in <em>McClanahan </em>the collision involved the emergency vehicle itself. In <em>McClanahan, </em>we did not attempt an overall analysis of our emergency statute, nor did we attempt to interpret the applicability of the reckless disregard language in subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">Historically, in any statutory analysis, we have endeavored to interpret a statute so as to give meaning to each part, as we stated in Syllabus Point 3 of <em>State ex rel. Fetters v. Hott, </em>173 W.Va. 501, 318 S.E.2d 446 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-15\">\u201c \u2018In ascertaining legislative intent, effect must be given to each part of the statute and to the statute as a whole so as to accomplish the general purpose of the legislation.\u2019 Syl. Pt. 2, <em>Smith v. State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commissioner, </em>159 W.Va. 108, 219 S.E.2d 361 (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">As we have earlier indicated, there is an apparent disparity between the \u201cdue regard\u201d and \u201creckless disregard\u201d standards contained in subsection (d) of our emergency vehicle statute. This disparity is more apparent than real if we consider the various provisions that exist with regard to emergency vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-17\">It may be assumed that an emergency vehicle driver will have had some specialized training in the operations of his vehicle. Under W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5, the emergency vehicle operator is shielded against liability arising from violations of the ordinary motor vehicle statutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the operator is in control of the vehicle, it is reasonable to impose a \u201cdue care\u201d standard on him and to hold him liable for violating that standard where the emergency vehicle is involved in the collision. <em>McClanahan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">This conclusion is reinforced by the provisions of W.Va.Code, 17C-9-5 (1971), which require the drivers of other vehicles to yield the right-of-way when an emergency vehicle approaches with its lights and sirens or other audible signal in operation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> W.Va.Code, 17C-9-5(b), specifies that these provisions do not relieve the operator of the emergency vehicle \u201cfrom the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway.\u201d <em>See Davis v. Cross, </em>152 W.Va. 540, 164 S.E.2d 899 (1968). This section does not contain the \u201creckless disregard\u201d provisions which appear in W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(d). It is reasonable to conclude that this omission in the more specific right-of-way statute indicates that the legislature was concerned solely with the operation of the emergency vehicle vis-a-vis other vehicles and elected to impose a general due care standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This conclusion becomes more apparent when we turn to the general emergency vehicle statute. W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(a), specifically identifies an emergency situation as including \u201cthe pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law.\u201d The appearance of the reckless disregard standard in the more general emergency vehicle statute, W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(d), suggests that this higher measure of liability was reserved by the legislature for collisions other than those involving the emergency vehicle itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Common sense dictates that a different standard ought to apply when officers are in pursuit of a lawbreaker who, in the ensuing chase, collides with and injures a third party. The duty to pursue and apprehend law violators should not be fettered by the specter of secondary liability based on a due care standard. It is the law violator who, in his efforts to escape justice, collides with the third party and directly causes the injuries. Only when the officer is guilty of gross negligence or reckless conduct in the pursuit that causes or contributes to the collision by the lawbreaker should liability attach. For this reason, we decline to follow those courts that impose the \u201cdue care\u201d standard illustrated by the Connecticut case of <em>Tetro. </em>They have apparently ignored the \u201creckless disregard\u201d language that plainly appears in their emergency vehicle statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">However, we also reject the standard set out by the Kansas Supreme Court in <em>Thornton, </em>which gives total immunity to the pursuing officer. We concede that the police have an obligation to apprehend law violators, but we do not accept the thesis that in so doing police officers are completely immune from liability for their actions in conducting vehicular pursuits of such violators.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Moreover, we do not agree with the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the lawbreaker, in attempting to avoid arrest, is the only party responsible for the injuries arising from a collision between the pursued vehicle and that of a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>party. We have recognized that it is possible for more than one party to contribute to an accident, as we explained in Syllabus Point 6 of <em>Burdette v. Maust Coal &amp; Coke Corp., </em>159 W.Va. 335, 222 S.E.2d 293 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">\u201c \u2018In a concurrent negligence case, the negligence of the defendant need not be the sole cause of the injury, it being sufficient that it was one of the efficient causes thereof, without which the injury would not have resulted; but it must appear that the negligence of the person sought to be charged was responsible for at least one of the causes resulting in the injury.\u2019 <em>Syllabus </em>point 5, <em>Long v. City of Weirton, </em>[158 W.Va. 741], 214 S.E.2d 832 (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Nor does the fact that a law violator\u2019s actions were the immediate cause of the third party\u2019s injuries necessarily absolve the pursuing officer of liability if the officer\u2019s reckless conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the ultimate collision. We spoke to this general concept in Syllabus Point 13 of <em>Anderson v. Moulder, </em>183 W.Va. 77, 394 S.E.2d 61 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cA tortfeasor whose negligence is a substantial factor in bringing about injuries is not relieved from liability by the intervening acts of third persons if those acts were reasonably foreseeable by the original tortfeasor at the time of his negligent conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The fact that the applicable standard of care is \u201creckless disregard\u201d rather than \u201cdue care\u201d does not affect these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Our position is not unlike that of the Supreme Court of North Carolina in <em>Bullins v. Schmidt, </em>322 N.C. 580, 369 S.E.2d 601 (1988). The North Carolina statute applicable in <em>Bullins </em>dealt specifically with pursuit of law violators and contained both \u201cdue regard\u201d and \u201creckless disregard\u201d provisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court held that the due regard provision was applicable where the officer\u2019s car collided with another person or property, but that the reckless disregard provision came into play when the violator being chased collided with a third party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">\u201cThis Court has established the standard of care where the conduct of an officer in the chase or apprehension of a law violator results in the <em>officer\u2019s </em>vehicle colliding with another person, vehicle, or object. The officer is held to the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the discharge of official duties of a like nature under like circumstances....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">\u201c... The last sentence of [N.C.Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-145 (Supp.1987)] establishes as the public policy of North Carolina that if an officer\u2019s conduct under the facts of this case is determined to be grossly negligent, then the statute does not protect him and he may be liable for damages proximately resulting from such gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">\u201c... Where the officer\u2019s vehicle does not collide with another person, vehicle, or object under these conditions, the policy of the state is that liability cannot attach unless the officer\u2019s conduct constitutes gross or wanton negligence.\u201d 322 N.C. at 582-83, 369 S.E.2d at 603. (Emphasis in original; citations omitted). violators of the law or of persons charged with or suspected of any such violation.... <em>This exemption shall not, however, protect the driver of any such vehicle from the consequence of a reckless disregard of the safety of others.\" </em>(Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af1\">We are in agreement with these principles. They parallel our holding in <em>McCla-nahan, </em>where we concluded that W.Va. Code, 17C-2-5(d), requires the driver of an emergency vehicle to exercise due care under the circumstances to avoid collisions between the emergency vehicle and persons or property. As our statutory analysis reveals, where the police are engaged in a vehicular pursuit of a known or suspected law violator, and the pursued vehicle collides with the vehicle of a third party, under W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5, the pursuing officer is not liable for injuries to the third party arising out of the collision unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>officer\u2019s conduct in the pursuit amounted to reckless conduct or gross negligence and was a substantial factor in bringing about the collision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">What type of conduct is reckless or amounts to gross negligence in a pursuit context cannot be determined by a simple formula. Courts have indicated a number of factors that can be considered, such as the length, characteristics, and speed of the pursuit; the area of the pursuit, whether rural or urban; the highway characteristics such as curves or no passing zones; the presence of pedestrians and traffic; weather and visibility; and the seriousness of the law violation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>E.g., Myers v. Town of Harrison, </em>438 F.2d 293 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 828, 92 S.Ct. 64, 30 L.Ed.2d 57 (1971); <em>Fiser v. City of Ann Arbor, supra; Kuzmics v. Santiago, </em>256 Pa.Super. 35, 389 A.2d 587 (1978). <em>Cf. DeWald v. State, </em>719 P.2d 643 (Wyo.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In this case, the trial court did, through its instructions, properly set the standard as one of reckless disregard or gross negligence. The jury found liability, but the trial court determined that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the conduct of the pursuing officers was in reckless disregard of the safety of others and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The sufficiency of the evidence in a civil case is tested by the standard set out in Syllabus Point 6 of <em>McClung v. Marion County Commission, </em>178 W.Va. 444, 360 S.E.2d 221 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether there is sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict the court should: (1) consider the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party; (2) assume that all conflicts in the evidence were resolved by the jury in favor of the prevailing party; (3) assume as proved all facts which the prevailing party\u2019s evidence tends to prove; and (4) give to the prevailing party the benefit of all favorable inferences which reasonably may be drawn from the facts proved.\u2019 Syl. pt. 5, <em>Orr v. Crowder, </em>[173] W.Va. [335], 315 S.E.2d 593 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 981, 105 S.Ct. 384, 83 L.Ed.2d 319 (1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">In <em>McClung, </em>we also made the following statements with regard to motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\">\u201cA motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to <em>W. Va. R.Civ.P. </em>50(b) provides the trial court with an opportunity, after the jury has been discharged, to reconsider its previous refusal to grant a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all of the evidence. The same factors as to the sufficiency of the evidence which are examined in deciding a motion for a directed verdict apply also when ruling upon a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Accordingly, in a case where the evidence is such that the jury could have properly found for either party upon the factual issues, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should not be granted. <em>Morgan v. Bottome, </em>170 W.Va. 23, 24, 289 S.E.2d 469, 470 (1982). <em>Accord </em>M. Lugar and L. Silverstein, <em>West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure </em>379-80, 375 (1960).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-16\">\u201cFinally, the action of the trial court in setting aside a jury verdict, while entitled to peculiar weight on appeal, will, nevertheless, be reversed where a consideration of all of the evidence clearly shows a proper case for jury determination. <em>See </em>syl. pt. 2, <em>Utter v. United Hospital Center, Inc., </em>160 W.Va. 703, 236 S.E.2d 213 (1977).\u201d 178 W.Va. at 454, 360 S.E.2d at 231. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Viewed in this light, the evidence presented below showed that at about 5:30 p.m. on September 15, 1987, an anonymous caller advised the Princeton Detachment of the State Police that Mr. Akers was driving towards Princeton on Route 20 in a pickup truck that had been reported stolen in Virginia earlier that day. Mr. Akers was a suspect in a series of burglaries in Mercer, Monroe, and Summers Counties, and warrants had been issued for his arrest on charges of burglary and grand larceny in Virginia and Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">In addition, Mr. Akers had been the subject of a high-speed pursuit by the Princeton city police the previous evening on Route 460, a four-lane highway. Trooper Ratliff and Corporal Fulknier had joined in the pursuit at the request of the Princeton police. The chase ended when the vehicle Mr. Akers was driving crossed the median and two lanes of opposing traffic and ran off the road. Several passengers in the vehicle were apprehended, but Mr. Akers escaped on foot. The vehicle was discovered to have been stolen and was found to contain various items of stolen property, illicit drugs, and a firearm. Trooper Ratliff and Corporal Fulknier spent the better part of the night interviewing witnesses and attempting to locate Mr. Akers. They also knew that Mr. Akers had previously been convicted of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Trooper Ratliff and Corporal Fulknier were dispatched to investigate the anonymous tip. With Trooper Ratliff driving, the two officers proceeded in an unmarked police car towards Glenwood Road. Both officers were familiar with this road, a two-lane secondary road running past residential areas, side streets, some businesses, a golf course, and a school. The area is characterized by the appellants as residential. In places where the road is hilly and twisting, there is no passing, and the maximum speed limit is 35 miles per hour. In addition, there are several straight stretches where the speed limit is 45 miles per hour. Although traffic on the day in question was not characterized as heavy, it appears that many people use Glenwood Road at that time of day on their way home from work. Mrs. Peak testified that on previous occasions she had seen children playing alongside the road at that time of day, although there was no evidence that any children were present on September 15, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">As they approached the intersection of Route 20 on Glenwood Road, the officers observed a truck matching the description of the stolen vehicle turn onto Glenwood Road and drive towards them. As the truck passed them, the officers recognized the driver as Mr. Akers. When Trooper Ratliff started to turn the police car around, Mr. Akers accelerated. The officers turned on their lights and siren,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> radioed to the detachment that they were pursuing Mr. Akers, and requested that a roadblock be established at the intersection of Glenwood Road and Route 460, approximately 2.5 miles away.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Mr. Akers\u2019 speed in the course of the chase was estimated at between 60 and 100 miles per hour. On several occasions, Trooper Ratliff and Corporal Fulknier saw Mr. Akers pass slower moving vehicles in blind curves and force oncoming traffic off the road. On such occasions the officers slowed down and waited for preceding traffic to move to the side of the road before continuing the chase. Mr. Akers stated that the police vehicle was never more than 100 yards behind him, although from time to time, the officers lost sight of the Akers vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">As he rounded the final curve before the intersection of Glenwood Road and Route 460, Mr. Akers saw a line of cars waiting to enter the four-lane highway. Out of the sight of Trooper Ratliff and Corporal Fulk-nier, Mr. Akers crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic with the intention of passing through a corner gas station and entering Route 460 from the other side. The vehicle driven by Mr. Akers collided head-on with the car driven by Mrs. Peak. Trooper Ratliff and Corporal Fulknier arrived on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>scene seconds later. Mr. Akers and an independent witness testified that both officers concerned themselves with Mr. Akers and that neither attempted to assist Mrs. Peak for several minutes. The entire pursuit lasted less than five minutes. Sergeant Roger Bright, who was en route to set up the road block at the intersection, arrived shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Analyzing the foregoing facts, we find no justification for disturbing the trial court\u2019s final ruling. Trooper Ratliff and Corporal Fulknier were confronted with a serious law violator who had escaped capture in a vehicular pursuit the previous evening. The officers knew of Mr. Akers\u2019 past record and the fact that the vehicle he abandoned on September 14, 1987, contained a weapon and drugs. Both vehicles driven by Mr. Akers on these two days were stolen. The officers were familiar with the road on which the pursuit was conducted. There was good visibility during the chase and no inclement weather which would make the road hazardous. Even though the speed was estimated at between 60 and 100 miles per hour, the officers were careful to slow down when passing cars. There were no pedestrians, and the traffic was moderate. The pursuit lasted only a brief period of time. It does not appear that the officers forced the pursuit by attempting to overtake Mr. Akers or by forcing him off the roadway. Neither officer attempted to fire his weapon, an act which might cause a fleeing suspect to panic. When Mr. Akers crossed the center line and drove into the filling station where the collision occurred, the officers were not in sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In these circumstances, we believe the trial court was correct in holding that the officers\u2019 conduct did not constitute gross negligence. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the final order of the Circuit Court of Mercer County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">.

We use the term \u201cshielded\" in a limited sense because while W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(b), identifies the rules of the road which the emergency vehicle driver may disregard, it still requires some cautionary conduct on his part. For instance, W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(b)(2), allows an emergency vehicle to proceed past stop signs or red lights, \"but only after slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation.\u201d W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(b)(3), allows the driver to exceed the speed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>limit \"so long as he does not endanger life or property.\u201d W.Va.Code, 17C-2-5(a), defines the type of emergency in which the statute applies.
