W. McLeod executed a deed of trust of all her property, to be held for Nellie Boynton, payable to her at the rate of $120 a year and the balance upon the decease of the grantor, and Mrs. Boynton gave a bond to support Mrs. McLeod during the latter\u2019s life. The deed of trust provided that the trust fund might be used to buy a farm for Mrs. Boynton, if she would mortgage the same to secure performance of her bond. A farm was purchased and deeded to Mrs. Boynton, and she and her husband, who is one of the defendants, gave a mortgage to Mrs. McLeod conditioned on the performance by Mrs. Boynton, her heirs, executors, and administrators, of her bond for support. Mrs. Boynton died in 1897, and Mrs. McLeod continued to live with the surviving husband, under an arrangement with the administrator, for over two years. She then left without excuse or justification, unless, as matter of law, there was a breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>bond caused by the death of Mrs. Boynton. Mrs. McLeod is dead, and the plaintiff is her administrator.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-3\"><em>James L. Wilson </em>and <em>Jewell, Owen ft Veazey, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-4\"><em>Shannon \u00a7 </em>Tilton, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b558-5\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMk\">The only question of law raised by the plaintiff\u2019s exception is whether the death of Mrs. Boynton in the lifetime of Mrs. McLeod constituted a breach of the condition of a mortgage which provided that if Mrs. Boynton, her heirs, executors, and administrators, should comply with the condition of a bond to support Mrs. McLeod for life, the conveyance should be void. The plaintiff contends that this agreement so far partakes of the nature of a contract made with reference to the continued existence of a particular person or thing <em>(Clarksville Land Co. </em>v. <em>Harriman, </em>68 N. H. 374; <em>Eliot Bank </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>141 Mass. 566, 570; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>3 B. &amp; S. 826, 839) that the death of Mrs. Boynfon terminated it. It is .clear, however, that his contention is not well founded. If contracts of this kind are so far personal that the one who is to furnish the home cannot, when the contract is silent in respect to the matter, assign his interest in it to a stranger without the consent of the other party <em>(Flanders </em>v. <em>Lamphear, </em>9 N. H. 201; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>13 N. H. 9; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>36 N. H. 141; <em>Bethlehem </em>v. <em>Annis, </em>40 N. H. 34; <em>Gotham </em>v. <em>Gotham, </em>55 N. H. 440; <em>Winch </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>62 N. H. 427), still, when the contract provides for such a contingency it is both the right and duty of the administrator to perform it; for in such \u2022cases, upon the death of the coiitractor the duty of providing the home devolves upon his administrator and is a charge upon the \u25a0estate. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>13 N. H. 9, 12; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>36 N. H. 141, 150; <em>Bethlehem </em>v. <em>Annis, </em>40 N. H. 34, 42. The death of Mrs. Boynton in the lifetime of Mrs. McLeod did not, therefore, constitute a default in the condition of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. <em>Exception overruled.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b558-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
