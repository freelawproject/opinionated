Transferred from the September term, 1905, of the superior court by Chamberlin, J. Facts agreed. The deed purported to convey several tracts of woodland. Without the knowledge of either party one of the lots was described twice, which made the entire acreage of the land conveyed appear in the deed to be more than it was. Since the date of the deed, the plaintiffs have cut off the wood and timber from the premises.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-9\"><em>William S. </em>Pierce, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-10\"><em>Creorge P.

Having obtained a deed which by inadvertence describes one part of the land twice, it is not perceived how the plaintiffs\u2019 position would be improved by a decree in equity reforming the description in the deed by striking out the superfluous part thereof. If the deed conveys to them the land they bought, the fact that it describes the land more than once is immaterial, so far as they are concerned. Such a decree would obviously be unnecessary and legally useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-13\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
