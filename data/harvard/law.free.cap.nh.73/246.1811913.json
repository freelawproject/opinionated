Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. Transferred from the September term,. 1904, of the superior court by <em>Stone, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\">August 28, 1903, there was a collision between two of the defendants\u2019 cars, upon one of which the plaintiff was riding, in consequence of which she claimed to have sustained physical injuries. Whether she was injured by the collision was the issue tried. Upon the cross-examination of one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, a physician, the defendants\u2019 counsel asked him about the relative authority of certain medical writers on nervous diseases and inquired of him if he would produce in court the work of a certain specialist. Thereupon the court remarked: \u201c I guess we wo n\u2019t go into a comparison of. books. If they do n\u2019t give us any more information than some law books do, we sha n\u2019t get much from them.\u201d To this remark the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-10\">The defendants, having introduced evidence that the shock from the collision was slight and that no other passenger was injured, offered to show that no passenger on either car had complained to them of having been injured, and that no other claim for damages for such injury had been brought against them. The evidence was excluded, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-11\"><em>William F. Nason, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-12\"><em>John Nivel, Samuel W Emery, </em>and <em>George T.

But as it was conditional in form, and as it was not even the statement of a fact, it could have conveyed no information to the jury as to the reliability of medical theories advanced by the medical witnesses. The court in effect said that he did not know whether much information could be derived from medical books \u2014 a statement which was plainly immaterial and harmless. <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Electric Co., </em>68 N.
