Facts found by <em>Chamberlin, J., </em>at the September term, 1904, of the superior court, and transferred without a ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-10\">Carter owned a lot of land forty-eight feet in width, extending from Pine street in Nashua in an easterly direction 100 feet. November 10, 1869, he conveyed to Dufault the southerly twenty feet in width of the lot, of which the defendant has become the owner by mesne conveyances. There was no reservation of any right of way over the land thus conveyed. December 27, 1869, Carter conveyed to Larose the easterly thirty feet of the remaining\u2019 portion of the lot, \u201c with a right of way from Pine street over my [his] half of the driveway between my [his] land and land of Dufault.\u201d The plaintiff is the owner of this lot and right of way, whatever it may be. February 10, 1870, Carter conveyed to Duval the remainder of the land.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b637-11\"><em>Boyle </em>&lt;f' <em>Lucier, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b637-12\"><em>Henry B.
