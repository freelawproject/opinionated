Trial before <em>Pike, </em>J., at the May term, 1904, of the superior court, and decree for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-11\">The defendants reside in Massachusetts, and the plaintiff in this state. Prior to August 24, 1899, the plaintiff had talked with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Packard about trading a farm in Hillsborough for Massachusetts real estate. On that date the plaintiff met Packard in Boston, and agreed to deed the farm and pay $3,000 in cash for land in Brookline, Massachusetts, owned by Packard, if the latter would find a purchaser for the land. The land was mortgaged to one Rogers for $4,500, and the legal title was in one Hyde. Packard produced as a purchaser' one Peterson, and it was agreed by the three parties that Packard should have the Brookline land conveyed to Peterson, that the plaintiff should convey his farm and pay $3,000 to 'Packard, and that Peterson should give the plaintiff his note for the purchase price of the Brookline land, secured by a second mortgage of the premises. The conveyances necessary to effectuate this agreement were duly made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">Soon after these transactions Peterson went into bankruptcy and has obtained a discharge. The plaintiff foreclosed his mortgage in December, 1900, and remained in possession of the property until December, 1902, when the Rogers mortgage was foreclosed. The plaintiff filed this bill upon learning of the fraud which had been practiced upon him, but he did not offer to deliver the Peterson' note to Packard before doing so. The Brookline land was never worth more than the amount due on the Rogers mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">At the close of the evidence the defendants moved to dismiss the bill, on the ground that the plaintiff was not in a condition to return the consideration he received from Packard. The motion was denied, and they excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-7\"><em>Andrews Andrews </em>and <em>Taggart, Tuttle, Burroughs Wyman, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-8\"><em>William O.

He gave Packard his farm and $3,000 for that note. Since the note has not been paid and is in his possession, he is in a position to return the consideration he received for his farm, if equity requires that he should do so. It is unnecessary, both in this state and in Massachusetts, for the injured party to offer to return the consideration he has received before filing a bill to rescind a conveyance which was procured by fraud. That is, the making of an offer of restitution is not a condition precedent to the right to maintain such an action in either state, although such an offer is necessary in Massachusetts in order to maintain a possessory action to recover property obtained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>fraud. Neither is it necessary to make such an offer in the bill itself, for the court has power to impose the conditions upon which it will give relief. <em>Thomas </em>v. Beals, <em>154 </em>Mass. 51, 54. The court has power to compel \u201cthe plaintiff to do what he equitably ought to do.\u201d <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Stock </em>Exchange, 72 N. H. 315, 321. If such an order has not been made, the court can make it -at this time. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>67 N. H. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
