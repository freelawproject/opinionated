His counsel gave the state notice of the taking of depositions under section 13, chapter 225, Public Statutes. At the return of the caption it appeared that the defendant proposed to take the deposition of the principal witness for the state, and the solicitor objected. The justice ruled that the deposition be taken, and continued the caption pending a decision upon this petition. It was ruled in the superior court that the defendant had no right under the statute to take the deposition, and he excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Edward II.

At that time the defendant had simply been bound over to await the action of the grand jury. No indictment had' been found against him, and whether one ever would be was a question about which nothing could then be known. Section 18, chapter 225, of the Public Statutes, contemplates the pendency of a criminal action in which depositions are to be taken and used, the same as section 1 contemplates the pendency of a civil action when notice is given under it. <em>Bundy </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>50 N. H. 116, 120; <em>Kingsbury </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 N. H. 109; <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>4 N. H. 54. Until the defendant was indicted no criminal case was pending against him <em>(People </em>v. <em>Restell, </em>3 Hill 289, 294) ; and as no indictment had been found when the notice was given, the proceeding was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
