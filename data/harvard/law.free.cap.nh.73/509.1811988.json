Susie Temple conveyed the Perkins farm in Mont Yernon to Elnora Winn, by a warranty deed which contained the following clause: \u201cReserving the wood and timber standing on the following described piece of land: Beginning at the no. east corner of said woodlot, thence running south to stone wall; thence running southwesterly by said wall and land bout this day bought of said Temple; thence north by Henry G. Blood and Henry A. Hutchinson; thence east by land of Harry G. Blood and Charles II. Trow. Mrs. M. Susie Temple reserves the right of two years from May 1st, 1899, to remove the lumber and wood on lot above mentioned.\u201d This deed was recorded March 31, 1899. Hartshorn had previously bargained for the wood and timber, and Temple convoyed it to him on May 29, 1899, by a warranty deed which was recorded June 10, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>November 7, 1900, Winn conveyed the farm to Dyer by a warranty deed recorded the same day, which contained a clause u reserving all the wood and timber now standing or down on the following described piece of land,\u201d describing the same lot reserved in deed of Temple to Winn, and ending as follows: \u201c The above reserve was for two years limited to May 1st, 1901, with the right to enter upon and take away the same within the above limit.\u201d September 28, 1901, Dyer sold and conveyed the premises to Peebles, making no reservation-. Hartshorn cut a part of the wood and timber before May, 1901, and the remainder in February or March, 1902. At the May term, 1902, of the superior court, Peebles sued Dyer \u2014 the present plaintiff \u2014 for breach of covenant on account of the growth cut by Hartshorn in 1902, and recovered judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-5\"><em>Doyle </em>Lueier, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-6\"><em>Edgar I.

The fact that the deed provided for their removal from the land before May 1, 1901, did not render the title to them conditional, but made their continuance upon the land after that date unlawful. <em>Hoit </em>v. <em>Stratton Mills, </em>54 N. H. 109; <em>S. C., </em>54 N. H. 452; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Furbish, </em>68 N. H. 123, 130; <em>Irons </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>41 N. J. Law 203. By the reservation the trees were, in contemplation of law, severed from the granted land <em>(Kingsley </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>45 N. H. 313; <em>Hoit </em>v. <em>Stratton Mills, </em>54 N. H. 109), and as effectually transformed into personal property as though they had been actually severed. <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>43 N. H. 277; <em>Town </em>v. Hazen, 51 N. H. 596; <em>Stackpole </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>62 N. H. 493; <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>63 N. H. 57, 59. The plaintiff\u2019s grantor had no title to the trees and could transfer none. Neither teould she change the contract between herself and Temple. <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Flanders, ante, p. </em>345. The trees that were upon the land in February and March, 1902, were the property of the defendant. The plaintiff had then parted with her title and right to the possession of -the land. Not being the owner of the land or the trees when the alleged trespass was committed, she cannot maintain this action. The verdict was properly found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
