On November 5 he wrote as follows: \u201c I have examined your lot as I agreed to, and on account of owning-the adjoining lot I agree to take it at your price and enclose check for $100, that you may know it is a <em>Iona fide </em>trade, and the balance of the money I will send to you when the deed of conveyance is ready, or if you prefer will pay the balance to Mr. Pike Perkins-(as when I saw Mr. Perkins last he had your deeds), if you decide to have him arrange for making the deeds. I buy all the growth, with the usual logging and mill privileges and reasonable time to move the same.\u201d On the same date the plaintiff also wrote-to Perkins, who is referred to in the letters of both parties, as follows : \u201c I decided yesterday to take the Meader lot and wrote-her to that effect, enclosing $100, balance to be paid when deed is-ready.

The plaintiff\u2019s letter of November 5, in which lie says he had examined the defendant\u2019s lot and agrees to take it at her price, was not an unconditional acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer to sell the timber on the lot. While from the previous correspondence and the whole letter it may be plain that when the plaintiff said he would take the lot he could not be understood to include the land, nevertheless, unless it appeared that when the defendant said \u201c timber \u201d she meant, or could properly be understood to mean, what the plaintiff did by \u201cgrowth,\u201d the two propositions did not refer to the same subject-matter, the minds of the parties did not meet, and there was no contract. Unless the identity in meaning of these terms conclusively appeared or was conceded, the plaintiff\u2019s letter was a rejection of the defendant\u2019s offer and the submission of a new proposition. <em>Harris </em>v. Scott, 67 N. H. 437, 439; Benj. Sales, <em>s. </em>39; Chit. Cout. (10th Am. ed.) 8-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In England the term \u201ctimber\u201d does not include all kinds of wood. \u201c What kind of wood in England is deemed to be timber depends upon the custom of the country. Wood which in some counties is called timber is not so in others.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Brow</em>nson, 7 Johns. 227, 234; <em>Chandos </em>v. <em>Talbot, 2 </em>P. Wms. 601, 606; <em>Aubrey </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>10 East 416, 455; <em>Dashwood </em>v. <em>Magniac, </em>[1891] 3 Ch. 306, 351. In this country the term \u201c timber,\u201d when applied to standing trees, generally means such as are suitable for use in the erection of buildings or in the manufacture of tools, utensils, furniture, carriages, fences, ships, and the like. <em>Alcutt </em>v. <em>Bakin, </em>83 N. H. 507, 509. It is common knowledge that the product of a wood lot is generally capable of sale or use for these purposes, or for fire-wood. Trees which from their size or variety are unsuited for manufacturing purposes may be used for the latter purpose; while if not valuable from their location for use for fire, trees too small to be used in manufacture may be of value to the owner of the soil, if permitted to remain and grow. The word \u201c growth,\u201d for which the plaintiff stipulates, is plainly generic in meaning, and would include all the wood upon the lot. Whether there was other growth upon the lot except what would be properly included within the term \u201c timber \u201d does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">If all the standing trees upon the lot were of a size and kind suitable for manufacturing use, the terms used would be identical so far as this contract is concerned; for the word \u201c growth \u201d could not then have been understood to include anything but timber. The language used by the parties is not to be construed by arbitrary definitions of the words employed. The question always is; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>what did the terms employed mean to the parties using them? <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Green, </em>67 N. H. 557; <em>Wyndham </em>v. <em>Way, </em>4 Taunt. 316; <em>Bullen </em>v. <em>Denning, </em>5 B. &amp; C. 842. If there were competent evidence establishing that to the parties \u201c timber \u201d and \u201c growth \u201d were identical in meaning, the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance would not be rendered conditional by his use of a different word. But the case \u25a0discloses no evidence to that effect. The fact that the plaintiff considered it necessary to specify \u201c growth \u201d in his letter to the defendant, and to repeat the same term in his letter to Mr. Perkins, indicates that he understood that the defendant\u2019s offer of timber would not include all which he wished to get in his purchase. It also appears that the land was a farm upon which were buildings occupied by tenants. If there was wood or growth upon the farm not suitable for manufacture, but suitable for use as a supply for fire in the buildings upon the farm, such use of the firewood might be of value to the defendant in renting the farm; and it would not be probable that by the use of language generally excluding growth of such character, she intended under these circumstances to include it. If there was evidence tending to show that in this case the words \u201c timber \u201d and \u201c growth \u201d had identical meanings to the parties, or were from the character of the growth of the same effect, the burden was on the plaintiff to present it, and in the absence of the evidence he fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">But assuming that it can be shown that the words \u201c timber \u201d and \u201c growth,\u201d as used in the negotiations, were identical in meaning or effect, nevertheless the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance was still conditional, because he incorporated into it a provision that he should have the use of land for mill purposes. While an offer to sell timber may include the offer of reasonable time to cut and remove it, the case shows nothing upon which it can be held that such an offer includes the use of land for a mill. The plaintiff\u2019s letter was an acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer, upon condition that all the growth should be included and he should have the right to use the \u2022defendant\u2019s land for the operation of a mill to manufacture it. As the defendant had not offered to sell all the growth, or to furnish land upon which the timber could be manufactured, the plaintiff\u2019s letter did not complete any contract between the parties. If the defendant had tendered the plaintiff a conveyance of all the growth with the right to remove it within a reasonable time, but refusing the use of the land for mill purposes, the plaintiff could have refused to accept the deed and have required the return of his check. To establish the contract alleged in this case, it must therefore appear that the defendant assented to the terms suggested by the plaintiff, and that her acceptance was communicated to him, either actually, or constructively by the mailing of a letter containing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>unconditional acceptance. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>69 N. H. 305; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>67 N. H. 291, 294, 296; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>48 N. H. 14, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Upon receipt of the plaintiff\u2019s letter of November 6, the defendant wrote as follows: \u201c Your letter received with check enclosed. I will attend to the other matter of which you write, and let you know in regard to it as soon .as I hear from Mr. Perkins.\u201d The matter written about by the plaintiff, other than the check, was the purchase of \u201c all the growth with the usual logging and mill privileges,\u201d and the1 details of completing the conveyance. Whether the defendant then intended to accept the plaintiff\u2019s offer or not,, she did not inform the plaintiff that she did. So far as the letter goes, she neither accepts nor rejects, but proposes to give her answer after consulting Mr. Perkins. The retention of the check for this purpose was not an acceptance of the offer. If the plaintiff was unwilling to permit his offer to stand, he could have withdrawn it and demanded the return of the check. Subsequently the defendant returned the check and refused to sell. As the evidence does not establish either that the plaintiff accepted the defendant\u2019s offer, or the defendant the plaintiff\u2019s, no contract was proved. The defendant\u2019s exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\"><em>Verdict set </em>aside\u201e</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
