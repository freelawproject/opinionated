A jury was impaneled to try the indictment. After the state had introduced some evidence, a conference was had between the presiding justice and the solicitor concerning the law under which the indictment was found, as a result of which the solicitor entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tlie case. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel was present at the conference and did not object to the entry or say anything in reference to it. The solicitor testified that \u201c the trial got to the point where the presiding judge announced his interpretation of what the law meant; and his interpretation of it was such that I told him that the state could not prove a condition of things that he said must be shown under the law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-3\">The defendants\u2019 motions for a nonsuit and for an order directing a verdict in their favor were denied, subject to exception.

The answer to this question depends upon the answer to the further question, whether the entry was procured by the plaintiff or was made in consequence of a compromise to which he was a party. If it was caused in either of those ways, it was not such a termination of the case a\u00ae will support this action; but if it was not so caused, it will support the action. <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>66 N. H. 375. The latter is a pure question of fact. The circumstances under which the entry was made do not conclusively show that it was procured by the plaintiff or was occasioned by a compromise to which he was a party. There was evidence from which the jury could find that the entry was the act of the solicitor, induced solely by the advice of the court as to the law governing the case. The defendants\u2019 motions were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The exception to the admission of the docket entries in the former case as evidence is not insisted upon. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>60 N.
