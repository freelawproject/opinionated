Before the suit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>begun the heirs of the intestate assigned their respective, interests in the estate to the defendant in his individual capacity. The defendant, admitting that a large part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the intestate is valid, seeks to set off a claim which McCaffrey owes him personally. Extended discussion of the question thus presented is unnecessary. \u201c If there are mutual debts or demands between the\u2019 plaintiff and defendant at the time of the commencement of the plaintiff\u2019s action, one debt or demand may be set off against the other.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>223, s. 7. The debt sued on and the one pleaded in set-off are not mutual. As an administrator, the defendant could maintain no action against McCaffrey to recover the amount of the set-off, for non-assumpsit would be a perfect defence. By seeking to recoup the same debt when sued as an administrator, he occupies no better position in that respect. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>43 N. H. 430, 435; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>44 N. H. 125; <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>45 N. H. 104, 109; <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Tapper, </em>58 N.
