He was a devout Methodist, being a member of the Methodist Church in Goshen while he lived there, and of the church of the same denomination in Claremont subsequently until his death. The Methodist Church in Goshen ceased to exist about 1888. The testator\u2019s widow died May 16*1903. Their only child died in 1879, leaving a son, Charles M. Philbrick, who was born November 21, 1879, and lived with his grandparents until 1883. He is still living, is the nearest heir of the testator, and is one of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-12\">The will was probated July 2, 1884. According to the inventory then filed, the testator\u2019s estate consisted of his homestead, appraised at $1,800, household furniture of the value of $186.50, provisions and produce of the value of $11.50, wearing apparel of the value of $20, and other personal property amounting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>$2,129.24. The plaintiff was appointed administrator upon the death of the widow, and he has realized from the real estate $1,925, and from the personal estate about $550, or about $2,475 in all. The widow left a will which has been duly probated, and by which she made Charles M. Philbrick her residuary legatee. She left an estate in her own right of some $300 or $400, substantially all of which was used in the payment of the expenses of her last sickness and funeral. Her will contained no reference to the estate of her husband, or to the execution of a power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">Charles M. Philbrick claims the entire estate. Abbie Phillips claims the legacy mentioned in the eighth clause of the will, the Trustees of the New Hampshire Methodist Conference claim the legacy mentioned in the ninth clause, and the Methodist Church in Claremont that mentioned in the tenth clause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-6\"><em>Ilosea W. </em>Parker, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-7\"><em>Leach, Stevens Couch, </em>for Charles M.

The claimants certainly have no reason to complain of this assumption. Do the provisions of the will entitle the claimants to the payment of their legacies from this money? The answer to this question depends upon the intention of the testator, as expressed in the last sentence of the sixth clause of the will and in the clauses following it.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Beginning with the last sentence of the sixth clause, the will reads: \u201c If there should be anything left at her [the wife\u2019s] decease, I dispose of it in the following manner, Seventh, I give and bequeath to my grandson Charlie Philbrie one thousand dollars if living at the time of the decease of my said wife.\u201d Thus far there is no ambiguity and no need for interpretation. By applying the provision to the facts, it appears beyond question that Philbrick is entitled to one thousand dollars from what was left at the widow\u2019s decease. The will then proceeds: \u201cIf [Philbrick is] not living at her decease, I dispose of it in the following manner, namely.\u201d The question arises here, to what does \u201cit\u201d refer \u2014 the thousand dollars, or a residue of the estate left at the widow\u2019s decease ? Grammatically, \u201c it \u201d refers to the thousand dollars; and if this was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>testator\u2019s intention, it is evident that the claimants are not entitled to anything by virtue of the eighth and subsequent clauses. The fund from which alone their legacies are payable would have no existence. If \u201c it \u201d refers to the residue of the estate after the payment of Philbrick\u2019s legacy, the fact does not afford them much assistance, because in any event their legacies seem to depend upon, the condition that Philbrick is not living at the wife\u2019s decease. Their difficulty does not arise so much from the meaning of \u201c it \u201d as from the meaning of the condition expressed by the words \u201c if not living at her decease.\u201d To entitle them to the legacies, these words must be omitted from consideration altogether, or the words '\u201cor, if living, there is anything left after the payment of his legacy,\u201d or words expressing that idea, must be interpolated after them. Words in a will cannot be ignored, nor can words be interpolated, unless it appears from all the competent evidence more probable than otherwise that the testator\u2019s intention would be more clearly or fully expressed by such interpretation. The testator\u2019s intention expressed in the will, whatever be the form of the expression, is the governing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">All the provisions of the will contained in the seventh and following clauses are consistent with the theory that the testator intended the claimants should receive nothing if Philbrick survived the testator\u2019s wife. That such must have been the intention in case the estate left at her decease should prove to be one thousand dollars or less, is evident; for in that event Philbrick would be entitled to the whole by virtue of the seventh clause. The thirteenth and fourteenth clauses contain all the evidence there is regarding the testator\u2019s intention in case the estate left should prove to be more than sufficient to pay Philbrick\u2019s legacy if he survived, or the claimants\u2019 legacies if Philbrick died before the testator\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">By the thirteenth clause, \u201c all the remainder of property of every description \u201d is given to the wife for her support, with full power to convey or dispose of it at any time the same as the testator would if living, \u201c and if there is any left it is to be paid as stated in this will as far as it goes.\u201d The \u201cremainder\u201d here referred to must be that which is left at the wife\u2019s decease \u2014 not that left after paying Philbrick\u2019s legacy, or his and the claimants\u2019 legacies. This appears with reasonable certainty from the provision that \u201c if there is anything left it is to be paid as stated in this will as far as it goes.\u201d A provision for the payment of legacies from the remainder left after the legacies themselves have been paid would be absurd. The provision that the remainder is to be paid \u201c as stated in this will \u201d does not add anything to, nor in any way modify, the terms by which payments were to be made according to the partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ular provisions of the will relating to them. The phrase \u201c as stated in this will\u201d merely refers to other portions of the will for the terms of payment. The intended office of the thirteenth clause, besides confirming the wife\u2019s right to control the property and use it for her comfort and support, appears to have been to confer upon her the additional power of disposing of the remainder at any time as the testator would, or perhaps might, do if living. Without stopping to consider whether the wife has attempted to exercise this power <em>(Kimball </em>v. Society, 65 N. H. 139; <em>Emery </em>v. Haven, 67 N. H. 503; <em>Shapleigh </em>v. Shapleigh, 69 N. H. 577), it is sufficient for the present purpose to note that the existence of the power has no tendency whatever to prove that the testator intended the claimants\u2019 legacies should be paid if Philbriek survived his wife and there was sufficient estate left after the payment of Philbriek\u2019s legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The fourteenth clause is distinctively a residuary clause, expressed in general terms. It bequeaths to the testator\u2019s nearest heirs the remainder of his property \u201cif there should be any left after paying the above bequests \u201d at the decease of his wife. His nearest heir at the date of the will was the grandson, Charles M. Philbriek, then only about eighteen months old. The uncertainty as to the continuance of the child\u2019s life explains the use of the general term \u201c nearest heirs \u201d for a description of the beneficiaries intended under this clause. The \u201c remainder \u201d referred to is that left \u201c after paying the above bequests \u201d at the decease of the wife. If the grandson survived the wife, the bequests mentioned in the sixth, eleventh, and twelfth clauses, at least, would be payable before the remainder could be ascertained. If ho did not survive, the bequests to the claimants would certainly be due. \u201cThe above bequests \u201d would apply to the facts in either contingency. There is nothing in the words themselves, nor in their connection, which tends to show an enlargement or modification of the terms upon which any of \u201cthe above bequests\u201d are payable. \u201cAfter paying the above bequests \u201d naturally signifies after paying them according to the terms of payment prescribed by the provisions making the bequests. This clause unconditionally disposes of whatever may be left of the estate in any event. If it had been omitted, it might be said with some reason that the testator\u2019s neglect to make disposition of the money left after satisfying Phil-brick\u2019s legacy, other than by the eighth, ninth, and tenth clauses, was evidence that he intended these clauses should operate upon such remainder. But the presence of the fourteenth clause prevents such reason from being urged in behalf of the claimants. By reading all these provisions in the light of the circumstances surrounding the testator when he made the will, and giving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>words their ordinary, popular significance, nothing is found to justify the inference necessary to entitle the claimants to the legacies they seek. The ties of blood are generally stronger than the ties growing out of social, benevolent, and even religious associations and interests. It is not unreasonable to suppose that, as between his grandson and the claimants, the testator gave the preference to the grandson; that he intended the benevolent bequests should take effect only in case his \u201cnearest heirs\u201d were persons other than the grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Such being the nature and effect of the testimony bearing on the question of the testator\u2019s intention, the plaintiff is advised that Charles M. Philbrick is entitled by the seventh clause of the will to one thousand dollars, and by the fourteenth clause to the remainder of the testator\u2019s estate; and that neither of the claimants is entitled to anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>Gase discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
