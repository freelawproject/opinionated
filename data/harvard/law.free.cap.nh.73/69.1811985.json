In view of the settled law of this state <em>(Darling </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>52 N. H. 401; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>58 N. H. 396; D<em>ow </em>v. <em>Weare, </em>68 N. H. 345; <em>Folsom </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>68 N. H. 454, 461), the evidence was clearly competent, unless it was too remote-as a matter of fact. But as the evidence was not excluded upon the ground of remoteness, but because legally incompetent <em>(Challis </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>71 N. H. 90, 95; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>60 N.
