October 28, 1901, the defendant contracted with the plaintiffs as follows: \u201cThis is to show that Cornelia and Eunice M. Kimball have sold to T. P. Waterman one lot of pine timber situated on the Kimball property north of the cemetery and one lot of pine timber situated in the Glen, so-called, west and southwest of the property owned by Mrs. Marion Crawford, for and in consideration of two hundred dollars paid by Mr. Waterman to the Misses Kimball.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">In 1902 and 1903, the defendant cut and removed most of the pine timber from these lots and sold the same. He claimed that the contract entitled him to cut all the pine timber on the \u201c Kim-ball property north of the cemetery,\u201d and excepted to the introduction of oral testimony tending to prove what portion of the pine timber thereon was the subject of the sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-6\"><em>Alonzo L. </em>Chamberlin, <em>Clarence li. </em>Hibbard, and <em>Ira </em>Colby, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-7\"><em>Marshall H.

It is found that at the time of the sale the plaintiffs owned two lots of land in West Lebanon, one lot being north of the cemetery, the other in the Glen, and that the pine timber then remaining on the lots was scattered over them in small clumps and extended areas. In the written agreement, the subject-matter of the sale is described as \u201c one lot of pine timber situated on the Kimball property north of the cemetery and one lot of pine timber situated in the Glen.\u201d The contract upon its face is unambiguous; but when an attempt is made to apply it to the facts and circumstances surrounding the parties at the time it was made, it is found that there are two or more lots or areas of pine timber on each tract of land which answer its terms. In other words, there is a latent ambiguity which permits the introduction of oral testimony to show what lot or area of pine on each tract of land was intended to be sold. <em>Pickering </em>v.
