Sanborn and the plaintiff were the owners in common of a lumber lot. On that date Sanborn sold the wood and timber thereon to the defendants Kennett and Weeks for $350 and received that sum from them. The plaintiff know of the sale at the time it was made, but remained silent. Sanborn died in the following July, and on the day of his funeral the plaintiff forbade the defendants cutting any of the wood and timber. At \u2018that time the defendants had not begun operations on the lot, though they had made arrangements for clearing it. The value of the wood and timber at the time of the sale was $700. If upon these facts the plaintiff can recover, he should have judgment for $350.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-10\"><em>Frank Weeks, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-11\"><em>Arthur L.

H. 313; <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>49 N. H. 204; <em>Reid </em>v. <em>McQuesten, </em>61 N. H. 421; <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>63 N. H. 57; <em>Lamprey </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>68 N. H. 198. Such a license may be revoked at any time; and acts done upon the land by the licensee after revocation, and without other rightful authority, render him liable as a trespasser. <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>24 N. H. 176; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Laffee, </em>46 N. H. 505; <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Hibbard, </em>58 N. H. 269; <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Straw, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>71 N. H. 160. By the death of Sanborn, whatever authority he gave the licensees to enter upon the land and cut the timber was revoked <em>(Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>51 N. H. 483; <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>68 N. H. 598, 600), and in two or three days thereafter the plaintiff exercised his right of revocation by expressly notifying them not to cut the wood and timber. Their permissive right then ceased, and they became trespassers in reference to their acts subsequently done upon the land. As the case is understood, those acts consisted in clearing the lot, for which the plaintiff seeks to recover. According to the provision of the case, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for $350.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\n<em>Qase discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
