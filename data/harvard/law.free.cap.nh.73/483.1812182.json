A civil engineer testified that water would percolate through that soil, and that he dug the hole and found that the water in it stood on a level with the stream. To all this the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-10\">Subject to exception, the plaintiff testified that he relied upon the low lands, which could be cropped without fertilizing, to keep up his light upland, and that the damage to him from water held back by the new dam more than by the old dam was fl,000 for the six years prior to the date of the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-11\">The defendants excepted to the following instructions given to the jury: \u201c The evidence apparently shows that the plaintiff\u2019s title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>is a prescriptive one; but this does not render it any the less valid. He has had such possession and color o\u00ed title as give him a right to recover damages if the defendants have exceeded their legal rights in the premises. And so the practical question for you is whether the defendants have flowed beyond what they have a right to. The defendants say that they have title by deed, and also a prescriptive right to flow as much as they have flowed. The deed to them from Coe &amp; Pingree conveys the right of flow-age by Errol dam. This means the right to flow as it was exercised at the time the deed was given in 1877; and that is the limit of the defendants\u2019 right as founded upon the deed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">Instructions were also given as to what was necessary to enable the defendants to acquire flowage rights by prescription as against the plaintiff. The charge then proceeded as follows: \u201cSo whether this title is by deed or by prescription, it is measured by the extent of the use; and as there is no dispute but that the use was substantially the same for more than twenty years, the practical question for you will be whether there has been a substantial increase \u25a0of the flowage by the new dam. The question, as you will see, is purely one of fact for you to settle. Was the flowage for the six years just before March 11, 1903, substantially greater than that which the defendants had claimed and exercised the right to the \u25a0enjoyment of for twenty years ? \u201d There was no exception to these instructions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-6\"><em>Edmund Sullivan </em>and <em>Gross \u00a7\u2022 Tardivel, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-7\"><em>Brew, Jordan, Buckley Shurtleff </em>and <em>White 8f Carter </em>(of Maine), for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b517-8\">Chase, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATv\">There was no error in the calling of the attention of the jury at the view, to the newly dug hole in the ground and the height of the water therein, as compared with the height of the water in the river; nor in the receipt of the civil engineer\u2019s testimony regarding the hole and the water. The height of the water in the plaintiff\u2019s land, as compared with its height in the river, was a physical fact relevant to the issue on trial, and it might be shown by direct observation and by the testimony of those who had observed it. <em>Concord etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>70 N. H. 627. The fact that the civil engineer was permitted to testify to the percolating character of the soil between the hole and the river implies that the court found that he was qualified to testify upon the subject. As there is nothing in the case tending to show that there was any error of law involved in this finding, the parties are bound by it,'and his testimony was competent. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>41 N. H. 546; <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>50 N. H. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Nor is the exception to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony concerning his damages tenable, <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>58 N. H. 104; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>62 N. H. 582, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\">It would seem, from the manner in which the case was presented to the jury that it was not denied that the plaintiff had acquired a title by prescription to the land flowed, subject to a flowage easement appurtenant to the defendants\u2019 land at Errol on which their dam was located. The extent of this easement appears to have been the only question in dispute. The defendants, asserted title to the easement by virtue of the deed of 1877 from Coe &amp; Pingree to their grantors, and also by prescription. The only exception to the charge related to the interpretation that was given therein to the Coe &amp; Pingree deed. There were conveyed by this deed the land on which the dam stood and \u201c all rights of flowage of any lands \u201d belonging to Coe &amp; Pingree, or either of them, upon Lake Umbagog, the Androscoggin and Magalloway rivers and their tributaries, and all right they had \u201cto flow the land of others by any of said dams.\u201d Whether the phrase \u201c by any of said dams \u201d limits the right of flowing lands above the Errol dam, owned and retained by Coe &amp; Pingree, as well as all rights acquired by them to flow lands of others, might be doubtful in the absence of further statement. But this description is immediately followed by the explanation, \u201c intending hereby to convey all right of flowage of any lands in said county of Coos, caused by any of said dams, wherever situate, . . . and however the right may have been acquired,\u201d etc. Here, the right of flowing lands other than those conveyed is. specifically limited to that \u201c caused by any of said dams.\u201d The only flowage easement involved in the action is the one pertaining to the dam at Errol, which, according to the ease, must be one of \u201csaid dams \u201d mentioned in the deed. The right of flowage conveyed in connection with this dam or the land on which it stood was not a right to flow Coe &amp; Pingree\u2019s other lands to any extent and depth that it was possible to flow them by a dam at Errol, but only a right to flow such lands to the extent that they were customarily flowed by the existing dam. The further explanatory clause is added: \u201c to the end that the grantees may have and enjoy the same rights of flowage, and to the same extent over all said premises, as we now have the right to enjoy.\u201d This does not modify the prior explanatory clause. \u201c The same rights of flowage \u201d are of the flowage \u201c caused by any of said dams \u201d ; these rights are to be enjoyed \u201c to the same extent over all said premises as we [the grantors] now have the right to enjoy\u201d; that is, by means of \u201cany of said dams.\u201d The rightful state of the property at the time of the execution of the deed is weighty evidence of the intention which the parties attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>express by its terras. <em>Dunklee </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>24 N. H. 489; <em>Seavey </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>48 N. H. 441; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>62 N. H. 447. Heading tbe deed in tbe light of this evidence, and giving its terms their ordinary meaning, it appears that there was no error in tbe court\u2019s instructions to tbe jury that tbe right of flowage conveyed by the Coe &amp; Pingree deed was \u201ctbe right to flow as it was exercised at tbe time tbe deed was given in 1877 \u201d; and that \u201c that is tbe limit of tbe defendants\u2019 right as founded upon tbe deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
