William H. Poole disclaimed, and Annie L.

White, promised the defendant that if she would abandon her purpose of going to Cuba, remain in Hanover, and induce her husband to do the same, he would build and give to her a house in Hanover; that in consideration of this promise and in reliance thereon, the defendant and her husband abandoned their purpose of going to Cuba, remained in Hanover, and continued there to the date of the filing of the bill; that White, in pursuance of the agreement, selected a lot satisfactory to her, paid for it, and took the deed in his own name but in trust for the defendant, giving as a reason Ms desire to transfer the complete property to lier when he had built a house thereon; that shortly afterward White erected upon the lot a house which was completed in 1900, and upon its completion the defendant, in pursuance of the contract, moved into the house and has ever since occupied it, and with the knowledge and assent of White has regarded and treated it as her property, and has caused to be expended thereon 8500 in improvements and repairs; and that at the time of Ms death, in 1903, White was arranging to convey the property to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-13\">The plaintiffs\u2019 demurrer was overruled at the May term, 1905, \u25a0of the superior court by <em>Wallace, </em>C.

The plaintiffs contend that the defendant is not entitled to the relief prayed for in the bill, for the reason that the terms of the contract there set out are-not sufficiently definite to enable a court of equity to decree specific performance, and that their demurrer should have been sustained. They say that, according to the allegation of the bill, the contract between the testator and the defendant was simply that he should build and give her a house in Hanover, without reference to any particular lot of land upon which the house was to be built. But we think the fair meaning of the bill is that the defendant made a parol contract with the testator by which he was to convey to the defendant the land claimed in the writ of entry. If such contract is not alleged with sufficient definiteness, the defendant asks leave to amend the bill. Such amendment may be made and will render unnecessary the consideration of this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">No time being fixed within which the testator was to give a deed of the property, he was entitled to a reasonable time in which to do so. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>63 N. H. 61, <em>62; Kidder </em>v. <em>Flanders, ante, p. </em>345.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The consideration to be given by the defendant seems definite enough. It was that she should abandon her present purpose of going to Cuba and remain in Hanover, and that she should induce her husband to do the same. The time that they were to remain in Hanover would be a reasonable time, having reference to the nature of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">It is alleged in the bill that the defendant, induced by the testator\u2019s promise, entered into the possession of the property, expended large sums in the way of improvements, and has continued in the occupation of the same to the present time, managing- and controlling it as her own. These allegations are sufficient to withdraw the case from the operation of the statute of frauds. <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>9 N. H. 385, 390; <em>Seavey </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>62 N.
