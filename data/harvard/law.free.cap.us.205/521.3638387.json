He thereafter filed this complaint against the Franks and Vogt, setting up the proceedings and .averring that defendants Frank claimed a lien upon the special fund to the whole extent thereof, which constituted a cloud on plaintiff\u2019s title to the fund, and he demanded, judgment that the chattel mortgage be declared null and void and cancelled' and discharged of record, and that the special fund be declared free of the incumbrance of the alleged \u2019chattel mortgage, and from any lien or claim by the Franks under the mortgage or otherwise. The trial court held that the mortgage was made \u201cwith the intent and purpose off said Vogt- and said defendants Frank to hinder, defeat, defraud and delay said Vogt\u2019s creditors\u201d; and decreed the annulment of .the-mortgage, and that it was \u201cno lien upon the moneys,'viz., $5,481.47, deposited on July 9th, 1902, by Arthur T.

No other court has any power to interfere with such property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-7\">This rule of general as well as of Federal jurisprudence applies to proceedings in bankruptcy. The prosecution-of this suit -in the state court might have been enjoined by the court of bankruptcy. The judgment is, consequently, subject to reversal by this court. <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Heymen, 111 </em>U.

'</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-9\">In each case, the judgment of the court which acquired prior jurisdiction is impeded, clogged and interfered with. It is, -moreover, for the interests of justice that conflicts between decrees of coordinate tribunals should be'avoided; and that the parties should not be tempted by the hope of thus gaining some apparent and at least temporary advantage, to indulge in \u201can unseemly scramble of litigants to speed cases in the respective courts of their preference.\u201d <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>36 Fed.

Such a suit does not interfere with the possession of the fund.. Where the suit in the state corut asks for relief which might be an interference with the possession of the Federal court, this does not war-rant enjoining the suit, where the principal relief sought would not be a direct interference. <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>North Chicago St. R.

But notwithstanding this possession the state courts have -universally entertained actions by the trustee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b556-6\">Mr. Chief Justice- Fuller,</author>\n<p id=\"A_K\">after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AqSN\">Counsel for plaintiffs in error contended below that the state courts had no jurisdiction becaus\u00e9 the suit was brought to determine title to property or a fund in the possession of the District Court of the United States. The bankruptcy act of July 1, 1898, provided that \u201csuits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant.\u201d 30 Stat. 544, c. 541, \u00a7 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In <em>Bardes </em>v. <em>Hawarden Bank, </em>178 U. S. 524, we held that the bankruptcy court, except by the consent of the defendant, had no jurisdiction to try and determine a suit brought by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover property alleged to be part of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, or to have been transferred by him' in fraud of the act, but that such suits must be prosecuted either in the state courts or in the Circuit Courts of the United States where diversity of citizenship existed. The act of 1898 was amended by the act of February 5, .1903, 32 St\u00e1t. 797, c. 487, section 19 of which provided that the act should \u201cnot apply to bankruptcy cases pending when this act takps effect, but such cases shall be adjudicated and disposed of conformably to the provisions of the said act of July first, eighteen hundred'and ninety-eight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The present case was commenced in 1902, and besides the amendment gave the bankruptcy court concurrent and not exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">We give in the margin<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> quotations from the acts of July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>1898, and February <em>5, </em>1903, the amendments made by the latter act being italicized.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Undoubtedly the state court, in which the trustee brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>this suit, was the court \u201cwhere the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them [suits], if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted,\u201d and its jurisdiction under the applicable general rule must be conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">But plaintiffs in error contend that the possession by the bankruptcy court of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged chattels deprives the state court of its conceded jurisdiction to set aside the mortgage as fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The contention is wholly inadmissible. The mortgaged property consisted of- horses, vehicles, harness, etc., and the order of sale of the temporary receiver, agreed to by plaintiffs in error, was evidently in the interest of all parties, and provided for the deposit of the proceeds, not in the general funds of the estate, but as a special fund, to which the lien, if any, of the chattel mortgage was transferred, and clearly contem-' plated a plenary suit to determine the validity thereof, which, at that time, there being no diversity of citizenship, and no such possession as might lead to a different result, could only be commenced in the state court. The trustee himself commenced it there and obtained the decree, which was in its nature self-executing,'and merely set aside the mortgage,'and, as incident thereto,- declared that the special fund was free from its lien, and, without seeking to interfere with .the possession, left it to the bankruptcy court to carry the decree into effect by placing the mon\u00e9y in the custody of its officer, the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>No principle of comity was violated and there was no interference with the bankruptcy court. <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Title &amp; Trust Company, </em>198 U. S. 280; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Friedlander, </em>104 U. S. 570; <em>Eyster </em>v. <em>Gaff, </em>91 U. S. 521; <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Houseman, </em>93 U. S. 130; <em>Re Platteville Foundry &amp; Machine Company, </em>147 Fed. Rep. 828; <em>Guaranty Trust Company </em>v. <em>North Chicago Street Railroad Company, </em>130 Fed. Rep. 801; <em>Re Spitzer, </em>130 Fed. Rep. 879; <em>Bindseil </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>61 N. J. Eq. 645; <em>Skilton </em>v. <em>Codington, </em>185 N. Y. 80. In the latter case the Court of Appeals by Cullen, C. J., in sustaining the jurisdiction of the state court, admirably expounds the applicable principles, with a full citation of authorities. That was a suit against the trustee,, while the present case was brought by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The possession of the temporary receiver of the special fund was not in the circumstances in any sense sufficient to change the ordinary rule giving the state courts jurisdiction any more than the constructive possession in every case created by adjudication. <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Nugent, </em>184 U. S. 1; <em>York Mfg. Company </em>v. <em>Cassell, </em>201 U. S. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It is objected that the trustee had no right to attack the validity of the chattel mortgage because it did not appear that he represented any .but simple contract creditors. \u2022 But the record before us shows that the entire record of the proceed-, ings in the bankruptcy court was in evidence before the trial court, though it was not returned here, so that if it were necessary that the trustee should represent judgment creditors, which we do not decide that it was, it must be presumed that the trial court in passing upon all the evidence found that he did. This may explain why the point was not made in the trial court, and it comes too late here.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-12\"> Sec. 236: \u201cSuits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant, <em>except suits for the recovery of property under section sixty, subdivision\u25a0 b, and section sixty-seven, subdivision e.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Sec. 60b: \u201c If a bankrupt shall have given a preference within four months before the filing of a petition, or after the filing of the petition and before the adjudication, and the person receiving it; or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall have had reasonable cause to believe that it was intended thereby to give a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee, and he may recover the property or its value from such person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aesq\"><em>\u201cIf a bankrupt shall have given a preference, and the person receiving it, or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall have had reasonable cause to believe that it </em>was <em>intended thereby to give a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee and he may recover the property or its value from such person.
