From September 26, 1898, to the end of the furIpugh period he'was detained for duty and actually performed duty.

Anderson </em>was on the brief, for appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-11\">The Army Regulations provide no command for a subaltern; the lowest officer in rank, provided for in that'respect is a captain. ' The claimant, therefore, whose grade was that of a second lieutenant of cavalry, had no command pertaining to his grade, and his case does not come within the purview of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the act. The statute does not say that increased compensation shall be received for exercising higher duties- or exercising a command, but for exercising a higher command. It does not refer to the commander, but to the troops which he commands. <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>United States, </em>38 C. Cl. 689.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">The responsibilities of higher command in this case were no greater than in ordinary times of peace. <em>Truitt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>38 C. Cl. 398.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">Under General Orders, No. 86, the assignment of the claimant to the command of his company could have been legally ordered only by the commanding general in the field or the Secretary of War, and a certified copy in duplicate should have been filed with the paymaster in order to entitle, him to the higher pay. The general order also, from language used, evidently contemplated the issuance of the order of assignment prior to the assumption of the higher command.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-7\">' \u2022 The commanding general in the field had no power to delegate his authority to assign an officer to a higher command, nor had he the power to subsequently confirm and ratify such unauthorized action by any officer under his command.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-8\"><em>Mr. George. A.. King, </em>with whom <em>Mr. William B. King </em>and <em>Mr. Clark McKercher </em>were on the brief, for appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-9\">The right to some extra pay is conceded, and the question is, what is the proper rate? The answer of the Court of Claims is that it shall be the rate to which the. claimant was entitled and which he received at the time of his muster out and discharge from the service as well as for about two months previous, This includes the time during which his regiment was nominally on furlough,' while the claimant was held for active duty- and actually, discharged duty as the commanding officer of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-10\">This conclusion is in accordance with the law whether the ;rate properly allowable be that'of the pay to which the claim- \u2022 ant was entitled at the time of his muster out and discharge \u25a0 from the service, as this court decided in the case of the similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>statute passed for the Mexican War, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>North, </em>112 U. S. 510, affirming 19 C. Cl. 254, or whether the proper rate of pay be that to which he was entitled during the nominal furlough of his regiment, as decided by the Court of Claims under these statutes in <em>Terrell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>40 C. Cl. 78.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-5\">There has been a contemporaneous and continuous construction of the statute. To reverse this construction as the Government now contends at this late day, would be to overturn . thousands' of settlements already \u00abmade. This would result most unequally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-6\">As to the force to be given to contemporaneous and continuous construction see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>95 U. S. 763; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alabama R. R. Co., </em>142 U. S. 621; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Finnell, </em>185 U. S. 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-7\">Clearly, the command was \u201cabove that pertaining to his grade.\u201d' He was only a second lieutenant, the lowest grade of commissioned officer, and for a short time before his discharge from the service, a first lieutenant; but he was, at the time of his muster out and for about two months previous, in actual command of his company, a command appropriate to the grade of captain, as shown by \u00a7 14, Army Regulations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-8\">There was a complete literal compliance with the statute. His assignment to the command of .the company was made \u201cin orders\u201d of the most formal and peremptory character first issued by the commanding officer of his regiment and subsequently confirmed by the major-general commanding the corps.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-9\">The claimant exercised a higher command, and he exercised it under orders issued by competent authority, and this is sufficient. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>39 C. Cl. 1, 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-10\">There is no need here for interpretation or .construction of the statute. The language is plain and unambiguous. The orders are here under, unquestionable authority.' The will of Congress- expressed in the statute is therefore met and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the right to higher pay follows. <em>Lake County </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>130 U. S. 671.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b198-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Fuller,</author>\n<p id=\"A94\">after, making' the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the .court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">It is conceded by the Government that claimant is entitled to extra pay, so that the question is to what amount. Was he entitled to receive one month\u2019s extra pay of a captain of cavalry mounted ($166.66) or one ilionth\u2019s extra pay of a second lieutenant of cavalry mounted ($125)?-</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We lay out of view the suggestion that if claimant were entitled to the extra pay of a second lieutenant of cavalry only, then that a certain sum or sums ought to ,be deducted as having been previously improvidently paid by the Auditor for the War Department. The United States filed no set-off or counterclaim, and we think we cannot overhaul the allowance by the Auditor for the War Department in the circumstances. Such payment, if made in error, did not determine the question before us within <em>United States v. Hite, </em>204 U. S. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The claim is made under section 7 of the act of April 26, 1898, 30 Stat. 364, 365, c. 191, reading as follows: \u201cThat in time of war every officer serving with troops operating against an enemy who shall exercise, under assignment in orders issued by competent authority, a command above <em>that </em>pertaining to his grade, shall be entitled to receive the pay and allowances of the grade appropriate to the command so exercised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The main question is whether claimant exercised, \u201cunder assignment in orders issued by competent authority, a command above that pertaining to his grade?\u201d When he assumed command of his company, August 26, 1898, he was the senior officer present, the captain and the first lieutenant being absent. Section 253 of the Army Regulations of 1895, then in force, provided: \u201c In the absence' of its captain, the command of a company devolves upon the subaltern next in rank who is serving with it, unless otherwise specially directed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>This embodied the rule of succession by seniority prevailing in the ordinary course of military affairs, while, at the same time, it recognized that there might be exceptions, in respect of which special direction was required, and section 7 of the act of April 26, 1898, applied to such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The exceptions spring from necessity, and where it is apparent that that does not exist, orders relied, on as the basis for increased pay under section 7 are ineffectual for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>United States, </em>38 C. Cl. 689, the .Court of Claims held that-what the law contemplated was \u201cnecessary and not gratuitous assignments, and only such as would be for the good of the service and the vigorous prosecution .of the war.\u201d Chief Justice Nott, speaking for the court, said: \u201cIt seems to the court incontrovertible that the words \u2018under assignment in orders issued- by competent authority \u2019 constitute the controlling limitation of the statute; and the limitation implies that the benefits of the statute extend only to cases where such an order is necessary \"to impose the Larden of the higher command upon an officer.\u201d We concur in that view, and tested by it, Special Orders No. 44, dated August 24, 1898, whereby the lieutenant colonel of the First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry announced that First Lieutenant Forsyth was relieved of the command of troop E, and, as incident thereto, that Second Lieutenant' Mitchell was appointed to the command, cannot be considered as an \u201c assignment in orders issued by competent authority,\u201d within section 7. That section was not enacted to give increased pay for the discharge of the-ordinary duties of the service,. but to give, compensation 'for the greater risk and responsibility of active military command, and no assignment in orders when unnecessary to that end can make a case within the statute. <em>Truitt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>38 C. Cl. 398, 406; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>1 Pet. 293, 297. Here the additional duties discharged by Lieutenant Mitchell were \u201cthe ordinary incidental duties of military official life-which go with such officer\u2019s commission.\u201d 38 C. Cl. 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The attempted confirmation by Special Orders No. 97 must fail of effect under section 7 for like reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Other questions argued at the bar need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aev\"><em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with a -direction to enter judgment in favor of claimant for </em>$125.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
