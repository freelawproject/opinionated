The words in the fourth subdivision of \u00a7 17, \u201cwhile acting as an officer, or in any fiduciary capacity,\u201d extend to \u201cfraud, embezzlement, misappropriation,\u201d as well as \u201cdefalcation.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>195U.S. 176.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b213-10\">183 N.

These debts are not provable debts and, therefore, are not released within the principles laid down in the second proposition of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>195 U. S. 176, 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">The qualifying clause \u201cwhile acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity \u201d found in \u00a7 17, subd. 4, of the act, relates to the word \"defalcation\" only and not to any of the preceding words, \"fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">Under the bankruptcy act of 1867 debts created by fraud or arising out of fiduciary relations and in tort generally, were not dischargable. In the highest courts of many of the States, as well as in many of the United States Circuit Courts, it was held that, if, prior to the bankruptcy, a judgment was obtained for the fraud, then the fraud and tort became merged into the judgment, a contract of record, and was released as a contract indebtedness. <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>81 Massachusetts, 547; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>28 Maine, 385; <em>Crouch </em>v. <em>Gridley, </em>6 Hill, 250; <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Schuyler, 2 </em>Denio, 73; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Biglow, </em>5 Georgia, 437; <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Grout, </em>17 Vermont, 512; <em>In re Adson Comstock, 22 </em>Vermont, 642; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>9 R.

The complaint contained three counts, setting up separate items of damages, namely, $349.30, $230.83 and $321.73 for goods sold, and judgment was demanded for the aggregate with interest on each item.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">One of the defenses was that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by a discharge in bankruptcy of defendant\u2019s firm, to which plaintiffs replied that they were not such as could be discharged in. bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The New York Court of Appeals held that, according to the rulings of this court in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>195 U. S. 176, the alleged indebtedness to plaintiffs was covered by the discharge, and directed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to be dismissed. <em>Tindle </em>v. <em>Birkett, </em>183 N. Y. 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">This writ of error was then prosecuted, and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contends that their debts were not provable debts and therefore not- discharged, and that <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Burke </em>might well be modified in view of certain suggestions deemed to be novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Sections 17 and 63a of the bankruptcy act of 1898 read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u201cSec. 17. A discharge in bankruptcy shall-release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as . . . (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another; . . . or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">\u201cSec. 63.- Debts which may be proved:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">\u201c(a) Debts\u201eof the bankrupt may be\u2019proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the 'filing of the petition against him, whether then payable or'not . . . ; (4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract express or implied; and (5) founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>upon provable debts reduced to judgments after the filing of the petition and before the consideration of the bankrupt\u2019s application for a discharge, . <em>.a\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Counsel admit that the claims in -question were all liquidated. By their nature and amount as well as by the form of the complaint they stand upon the contracts originally made. Whiteside v. <em>Brawley, </em>152 Massachusetts, 133, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\"><em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Burke </em>was an action in trover instituted in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, by Burke against Crawford and Valentine, plaintiffs in error, to recover damages for the willful and fraudulent conversion of the interests of the plaintiff in certain shares of stock. There were ten counts in .the declaration, five charging fraudulent conversion \u2022of that stock, and five, the obtaining of money from plaintiff in the way of margins by means of false and fraudulent representations. Defendants pleaded their discharge in bankruptcy, but were found guilty on all the counts, and judgment was entered against them, which was affirmed by the Appellate .Court and by the Supreme Court of Illinois. This court held that plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201c provable under the bankruptcy act,\u201d that is, was \u201csusceptible of being proved,\u201d and that it might have been proved under section 63a as \u201cfounded upon an open account or upon a contract express or implied,\u201d if plaintiff had. chosen to waive the tort and take his place \u25a0with the other creditors of the estate. And that the woids, in the fourth subdivision of section 17, \u201cwhile acting as an officer, or in any fiduciary capacity,\u201d extended to \u201cfraud, embezzlement, misappropriation\u201d as well as \u201cdefalcation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AjT\">That case completely determines this as the New York Court of Appeals correctly held.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
