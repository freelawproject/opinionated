We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and Pannell\u2019s informal appellate brief. Because Pannell failed to challenge on appeal the basis for the district court\u2019s ruling, he has not preserved this issue for our review. 4th Cir. R. 34(b). In any event, it is clear that the district court correctly found Pannell\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition untimely. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Pannell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
