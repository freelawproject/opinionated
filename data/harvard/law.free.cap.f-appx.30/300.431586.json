His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states that there are no meritorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>grounds for appeal. Although informed of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Lester has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Lester was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Because Lester\u2019s sentence was below the properly calculated sentencing guidelines\u2019 maximum range and less than the statutory maximum sentence, it is not reviewable. <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record in this case, and we find no meritorious issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">For these reasons, we affirm Lester\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
