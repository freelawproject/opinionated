The defendant answered and filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>most of Harrison\u2019s claims were procedurally barred and that none of them had merit. The district court dismissed the petition because it was not filed within the one-year limitations period of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001). Harrison appeals. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002), we recently held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxM\">that when a federal habeas court, prior to trial, perceives a pro se \u00a7 2254 petition to be untimely and the state has not filed a motion to dismiss based on the one-year limitations period, the court must warn the prisoner that the case is subject to dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d) absent a sufficient explanation, unless it is indisputably clear from the materials presented to the district court that the petition is untimely and cannot be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 706. Here, <em>Hill </em>is fully applicable. The defendant\u2019s answer and motion for summary judgment were not based on expiration of the limitations period. Hill takes issue with the court\u2019s conclusion that the habeas petition was untimely. And it is not \u201cindisputably clear\u201d from the materials in the record that the petition is untimely and unsalvageable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We therefore grant the motion for certificate of appealability, vacate the decision of the district court, and remand for proceedings consistent with our holding in <em>Hill. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process. The motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
