In Count 3, he was charged with knowingly and intentionally distributing 251.9 grams of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) and 1.2 kilograms of cocaine hydrochloride in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (West 1999). In Count 4, he was charged with knowingly carrying a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A)\u00ae (West 2000). Franzini-Escamilla pled guilty under a plea agreement to both counts. The district court sentenced him to 132 months in prison and five years of supervised release for Count 3 and sixty months in prison, to run consecutively, and three years of supervised release, to run concurrently, for Court 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Franzini-Escamilla\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issue of whether Franzini-Escamilla\u2019s plea was given knowingly and voluntarily and with effective assistance of counsel, but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Franzini-Escamilla filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing his counsel was ineffective, he was coerced by his counsel into pleading guilty and coerced into lying to the probation officer, and he was never involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Our review of Franzini-Escamilla\u2019s guilty plea and the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing reveal no error. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117 (4th Cir.1991). We decline to consider on direct appeal Franzini-Escamilla\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims because counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness does not plainly appear on the face of the record. Rather, any challenge Franzini-Escamilla may have to his attorney\u2019s performance is more properly raised in post-conviction proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 120-121. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Franzini-Escamilla\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
