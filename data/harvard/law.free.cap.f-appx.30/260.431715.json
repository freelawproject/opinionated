Wilson filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this court seeking release from his incarceration in a Virginia prison, where he was transferred on behalf of the federal Bureau of Prisons. Wilson argues that he is being detained beyond the expiration of his federal prison sentence, which was imposed after trial and conviction in the District of Columbia for bank fraud and related crimes. The government filed a response to Wilson\u2019s petition, stating that Wilson is being held not as an extension of his federal prison sentence, but because the Immigration and Naturalization Service has instituted removal proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Wilson\u2019s petition, and so must dismiss it. Original jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus generally resides in district courts, not appellate courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361 (West 1993). The All Writs Act does vest all statutorily created federal courts, including this court, with authority to issue \u201call writs necessary or appropriate <em>in aid of </em>their respective jurisdictions....\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1651 (West 1994) (emphasis added). However, Wilson\u2019s petition, stemming from a District of Columbia conviction and sentence, fails to implicate the independent basis for our jurisdiction necessary to proceed under the All Writs Act. <em>See In re Chambers Develop. Co., </em>148 F.3d 214, 223 n. 6 (3d Cir.1998) (stating that the All Writs Act requires that \u201cthe case may at some future time come within the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction\u201d). Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ingly, although we grant Wilson\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his motion for counsel and dismiss his petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal issues are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
