He also challenges the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for a certificate of appealability. Because Lanthron\u2019s challenge to a court martial is properly addressed under \u00a7 2241, <em>Burns v. Wilson, </em>346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953), the district court erred in dismissing the petition based on the time limits applicable to motions under \u00a7 2255. However, as the district court correctly noted in its denial of Lanthron\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, Lanthron did not meet the custody requirement applicable to habeas corpus petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3); <em>see Garlotte v. Fordice, </em>515 U.S. 39, 40, 115 S.Ct. 1948, 132 L.Ed.2d 36 (1995). Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief on the basis that Lanthron was not in custody, depriving the district court of jurisdiction over the petition. We grant Lanthron\u2019s motion to supplement the record. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
