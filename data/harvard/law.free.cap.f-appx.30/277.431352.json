Thomas was convicted of second-degree murder, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111, and Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112, for their roles in the death of Brett Reginald Hawkins while all three men were inmates at the Lorton Reformatory Correctional Complex. On appeal, Thomas contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for a mistrial. Newton maintains that the court erred by admitting the grand jury testimony of an unavailable witness and by sustaining Thomas\u2019 objection to evidence of the victim\u2019s character. Newton also argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">We first address Thomas\u2019 contention that the district court abused its discretion in denying Thomas\u2019 motion for a mistrial. At trial, the government proffered evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>dence that Thomas had been interviewed by an FBI agent about the murder, and told the agent that \u201che didn\u2019t know anything\u201d relevant because he \u201cwas at the ball field\u201d when it happened. The agent further testified that the interview was very short and that Thomas had \u201ca little bit of attitude\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the interview.\u201d Thomas objected, and the district court barred any further testimony about his demeanor. Thomas also moved, unsuccessfully, for a mistrial. On appeal, Thomas asserts that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial was an abuse of discretion because this evidence was \u201cequivalent to ... commenting during closing argument that the defendant failed to testify,\u201d and therefore constituted a presumptively prejudicial violation of Thomas\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights. Brief of Appellant at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Denying the motion for mistrial was not an abuse of discretion. As the district court explained, \u201c[Thomas] didn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t want to talk to the FBI. He told the FBI he was at a different place when the murder occurred. That is two entirely different things. [Thomas] was told who they were, he was told what they were investigating, he was asked the question, and he gave an answer.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dorlouis, </em>107 F.3d 248, 257 (4th Cir.1997) (noting that denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial \u201cis within the sound discretion of the district court and will be disturbed only under the most extraordinary of circumstances\u201d) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Newton\u2019s contentions are equally merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">First, Newton maintains that the district court erred in admitting the grand jury testimony of an unavailable witness. He contends that introduction of this testimony deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confront all witnesses against him. But it is well settled that statements by unavailable declarants are admissible if they \u201ccontainf] \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 such that adversarial testing would be expected to add little, if anything, to the statements\u2019 reliability.\u201d <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 124-25, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (quoting <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980)). The testimony of the unavailable witness in this case contained such guarantees: it was voluntary, given under oath to a grand jury, from personal knowledge, and consistent with testimony provided by other eye witnesses. <em>See United States v. McHan, </em>101 F.3d 1027, 1037-38 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Newton also contends the Federal Rules of Evidence barred introduction of the grand jury testimony, and that the district court erred in sustaining Thomas\u2019 objection to evidence of the victim\u2019s character. Because Newton did not raise either of these arguments before the district court, our review is for plain error. Newton must show: (1) an error; (2) that the error was plain; (3) that the error affected substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these three elements are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect [s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">With respect to both arguments, we note that there were four eyewitnesses present at the trial who testified that Newton \u201ctackled or caught up to and pulled down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Mr. Hawkins,\u201d so that Thomas could stab him to death. The only contrary testimony came from Newton, who was self-interested, and from Thomas, who was not only self-interested but also admitted that he had lied to the FBI about his role in the killing. Given this evidence, even if admission of the challenged evidence was error, we would not exercise our discretion to notice it since such error does not \u201cseriously affect the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Furthermore, this abundant evidence also renders Newton\u2019s contention as to the alleged insufficiency of the evidence meritless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Accordingly, the convictions and sentences are in all respects</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\">. Read liberally, Thomas\u2019 brief could also be understood to assert that the evidence about his demeanor was prejudicial, but we find this argument unsupported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-17\">. Both Thomas and Newton also timely filed supplemental pro se petitions or letters, which we treat as supplemental appellate briefs, in which they assert that they received ineffective assistance from counsel. We review such claims on direct appeal only when the ineffectiveness \u201cconclusively appears\u201d on the record, and here, it does not. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>136 F.3d 972, 979 (4th Cir.1998). Thomas also raises several additional issues; all of which are clearly merit-less.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
