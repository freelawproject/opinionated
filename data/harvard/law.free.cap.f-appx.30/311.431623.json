Hamrick seeks review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision and order dismissing his appeal from an Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision denying his claim for black lung benefits as untimely. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">A notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days from the date upon which the decision or order of the ALJ was filed in the Office of the District Director. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.205. The ALJ\u2019s decision and order were filed in the Office of the District Director on July 31, 2001. Hamrick\u2019s notice of appeal, postmarked September 5, 2001, and received in the Office of the Clerk on September 10, 2001, is therefore untimely. <em>See Dominion Coal Corp. v. Honaker, </em>33 F.3d 401, 405 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s order dismissing Hamrick\u2019s appeal as untimely. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
