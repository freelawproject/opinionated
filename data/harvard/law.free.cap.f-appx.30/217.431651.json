To the extent that Watkins seeks to appeal the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief, we dismiss that appeal as untimely. The district court entered its final order denying \u00a7 2255 relief on September 25, 2001. Watkins\u2019 notice of appeal was received in this court on December 12, 2001. Because Watkins noted his appeal more than sixty days after the district court\u2019s order without obtaining an extension of time or reopening the appeal period, we dismiss that aspect of his appeal as untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a); <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). As to the court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, as to that order, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. See <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>Nos. CR-99-513-S; CA-01-2830-S (D.Md. Oct. 25, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
