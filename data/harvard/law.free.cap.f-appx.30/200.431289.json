We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because McEvily\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on September 17, 2001. Giving him the benefit of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c) and <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), McEvily\u2019s notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on October 28, 2001. Because McEvily failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
