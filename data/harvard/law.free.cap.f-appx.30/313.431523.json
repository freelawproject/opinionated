Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Rasnake v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Prog., </em>No. 00-735-BLA (BRB Apr. 19, 2001; Sep. 25, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
