Alford appeals the district court\u2019s judgment entered pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the Appellees in this civil action and the court\u2019s order denying his motion for a new trial. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error. Alford offers only conclusory assertions in support of his claim that the Appellees were responsible for his automobile accident. In addition, Alford failed to object to Appellees\u2019 cross-examination of Alford regarding his medication, and failed to move for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See Alford v. Meltzer, </em>No. CA-99-6-1 (N.D.W. Va. filed Sept. 7, 2001, entered Sept. 10, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
