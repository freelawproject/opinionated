(\u201cHamlet\u201d), on her age discrimination claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2001) and the North Carolina Equal Employment Practices Act (NCEEPA), N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 143-422.2 (2000); and granting judgment as a matter of law to Hamlet on her negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix and supplemental joint appendix, the district court\u2019s orders and rulings from the bench. The court properly found that Jacobs failed to show the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons Hamlet offered for terminating her were pretextual. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 137-39, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Furthermore, the court properly concluded that Jacobs failed to establish her negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims as a matter of law. <em>See Soderlund v. Kuch, </em>143 N.C.App. 361, 546 S.E.2d 632, 636 (N.C.Ct.App.2001). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Jacobs v. Hamlet HMA, Inc., </em>No. CA-00-649-1 (M.D.N.C. July 24 &amp; Sept. 13, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
