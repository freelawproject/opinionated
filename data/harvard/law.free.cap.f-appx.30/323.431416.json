We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because Grady\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-11\"> For the purpose of this appeal we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed.
