For the first time on appeal, he challenges his sentence, contending the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement to his offense level pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2000) for using or possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense. Finding no plain error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Because Mendez did not object to the application of the enhancement during sentencing, we review for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find the Government provided sufficient evidence that the firearm transactions facilitated or potentially facilitated the drug transaction. <em>See United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 829 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, the district court did not commit plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Mendez\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
