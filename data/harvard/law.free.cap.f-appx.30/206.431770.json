The district court declined Walker\u2019s petition for mandamus relief and denied his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Courts are extremely reluctant to grant mandamus relief. <em>In re Ford Motor Co., </em>751 F.2d 274, 275 (8th Cir.1984). In seeking mandamus relief, a petitioner carries the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate means to attain the relief and that his right to such relief is clear and indisputable. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Walker failed to meet this heavy burden and thus we affirm on the reasoning of the district court\u2019s orders denying Walker\u2019s mandamus petition and motion to reconsider. <em>See In re: Walker, </em>No. CA-01-2906 (D. Md. Oct. 9, 2001; Oct. 29, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
