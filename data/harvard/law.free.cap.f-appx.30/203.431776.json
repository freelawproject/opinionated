The district court dismissed without prejudice Ballard\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Ballard\u2019s motion to amend and motion for declaratory relief essentially are the latest in a series of motions for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition. Because Ballard has stated no grounds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>reconsideration, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>674 F.2d 310, 313 (4th Cir.1982) (no relief warranted when motion for reconsideration merely asks district court to change its mind). Ballard\u2019s motion for en banc hearing is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
