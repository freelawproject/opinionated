In three prior lawsuits, other groups of former Kelly-Springfield workers brought similar claims against Goodyear. <em>See Heinrich v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>532 F.Supp. 1348 (D.Md.1982); <em>McClelland v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>735 F.Supp. 172 (D.Md.1990); <em>Jewell v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>Civ. No. S-89-3235. <em>Heinrich </em>settled, but Goodyear prevailed on summary judgment in <em>McClelland </em>and <em>Jewell </em>because the plaintiffs were unable to show proximate causation. This Court affirmed both <em>McClelland </em>and <em>Jewell </em>on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">In this litigation, the district court likewise found that plaintiffs failed to show sufficient evidence of proximate causation and granted summary judgment to Goodyear. <em>See Aldridge v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>34 F.Supp.2d 1010, 1017 (D.Md.1999) <em>(Aldridge III). </em>Goodyear supplied only ten percent of the potentially hazardous chemicals to which plaintiffs were exposed. <em>Id. </em>at 1017. Moreover, plaintiffs failed to produce evidence that a \u201cparticular, identifiable chemical supplied by Goodyear was a legal cause of their injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1019. Finally, the district court rejected the affidavits of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses as too vague and conclusory, lacking reliance on scientific research or literature, and as failing to address possible alternative causes of plaintiffs\u2019 illnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 1024. The district court, however, did not permit the <em>Aldridge </em>plaintiffs <em>any </em>discovery, but relied on the discovery produced in the previous litigation against Goodyear.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">This court vacated the district court\u2019s summary judgment order and remanded \u201cwith instructions [to] provide the Workers a <em>limited </em>opportunity for discovery so that they may seek those documents and information and <em>only </em>those documents and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>formation, responsive to their requests that have <em>not previously been disclosed </em>in one or the other of the litigations.\u201d <em>Aldridge v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>223 F.3d 263, 266 (4th Cir.2000) <em>(Aldridge TV) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On remand, the district court held that the employees were <em>still </em>not entitled to any discovery. <em>See Aldridge v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>198 F.R.D. 72 (D.Md.2000) (Al<em>dridge V, </em>the decision from which appellants appeal). The district court noted that plaintiffs failed to identify \u201cvery specifically that very small amount of information that they believe might exist,\u201d as we stated in <em>Aldridge IV. Id. </em>at 76. Moreover, the discovery requested by plaintiffs either: 1) was duplicative, 2) had never been presented as a request to the district court before, or 3) had no relevance to the critical issue of causation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In March of 1997, in response to Goodyear\u2019s initial motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs had submitted six affidavits under Rule 56(f) requesting further discovery. In <em>Aldridge V, </em>the district court refused to consider any new requests for discovery, and considered only the discovery requests \u201cpreviously made\u201d in plaintiffs\u2019 six Rule 56(f) affidavits. <em>See </em>198 F.R.D. at 78. The district court concluded that four of the six affidavits requested information available in the discovery undertaken in <em>Heinrich </em>and <em>McClelland. Id. </em>at 78-79. As to the fifth and sixth affidavits, the district noted \u201cfive possible areas\u201d that may relate to discovery not previously available to plaintiffs, but ultimately concluded that none of these areas was relevant to the dispositive issue of causation. <em>Id. </em>at 79-81. Accordingly, the district court denied further discovery and reinstated its grant of summary judgment from <em>Aldridge III.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Having had the benefit of oral argument and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly decided the issues before it. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
