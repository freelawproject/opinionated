He appeals his conviction and sentence. Edwards\u2019 attorney has filed a brief citing <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), requesting this court conduct a de novo review of the record but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Edwards was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not file such a brief despite being granted an extension of time to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case. Our review convinces us that Edwards\u2019 plea was knowing and voluntary, and was supported by an adequate factual basis. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Edwards\u2019 sentence of 120 months imprisonment is within the properly calculated Guideline<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> range. We have found no meritorious issues for appeal, and therefore affirm Edwards\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-24\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
