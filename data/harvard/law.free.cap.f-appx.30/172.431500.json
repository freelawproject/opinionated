She also appeals the court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations to dismiss her claims under Title VII of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78j(b) (West 1997 &amp; Supp. 2001), and to allow her claim under the Equal Pay Act to proceed. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the orders are not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The orders here appealed are neither final orders nor appeal-able interlocutory or collateral orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. We deny Patterson\u2019s motion for stay of judgment and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
