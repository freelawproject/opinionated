In 1998, Mr. Thompson was working when he experienced severe angina. He was admitted to the hospital and underwent emergency cardiac bypass surgery. Before the surgery, Dr. Scanlan, a cardiologist, noted that Mr. Thompson also might be suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The cardiac surgery was successful and Mr. Thompson was released from the hospital. In his second post-operative visit in late February, Dr. Scanlan referred Mr. Thompson to Dr. Vora, a pulmonologist. Dr. Vora diagnosed Mr. Thompson with severe COPD, noting that he had lost 70% of his breathing capacity and that his breathing condition would only worsen. Dr. Vora found that Mr. Thompson\u2019s COPD permanently disabled him from all activities, but was unrelated to his previous cardiac problems. Mr. Thompson filed his claim for long-term disability benefits on July 22, 1998, asserting that he was permanently disabled due to \u201csevere obstructive airways disease and emphysema.\u201d J.A. 177. On September 21, 1998, LINA wrote Mr. Thompson a letter denying his claim. J.A. 245-49. The denial relied on the pre-existing condition limitation in the Plan. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, LINA wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">Since you consulted with Dr. Anderson on 9/12/1997 for hypercholesterolemia which is a condition related directly or indirectly to the cardiac condition that stopped you from working, you do not satisfy the Pre Existing Condition Limitation as previously defined. Therefore, you are not eligible for Monthly Benefit (sic) under the Long Term Disability policy BK 3990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">J.A. 248. The letter also advised Mr. Thompson of his appellate rights, indicating that if he disputed the denial, he could send a written statement of reasons for his disagreement and \u201ca letter from his physician(s) explaining and supplying information contrary to the above.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">On October 5, 1998, Mr. Thompson appealed LINA\u2019s benefits disqualification. Mr. Thompson wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">The cardiac condition is not the condition that has disabled me and prevented my return to work. The diseases that have caused my disability are COPD (severe obstructive airways disease) and emphysema, which have absolutely nothing to do with hypercholesteralemia (sic).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">J.A. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">On November 18, 1998, LINA affirmed its earlier finding of ineligibility because \u201cthe pre-existing condition limitation\u201d was not satisfied. J.A. 251. On May 6, 1999, in response to a letter from Mr. Thompson\u2019s lawyer, LINA reaffirmed its position that Mr. Thompson was disqualified from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>benefits because it found his disability resulted from a pre-existing cardiac condition. J.A. 256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In September 1999, Mr. Thompson filed this action in federal court, alleging an improper denial of long-term disability benefits. In its answer, LINA again stated its position that Mr. Thompson was not eligible for benefits because he did not satisfy the pre-existing condition limitation. Then, on November 14, 2000, more than two years after Mr. Thompson filed his claim, LINA moved for summary judgment and raised for the first time the Plan\u2019s \u201cactive service\u201d provision as a basis for its denial of benefits. J.A. 5, 397, 403. The district court granted LINA\u2019s motion, relying on the Plan\u2019s active service provision. The court reasoned that since Mr. Thompson was not in \u201cactive service\u201d when he was diagnosed with COPD, LINA properly denied his claim. Mr. Thompson now appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Thompson argues that the district court erred by awarding summary judgment based on a reason LINA raised for the first time upon judicial review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">In enacting ERISA, Congress established procedural safeguards to ensure that fiduciaries would administer employee benefit plans \u201csolely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104(a)(1) &amp; 1001(b); <em>see also Makar v. Health Care Corp. of the Mid-Atlantic, </em>872 F.2d 80, 83 (4th Cir.1989). Fiduciaries must provide \u201cfull and fair reviews\u201d of claims for benefits. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1 (2001). Plan administrators are required to state the reason(s) for a denial and provide the specific plan provision(s) that formed the basis of the decision. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1; <em>see also Weaver v. Phoenix Home Life Mut. Ins. Co., </em>990 F.2d 154, 158 (4th Cir.1993). Fiduciaries must notify claimants of their decisions in writing and in language likely to be understood by one of ordinary intelligence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1; <em>see also Grossmuller v. Int\u2019l Union, </em>715 F.2d 853, 858 (3d Cir.1983). The decision must be objectively reasonable and based on substantial evidence. <em>Ellis v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>126 F.3d 228, 233 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">These procedural safeguards are at the foundation of ERISA. Fiduciary compliance is essential to upholding the administrative integrity of this statutory scheme. <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co., Inc. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 15, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987); <em>Weaver, </em>990 F.2d at 157. For these reasons, courts generally find abuse of discretion where a fiduciary neglects his responsibilities. <em>Weaver, </em>990 F.2d at 159; <em>see also Marolt v. Alliant Techsystems, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 617, 618 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Halpin v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>962 F.2d 685, 697 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Grossmuller, </em>715 F.2d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">LINA would have us bypass ERISA\u2019s procedural safeguards. Here, LINA denied Mr. Thompson\u2019s claim for benefits in September 1998, explaining that his cardiac condition disqualified him from receiving benefits under the Plan\u2019s pre-existing condition limitation. LINA also relied on the pre-existing condition limitation to affirm the denial on appeal. When Mr. Thompson filed suit, LINA\u2019s Answer to Mr. Thompson\u2019s Complaint again set forth the pre-existing condition limitation as the sole reason for its denial. Not until the summary judgment stage in November 2000, did LINA assert the Plan\u2019s \u201cactive service\u201d provision as the rationale for its denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">At this late stage, allowing LINA to raise a new basis for denial would deprive Mr. Thompson of the procedural fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ness guaranteed to claimants under ERISA. Quite simply, Mr. Thompson and every other claimant is statutorily entitled to expect that plan administrators will follow mandatory rules of procedure. LINA had a fiduciary duty to consider Mr. Thompson\u2019s claim fully and fairly and to provide him with the specific disqualifying reason or reasons. <em>See Weaver, </em>990 F.2d at 158. A district court\u2019s review is limited to whether the rationale set forth in the initial denial notice is reasonable. A court may not consider a new reason for claim denial offered for the first time on judicial review. We find that the district court erred in relying on LINA\u2019s \u201cactive service\u201d argument when it reviewed LINA\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Having found that judicial review is limited to the reason stated in the denial notice, we now review that reason. <em>See de Nobel v. Vitro Corp., </em>885 F.2d 1180, 1186 (4th Cir.1989) (reviewing the fiduciary\u2019s decision directly instead of remanding where there was a developed record of the fiduciary\u2019s review and immediate review was in the interest of justice). Where a plaintiff appeals the grant of summary judgment, this court reviews the decision de novo and applies the same standards employed by the district court. <em>Brogan v. Holland, </em>105 F.3d 158, 161 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Here, the Plan provides that payment of benefits begins when the fiduciary receives \u201cdue proof\u2019 of eligibility. We find that this provision granted LINA the discretion to interpret and apply the terms of the Plan. <em>See, e.g., Perez v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>150 F.3d 550, 556 (6th Cir.1998) (en banc) (finding that plan language requiring \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d conferred discretion). Where the Plan confers discretion, we review the plan administrator\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. We will not disturb that decision if it is objectively reasonable and based upon substantial evidence. <em>Ellis, </em>126 F.3d at 232 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Brogan, </em>105 F.3d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Because LINA serves as both the insurer and claims administrator, we apply a modified abuse of discretion review to counteract the conflict of interest present. <em>Bedrick v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>93 F.3d 149, 152 (4th Cir.1996). The greater the incentive for the fiduciary to benefit himself by a certain interpretation, the more objectively reasonable the fiduciary\u2019s decision must be and the more substantial the evidence must be to support it. <em>Ellis, </em>126 F.3d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">A pre-existing condition limitation generally excludes coverage during the first year for illnesses resulting from underlying conditions that were present in the three months prior to the insurer\u2019s assumption of coverage. Here, the Plan\u2019s pre-existing condition limitation provides that LINA will not be responsible to pay benefits for any period of disability that <em>\u201cresults, </em>directly or indirectly, from an injury or sickness\u201d for which the employee sought treatment in the three months pri- or to the effective date of his insurance coverage. J.A. 245 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Here, LINA applies the limitation because it believes the disabling condition \u201crelates\u201d to the pre-existing condition. In letters denying Mr. Thompson\u2019s claim, LINA applied the limitation and explained that the two conditions were \u201crelated,\u201d because Mr. Thompson was diagnosed with COPD while being treated for his heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">A dictionary definition of the term \u201cresults\u201d means \u201cto happen or exist as a result of a cause.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New Col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>lege Dictionary 946 (2d ed.1995). \u201cRelates,\u201d on the other hand, merely requires any \u201cconnection\u201d or \u201cassociation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 935. \u201cResults\u201d requires a causal link; \u201crelates\u201d does not. Although LINA found a relationship between the two conditions, it did not find that Mr. Thompson\u2019s preexisting cardiac condition caused his COPD condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We find that LINA\u2019s interpretation of the pre-existing condition limitation is not objectively reasonable or based on substantial evidence. All the physicians in the record asserted that Mr. Thompson\u2019s preexisting cardiac condition was not related to his disabling pulmonary illness. LINA made its decision without seeking the opinions of other physicians. The record shows that there was no causal connection between Mr. Thompson\u2019s two illnesses. Therefore, Mr. Thompson\u2019s COPD was not a pre-existing condition and the limitation was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Based on LINA\u2019s unreasonable interpretation and lack of substantial evidence, we find that LINA abused its discretion. LINA\u2019s actions do not reflect those of an unconflicted fiduciary. We reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for LINA and remand for the entry of judgment for the plaintiff and a determination of appropriate attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b193-8\">TRAXLER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AH_\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">I agree with the majority\u2019s determination that the district court erred in upholding the denial of ERISA benefits based upon a reason LINA first raised before the district court. Plan administrators must set forth the specific reasons for denial \u201cin a manner calculated to be understood by the participant\u201d and provide for a \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of any such denial. 29 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1133 (West 1999); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(g) (2001); <em>Weaver v. Phoenix Home Life Mut. Ins. Co., </em>990 F.2d 154, 157 (4th Cir.1993). \u201cThese procedural guidelines are at the foundation of ERISA,\u201d <em>Weaver, </em>990 F.2d at 157, and it was error for the district court to affirm the LINA\u2019s denial on a basis never advanced by LINA before the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s decision to remand this case for the entry of judgment for Thompson. I believe the proper remedy in these circumstances is to remand to the district court with directions that the case be returned to the plan administrator for a full and fair review of Thompson\u2019s claim for disability benefits caused by his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <em>See Weaver, </em>990 F.2d at 159 (noting that \u201cwhere the plan administrator has failed to comply with ERISA\u2019s procedural guidelines and the plaintiff/participant has preserved his objection to the plan administrator\u2019s noncompliance, the proper course of action for the court is remand to the plan administrator for a \u2018full and fair review.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Berry v. Cibar-Geigy Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1003, 1007 n. 4 (4th Cir.1985) (also noting propriety of remand in such circumstances because \u201c[t]he question of eligibility must be resolved by the plan in the first instance, not the court.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Finally, because I would hold that the plan administrator failed to comply with ERISA\u2019s procedural guidelines and, therefore, that remand is necessary, I find it unnecessary to resolve in this proceeding the thorny question of whether the \u201cdue proof\u2019 provision in Thompson\u2019s policy is sufficient to confer discretionary authority upon LINA or whether we would ultimately review a properly-issued decision under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
