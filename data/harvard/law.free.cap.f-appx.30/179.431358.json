We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Taylor\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-24\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on October 23, 1998. Taylor\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on August 23, 2001. Because Taylor failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Taylor\u2019s motion for an order directing DNA testing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-21\"> We further note that this court has previously dismissed an appeal of this same order on the merits. <em>Taylor v.
