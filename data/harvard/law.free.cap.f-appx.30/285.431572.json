The district court found that Murrell\u2019s action challenged the fact or duration of his confinement, and thus should have been brought under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2000). On remand, the district court determined that Murrell was challenging an arrest that did not lead to a conviction or incarceration, and therefore that the incident that forms the basis of his \u00a7 1983 complaint is unconnected to his current incarceration. Thus, his claim is cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Brooks v. City of Winston-Salem, </em>85 F.3d 178, 181-82 (4th Cir.1996). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Murrell\u2019s action and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-26\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
