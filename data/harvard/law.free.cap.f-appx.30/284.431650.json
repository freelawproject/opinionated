Counsel has.filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggests on Simon\u2019s behalf that the district court erred in determining her sentence. Simon has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, although she was informed of her right to do so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">Simon contends the district court erred in sentencing her to thirty-seven months of imprisonment. However, because Simon\u2019s sentence was within the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range and less than the statutory maximum sentence, it is not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-24\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Simon\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
