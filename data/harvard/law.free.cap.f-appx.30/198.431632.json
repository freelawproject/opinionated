In his petition, Quinones-Molinar challenged his continued post-removal detention by the Immigration and Nationalization Service under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4. The record reflects that during the pendency of this appeal, Quinones-Molinar was deported to Panama. Finding this appeal to be moot, we dismiss it accordingly. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
