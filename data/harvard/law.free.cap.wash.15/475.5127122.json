The complaint states but a single cause of action against all the defendants. Each and all of the defendants were necessary and proper parties to a complete adjudication upon plaintiff\u2019s rights. The ground upon which the removal is claimed is that of diverse citzenship under the separable controversy clause of the statute. <em>Ayres v. Wiswall, </em>5 Sup. Ct. 90; <em>Coney v.

Failure of one of the defendants to join in the petition is fatal to the right of removal when there is no separable controversy. <em>Thompson v.

The action was brought to foreclose a mortgage given by the appellant and her husband, Henry F. Suksdorf, upon land in Spokane county. The other defendants were represented as claiming some interest in said lands, which, it was alleged, was subsequent to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. The defendants were served with process in said action, the service upon appellant being by publication. She was a resident of the state of Oregon. She appeared in the action on September 16, 1895, and made a motion for security for costs. Thereafter, on October 14th, the default of all the defendants excepting appellant was entered. A motion for judgment made by the plaintiff was denied and appellant was granted an extension of time until October 23, 1895, within which to answer. On said last date appellant made the application in question for a transfer of the cause to the federal court, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">There was no error in denying the application for a transfer. The complaint stated but a single cause of action against all the defendants, and they, or some of them at least, aside from appellant, were necessary parties to a complete determination of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, and there was no such separable controversy as would entitle the appellant to a transfer of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Furthermore, the application was properly denied in consequence of not having been seasonably made. Appellant was in default. The extension of time which was granted was to allow her to answer, and should not be held as having enlarged the time within which she could apply for a transfer of the cause to the federal court, as such application should have been made before the expiration of the time fixed by statute within which she was called upon to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Hoyt, C. J., and Dunbar, Anders and Gordon, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
