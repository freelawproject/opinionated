In so doing, the court will but decide an issue proposed by the appellant himself in his complaint. If this respondent has an equitable lien upon the property in question, a court of equity will enforce such a lien against one intermeddling with the mortgaged property. <em>Wetzel v.

J. Noyes all his right and interest in the said license; that the said Noyes under and by virtue of the said license and assignment thereof, entered upon the land therein described in September, 1892, and cut therefrom the logs in controversy, and thereby became the owner of such logs, subject only to the lien reserved in the license above described. Many other findings were made by the court, but we think a recital of these sufficient for the purposes of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">An action was brought by the appellant to foreclose this chattel mortgage, Noyes defaulted, and the court entered a decree granting judgment in favor of the appellant against Noyes for the amount asked for, but subjecting their lien to the lien of the respondents, viz., the sum of $1.50 per thousand feet, and from this judgment appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Briefs, somewhat elaborate, have been prepared by counsel in this case, but we think the contention of the appellant cannot be sustained. The findings of the court are sustained by the testimony, and in our judgment the findings of facts sustain the law announced by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The respondent, together with Walker as its trustee, having a legal title, could deal with the premises as the legal owner, subject to be called to account only in a matter concerning the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and it could maintain an action in its own name in any matter affecting the trust property. By investing Walker with the legal title, as shown by the pleadings and the testimony, they created him their agent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>third parties, especially where notice is given of the action of the agent by record, as in this case, cannot question his authority so long as it is not denied by the <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We are also inclined to think from the record that Noyes cut the timber under the authority of the Ledger license, consequently Noyes, Moody and Ledger are estopped from denying Walker\u2019s authority to execute the license. We have examined the authorities cited by appellant under paragraph one of his brief, but do not think that they are in point. So far as the right of lien in the respondents is concerned in this case, this was a lien by contract, and was enforcible in equity although the contract did not amount to a legal mortgage. See 1 Jones on Liens, \u00a7 27 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">But even if it be conceded that the respondent had nothing more than a lien interest in the property, he is entitled to have the interest established and. the priorities adjusted: that was the object the appellant had in bringing it into court, and the deciding of this issue and establishing the priorities was in response to appellant\u2019s demand. It is an equitable proceeding; the parties in interest were before the court; the priorities were adjusted under competent testimony; audit seems to us in accordance with the right, as the facts were portrayed by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The judgment will, therefore, in all things be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Hoyt, C. J., and Anders, Gordon and Scott, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
