Mun-roe, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-18\">Tbe ultimate question' presented by this appeal is tbe validity of a special assessment upon lots of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>appellant in the city of Denver to defray the expense of a sidewalk constructed by the city in front of these lots. The assessment was held to be valid by the trial court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-3\">The charter of the city under which the proceedings were had in the first instance, which resulted in the construction of the sidewalk, provided that the city council, upon the recommendation of the board of public works, may, by ordinance, order the construction of sidewalks. Upon the passage of such ordinance the city clerk shall notify the owners of property to construct such walks. If not constructed by the owners within the time specified, the city is authorized to do so. If constructed by the city, a warrant for the payment of the expense thereof shall issue, but shall be held by the clerk for the period of thirty days in order to afford the owner an opportunity to take it up. It then provides: \u201cAnd if such warrants are not paid by the owner of the lots so improved within the thirty days, the city council, upon notice to the owners of the lots so improved who have not paid for the construction of the sidewalk adjacent to the same, by publication for ten successive days in a newspaper published in the city of Denver, and hearings, shall assess the respective amounts due upon each lot for the construction of the sidewalk adjacent to the same.\u201d \u2014 Laws 1889, p. 139, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-4\">In September, 1891, pursuant to the recommendation of the board of public works, an ordinance was passed creating \u201cWest Denver Sidewalk District No. 6,\u201d ordering the construction of sidewalks within this territory. This district was described by reference to streets and embraced the lots in question. Thereafter, notice was published addressed to \u201cThe property owners in West Denver Sidewalk District No. 6,\u201d requiring them to construct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>sidewalks in front of their property therein within a specified time. This notice contained a description of the district, by reference to streets. The then owner of the lots of appellant neglected to construct a walk in front thereof within the time specified, and the city constructed the same, between September, 1892, and August' following.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-3\">Section 12 of 'the ordinance provided, in substance, that after the construction of sidewalks within the district hy the city, the clerk shall give notice by publication to the owners who had not paid for such construction, that the city council at its regular meetings for the two months succeeding the date of the first publication of such notice would receive, hear, and determine any complaints or objections that the owners might have to offer against the assessment of their lots for sidewalks constructed by the city before any ordinance levying such assessments would be passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-4\">In 1893 the charter of the city of Denver was amended, requiring notice by publication to owners who had not constructed sidewalks in accordance with the requirements of the city authorities, to make their complaints or objections against the assessment of their lots within thirty days from the first publication of such notice. This amendment also provided that such objections as were filed would be heard and determined hy the city council before the passage of any ordinance assessing the cost of such sidewalks. \u2014 Laws 1893, p. 212, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">The notice contemplated by \u00a7 12 of the ordinance, <em>supra, </em>had not been given when this law took effect, and in November, 1895, the city council passed an ordinance amending \u00a7 12 so as to - require lot owners to present their objections within thirty days instead of two months, as originally provided. This amendatory ordinance was published -on Sunday. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The notice thereby contemplated was duly given, addressed to \u201cThe property owners in West Denver Sidewalk District No. 6.\u201d No objection to 'the cost of constructing the sidewalk in question was made by the owner, and the expense thereof was thereafter assessed against his lots. One of these lots is on a corner, and the expense of a walk across the intersection of the abutting streets between the lot line and the curb was assessed against it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-3\">Counsel for appellant contend that the assessment is illegal for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-4\">1. There was no law authorizing the creation of a sidewalk district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-5\">2. Notice to \u201cThe property owners of West Denver Sidewalk District No. 6\u201d was not a notice to lot owners as required by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-6\">3. That the law. and ordinances under which the assessment was made did not afford owners an opportunity to be heard at a specified time and place on the question of benefits, and the charter provided no specific method of assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-7\">4% Thaf the amendatory ordinance was illegal because it changed the time within which objections might be filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-8\">5. That this ordinance was illegal because published on Sunday.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-9\">6. That it is illegal because the corner lot was charged with the expense of a walk across the intersection of the abutting streets between the lot line and the curb. The cost of this walk can be accurately determined. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-10\">The constitutionality of the law creating the board of public works is also challenged.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b307-11\">Mr. Justice Gabbert</author>\n<p id=\"AV5\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">1. There is no provision of the charter with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>respect to the creation of a sidewalk district. In the absence of statutory regulations, the municipal authorities are vested with discretion in laying out a district within which local public improvements shall be <em>made. </em>\u2014 City <em>of Denver v. Campbell, </em>33 Colo. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">2. In giving\u2019 notice to property owners to construct, or in respect to, a local improvement, in so far as description of property is concerned, it is sufficient if, from such notice, it can be said the lot owners were advised that their property would be affected by the proceedings to which the notice referred. The notices in the case at bar were addressed to \u201cThe property owners in West Denver Sidewalk District No. 6.\u201d Therein the district was described with reference to streets. This was sufficient to advise all persons owning lots within the territory thereby described of the proceedings involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">3. The charter is not invalid because it does not specify the tribunal (we refer to the charter provision found in the Law of 1889), or the time or place for hearing objections before assessments for sidewalks constructed by the city become final. Power is thereby granted the city authorities to provide for such notice and such tribunal, and that is <em>sufficient. </em>\u2014 City <em>of Denver v. Dumars, </em>33 Colo. 94; <em>City of Denver v. Londoner, </em>33 Colo. 104; <em>Paulsen v. Portland, </em>149 U. S. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">For similar reasons the charter provisions of 1893 are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Neither is the ordinance invalid because it does not specify the time and place when objections filed will be heard and determined. It contemplates a hearing upon objections to assessments, and names the tribunal to hear them before such as are objected to become final. Perhaps owners filing objections to assessments in response to the notice by the clerk, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>which the ordinance says shall be given to therb., should have notice of the time and place when they would be considered and determined, but that right has not been denied in the case at bar, because no objections were filed, and the ordinance cannot be construed to inhibit or not to require such a notice to those who have filed objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">The charter and ordinance are not invalid because neither specifies the character of objections which will be considered in fixing the amount of the sidewalk assessments. Having provided for a hearing with respect to such assessments, it logically follows that the tribunal designated shall hear and determine all questions which would be competent to present to that tribunal, attacking the validity or amount of such <em>assessments. </em>\u2014 City <em>of Denver v. Dumars, supra; Fallbrook Irr. Dist. v. Bradley, </em>164 U. S. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Whether or not the charter of 1889 failed to provide a specific method for determining how the assessment against a lot to defray the expense of constructing a sidewalk in front thereof should be made, or left it with the city authorities to make such assessment according to benefits, is not presented by the record. It was the province of the city authorities to determine the rule to be followed in making, and the amount of the assessment in the first instance. Neither appellant nor his predecessor raised any question before the special forum provided by law to determine these questions. The owner must avail himself of the opportunity afforded to appear and mak'e objections to special assessments in the special forum which the law has designated for that purpose. Otherwise, he will not be heard to object in any other <em>forum.- </em>\u2014 City <em>of Denver v. Dumars, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">4. The fact that the amendatory ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>shortened the time within which objections to assessments might be filed is not a matter of which appellant can complain. The charter as it existed at the time when the proceedings were initiated did not specify the time within which such objections might be filed, but left that matter entirely to the discretion of the city authorities. The latter, by changing this time, only changed the procedure, and this-change did not divest the lot owner of any vested right.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">5. . This amendatory ordinance is not illegal because published on Sunday. It was not process. <em>\u2014City of Denver v. Dumars, supra; City of Denver v. Londoner, supra; Dumars v. City of Denver, </em>16 Colo. App. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">6. There are two reasons why the question of assessing the corner lot with the expense of laying a walk from the lot line to the curb of the abutting street cannot be considered: (1) There was no application to the tribunal provided by law to correct this alleged <em>error </em>\u2014 Spalding <em>v. City of Denver, </em>33 Colo. 172; and (2) it appears that the alleged excess is susceptible of mathematical calculation. The entire assessment, therefore, is not invalid, but only that which is excessive; but before a. property owner can take advantage of an excessive assessment in such circumstances, he must pay, or tender, the amount which is <em>valid. </em>\u2014 City <em>of Denver v. Kennedy, </em>33 Colo. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In <em>City of Denver v. Londoner, supra, </em>the law creating the board of public works of the city of Denver was declared constitutional. This was followed in <em>City of Denver v. Iliff, </em>38 Colo. 357. No new questions are presented by counsel for appellant on that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed. Decision <em>en banc. Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
