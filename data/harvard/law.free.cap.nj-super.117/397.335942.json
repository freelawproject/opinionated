The bar is herewith placed on notice that the rule is intended, ordinarily, to be complied with as written. Any complaint about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the fairness of the rule should be addressed to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In the particular circumstances here shown, however, denial of the timely motion to suppress would visit an undue hardship on a defendant asserting a constitutional right. The several delays in scheduling the hearing of the motion were not the fault of defendant. The State was not prejudiced, a brief for defendant having actually been served on the prosecutor before the date finally agreed upon for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The order is reversed and the matter remanded for hearing of the motion to suppress.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
