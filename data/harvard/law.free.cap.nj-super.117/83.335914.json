J. S. A. </em>2A:141-1. On April 29, 1970 he was sentenced to the State Eeformatory at Yardville, a maximum of seven years to apply. He timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">Defendant contends: (1) the admission of the in-court identification of him by the victim was reversible error because it was the product of an out-of-court identification which was a denial of due process; (2) the court erred in not permitting him to call his mother as an alibi witness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>thereby depriving him of due process of law; (3) the court committed plain error in not specifically charging the jury on \u201calibi,\u201d and (4) the court misled the jury as to what the contentions of the defense were.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">On June 21, 1969, at approximately 9:50 p.m. to 10 :15 p.m., Mr. Britt Hendrickson was standing in front of the Adams Theater in Newark. He had been in Perth Amboy, where he had had a few beers, until about 8:45 p.m. and then had come by automobile to Newark. As he was looking across the street at the Branford Theater, he was pulled to the ground from behind by three colored males. He was struck in the face by two of the men, while the third \u2014- a Negro in a white coat \u2014 went through his pockets and took his wallet containing $105. The lights of the marquee were on. Hendrickson testified that he could clearly see the face of this third man. As a result of the attack, Hendrickson was rendered unconscious and was hospitalized for a number of days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Officer James Braekin was on duty in the area of the incident at the time of its occurrence. After making his 10:30 p.m. call into headquarters, the officer was approached by a pedestrian. As a result of what this man told him, the officer proceeded towards the Adams Theater. Another passer-by approached him and his attention was directed across the street to a Negro male in a white coat. This proved to be defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Officer Braekin called for assistance on his walkie-talkie and then followed defendant through a crowd on Broad Street and into a pizzeria. There the defendant was apprehended and placed under arrest. The officer took defendant back to the scene of the robbery where Hendrickson still lay unconscious. After an ambulance arrived for the victim, defendant was taken to the First Precinct where he was searched. Nothing of an incriminating kind was found in his possession. He gave his name as Robert Johnson, 17 years of age, and also told the police his social security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>number. All this was false. His correct identification, name and age, were ascertained the next day. There was no record of the social security number given.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">At the trial in the County Court a <em>voir dire </em>hearing, out of the presence of the jury, was held concerning the identification procedure. Hendrickson testified thereat that he had been called to come to the Municipal Court about a month and a-half after the incident. The courtroom that day was \"full of colored.\u201d While he and his wife were sitting there, defendant was brought in by \u201ca white man.\u201d Hendrickson immediately recognized defendant as the man who had gone through his pockets. He was asked by the judge in the Municipal Court if he recognized defendant and he answered in the affirmative. When asked if he had had any doubts, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">No, sir. 1 wouldn\u2019t forget him, not that face over me, and going in my pockets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The trial judge held all testimony concerning identification admissible, apparently finding the identification at the Municipal Court proper and the in-court identification at trial not tainted. In the judge\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">The court is satisfied that, neither the out-of-court or the Magistrate\u2019s Court identification, or the in-eourt identification, are tainted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">During direct examination before the jury Hendrickson identified defendant as one of his assailants. Nothing was elicited by the prosecutor concerning the Municipal Court identification. This was, however, brought out by defendant\u2019s attorney on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Defendant asserts that at his arraignment, on September <em>22, </em>1969 in the County Court, he was not represented by counsel. At that time a demand was made upon him for a bill of particulars if he intended to rely on the defense of alibi. However, such a bill was never delivered by him or on his behalf. Eather, a letter was sent from the Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Defender\u2019s Office to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office approximately four months prior to trial. This stated that \u201cthe defendant may rely on the defense of an alibi. The alibi witness is Mrs. Doris Harris, 151 Clifton Avenue, Hewark, New Jersey [defendant\u2019s mother].\u201d It was defendant\u2019s contention that he was with his mother, sister, and nephew and one Lloyd Harris at his cousin\u2019s house in the evening of the day of the robbery. They allegedly left at about 10 :15 p.it., at which time he was driven to Broad and Market Streets, in Hewark. This is only a short distance from the scene of the crime. He walked over to get some pizza in a restaurant when he was arrested. Defendant\u2019s mother was offered as a witness at the trial to establish the fact that they were at the cousin\u2019s until 10:15 p.m. and then they drove defendant to Broad and Market Streets, where he alone left the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The State objected to the mother\u2019s testimony on the ground that <em>B. </em>3:11-1 had not been complied with. After argument on the issue, the court disallowed alibi testimony by defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. He denied participation in the crime. He contended that he gave a false name and age, because he was warned that they (the police) would beat him up if he was an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Defendant\u2019s cousin, Shirley Jones, testified that defendant and others had been at her house that evening; however, she did not know what time they left. A Doris Adams testified as a character witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Was the in-court identification of defendant the product of an improper out-of-court identification? This is the first question to be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Defendant places reliance upon the fifth amendment due process requirement. As pointed out by <em>Stovall v. </em>Denno, 388 <em>U. S. </em>293, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>1967, 18 <em>L. Ed. </em>1199 (1967), and subsequent cases, where identification is based upon im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>proper suggestive procedures, it will be inadmissible. Such determination must be made by viewing the identification in the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 302, 87 S. Ct. 1967. It must be considered whether the \u201cidentification procedure was so impermissively suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U. S. </em>377, 384, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>967, 971, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1247 (1968). See also <em>State v. Edge, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>580, 586-587 (1971); <em>State v. Mustacchio, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>265, 271-272 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In the instant case we find no such impropriety. The confrontation here, though one-to-one, was in no way suggestive. Immediately, upon defendant\u2019s being brought into the municipal courtroom \u2014 which was crowded with other Negroes \u2014 Hendrickson recognized defendant. This recognition was totally spontaneous and free of any external pressures. When called upon by the Magistrate, Hendrickson merely gave voice to his earlier recognition. The trial court was justified in finding that this \u201cidentification\u201d was a product of the victim\u2019s familiarity with defendant by reason of the happening on the night of the robbery, rather than any untoward procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Defendant also attacks the identification on the ground that he was denied his sixth amendment right to counsel. This is, of course, in reliance upon the rule set forth in <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 <em>U. S. </em>218, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>1926, 18 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1149 (1967). There it was held that a post-indictment line-up is a critical stage of the criminal process which requires representation of an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The United States Supreme Court has not decided specifically whether this rule encompasses pre-indictment situations. (It is interesting to note that <em>Stovall v. Denno </em>involved a pre-indictment situation, yet the issue never entered the court\u2019s consideration.) Nor has our Supreme Court ruled on the issue. See <em>State v. Edge, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>580, 586 (1971); <em>State v. Mustacchio, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>265, 269-270 (1970). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Courts in various jurisdictions have reached differing views. \u25a0See cases cited in <em>Mustacchio, supra, </em>at 270. Compare <em>State v. Jordan, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>563 (App. Div.), certification denied 58 <em>N. J. </em>338 (1971), with <em>State v. Earle, </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>523 (App. Div. 1970), certification granted 57 <em>N. J. </em>602 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">In <em>Earle, </em>the court held that a defendant under arrest and in police custody is entitled to counsel at a confrontation. In <em>Jordan, </em>the court, in affirming the conviction, found that the mere fact that defendant was in custody at the time of the line-up did not require presence of counsel. A functional test was there emphasized which would weigh \u201cpossible prejudice to the accused * * * against countervailing policy considerations.\u201d 113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 569-570.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In light of the witness\u2019 unequivocal identification of defendant, his proximity to him, and the excellent lighting conditions at the time of the offense, it is reasonable to find that the victim\u2019s identification stems from his first encounter with defendant and not from the subsequent confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We note, too, that the State limited its evidence on identification and the defense brought out the pretrial identification before the jury on the cross-examination of Hendrickson.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">We next consider whether the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to permit defendant\u2019s mother to testify as an alibi witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\"><em>R. </em>3:11-1 provides that if a defendant intends to rely upon the defense of alibi, upon demand by the prosecutor, he must furnish the prosecutor with the specifics of that defense including the contentions and witnesses. <em>R. </em>3 :11-2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">If such bill of particulars is not furnished as required, the court may refuse to allow the party in default to present witnesses at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>trial as to defendant\u2019s absence from or presence at the scene of the alleged offense, or make such other order or grant such adjournment as the interest of justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The purpose of this rule is to avoid the sudden introduction of factual contentions at trial which cannot be investigated without a recess. <em>State v. Garvin, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>268, 272-273 (1965). It seeks to do away with previous \u201cunfairness in criminal trials of a surprise alibi.\u201d <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>47 <em>N. J. </em>379, 388 (1966). Similar rules are in effect in most, if not all, jurisdictions, and their constitutionality has been repeatedly upheld. See <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 <em>U. S. </em>78, 80-86, 90 <em>S. Ct. </em>1893, 26 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 446 (1970); <em>State v. Angeleri, </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>382, <em>certiorari </em>denied 393 <em>U. S. </em>951, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>372, 21 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 362 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">At the time of the arraignment (September 22, 1969), defendant was served with the requisite demand which he acknowledged. It is contended that defendant was not represented by counsel prior to this acknowledgement. There-is no indication whether defendant had waived his right to counsel at this time, or whether he understood the demand. However, on November 7, 1969, a letter was sent from the Public Defender\u2019s office indicating that alibi <em>might </em>be a defense, and merely giving the name and address of the witness. Detective O\u2019Hare of the Prosecutors Office sent a letter to the person named but made no further inquiry. He allegedly was awaiting formal compliance with the earlier demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The response by the defense attorney indicates that he was aware of the demand; and, it would thus not be unreasonable to consider the demand effective. However, it must be considered whether the exclusion of the particular \u201calibi\u201d testimony by the trial judge was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Normally, the rule applicable to the defense of \u201calibi\u201d is applied strictly. <em>Annotation, \u201cNotice of Alibi \u2019\u2019 </em>30 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 480 (1953). However, in <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>47 <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>379 (1966), </em>in a somewhat comparable situation, a demand from the defense attorney was misplaced in the prosecutor\u2019s office and never answered. The court pointed out that the State had not refused to disclose the witnesses and defense could have readily obviated the problem by a pretrial motion to compel the State to answer. Eather, as the court expressed it, \u201cthe defense chose to sit back in the hope of gaining some advantage at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In <em>State v. Nunn, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>161 (App. Div. 1971), after holding that circumstantial witnesses were contemplated in <em>B. </em>3:11 \u2014 1, this court held that there was no clear abuse of discretion in excluding certain alibi testimony in light of the surrounding circumstances. The defense counsel had been aware of the witnesses\u2019 existence more than two weeks prior to trial. See also <em>State v. Woodard, </em>102 <em>N. J. Super. </em>419, 426 (App. Div.), certification denied 53 <em>N. J. </em>64 (1968); <em>certiorari denied, </em>395 <em>U. S. </em>938, 89 S. Ct. 2004, 23 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Other jurisdictions have had opportunity to treat this issue. In <em>State v. Martin, </em>2 <em>Ariz. App. </em>510, 410 <em>P. </em>2d 132 (Ct. App. 1966), it was held that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of alibi testimony because of non-compliance with the disclosure rule. Defendant had made an offer of proof at the trial. The court stated that for alibi to be an effective defense it must be shown that defendant was so far from the place of the alleged crime that he could not with ordinary exertion have participated in the crime. 21 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 136 (1965). The court found that the evidence presented did not meet this standard and thus there was no abuse in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">By way of contrast to strict compliance with the rule, see <em>Founts v. State, </em>483 <em>P. </em>2d 654 (Nev. Sup. Ct. 1971). There, defendant orally informed the prosecutor prior to trial that he intended to call an alibi witness. However, the trial judge disallowed the testimony in that no written notice had been timely submitted giving the specifics. The Supreme Court of Nevada reversed. Under their rule, such evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>was admissible \u201cupon good cause shown.\u201d They noted that the prosecutor had had time to investigate and was not surprised; the evidence directly controverted the State\u2019s case. \u201c[Sjtrict compliance should not be blindly required if the end result will make the criminal prosecution a game.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656. <em>Accord: Commonwealth v. Shider, </em>209 <em>Pa. Super. </em>133, 224 <em>A. </em>2d 802 (Super. Ct. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Likewise, in the instant case it is difficult to appreciate the State\u2019s claiming any surprise. The prosecutor had been aware of the one potential witness upon whom defendant would rely <em>if </em>he was going to urge the defense of alibi. The ambiguity of defendant\u2019s notice that he <em>might </em>rely on the defense is understandable in light of the tenuousness of the evidence. Moreover, even had the notice been explicit, the prosecutor would have been in no better position since defendant would not be <em>hound </em>to this defense. The trial judge should have permitted defendant to present this evidence. (It should also be noted that the judge refused to permit an offer of proof.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The question, however, is whether the error was reversible. Would the mother\u2019s testimony, in fact, amount to an effective alibi defense? Could the mother\u2019s testimony, if believed, exculpate defendant? The time of the robbery was set at between 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. The intended testimony was to be that defendant, his mother and others, had left the cousin\u2019s house at approximately 10:15 p.m. and traveled to Broad and Market Streets (apparently 15 minutes from the cousin\u2019s house). At that point, defendant got out of the car <em>alone. </em>The Broad and Market Street intersection is only about a block and a-half from the Branford Theater and less than two blocks from the Adams Theater \u2014 a three minute walk at best. The mother could not place defendant once he left the car. The time sequence is close but not precise. The mother\u2019s testimony could not have reasonably exculpated defendant. It would have placed him close to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the scene of the robbery and probably there at the critical time, as testified to by the victim and the police officer. Thus, we conclude the exclusion was not reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"> The court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the specific issue of <em>alibi. </em>No request to charge as to the defense of \u201calibi\u201d was made and no exception was taken to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Moreover, it has been held that alibi is not a \u201cseparate\u201d defense which requires a specific charge to the jury. <em>State v. Edge, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>580, 590 (1971); <em>State v. Garvin, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>268 (1965). Thus, there was no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Nor did the court mislead the jury was to what the contentions of the defense were. In its charge the trial court indicated that it was going to reiterate the contentions of both defendant and the State. This was done. Defendant\u2019s attorney claimed that the trial judge failed to indicate the \u201chighly suggestive nature\u201d of the identification. The court refused to recharge after this was noted. We find no error in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The trial judge had indicated that he was stating the facts as he recollected them. The defense attorney had had ample opportunity to set forth defendant\u2019s contentions in summation. Reliance was placed essentially on the matter of identification. The omission by the judge as to this matter was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
