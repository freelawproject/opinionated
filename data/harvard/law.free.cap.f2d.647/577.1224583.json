The vessels, travelling at a high rate of speed, appeared to be travelling together. According to the testimony of one customs agent, only one individual appeared to be aboard each vessel which militated against \u201cpeople going out fishing.\u201d These circumstances aroused the agents\u2019 suspicions. They decided to give chase. Because of the high rate of speed at which the vessels were travelling, the customs agents only caught one vessel. After hailing the appellants with a megaphone, the agents positioned their vessel alongside the appellants\u2019 vessel. Two men, the appellants, were on board. The agents identified themselves and requested permission to board. After receiving permission, two customs agents boarded the vessel and detected a strong odor which they believed came from marijuana. They then requested permission to search the hull of the boat. Appellants granted permission. Upon opening the hatch to the hull, the agents discovered approximately eighteen to twenty bales of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-19\">Appellants sought to have the marijuana suppressed on the ground that the customs agents lacked sufficient suspicion to stop their vessel. The trial court denied their motion. The trial court, in a bench trial, convicted appellants, Hector Tapanes Rua-no and Alfredo An\u00edbal Montejo Menchero, of importation of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether the customs agents possessed sufficient suspicion to stop appellants\u2019 vessel. United States Customs officials may make investigatory stops of vessels on inland waters \u201con facts which justify a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Serrano, </em>607 F.2d 1145, 1148 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 965, 100 S.Ct. 1655, 64 L.Ed.2d 241 (1980). This interpretation does not offend the fourth amendment. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>596 F.2d 674 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 963, 100 S.Ct. 448, 62 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">A customs officer testified that he stopped appellants\u2019 vessel because of the vessel\u2019s \u201chigh rate of speed,\u201d the early hour of the morning, the fact that the vessels appeared to be travelling together, and the fact that only one individual appeared on each boat which was \u201cinconsistent with people going out fishing.\u201d He further testified that the boats were violating the common courtesy usually given to other vessels by slowing down when entering Government Cut.</p>\n<p id=\"akx-dedup-0\">Under the relaxed standard announced in <em>Serrano, </em>we find that these facts constituted reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying appellants\u2019 motion to suppress. The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-13\">.

Alfrey, </em>620 F.2d 551, 555 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 101 S.Ct. 337, 66 L.Ed.2d 160 (1980) [emphasis added]. This standard is not applicable to the instant case, however, because the overwhelming evidence indicates that the customs officers stopped appellants boat not to inspect its documents but to investigate the suspicious circumstances surrounding the boat\u2019s entry into Government Cut. For example, when asked what, if any, action he took after observing the three boats, the customs officer stated \u201c[w]e observed the three vessels pass our location. Due to the high rate of speed they were traveling, we decided to give chase to [the] vessels to determine ... exactly where they were coming from and where they were going to.\u201d When asked whether he ever asked appellants for registration papers, the officer responded he believed he did but \u201creally I can\u2019t recall .... \u201d In our view, the customs officer\u2019s testimony militates against a finding that the officers stopped appellant\u2019s boat in order to check its documents. Under these circumstances, we apply the standard applicable to investigatory stops.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
