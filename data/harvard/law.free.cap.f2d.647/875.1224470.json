The returns did not reflect any income for the years in question, but did include numerous constitutional challenges to the income tax system. The Commissioner reconstructed Parkinson\u2019s tax liabilities from bank records and other third party records and assessed deficiencies and penalties for the three years in question. Parkinson, without the assistance of counsel, petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination. The Commissioner then moved for summary judgment pursuant to Tax Court Rule 121(b). Following the hearing on the Commissioner\u2019s motion, which Parkinson did not attend, the Tax Court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact presented and granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner. Parkinson then retained counsel and filed a motion for reconsideration which the Tax Court denied. Parkinson argues that the Tax Court erred in granting the Commissioner summary judgment on the petition for redetermination and in denying the motion for reconsideration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Pursuant to Tax Court Rule 121(d), which is derived from Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), a party must do more than rest on his pleadings to successfully oppose a motion for summary judgment. The resisting party \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Parkinson\u2019s conclusory characterization of the Commissioner\u2019s calculations as \u201carbitrary ... estimates,\u201d and his allusion to evidence, which he was unwilling to disclose before trial, were insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity accorded the Commissioner\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The Tax Court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration will not be overturned on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Nor-Cal Adjusters v. Commissioner, </em>503 F.2d 359, 363 (9th Cir. 1974). The Tax Court\u2019s refusal to reopen this case for submission of additional evidence was not a clear abuse of discretion. Parkinson has no right to reopen proceedings merely because he initially chose not to hire counsel and lacked the legal skills necessary to adequately represent himself. <em>Deininger v. Commissioner, </em>313 F.2d 221 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 853, 84 S.Ct. 113, 11 L.Ed.2d 80 (1963); <em>Coussement v.
