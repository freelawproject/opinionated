This time the question arises on the following claim (as asserted in the petition): In 1978, plaintiff United Electric Corporation (United) made a contract with Standard Conveyor Co. (Standard) to supply over $100,000 worth of electrical components which were to become part of a mechanized materials-handling system that Standard contracted with the United States Air Force to fabricate, test and install at McClellan Air Force Base. The Air Force required Standard to post a payment bond of $494,665.50 under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270a, an amount which United alleges was legally inadequate. Plaintiff says it performed its contractual obligations but did not receive payment from Standard which had filed a petition in bankruptcy in 1979, and is allegedly unable to pay. Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>ed then attempted to recover its compensation from Standard\u2019s surety, but the surety also refused compensation on the ground that the bond did not cover the materials provided by plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, plaintiff alleges the Government still retains a percentage of the contract in an amount ($550,000) much greater than United\u2019s demand ($107,958.42).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">Plaintiff seeks judgment in this court from the United States for its contract price, asserting that the Air Force acted negligently and failed to comply with the requirements of the Miller Act, thus creating an equitable lien in United\u2019s favor on contract retainages (or other funds which should have been but were not retained by defendant). Defendant has moved to dismiss the petition, saying that the subcontractor has no claim within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">The obvious difficulty for plaintiff is that the full court has already decided, in a comparable context, that we cannot entertain a subcontractor\u2019s claim which the prime (or a higher sub) and the surety have not paid. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. United States, </em>201 Ct.Cl. 1, 475 F.2d 1377 (1973) <em>(USF&amp;G). </em>There, the Miller Act surety had fully met its obligations under the payment and performance bonds, but certain laborers and materialmen remained unpaid. The surety and the unpaid subcontractors sued here, raising claims against contract retainages in the hands of the Government, and also alleging improper progress payments. The Government claimed priority to the retained funds on the basis of a tax lien and other unmet obligations owing to it by the prime contractor. After satisfaction of these debts, approximately $4,000 in unexpended contract funds remained \u2014 an amount far smaller than that still owed to the subcontractors. On these facts we held that'(l) the surety did not have priority against the United States for amounts necessary to satisfy tax and other obligations running from the prime to the Government; (2) the surety could not share in unexpended sums retained under the contract because it had not fully paid all of the laborers and materi-almen (although it had completely satisfied its payment bond obligation to them); and (3) the subcontractors did not have standing to sue the United States on their own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">The <em>USF&amp;G </em>issue which is now critical concerns the last of these holdings \u2014 the right of subcontractors to sue the United States directly for their compensation. Relying on precedent from this court as well as the Supreme Court, we ruled specifically that such a right does not exist. This en banc holding is of course, binding on this panel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But we can ask the full en banc court to reconsider that decision if we now think it wrong or questionable. We heard oral argument on the present case because a post- <em>USF&amp;G </em>ruling of the Tenth Circuit could be thought to undermine our decision in <em>USF&amp;G </em>(and is so presented by United). <em>Kennedy Electric Co. v. United States Postal Service, </em>508 F.2d 954 (10th Cir. 1974). Because of <em>Kennedy, </em>which United emphasizes strongly, we have recanvassed the ground and now conclude that that case is quite distinguishable and that we have no reason to question <em>USF&amp;G.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">In <em>Kennedy, </em>an electrical subcontractor which had performed work on a building for the Post Office Department (predecessor to the United States Postal Service) brought suit against the Postal Service for its compensation. That claimant had not been paid for its labor and materials because the prime had become insolvent and no Miller Act bonds had been posted. The Tenth Circuit, affirming a district court judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, held that the subcontractor had an equitable lien on contract retainages and amounts which had been improperly paid to the contractor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>assignee in violation of Postal Service regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\"><em>Kennedy </em>is quite different from both <em>USF&amp;G </em>and the present case on a crucial point. In <em>Kennedy </em>the Postal Service, rather than the United States, was the defendant. The Postal Service is an independent establishment with the general capacity (given it by Congress) to \u201csue and be sued,\u201d <em>see </em>39 U.S.C. \u00a7 401,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> not a subordinate unit of the Federal Government like the Air Force. In <em>Kennedy, </em>therefore, there was no bar of sovereign immunity to the subcontractor\u2019s suit, and the Postal Service was found to be \u201cjust as amenable to the judicial process as is a private enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 957, 960. <em>See also, F.H.A. v. Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 245, 60 S.Ct. 488, 490, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940). Indeed, while discussing our decision in <em>USF&amp;G, </em>the <em>Kennedy </em>court specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-5\"><em>USF&amp;G </em>is a different case from that at bar. We do not have a standing question. Our suit is against an independent establishment having the power to sue and be sued. [508 F.2d at 959.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">The broad, unlimited legislative declaration that the Postal Service could \u201cbe sued\u201d left the Tenth Circuit free to apply doctrines applicable to private persons, including principles of restitution, tort-law, and \u201ccontracts implied in law,\u201d and thereby to conclude that the equities of that subcontractor were paramount to those of the Postal Service, and that \u201c[i]n like circumstances a private enterprise could not take advantage of the misconduct of its transferor.\u201d 508 F.2d at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">The foundation of <em>USF&amp;G, </em>to the contrary, is that suit here against the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 is not unlimited and does not put the United States on the same plane, in all respects, as if it were a private entity. The controlling axiom is that the United States may be sued only to the extent that it allows its sovereign immunity to be waived. Through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, the United States has consented to be sued for money damages in certain restricted circumstances, the only relevant one being on the basis of a contract (either express or implied-in-fact) between the United States and the claimant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of a direct contractual link (express or implied in fact), no enforceable contractual right against the United States exists, and therefore a subcontractor, in privity only with its private prime, cannot recover directly from the Government for amounts owed it by the prime. <em>Putnam Mills Corp. v. United States, </em>202 Ct.Cl. 1, 8, 479 F.2d 1334, 1337 (1973).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This requirement of privity of contract is one important basis for the statement in <em>United States v. Munsey Trust Co., </em>332 U.S. 234, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947), that \u201cnothing is more clear than that laborers and material-men do not have enforceable rights against the United States for their compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 67 S.Ct. at 1602 (citing <em>H. </em>Her-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number><em>furth, Jr., Inc. v. United States, </em>89 Ct.Cl. 122 (1939)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\">The <em>USF&amp;G </em>court relied on this <em>Munsey </em>language in reaching its conclusion of no standing for subcontractors. In <em>Munsey </em>a surety and the United States both asserted a right to contract retainages. The surety had paid off laborers and'materialmen and was seeking reimbursement of such payment through subrogation to the rights of the subcontractors against the Government. The Supreme Court said (among other .things) that subrogation did not help the surety because the materialmen and laborers had no enforceable rights against the Government and that \u201cone cannot acquire by subrogation what another whose rights he claims did not have.\u201d 332 U.S. at 241-42, 67 S.Ct. at 1602-03.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">We recognized in <em>USF&amp;G </em>that there was a possible contradiction between <em>Munsey </em>and the later Supreme Court statement in <em>Pearlman v. Reliance Insurance Co., </em>371 U.S. 132, 83 S.Ct. 232, 9 L.Ed.2d 190 (1962), on the standing question. In <em>Pearlman </em>the contractor defaulted and the surety paid the laborers and materialmen. Both the surety and the contractor\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy sought to obtain the contract retain-ages. <em>Pearlman </em>recognized an equitable obligation of the Government to see that laborers and materialmen are paid.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-10\">We therefore hold in accord with the established legal principles stated above that the Government had a right to use the retained fund to pay laborers and materialmen; <em>that the laborers and ma-terialmen had a right to be paid out of the </em>fund; that the contractor had he completed his job and paid his laborers and materialmen, would have been entitled to the fund; <em>and that the surety, having paid the laborers and material-men, is entitled to the benefit of all these rights to the extent necessary to reimburse it. </em>[371 U.S. at 141, 83 S.Ct. at 237 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">The tension between <em>Munsey </em>and <em>Pearl-man </em>emerges from the assertion in <em>Munsey </em>that \u201cnothing is more clear than that laborers and materialmen do not have enforceable rights against the United States for their compensation,\u201d 332 U.S. at 241, 67 S.Ct. at 1602, and the different <em>Pearlman </em>language that \u201claborers and materialmen had a right to be paid out of the fund,\u201d a right which the surety \u201cis entitled to the benefit of * * * to the extent necessary to reimburse it,\u201d 371 U.S. at 141, 83 S.Ct. at 237. What concerned us in <em>USF&amp;G </em>about these two positions is that \u201c[i]t is a short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>step from <em>Pearlman </em>to infer that if the subcontractors have .rights to which the surety may be subrogated, then the subcontractors should be able to assert their rights directly * * 201 Ct.Cl. at 10, 475 F.2d at 1382. But to allow that would result in a conflict with <em>Munsey. Id. </em>at 10, 475 F.2d at 1382. <em>See also, Pearlman, supra, </em>371 U.S. at 142, 83 S.Ct. at 237 (concurring opinion of Justice Clark).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">We reconciled the <em>Munsey </em>and <em>Pearlman </em>comments when we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqM\">the Court in <em>Pearlman </em>stated that the surety was entitled to the benefit of <em>all </em>the rights of the laborers and material-men whose claims it paid and those of the contractor whose debts it paid. The surety then is subrogated to the rights of the contractor who could sue the Government since it was in privity of contract with the United States. The surety is likewise subrogated to the rights of the laborers and materialmen who might have superi- or equitable rights to the retainage but no right to sue the defendant. <em>[Id. </em>at 10, 475 F.2d at 1382 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azz\">Under this interpretation, <em>Pearlman </em>does not conflict with <em>Munsey </em>because, while the surety gains equitable rights from its subro-gation to the subcontractors\u2019 claims, its standing to sue (its ability to <em>enforce </em>those rights and others) comes from the fact that it is also subrogated to, and stands in the shoes of, the contractor, an entity which is clearly in privity of contract with the Government. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 475 F.2d at 1382. <em>See Pearlman, supra, </em>371 U.S. at 143, 83 S.Ct. at 238 (concurring opinion) (alternative suggestion as to surety\u2019s position). But the existence of equitable rights in subcontractors (as well as other laborers and mate-rialmen) does not mean that they, too, can sue the United States directly for their part of the retained funds \u2014 perhaps unfortunately, Congress has not consented to that class of suit and the subs\u2019 right remain unenforceable against the United States under the Tucker Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">We continue to see our position in <em>USF&amp;G </em>as a reasonable reading of the somewhat ambiguous language in <em>Pearl-man. </em>As <em>USF&amp;G </em>pointed out, while the Supreme Court and prior lower court cases dealt with questions of priority to funds held by the Government,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-8\">[n]one have involved a plaintiff-subcontractor directly asserting a claim to money held by the Government. <em>The subcontractors do possess equitable rights to the retained funds </em>vis-a-vis other claimants to the money, <em>but their rights * * * do not necessarily include or imply a right in the subcontractor itself to sue the Government. [Id. </em>at 10-11, 475 F.2d at 1382 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\"><em>See, also, Continental Casualty Co. v. United States, </em>164 Ct.Cl. 160 (1964), in which we said that \u201c[t]he United States had the right to use the money in its hands to pay laborers and materialmen [citing <em>Pearlman </em>], but the laborers and materialmen could not force it to do so [citing <em>Munsey].\u201d </em>Id. <em>at 162-63. </em>This analysis foreshadowed, in capsule form, our views in USF&amp;G.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">The Tenth Circuit\u2019s <em>Kennedy </em>opinion questions the <em>USF&amp;G </em>reconciliation of the <em>Munsey </em>and <em>Pearlman </em>statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-11\">More importantly the effort in <em>USF&amp;G </em>to reconcile Munsey and Pearlman does not convince us. Munsey says that it does not decide whether subcontractors have any claim to retainage if both contractor and surety fail to pay. Pearlman says that Munsey held only that the Government could exercise its set-off right. Accordingly there is nothing to reconcile. [508 F.2d at 959 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">The <em>Kennedy </em>court may have thought that we saw conflicting <em>decisions </em>in the two Supreme Court cases. But that was not the point of our concern; the two <em>decisions </em>were obviously reconcilable in result (as <em>Kennedy </em>points out). Our focus was, rather, on contrasting statements in the two opinions which do present somewhat of a problem, and our effort was to see if they could be harmonized (the two statements are, after all, in Supreme Court opinions). On that precise topic, <em>Kennedy </em>throws no light, nor does it suggest to us either that our reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>ions is incorrect or that the statements in those opinions are truly in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">We add that, even if our understanding in <em>USF&amp;G </em>(and in the present opinion) of the Supreme Court\u2019s statements is incorrect or unconvincing, that would make no difference in our ultimate conclusion which rests, at bottom, squarely on the limitations on this court\u2019s jurisdiction imposed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491. <em>See </em>the discussion, <em>supra. </em>These restrictions have been recognized and implemented, not only in <em>USF&amp;G, </em>but in the cases in this court declaring that subcontractors, without a contractual relationship with the Government, cannot sue either in general or specifically for contract retainages. <em>See, e. g., Herfurth, supra, </em>89 Ct.Cl. at 127; <em>Continental Casualty, supra, </em>164 Ct.Cl. at 162-63; <em>Putnam Mills, supra, </em>202 Ct.Cl. at 8, 479 F.2d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">It follows that we have no reason to question <em>USF&amp;G, </em>and that under it and established principles in this court United has no standing to sue the United States for recovery of its compensation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is the conclusion mandated, we think, by the Tucker Act (as it stands today) but it is not a happy result if United ends up without payment to which it is entitled and for which contract money is available from the Government. As we have done before, we stress that the United States may voluntarily choose to make payment, <em>see Continental Casualty, supra, </em>164 Ct.Cl. at 162-63; <em>USF&amp;G, supra, </em>201 Ct.Cl. at 10, 475 F.2d at 1382, and we believe that it has a nonenforceable obligation to do so, when and if it becomes clear that United had a valid claim, that contract retainages or other unexpended funds under the contract are available for such payment, and that, if those funds are not paid out, the Government will be receiving a windfall which it should not have. <em>Cf., USF&amp;G, supra, </em>201 Ct.Cl. at 12, 475 F.2d at 1383. The Government should not \u201cretain both the benefits of the contract and the funds that were to be used to pay for them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 475 F.2d at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition is granted and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">. While the surety has refused to make payment, it has not yet been judicially determined that the surety is free from liability to United. Plaintiff has filed suit against the surety which is now pending in U.S. District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1159-11\">. Plaintiff makes no attempt to distinguish <em>USF&amp;G </em>and we discern no basis for doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">. Section 401 granted the Postal Service a number of broad, general powers including the authority \u201cto sue and be sued in its official name,\u201d and \u201cto enter into and perform contracts * * * \u201d 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1), (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">. It is plain that the Miller Act itself does not mandate compensation by the United States to a subcontractor within the coverage of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976)) and that plaintiff has no claim directly under the Miller Act for relief from this court. Plaintiff makes no contrary contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">. This court has long followed the general rule that subcontractors (without a contractual arrangement with the Government) cannot themselves sue in this court on their contracts. <em>See, e. g., H. Herfurth, Jr., Inc. v. United States, </em>89 Ct.Cl. 122, 127 (1939) (note 6, <em>infra); Severin v.

The Supreme Court did not have to reach the issue of what claim the subcontractors would have had if both the surety and contractor failed to pay them, and specifically declined to decide that question. 332 U.S. at 242, 67 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">.
