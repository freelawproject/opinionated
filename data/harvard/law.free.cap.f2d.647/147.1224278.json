UPG challenges the agency\u2019s interpretation on this appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The district court considered the facts reflected in UPG\u2019s request with supplementing submissions, pertinent regulations, the bases of the Interpretation, the contentions of the parties and the applicable standard of review. It concluded that the agency had demonstrated \u201ca thorough consideration of the issues, consistent with other interpretations and other relevant factors.\u201d Addressing UPG\u2019s assertion that controlling effect should have been given to the phrase \u201cproduction by mechanical separators,\u201d the court expressed the view that irrespective of the standard applied the interpretation would not be invalid when considered in light of the intent reflected in the preamble:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">This preamble demonstrates that the crude oil definition reflects a historical and functional basis between condensate and natural gas liquids and was not based upon a narrow, technical meaning known only to those in the natural gas business. The Interpretations are not clearly erroneous and should be deferred to by this court in light of the Department of Energy\u2019s greater expertise in this area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">Since the interpretation was \u201cbased solely on the facts UPG presented to DOE,\u201d it was further concluded that there was \u201cno material fact question\u201d and that summary judgment was an appropriate means of disposing of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">On this appeal UPG makes three principal contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">I. That DOE\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation;</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">II. That the interpretation constitutes an unwarranted expansion of its \u201ccrude oil\u201d definition; and</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>III. That the district court erred by reviewing the interpretation on the basis of a standard that applies peculiarly to the construction of statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">DOE describes our problem as \u201cthe simple issue of whether the [DOE] ... has properly construed the meaning of the term \u2018crude oil\u2019 to include all \u2018condensate\u2019 recovered from the natural gas pipelines between the wellhead and the inlet meter of the gas plant.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Significant facts included in UPG\u2019s submission to the Office of General Counsel are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">UPG is a full product line company marketing LP gases ... crude oil, condensate, natural gas pipeline residue and other petroleum products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">The liquid hydrocarbon residue product (\u201cresidue\u201d or \u201cresidue product\u201d) which UPG purchases and resells is collected by the company from \u201cdrips\u201d and \u201cball run tanks\u201d that have been installed as an integral part of a natural gas pipeline. Such residue forms in a natural gas pipeline by a cooling process which occurs as a result of the difference in temperature between the natural gas and the pipeline facility. That is, the greater the temperature differential, the more residue will form in the natural gas pipeline. This residue may be removed from a pipeline system in either of two ways: (a) by utilizing the gas pressure in the pipeline to force the residue which has accumulated at various low points, or drips, into a pressurized receiving tank truck, or (2) by running a device (known as a \u201cpig\u201d or \u201cball\u201d) through the pipeline in order to force the accumulated residue ahead of such device into a stationary receiving tank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">As the residue moves through a natural gas pipeline, it absorbs impurities and foreign material clinging to the jnside walls of the pipe. Such material generally includes iron and hydrogen sulphide, rust, oil from compressor engines, ethanol amines, caustic solutions from sulphur removal processes, acid from carbon dioxide, salt water and glycols from dehydration facilities, all of which gives the residue a dark color. After collection from drips or ball run tanks, the residue is then trucked by UPG to storage tanks where the salt water, glycols and certain of the other impurities are permitted to separate from the usable hydrocarbon residue product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">UPG\u2019s residue collection operation covers numerous natural gas pipeline drips and ball run tanks located in the States of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico. The residue product collected by \u201cdrip haulers\u201d such as UPG was, in the past, generally discarded by simply blowing it out onto the ground, permitting it to evaporate in pits, or trucking it to disposal wells. However, during recent years, due to the increased value of this residue product and certain environmental considerations, such residue has been saved and marketed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In its submission UPG argued that condensate as the definition of crude oil indicates, is typically recovered from a natural gas stream by the use of conventional mechanical separators (a surface separator located at the wellhead, a field separator located centrally for two or more wells, or an inlet separator or scrubber located at the inlet side of a gas processing plant).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">It was contended that the process whereby condensate is recovered from a natural gas stream is markedly different from the occurrence of residue in a natural gas pipeline.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Condensate is removed from the natural gas stream prior to the sale thereof, and, for all practical purposes, the natural gas stream which passes the metering facility is in a gaseous state and does not contain free liquids. ... Furthermore, the residue product was incapable of being recovered from the natural gas stream by the exclusive use of a mechanical separation device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Following the submission of UPG\u2019s inquiry, the agency requested and was furnished copies of the contracts the company had entered into with pipeline operators for acquisition of the hydrocarbon residue. These contracts as more particularly hereinafter noted treated what UPG now terms \u201cpipeline residue\u201d as condensate. The agency also sought comments from various pipeline operators concerning their views on the problem of classification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">None of the agency\u2019s regulations contains a definition of the terms \u201cresidue,\u201d \u201cmechanical separator\u201d or \u201ccondensate,\u201d nor does the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751 <em>et seq. </em>(1973) (\u201cEPAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On September 27, 1979, DOE issued a Notice of Probable Violation to Northern Natural Gas Company, of which UPG is a wholly-owned subsidiary, claiming overcharges of more than $3,000,000 based upon the interpretation in question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">It is conceded by both parties that a substantial overlap exists in the chemical compositions of condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gasoline.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These are among the considerations that are important as we proceed more particularly to examine in the pipeline context the agency\u2019s definition of crude oil which is based not on chemical composition but upon method of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">UPG\u2019s first major contention on appeal is that \u201cDOE\u2019s interpretations that pipeline residue is \u2018crude oil\u2019 are inconsistent with the plain language of the regulations.\u201d It could have been more consistently and meaningfully phrased if the appellant had substituted the word \u201ccondensate\u201d for the term \u201cpipeline residue.\u201d The term \u201cpipeline residue\u201d apparently was coined by UPG after its submission of the request for the interpretation to put distance between its developing contention and the word \u201ccondensate.\u201d However, at the time of its request UPG equated in the context of its inquiry \u201ccondensate\u201d with \u201ccrude oil\u201d for pricing purposes, and sought to learn whether its \u201cresidue product\u201d could be clas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>sified as something other than condensate and, if so, what.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Be this as it may, even the face of the regulation when considered with its preamble raises substantial questions concerning UPG\u2019s present position. DOE makes no contention that the so-called residue meets the criteria of the first sentence of the definition of crude oil. Nor does UPG deny that the second sentence expands the reach of the definition to \u201ccondensate\u201d in natural gas pipelines if the \u201cmechanical separator\u20191 criterion of the second sentence is met. UPG\u2019s entire ease depends upon a narrow construction of the latter term. It cites in its brief what it calls industry definitions to buttress its position.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Even such definitions could be deemed to broadly accommodate DOE\u2019s concept that the pipeline, with its effect upon pressures and temperatures, together with the associated devices specially planned for recovery and removal of the condensate, comprise a machine for separating with the aid of water or air, materials of different specific gravity, or an apparatus for separating the oil mechanically carried over by the vapor in distillation <em>(Tver &amp; Berry), </em>or a separator which segregates oil, gas, and water with the aid, only at times, of chemical treatment and the application of heat <em>(Langen-kamp). </em>The general acceptation of the terms is more broadly hospitable to the agency\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There are other considerations suggested on the face of the definition which could be noted were we to be governed entirely by technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">The first sentence of the regulatory definition of crude oil places the second sentence, directly applicable here, in the context of \u201ccondensate\u201d and \u201cseparating facilities.\u201d Looking at the second sentence alone, there is no provision that its indispensable definitional element is the employment of mechanical separators;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> only that crude oil \u201cincludes condensate recovered ... by mechanical separators\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>point of recovery along the pipeline, \u201cwhether located on the lease, or central field facilities, or at the inlet side of a gas processing plant,\u201d is immaterial to the definition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In considering the question of plain meaning, the preamble to the regulation in question must not be disregarded. After reviewing the historical treatment of condensate the agency there concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK5\">[Cjondensate, . . . whether recovered from conventional surface separators, central field facilities, or at the inlet side of a gas processing plant, traditionally and historically has been gathered, priced, and refined as crude oil, and is therefore properly treated as crude oil under Sub-part D of the price regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The latter statement and the \u201cmechanical separator\u201d frame of reference included in the definition may better be understood in light of the fact that until recent years condensate from natural gas pipelines, except for that recovered by the use of special mechanical separators, was considered and handled as waste having no economic value.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The 1975 definition included as typical of the historic method of recovery having economic significance \u201cmechanical separation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In view of the circumstances already referred to it would, indeed, be a tyranny of words rather than a recognition of ideas portrayed by words to narrowly construe the definition of crude oil in the manner UPG\u2019s argument on \u201cplain meaning\u201d would have us do.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">For the reasons stated we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the agency\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation defining crude oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">If we assume that between UPG\u2019s narrow reading of the definition and the agency\u2019s broader interpretation, a real ambiguity is presented on the face of the regulation in its developmental setting, further consideration of the interpretation in the light of additional circumstances is convincing that the Office of General Counsel did not erroneously expand, rather than validly interpret, the regulation in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">As we have already noted, one of the correspondents of the agency has asserted in support of the rationale of UPG, and the amicus curiae has suggested, that hydrocarbon residue, even though condensate and thus regulated had it been removed b.y \u201cmechanical separation,\u201d escapes the reach of the EPAA entirely when recovered as \u201cpipeline residue\u201d through the use of drip tanks, ball run tanks, dehydrating units and the pipeline itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Even were this condensate subjected to price regulation, its classification as natural gas liquids or natural gasoline thus would not only involve the superficial distinctions of terms already discussed, but would invite additional regulatory problems that the present interpretation avoids. Under DOE\u2019s interpretation, all condensate collect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ed and removed from natural gas pipelines would be controlled by the crude oil regulations (Subpart D). Liquid hydrocarbons produced between the inlet and outlet meters of gas plants would be controlled by the natural gas liquids regulations (Subpart K).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The regulatory dividing line between the two products thus would be clear and not susceptible of misinterpretation or evasion. Under UPG\u2019s interpretation, its comparable condensate would be collected and sold in a manner dissimilar to the handling of other condensate, but treated as a natural gas liquid for pricing purposes. If a \u201cmechanical separator\u201d within its definition were used, UPG would term the same general type of condensate \u201ccrude oil\u201d for pricing purposes. As pointed out by DOE, adoption of the latter view would not only provide UPG with the direct pricing advantage of a natural gas liquid, but might also entitle UPG to additional pricing benefits enjoyed by that classification only because it has been considered by the agency to involve production within the confines of gas processing plants.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On the other hand UPG sees insurmountable administrative problems in reconciling DOE\u2019s concept of \u201cproperty\u201d production with treatment of its \u201cpipeline residue\u201d as crude oil. Its concession that no matter where condensate was produced by \u201cmechanical separation\u201d or how many producers might be involved in the gas supply, it has been and should be treated as crude oil, places this argument in perspective \u2014 a problem of agency administration of the existing concept of condensate as crude oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">UPG contends that the agency\u2019s problem, and thus ours, is simply a matter of law with respect to which administrative expertise is entitled to little if any deference. But the legal aspects of problems such as this, solutions for which depend importantly upon regulatory, economic, industrial and administrative relationships and other practical considerations, are not entirely unresponsive to the administrative expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">UPG would have us deny deference to the interpretation also because there is no showing of its being followed consistently over a long period of time. But the agency has not been inconsistent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The principle of a broad, practical construction on the basis of \u201ccondensate\u201d under related situations theretofore had been applied.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>understandable that the precise problem covered by the Interpretation in question had not been expressly addressed before, since the economic use of the hydrocarbon residue from pipelines was of comparatively recent origin, and up to almost the time of its request for an interpretation UPG apparently had been terming the residue it now said was not condensate, as expressly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We cannot agree with UPG\u2019s argument that the agency\u2019s interpretation was an undue expansion of the Crude Oil definition; that it was not foreseeable, and that the company was left to guess at the agency\u2019s intent until the interpretation was issued.-</p>\n<p id=\"A8K\">The 1974 contract between UPG and Northern Natural Gas Company, its parent corporation, contains a rather apt description with reference to \u201ccondensate\u201d of a \u201cpipeline separator,\u201d that broadly might be thought of as a \u201cmechanical separator,\u201d in its preamble: \u201cWHEREAS, in conjunction with the operation of said pipelines, Northern has constructed drips and reservoirs for the purpose of collecting the condensate which separates in liquid form from the natural gas transported through said pipelines . .. . \u201d UPG undertook to collect \u201ccondensates, including water\u201d from Northern\u2019s storage points, and in return received a specified price per gallon for \u201call hydrocarbon condensate,\u201d and an additional charge for the water removed in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">UPG\u2019s contract with Cities Service Gas Company dated December 1, 1975, recited, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">WHEREAS, Gas Co. has installed certain pipeline drips on some but not all its well lines, lateral lines and gathering truck lines in the Bishop Field for the purpose of collecting hydrocarbon condensate, water and/or other liquids (hereinafter referred to as Liquids) which separate from the natural gas transported through said pipeline facilities....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Upon these premises UPG undertook to remove all of said \u201cLiquids\u201d and contracted to receive in compensation a given amount per gallon of \u201call hydrocarbon condensate, f. o. b. point of collection, collected from the field drips,\u201d together with a given price per gallon \u201cfor the gathering, hauling and disposal of water only, collected from the field drips.\u201d <em>Cities </em>certified in this contract \u201cthat the prices charged for the hydrocarbon condensate sold hereunder are no greater than the maximum prices permitted pursuant to the Federal Energy Administration Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">In 1977 UPG\u2019s contract with Northern Natural Gas Company operating as Peoples Natural Gas Division stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdT\">WHEREAS Peoples owns and/or operates certain natural gas pipelines and wellhead equipment (hereinafter referred to as Peoples \u201cSystem\u201d), situated in the States of Kansas and Colorado; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abs\">WHEREAS, in conjunction with said system, Peoples owns and/or operates certain drips, separators, scrubbers, reservoirs, and storage tanks (hereinafter referred to as \u201cfacilities\u201d) for the purpose of collecting the condensate, crude oil, water, and other liquids (hereinafter referred to as \u201cliquids\u201d) which separate from the natural gas transported through said system....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">A single price per barrel was to be paid to UPG for \u201call hydrocarbon condensate or crude oil,\u201d f.o.b. point of collection, collected from the foregoing described facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">UPG did not mention in its request for an interpretation how the condensate theretofore had been contracted for by it, although as we have seen it did then accept DOE\u2019s present position that \u201ccondensate\u201d and \u201ccrude oil\u201d in the context of its situation would be the same. After it was required to produce copies of these contracts for examination by the agency, however, it hastened to explain through its attorney, using for the first time as far as the record discloses the expression \u201cpipeline residue\u201d in contradistinction to \u201ccondensate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">By improperly referring to all of these liquid hydrocarbons as \u201ccondensate,\u201d rather than both pipeline \u201cresidue\u201d and <em>condensate, </em>which latter product is in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>eluded in the definition of \u201ccrude oil\u201d under Part 212.31 of the regulations, UPG, Inc., was made aware of certain problems which this general term (\u201ccondensate\u201d) created for purchasers of such liquid hydrocarbons. That is, UPG, Inc., purchases and resells \u201ccrude oil,\u201d pipeline \u201cresidue\u201d and \u201ccondensate,\u201d and has improperly referred to the latter two products as <em>condensate </em>under its contracts for the purchase thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">This confession indicates why UPG made the request for an interpretation as and when it did and sketches its developing theory that \u201cpipeline residue\u201d was something different than the \u201ccondensate\u201d which it assumed in its request for an interpretation would be the equivalent of \u201ccrude oil.\u201d But this was not an avoidance as well as a confession; there remained a clear indication that the interpretation equating \u201ccrude oil\u201d with the \u201ccondensate\u201d UPG was handling had been reasonably foreseeable all the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The interpretation in view of all the circumstances appears to us to be, if not the only rational construction, a reasonable one not inconsistent with the interpreted regulation, in harmony with the objectives of the authorizing statute, consistent with other regulations and rulings of the agency, based upon the relevant factors, and persuasively articulated by its Office of General Counsel.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">On such a record we are at loss to fully understand UPG\u2019s third contention that the district court erred by reviewing the Interpretation \u201cunder a standard that applies to the construction of statutory language.\u201d It is true that the views of the trial court are also supportable by uncited guidelines that have been applied to the interpretation of statutory language,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but such common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>sense without imprimatur is coin of the realm for both administrators and judges. We perceive nothing in the language of the district court nor the result it reached which justifies appellant\u2019s assumption or which indicates other than a considerate application of our decisions concerning the standard of review applicable to administrative interpretations of regulatory language.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">There would be little occasion to add to our recent comprehensive discussion of the standards for review applicable here, <em>Energy Consumers and Producers Ass\u2019n v. DOE, supra, </em>at 140, 142-144, were it not for the contrary emphasis appellant places upon language in previous decisions of this court in its attempt to establish that an interpretation must fail if it is not supported by plain and certain language in the regulation interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Contending that <em>Energy Consumers </em>is \u201ccompletely distinguishable from this case,\u201d UPG relies upon language in <em>Tenneco Oil Co. v. FEA, </em>613 F.2d 298 (Em.App.1979), and additionally cites <em>Longview Refining Co. v. Shore, </em>554 F.2d 1006 (Em.App.1977); <em>Standard Oil Co. v. Department of Energy, </em>596 F.2d 1029 (Em.App.1978); and <em>Kraus &amp; Bros. v. United States, </em>327 U.S. 614, 66 S.Ct. 705, 90 L.Ed. 894 (1946), in support of its contentions that to justify the interpretation of a regulation, as distinguished from a statute, the regulation must unambiguously support the interpretation, especially in view of the \u201cdraconian penalties\u201d which now face those who fail to comply with DOE regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">There ordinarily is no need for an administrative interpretation of clear and unambiguous regulatory language. The law does not reject interpretations merely because there is a need for them; and the enforcement of almost all EPAA regulations as interpreted entails substantial financial consequences to oil companies, consumers, or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Appellant misconceives the true meaning of the cases it primarily relies on; they mainly discuss the problem of willfulness in the criminal law context. The prospect that some collateral effect of the Interpretation here may be advanced as a basis of a criminal prosecution or the application of civil sanctions where the question of certainty in meaning and wilful intent may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>at issue is not controlling. Time enough to address such issues if and when they are appropriately presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It is true that there is language in <em>Tenne-co, supra, </em>which taken out of context lends color to UPG\u2019s contention.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">That decision, correct on its facts, accepting as it did the plain meaning of the word \u201csale,\u201d and the authorities it cites on the question of certainty in regulatory language <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> are inapposite here. Inconsistency with plain meaning, or the issues of willfulness or criminal responsibility are not involved here. <em>Kraus &amp; Bros. v. United States, </em>327 U.S. 641, 66 S.Ct. 705, 90 L.Ed. 894 (1946), involved a criminal prosecution for the alleged violation of maximum price regulations. Equating of the present case with the situation in <em>Standard Oil Co. v.

In view of the acceptance by UPG prior to the submission of its request for an interpretation that the residue it was handling was condensate, and its acceptance by its very statement of its inquiry that if condensate it would be priced as crude oil pursuant to the regulations, the following explanation in the Interpretation assumes additional cogency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">The use of the term \u201cmechanical separators\u201d in the definition of \u201ccrude oil\u201d was designed to distinguish production of liquids by condensation as the result of temperature reduction to ambient levels and accompanying pressure changes (condensate) from production by absorption, adsorption, or extraneous refrigeration processes (natural gas liquids or natural gasoline). The fact that no mechanical device is employed to induce condensation does not mean that the liquids at issue here should not be classified as condensate. Indeed, the pipeline itself operates to condense the liquids by an equivalent process to that employed by mechanical separators at the lease. The DOE has consistently distinguished condensate from natural gas liquids and natural gasoline by the recovery process employed, rather than the operational objectives of the firm or the design objectives of the equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The interpretation adding this broader definition was buttressed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">by the fact that liquids recovered at the inlet side of a gas processing plant by mechanical separators are condensate for purposes of the pricing regulations. Similarly, liquids recovered by mechanical separators at central field facilities are condensate for pricing purposes .... Therefore, it would be anomalous to define the liquids at issue here, which condense after passing through the field separators and before the inlet scrubbers, as natural gas liquids or natural gasoline. Logically, the liquids recovered in pipeline drips and ball tanks should be treated consistently, i. e., as condensate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b231-14\">.
