Robinson, III.</p>\n<author id=\"b271-9\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">This case comes before us on appeal from an order of the District Court dismissing an action by Nancy H. Steorts against American Airlines as one barred by the Virginia statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our review leads us to the conclusion that the District Court should have applied the statute of limitations of the District of Columbia. Since, measured by the latter, Steort\u2019s suit was timely, we reverse the order of dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Steorts seeks damages for injuries allegedly sustained on October 11,1975, when an American airliner made an emergency \u201cbelly-landing\u201d at Dulles Airport, in Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Steorts was a passenger on the flight, which originally was bound from Toronto, Canada, to Washington National Airport.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plane was diverted to Dulles when the pilot was unable to lower its landing gear,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and after set-down the passengers were evacuated by emergency chute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Steorts contends that as a consequence of the forced landing and subsequent debarkation procedure, she sustained severe injuries, including a thorocodorsal sprain of the spine and mental anguish.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-21\">On October 11, 1978, exactly three years after the incident, Steorts filed suit against American in the District Court, invoking diversity jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Her complaint charged a lack of due care by the airline in maintaining and operating the plane, and by airline personnel in executing the emergency exit procedures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response, American moved to dismiss, contending that litigation of these claims was precluded by the Virginia statute, which requires commencement of actions for negligence within a two-year period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Steorts urged that she should be permitted to go forward with her suit because the District of Columbia\u2019s three-year limitation was controlling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-22\">The District Court agreed with American, and entered an order of dismissal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the view that \u201c[t]he law of this Circuit is unsettled\u201d with respect to the choice-of-law component of limitation problems,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court turned to other factors and concluded that \u201ccompelling policy considerations militate against applying the District of Columbia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>law of limitations to this case.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In essence, the court felt that to do so \u201cwould induce the worst type of forum-shopping,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and \u201cthat the better rule to apply in this case [was] the \u2018substantial interest\u2019 test.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Adopting this approach, the court held \u201cthat Virginia is the jurisdiction whose interests are most directly affected by this action;\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> since Virginia\u2019s two-year period had run, the court granted American\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We find that the application of the Virginia statute in this case necessitates reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Prior to 1971, the federal courts in the District of Columbia were authoritative expositors of local as well as federal law,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and ascertainment of the applicable statute of limitations was a process guided solely by conflict-of-laws principles.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The situation changed radically when, in the early 1970\u2019s, Congress restructured the District of Columbia courts,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and reposed in them full responsibility for the development of the District\u2019s own law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> From then onward, the relationship of the federal to the local judiciary was to be akin to that historically existent in the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">It was against this backdrop that in <em>Lee v. Flintkote </em>Co.,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> decided after the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the instant case, we held that the principles of <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are to be followed analogously by federal courts adjudicating diversity actions in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Erie </em>clearly mandates that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>diversity cases the substantive law of the forum controls with respect to those issues which are outcome-determinative,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and it is beyond cavil that statutes of limitations are of that character<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Similarly, the forerun-ning question of the statute applicable \u2014 in this ease that of Virginia or that of the District of Columbia \u2014 depends upon the forum\u2019s choice-of-law rules, which also are substantive for <em>Erie </em>purposes.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Thus, the adjudicative pivot at this stage of the litigation is the choice-of-law canon utilized by the courts of the District of Columbia in similar cases, and the highest court of the District of Columbia has on at least two occasions expressed its view on this matter. In <em>May Department Stores v. </em>Devercelli<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the District of Columbia Court of Appeals stated explicitly that the question whether an action is barred by a statute of limitations \u201cbeing procedural is governed by the statute of limitations of the forum.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> More recently, in <em>Hodge v. Southern Railway,</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court reiterated that \u201c[according to the established rule, a limitation on the time of suit is procedural and is governed by the law of the forum.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It is thus apparent that the District of Columbia courts would have resolved the limitation issue before us by resort to the District of Columbia statute. Consequently, the District Court must adhere to the same limitation period.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">Since the District of Columbia s three-year limitation period rather than Virginia\u2019s two-year statute governs the instant litigation, we reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal order and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-14\">. <em>Steorts v.

We also think it worthwhile to point out that the view of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is the position adopted by the Restatement, see Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 142 (1971), based on the rationale that the primary purpose of statutes of limitations is to protect local courts against the prosecution of stale claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
