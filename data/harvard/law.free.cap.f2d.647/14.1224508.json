We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">S &amp; L Development Company is a partnership owned by Don G. Simpson and Charles Langdon, individually and as partners (hereinafter collectively \u201cS &amp; L\u201d). The sole asset of the partnership is a commercial office building located in San Diego. In 1974, S &amp; L leased the office building to the County of San Diego. Pursuant to that lease, S &amp; L was required to remodel the building to suit the new tenants. From October 1974 through January 1975, S &amp; L employed at least five full-time construction workers. During the three and a half month period, construction workers completed the remodeling project, which involved lowering the ceiling and replacing the light fixtures, moving walls, relocating telephone and electrical outlets, and constructing a small enclosure outside the building. These employees were paid straight hourly rates whether or not they worked in excess of forty hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The Secretary of Labor brought this action under \u00a7 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, to enjoin S &amp; L from violating the Act\u2019s overtime and record keeping provisions and to recover unpaid overtime compensation claimed to be due under \u00a7 7 of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary asserted that the construction workers employed by S &amp; L were protected under the Act because S &amp; L was a covered enterprise<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the period of time that it engaged in the remodeling project. Following a brief trial, a magistrate found that the S &amp; L employees were not protected by the provisions of the Act because S &amp; L was not \u201cengaged in the business of construction or reconstruction\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Adopting the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, the district court entered judgment for defendants. The Secretary of Labor appeals from that judgment. For the reasons stated below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The sole question on appeal is whether the district court was correct in finding that S &amp; L was not \u201cengaged in the business of construction or reconstruction\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 3(s)(4) of the Act. S &amp; L maintains that it is not an enterprise subject to coverage under the Act, and urges us to adopt a narrow construction of the phrase \u201cengaged in the business of construction or reconstruction.\u201d First, S &amp; L contends that by using the words \u201cthe business of,\u201d Congress intended to cover only construction contractors. Second, S &amp; L argues that even if Congress intended to cover the incidental construction activities of an enterprise, those construction activities must be substantial and continuing in order to subject the enterprise to coverage under the Act. We disagree with this nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>row interpretation of the statutory language.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In our view, Congress intended to cover full-time construction workers for short-term projects whether they are employed by contractors or by other enterprises which engage in construction work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The construction workers employed by S &amp; L did the same kind of work that they would have done had they been employed by an independent contractor. We find \u201cno valid reason to discriminate between the two types of employees.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Allen Green &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>379 F.2d 198, 199 (6th Cir. 1967) (finding of coverage based on the fact that the construction employees performed \u201cthe same kind of work\u201d). <em>See also Brennan v. Six Flags Over Georgia, Ltd., </em>474 F.2d 18, 19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 827, 94 S.Ct. 47, 38 L.Ed.2d 61 (1973) (\u201cIt is the character of the work, not the source of the remuneration, that controls.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Our conclusion is supported by considering the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Equally important to the protection offered employees by the Act is the \u201cprotection to employers who pay a decent wage and who must compete with employers who pay a substandard wage.\u201d S.Rep.No.145, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1961] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1620,1621 (quoting Senator John F. Kennedy when he presented this legislation). <em>See also Wirtz v. Malthor, Inc., </em>391 F.2d 1, 3 (9th Cir. 1968). Short-term employers of full-time construction workers should not be in a better economic position than independent construction contractors performing projects of a short duration who must comply with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Coverage for enterprises \u201cengaged in the business of construction or reconstruction\u201d is not limited to construction contractors. Other courts, interpreting \u00a7 3(s)(4), have not required that a covered enterprise be engaged exclusively or even primarily in the construction business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Coverage is extended to enterprises that \u201cbuild for themselves as well as those who build for others.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Allen Green &amp; Associates, Inc., supra, </em>379 F.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">The district court found that S &amp; L was not \u201cin the business of construction or reconstruction\u201d within the meaning of the Act, because its construction activities were of a limited duration. This rationale, however, adds a requirement of substantiality to \u00a7 3(s)(4) which Congress specifically removed when it eliminated any dollar volume requirement for construction activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The critical consideration for coverage under \u00a7 3(s)(4) is \u201cwhether the activity that went into the actual building process is likely to have an effect on the flow of men, money, and materials across state lines.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Allen Green &amp; Associates, Inc., supra, </em>379 F.2d at 200. The removal of the dollar volume requirement in 1966 indicates a legislative intent that any construction work, regardless the size or duration of the project, is likely to have an effect on interstate commerce.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the duration of the project is relevant only to determine the period of coverage; the element of coverage is already established here by the nature of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Finally, S &amp; L argues that it is exempt from coverage under the exclusion for a family business with no regular employees outside the family as set forth in \u00a7 3(s).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This conclusion is devoid of any factual support in the record. In fact, the evidence shows that the two partners are <em>unrelated </em>and hired full-time employees for a limited period of time to complete a construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We reverse and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-23\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq. (hereinafter \u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-25\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(s)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">. An enterprise covered by the Act must pay its employees at a time and a half rate for all hours worked in excess of forty per week. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. During the period that S &amp; L was engaged in the remodeling project, it is alleged that some of the construction employees worked more than forty hours per week. On remand, the actual hours worked must be determined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. The concept of \u201centerprise coverage\u201d was added to the Fair Labor Standards Act by the 1961 Amendments to extend protection to all employees of an enterprise that meets the requirements of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 203(r) &amp; (s). Prior to that time, \u201ctraditional coverage\u201d under the Act was based on an employee-by-employee determination of whether the individ-' ual worker was \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d or \u201cin the production of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206, 207. To extend coverage to all employees of an enterprise, the Secretary of Labor must prove that the business is an enterprise as defined in \u00a7 3(r) and that it has the necessary contacts with commerce as set forth in \u00a7 3(s) of the Act. This commerce requirement is satisfied if the enterprise has: (1) employees (more than one) either traditionally covered or employees \u201chandling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) an annual gross volume not less than $250,-000 or be engaged in certain specified enterprises including \u201cthe business of construction or reconstruction.\u201d See <em>generally </em>Player, <em>Enterprise Coverage Under the Fair Labor Standards Act: An Assessment of the First Generation, </em>28 Vand.L.Rev. 283 (1975); Willis, <em>The Evolution of the Fair Labor Standards Act, </em>26 U.Miami L.Rev. 607 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">In deciding that S &amp; L is \u201cengaged in the business of construction or reconstruction,\u201d we do not decide whether the other elements of enterprise coverage have been met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">. It is well established that the Act\u2019s coverage provisions are to be construed broadly to apply to the \u201cfurthest reaches consistent with congressional direction.\u201d <em>Mitchell v.

We do not find the words \u201cthe business of\u201d to be mere surplusage. Because business is not defined by the Act, the word must be given its ordinary meaning. Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (1979) defines business as \u201ca commercial . . . enterprise.\u201d As such, the use of the word limits coverage to anyone who engages in construction or reconstruction for business purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b93-15\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b93-16\">. <em>Hodgson v.
