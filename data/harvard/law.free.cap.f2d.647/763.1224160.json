We hold that section 280A bars the deduction at issue, and for a reason different <em>from </em>that given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>district judge, we affirm the judgment of the district court, 493 F.Supp.540.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The facts, as set out by the district court, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">... [Pjlaintiff, S. Richard Fine, was the co-owner of a condominium unit in a Florida resort complex known as Innis-brook. Mr. Fine, in that year, became a party to a rental pool agreement with the Innisbrook resort management company, pursuant to which his unit was made available for rental to others for a period of 333 days. Under the terms of this pool agreement, the plaintiff was to be compensated to a limited extent for each day his condominium was available for rental, and in a larger amount for each day the unit was in fact rented. During the rental availability period, Mr. Fine was required to surrender his personal right of possession and access to his unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">In 1976, the plaintiff\u2019s unit, during the period covered by the pool agreement, was rented for 149 days and remained unoccupied for [184]. Mr. Fine, in addition, occupied the unit on a personal basis, not subject to the rental pool agreement, for 20 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">493 F.Supp. 540, 541 (N.D.Ill.1980) (footnote omitted). The rental pool agreement provided that thirty-three percent of rentals received would go to the rental pool to be \u201callocated among the Owners in accordance with their rental pool participation factor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, each owner received twenty percent of the rents Innisbrook received from renting his individual unit. In-nisbrook retained the remaining forty-seven percent \u201cfor its services as manager of the rental pool, the hotel operation and for the rental pool expenses.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">As a result of the Internal Revenue Service disallowing Fine\u2019s claimed loss under section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code, a refund suit was filed by Fine to recover $1,193.00 in federal income taxes paid for the calendar year 1976. Fine contended that his unit was \u201crented at a fair rental\u201d as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 280A(dXl)(B) for each of the 333 days that it participated in the pool and therefore that his twenty days of personal use did not exceed ten percent of the days the unit was rented. Alternatively he argued that his condominium was not a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d according to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 280A(f)(l)(B). Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by plaintiff Fine and the defendant United States. The district court denied Fine\u2019s motion but granted the motion of the United States. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b840-17\">There is much discussion in the briefs as to whether the \u201cDedication Agreement\u201d between the plaintiff and Innisbrook created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>an agency relationship or a leasehold. The district court held that the arrangement \u201cmust, for purposes of the present matter, be treated as a lease\u201d but went on to state that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcU\">characterization given to the agreement is of limited importance. Rather, the fundamental question to be resolved appears instead to be whether Congress intended that the arrangement at issue falls within the restrictions of 280A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">493 F.Supp. at 542. In our view, a determination of whether there was an agency relationship or a lease is not necessary in order to decide that section 280A bars the deduction at issue here. Section 280A(d)(l)(B) provides that the deduction is not allowable if a taxpayer\u2019s personal use exceeds \u201c10 percent of the number of days during such year for which such unit is rented at a fair rental.\u201d The word \u201clease\u201d does not appear in the statute. Moreover, we do not think that how many days the plaintiff\u2019s unit was \u201crented at a fair rental\u201d turns on whether the Dedication Agreement was or was not a lease. Therefore, we do not decide that issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">The district court concluded that the unit was \u201crented\u201d to Innisbrook but not at a \u201cfair rental\u201d for the 184 days during which it was not rented to hotel guests. The plaintiff taxpayer argues that the lower payment he received from the pool for the days the unit was not occupied by hotel guests was a fair \u201cunoccupied\u201d as opposed to \u201coccupied\u201d rental, much as a car rental fee is \u201cfair\u201d although depending on the amount the car is driven, the renter incurs a lesser or greater mileage charge. The district court did not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention. Noting that the term \u201cfair rental\u201d was not specifically defined in the Code, the district judge held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3z\">absent the existence of circumstances not relevant to the present matter, [a \u201cfair rental\u201d] can only pertain to a rental which is sufficient to permit the taxpayer to, in time, make a taxable profit on his vacation property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">493 F.Supp. at 542. He concluded that the percentage-based \u201cunoccupied rental fee\u201d would never be adequate to insure an after-tax profit and accordingly found that the plaintiff had not rented his unit at a fair rental for the days during which the unit was not rented to hotel guests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">We do not agree with the district judge that a \u201cfair rental\u201d under section 280A(d)(l)(B) \u201cmust pertain to a rental which is sufficient to permit the taxpayer to, in time, make a taxable profit on his vacation property,\u201d because in our view the legislative history of section 280A does not permit a definition based on profit. We begin our analysis, as did Congress,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by reference to section 183, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 183, which was enacted prior to section 280A and remains in effect today. Section 183 provides that if an \u201cactivity is not engaged in for profit, no deduction attributable to such activity shall be allowed under this chapter except as provided in this section.\u201d Section 183 contains a rebuttable presumption that an activity is engaged in for profit if \u201cthe gross income derived ... for 2 or more of the taxable years in the period of 5 consecutive taxable years which ends with the taxable year exceeds the deductions attributable to such activity (determined without regard to whether or not such activity is engaged in for profit)\u201d. Apart from that presumption, however, a determination under section 183 as to whether an activity is engaged in for profit requires a difficult decision concerning the subjective intent of the taxpayer. In enacting section 280A, Congress noted that the regulations promulgated under section 183 have been of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>only minimal aid in simplifying that determination in the case \u2014 like ours \u2014 of a so-called \u201cvacation home\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-4\">The Regulations provide a list of relevant factors which should normally be taken into account in determining whether the activity is engaged in for profit. Among other factors, the presence of personal motives must be considered, especially where there are recreational or personal elements involved. By way of illustration, the regulations provide that a taxpayer will be treated as holding a beach house primarily for personal purposes if, during a three-month season, the beach house is personally used by the taxpayer for one month and used for the production of rents for the remaining two months (Regs. \u00a7 1.183-l(d)(3)). However, except for this example, there are no definitive rules relating to how much personal use of vacation property will result in a finding that the rental activities of vacation homes are not engaged in for profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">H.R.Rep. No. 94-658, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 163, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 3057. <em>Accord, </em>S.Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 151, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3439, 3583. As we understand the Committee reports, section 280A was enacted to limit deductions for vacation homes solely on the basis of the amount of a taxpayer\u2019s personal use without it being necessary to consider the issue of profit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-6\">.. . [I]t is extremely difficult under existing law to determine when an activity is engaged in for profit. The present Regulations provide that in making this determination, a number of factors should be taken into account. These factors include the presence of \u201cpersonal motives,\u201d especially where there are recreational or personal elements involved. However, except for the example mentioned above, no objective standards are set forth in the regulations. Your committee believes that definitive rules should be provided to specify the extent to which personal use would result in the disallowance of certain deductions in excess of gross income. In a case where personal use is the controlling factor to be considered, this approach would obviate the need to require subjective determinations to be made concerning the taxpayer\u2019s motive and the primary purpose for which the vacation home is held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aha-dedup-0\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\"><em>The applicability of this new limitation on allowable deductions would be determined solely by reference , to the taxpayer\u2019s personal use of the vacation home during his taxable year rather than as under section 183, by reference to the profits or losses during any consecutive period of taxable years </em>or on the basis of facts and circumstances determinative of the taxpayer\u2019s objectives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">(emphasis added) H.R.Rep. No. 94-658, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 164-65, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 3058-59. <em>Accord, </em>S.Rep.

It is clear that where section 280A does not bar a deduction, section 183 may still apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9_\">Generally, applications of section 183 of the Code would not be affected by these new provisions. Thus, if the rental of a vacation home is treated as an activity not engaged in for profit after consideration of the relevant objective standards prescribed under section 183, deductions attributable to the rental activity would be limited under that provision (sec. 183) even though the new provisions did not apply because there was little or no personal use of the vacation home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">H.R.Rep. No. 94-658, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 165, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 3059. <em>Accord, </em>S.Rep. No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 153, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3439, 3585.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Although we take issue with his definition of \u201cfair rental,\u201d we agree with the district judge\u2019s conclusion that the taxpayer\u2019s condominium was not rented at a \u201cfair rental\u201d for the 184 days that it participated in the rental pool but was not rented to hotel guests. The crucial fact in our view is that payments by Innisbrook to the owners participating in the rental pool were made exclusively from funds generated from the rental of their units to hotel guests. The taxpayer\u2019s unit generated a portion of that money on the 149 days it was so rented. It generated none of that money on the remaining 184 days on which it merely participated in the pool. Given the rental and other services provided by Innisbrook and the fact that the agreement between Innisbrook and the owners was negotiated at arm\u2019s length, we will assume that the sum total paid to the owners collectively probably represented a fair rental, defined as fair market value, for the use of their units by hotel guests. The issue before us, however, concerns not Innisbrook\u2019s collective rentals but the rental of one owner\u2019s unit. However the owners chose to allocate the joint funds among themselves has no bearing on the requirement in section 280A(d)(l)(B) that a taxpayer\u2019s days of personal use of his unit be measured against the days when \u201csuch unit is rented at a fair rental.\u201d The taxpayer\u2019s unit was rented at a fair rental when it produced a fair rental, and that it failed to do when it was only participating in the pool.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">The period during which the vacation home is merely held out for rent would not be considered in determining the number of rental days for a taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af8\">H.R.Rep.
