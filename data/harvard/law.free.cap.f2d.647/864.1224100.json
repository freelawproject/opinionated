Appellant, J. Michael Stumpff, was granted leave to intervene and challenge the forfeiture. Based on stipulations, affidavits and documentary evidence, each party moved for summary judgment. The district court, finding the aircraft subject to forfeiture, granted appellee\u2019s motion and entered judgment accordingly. <em>United States v. One 1954 Douglas C-54 (DC-4) Aircraft, </em>461 F.Supp. 324 (W.D.Mo.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Stumpff appealed from that judgment, challenging the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(4) as applied. This court, without addressing the constitutional challenge, remanded for the district court to determine whether Stumpff had standing to contest the forfeiture. <em>United States v. One Douglas C-54 (DC-A) Aircraft, </em>604 F.2d 27 (8th Cir. 1979). After receiving additional stipulations and documentary evidence, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that Stumpff was not the true owner of the aircraft. For that reason, it concluded Stumpff lacked standing and entered judgment dismissing his intervention. He now challenges that judgment and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">The forfeiture which Stumpff contests resulted from a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigation into suspected illegal drug trafficking of Stumpff and one Albert Kammerer. According to the DEA, Stumpff and Kammerer obtained the forfeited aircraft to facilitate their drug trafficking. Kammerer has not contested the aircraft\u2019s forfeiture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">The record before the court on Stumpff\u2019s first appeal showed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-18\">1. A Federal Aviation Administration registration certificate issued in Stumpff\u2019s name and covering the forfeited aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-19\">2. A statement of expenses incurred by Stumpff, but not paid, for maintenance and storage of the aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-20\">3. A receipt given to Stumpff in exchange for a $10,000.00 deposit he made on the aircraft\u2019s purchase price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-21\">4. The aircraft\u2019s bill of sale listing Stumpff as the purchaser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-22\">5. Wiretapped conversations between Stumpff and Kammerer in which Kammerer agreed to supply the purchase money for the aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-23\">6. Statements by Kammerer\u2019s wife indicating that she discussed with Stumpff the possibility of Kammerer purchasing an aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-24\">7. Kammerer\u2019s statements that although title to the aircraft was in Stumpff\u2019s name, he considered himself the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>8. A blank bill of sale, given by Stumpff to Kammerer at his request, and used by Kammerer as collateral to obtain bond money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Presented with this evidence, the court doubted that Stumpff had standing to contest the forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>at 28. In remanding, the court said that if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av6t\">it is established that title to the aircraft was placed in Stumpff\u2019s name merely as a subterfuge to conceal the financial affairs and drug dealings of Kammerer, then Stumpff\u2019s intervention should be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">On remand, the district court was presented the following new evidence and stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-7\">1. Receipts showing that Stumpff purchased deicer boots for the aircraft. This equipment was never delivered and was not with the aircraft when it was seized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-8\">2. Receipts showing that Stumpff paid $50.00 for two months storage of the aircraft and $375.00 for certain other storage and maintenance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-9\">3. Receipts showing that Stumpff, through his brother, rented equipment to use in repairing the aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-10\">4. Stumpff failed to pay monthly maintenance charges on the aircraft in accordance with an agreement between himself and the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">The district court, after reviewing the evidence before it, concluded that Stumpff lacked standing to contest the forfeiture. It said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-12\">[W]e expressly find that title to the aircraft was in fact placed in Stumpff\u2019s name merely as a subterfuge to conceal the financial affairs and drug dealings of Kammerer. In short, we find that Kam-merer, and not Stumpff, was the true owner of the aircraft and that Stumpff did not have standing to intervene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-13\"><em>United States v. One 1954 Douglas C-54 (DC-4) Aircraft, </em>No. 78-0050-CV-W-1, mem. op. at 2 (W.D.Mo. April 18, 1980). We find this conclusion supported by the evidence and not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">To contest a forfeiture, one must have an ownership interest in the res. <em>United States v. Fifteen Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($15,500.00) United States Currency, </em>558 F.2d 1359, 1361 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>General Finance Corp. v. United States, </em>333 F.2d 681,682 (5th Cir. 1964); <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Eleven Thousand Five Hundred and Eighty Dollars ($11,580) In United States Currency, </em>454 F.Supp. 376, 381 (M.D.Fla.1978). An ownership interest, of course, may be evidenced in a number of ways including showings of actual possession, control, title and financial stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">On Stumpff\u2019s first appeal, the court, in examining his interest in the res, said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-16\">While it is true that Stumpff delivered the purchase money to the seller and listed himself as the purchaser on the bill of sale for the aircraft, the district court found that Kammerer put up all of the purchase money. And Kammerer stated in his deposition that he considered himself the aircraft\u2019s owner. When questioned by the government as to why the bill of sale and FAA registration certificate bore Stumpff\u2019s name, Kammerer first testified that he \u2018didn\u2019t particularly want to own an airplane.\u2019 Further questioning revealed that he lacked \u2018the financial capability other than holding money\u2019 to be listed as the aircraft\u2019s owner on public documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-17\">The mere fact that the certificate of aircraft registration was issued to Stumpff does not determine rights of ownership in the aircraft as between Kammerer and Stumpff. Such certificates are issued for registration purposes only and are not certificates of title. Significant is the fact that on January 1, 1978 Stumpff, at Kammerer\u2019s request tendered a blank bill of sale for the aircraft to Kammerer. Kammerer did not complete the document or register it with the FAA so as to openly transfer title to himself, but instead used it as collateral to obtain bond money after his arrest. This transaction seems to indicate that Kammerer, and not Stumpff, exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>dominion and control over the aircraft and thus was its true owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">604 F.2d at 29 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">The evidence subsequently presented to the district court is consistent with Kammerer\u2019s dominion and control. As the district court pointed out, that evidence, like the purchase of the aircraft, suggests that Stumpff was Kammerer\u2019s front-man. That was the precise reason title to the aircraft was placed in Stumpff\u2019s name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kammerer controlled the aircraft, as evidenced by his using it for collateral, and he paid for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">We agree with the district court that Stumpff was not the true owner of the aircraft. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Stumpff\u2019s intervention.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-13\">. The Honorable John W.
