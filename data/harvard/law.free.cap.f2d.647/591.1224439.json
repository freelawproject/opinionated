The property in question had been foreclosed upon and sold, and the federal tax liens cancelled, pursuant to Louisiana\u2019s executory foreclosure proceedings. The plaintiff-appellant Myers acquired the property through a private transaction from the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>chaser at that foreclosure sale. We agree with the district court that the foreclosure sale did not discharge the tax liens, because the executory foreclosure constituted an \u201cother sale\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b), so that therefore the foreclosing creditor\u2019s failure to serve notice upon the United States as required by that section prevented the discharge of the federal liens through the foreclosure sale. Furthermore, we hold that the levy procedures established by the Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331, do not violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The judgment below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The facts of this case are largely undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On April 21, 1978, Peoples Bank &amp; Trust of Blanchard, Inc. (Peoples Bank) instituted foreclosure proceedings via Louisiana\u2019s ex-ecutory process<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against certain immovable property located in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, and owned by Fitts &amp; Associates, Inc. (Fitts).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">At the time the foreclosure proceedings were commenced, the Peoples Bank mortgage was the senior encumbrance on the property. Among the several inferior encumbrances was a duly recorded federal tax lien against Fitts in the amount of $17,-754.18 that had been filed for recordation in Caddo Parish on April 5,1978. Pursuant to the foreclosure proceedings, the property was seized and a notice of seizure was recorded on April 24, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">On April 25, 1978, four days after the foreclosure proceedings were commenced, a second federal tax lien against Fitts, this one in the amount of $15,809.33, was duly recorded as an encumbrance on the property. (The plaintiff Myers\u2019 first contention on this appeal is that this second lien, recorded <em>after </em>the foreclosure proceedings were filed, was discharged by the foreclosure sale. The district court rejected this contention, holding that the lien was not discharged because notice of the foreclosure proceedings was not served upon the government.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-13\">If a levy has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">On June 7, 1978, more than forty days after the filing of the second federal tax lien, a sheriff\u2019s sale was held. The property sold to Peoples Bank for $170,000.00 \u2014 -less than the amount of the debt secured by the Peoples Bank mortgage. In accordance with state law, as instructed by the sheriff, the Caddo Parish clerk of court therefore noted in the public records the cancellation of all inferior encumbrances on the property, including the two federal tax liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-16\">At no time during the foreclosure proceedings was the United States joined as a party or served with notice of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-17\">Subsequently, on June 16, 1978, Peoples Bank sold the property to appellant Myers, whose title examination had disclosed that all encumbrances on the property (including the federal tax liens) had been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-18\">On June 21, 1978, after Myers\u2019 purchase and the recordation of his deed, the government served Fitts with a levy against the property, and served Myers with a notice of seizure. Notices of seizure were posted on the property, and the property was secured. (Myers\u2019 second complaint, based on the Fifth Amendment, is that no predeprivation hearing was held before he was dispossessed of his property and that no meaningful postdeprivation hearing was afforded him to contest the validity of the tax claim against Fitts, the tax debtor and prior owner of the property.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-19\">On July 5, 1978, Myers brought this action for wrongful levy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the United States District Court for the Western Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>trict of Louisiana. The district court ordered the property released from seizure after requiring Myers to deposit the amount of the tax assessment {with interest) secured by the two tax liens into the registry of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">After trial on the merits, the district court concluded that Louisiana\u2019s executory process is <em>not </em>a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the Act\u2019s discharge provisions, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(a), and that the foreclosing creditor (Peoples Bank) was therefore required to serve notice upon the government, as provided by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b), in order to discharge the federal tax liens through the foreclosure sale. Since such notice was not given in this case, the district court held that the liens had not been discharged, and that the government had properly levied upon and seized the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">On appeal, Myers contends (I) that the district court erred in concluding that the second federal tax lien, filed for recordation after the commencement of the executory foreclosure proceedings, was not discharged by virtue of the foreclosure sale, and (II) that the levy procedures established by the Act are unconstitutional in that they violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b671-21\">The resolution of Myers\u2019 first contention \u2014 that the foreclosure sale effectively discharged the second federal tax lien\u2014 turns on the proper characterization of the foreclosure sale under the discharge provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-22\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-23\">The methods by which an inferior tax lien of the United States may be discharged through foreclosure and sale under local law are set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Mertens, Federal Income Taxation: Code Commentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>\u00a7 7425:1 (1980). When the United States is not joined as a party to the foreclosure proceedings, the statutory scheme embodied in those sections draws a distinction between sales pursuant to \u201cjudicial proceedings,\u201d the effect of which is governed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cother sales,\u201d the effect of which is governed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Mertens, Code Commentary, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7425:l-:2. The distinction is made by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425, enacted by the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, which was intended to protect the United States, where its tax lien is junior, from its discharge under state law without prior notice to the United States of proceedings by which the property is sold. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">For present purposes, the relevance of the distinction is that, if the Louisiana executory foreclosure is a \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d the second federal tax lien was discharged, because it was not filed at the time the foreclosure process was commenced.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, if the Louisiana execu-tory foreclosure was an \u201cother sale,\u201d the second federal lien (filed more than thirty days before the date of the sale) is not discharged, because the federal government was not afforded notice of the sale as required by statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although under state law the inferior mortgages and liens were discharged by the foreclosure sale, it is not disputed that, if the proper type of notice required by federal statute is not afforded where so required, the federal tax lien then remains unaffected by the foreclosure process and will follow the property into the hands of the subsequent purchaser, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>though (due to improvident cancellation) that purchaser had no record notice of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In the present case, the foreclosure sale was held pursuant to Louisiana\u2019s executory process. Executory process is an expedited <em>in rem </em>action derived from the civil law. <em>Hood Motor Company, Inc. v. Lawrence, </em>320 So.2d 111, 112-13 (La.1975). <em>See generally </em>McMahon, <em>The Historical Development of Executory Process in Louisiana, </em>32 Tul.L.Rev. 555 (1958). By means of the executory process, a creditor may effect the seizure and sale of property in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, without previous citation and judgment, in order to enforce a mortgage or privilege that is evidenced by an authentic act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> importing a confession of judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> La.C.Civ.P. art. 2631.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In order to obtain the <em>ex parte </em>order of seizure and sale, the creditor must file a petition that comports with the general pleading requirements of Louisiana law, La. C.Civ.P. arts. 2634, 891, and must attach thereto the authentic evidence necessary to prove his right to use executory process\u2014 the instruments evidencing the obligation, the authentic act of mortgage or privilege importing the confession of judgment, and any other evidence necessary to complete the proof of his right to use executory process, La.C.Civ.P. art. 2635; <em>Hood Motor Company, Inc. v. Lawrence, supra, </em>320 So.2d at 113. However, the order may be issued by a judge, or by the clerk of court in the exercise of his quasi-judicial powers, La.C.Civ.P. art. 283(2); <em>Hood Motor Company, Inc. v. Lawrence, supra, </em>320 So.2d at 114-16, 115 n. 4, and is not considered a judgment \u201cin any technical sense,\u201d <em>Hood Motor Company, Inc. v. Lawrence, supra, </em>320 So.2d at 113 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">The Louisiana executory proceeding, founded upon \u201cauthentic\u201d (sworn, pre-suit) evidence, is designed to be an expeditious, effective, and inexpensive foreclosure proceeding. McMahon, <em>supra, </em>32 Tul.L.Rev. at 532. Once the order has issued and the property has been seized, the debtor may contest the seizure only by taking a suspen-sive appeal or by instituting an injunction proceeding to arrest the seizure and sale. La.C.Civ.P. art. 2642. This <em>in rem </em>action may be instituted against survivors of a deceased original debtor without the necessity of probate proceedings, La.C.Civ.P. arts. 2671, 2672, as well as to enforce the mortgage against property sold by the original debtor, <em>without </em>joining the subsequent purchaser as a party, La.C.Civ.P. art. 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Under the facts of the case at hand, the issue to be resolved is relatively narrow: Whether Louisiana\u2019s executory process constitutes a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">The United States was not joined as a party to the foreclosure proceedings nor served with written notice of the foreclosure sale. It is undisputed that <em>both </em>federal tax liens were duly filed more than thirty days prior to the date of the foreclosure sale, and that the <em>first </em>federal lien was filed prior to the commencement of the executory foreclosure proceedings. Thus, whether or not the executory foreclosure is a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d or an \u201cother sale,\u201d it is clear (and Myers concedes) that the <em>first </em>federal lien cannot have been discharged by virtue of the foreclosure sale. The <em>second </em>federal tax lien, however, was not filed at the time the executory foreclosure proceedings were commenced. Therefore, if the foreclosure sale can be characterized as a sale pursuant to \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 7425(a), the second lien would be discharged as provided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u00a7 7425(a)(2). If, however, the foreclosure sale is an \u201cother sale\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7425(b), then the second federal lien would not be discharged, because the United States was not given notice of the proceeding. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b)(1), (b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">For reasons to be set forth, the district court correctly held that Louisiana\u2019s executory process does not constitute a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7425(a), and that the foreclosure sale at issue here is thus an \u201cother sale\u201d governed by the provisions of \u00a7 7425(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">By its terms, \u00a7 7425(a) applies only to \u201cjudicial sales\u201d pursuant to \u201ca judgment in any civil action or suit described in subsection (a) of title 28 of the United States Code.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(a). Section 7425(b), on the other hand, applies to all \u201cother sales\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">Notwithstanding subsection (a) a sale of property ... made pursuant to an instrument creating a lien ..., <em>pursuant to a confession of judgment on the obligation secured by such an instrument, </em>or pursuant to a nonjudicial sale under a statutory lien....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AdSI\">The precise contours of the distinction thus drawn between \u201cjudicial\u201d and \u201cother\u201d sales are brought into clearer focus by the legislative history. The congressional committee reports explaining \u00a7 7425 differentiate the \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d of its subsection (a) from the \u201cother sales\u201d of subsection (b) as follows: the former is \u201ca plenary judicial proceeding,\u201d as contrasted with \u201cother foreclosure proceedings\u201d \u201cwhere the interests of junior lienors may be eliminated without notice\u201d; as an example of the latter, the report speaks of the procedure available in some states whereby \u201cforeclosure of a senior security interest may be accomplished by sale of the property by a judicial officer pursuant to a judgment entered under a \u2018confession of judgment\u2019 signed by the debtor (typically in the security interest instrument itself).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>port notes the intent of \u00a7 7425 to require that the government be made a party in a plenary proceeding to discharge its tax lien, and \u2014 where there is no plenary proceeding \u2014 to require timely notice to the government where it has the status of a junior lienor.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The import of the legislative history is quite clear: Section 7425(a) was intended to apply only to judicial sales pursuant to <em>plenary </em>judicial proceedings embodying the procedures associated with a complete and formal hearing on the merits, as distinguished from a more informal summary determination. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>verba </em>\u201cplenary\u201d and \u201cplenary action\u201d (5th ed. 1979). Louisiana\u2019s executory process is unquestionably a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d in the literal sense \u2014 it does require judicial, or at least quasi-judicial, involvement; but it falls far short of the <em>plenary </em>judicial proceedings described in the committee reports. This conclusion is bolstered by the express language of \u00a7 7425(b), which in terms applies to sales made \u201cpursuant to a confession of judgment,\u201d as well as by the language of the congressional report (see note 11) that specifically equates the present type of \u201cconfession of judgment\u201d foreclosure with \u201cother\u201d (i. <em>e., non </em>plenary) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Myers argues, however, that the Act\u2019s legislative history, when taken as a whole, does not reflect the plenary-nonplenary distinction made in the above-quoted committee reports. In support of this contention he quotes from statements made before the House Ways and Means Committee during its hearings on the Act. Those statements indeed do not reflect the plenary-nonple-nary distinction that appears in the final committee reports. It is significant to note, however, that the earlier versions of the Act then before the House committee differed markedly from the version that was finally reported to the House and to the Senate. In those earlier versions, \u00a7 7425(b) was restricted to \u201cnonjudicial sales\u201d made \u201cpursuant to an instrument creating a lien.\u201d Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966: Hearings on H.R. 11256 and H.R. 11290 before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 14-15, 30-31 (1966) (text of H.R. 11256, \u00a7 7425 and H.R. 11290, \u00a7 7425). As noted above (see note 11), \u00a7 7425(b) in its final version was greatly expanded. The congressional reports as to the final version of that section clearly show an intent to establish the plenary-nonplenary distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>indicated by the differentiation between \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d and (all) \u201cother sales\u201d by way of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Myers also contends that the plenary-nonplenary distinction described in the congressional committee reports and adopted by the court below does not stand up in the light of two recent federal court decisions interpreting \u00a7 7425. The gist of this contention is that \u00a7 7425(a) controls whenever there is a judicial proceeding in which the United States might be named a party or in which the United States might intervene to assert its rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For reasons somewhat tedious to explain (see notes 13 and 14), neither of the two decisions relied <em>upon </em>\u2014 A.H. <em>and R.S. Coal Corporation v. United States, </em>461 F.Supp. 752 (W.D.Pa. 1978)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <em>Galesi v. United States, </em>406 F.Supp. 623 (D.Vt.1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>544 F.2d 606 (2d Cir. 1976)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> support the nondistinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>of plenary-nonplenary for which Myers argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 7425(a) applies only to sales made pursuant to <em>plenary </em>judicial proceedings, and that \u00a7 7425(b) applies to all other foreclosure sales. Since Louisiana\u2019s executory foreclosure proceeding is not a plenary judicial proceeding, it necessarily falls within the ambit of \u00a7 7425(b). Section 7425(b) provides that where notice of a federal tax lien is duly filed more than thirty days prior to the date of the foreclosure sale, the sale will be made subject to the federal lien unless written notice of the sale is served upon the United States at least twenty-five days before the sale is held. It is undisputed that such notice was not given in the present case. It therefore follows that the second federal lien was not discharged by the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Myers\u2019 final contention is that the levy here at issue violated the provisions of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">There is no suggestion on this appeal that the federal tax liens upon which the challenged levy was based did not properly attach to the property in question,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and we have determined that the liens were not discharged by the foreclosure sale. The challenged levy was thus based upon valid and existing tax liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-15\">Under \u00a7 6331,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the United States is authorized to collect delinquent taxes \u201cby levy upon all property and rights to property ... on which there is a lien provided in this chapter for the payment of such tax.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(a). The term \u201clevy\u201d as used in the Act includes \u201cthe power of distraint and seizure by any means.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(b). And, where levy is proper, the United States may seize and sell the property levied upon. <em>Id. </em>Such levy and seizure need not be accomplished while the property is in the hands of the taxpayer; so long as the property is subject to a valid federal tax lien, it may be seized in the hands of any subsequent purchaser. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6331-l(a)(l) (1979); Mertens, Code. Commentary, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6331:1; W. Plumb &amp; L. Wright, Federal Tax Liens 201 (2d ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-16\">There is no suggestion on this appeal that the United States in any way deviated from the prescribed levy procedures established by the Act and its attendant regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The gravamen of Myers\u2019 complaint is that the prescribed procedures are themselves constitutionally defective in that they permit the seizure of private property without a preseizure hearing or a prompt and adequate postseizure hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The Supreme Court of the United States has long recognized that, so long as there is an adequate opportunity for post-seizure determination of rights, the summary tax collection procedures of the Internal Revenue Code meet the requirements of due process. <em>See G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18, 97 S.Ct. 619, 628 n.18, 50 L.Ed.2d 530 (1977); <em>Commissioner v. Shapiro, </em>424 U.S. 614, 630-32 &amp; n.12, 96 S.Ct. 1062, 1072-73 &amp; n.12, 47 L.Ed.2d 278 (1976); <em>Fuentes v.

And indeed, the particular provisions of \u00a7 6331 have withstood numerous constitutional challenges predicated on the lack of preseizure judicial hearings. <em>See, e. g., Ginter v. Southern, </em>611 F.2d at 1226, 1228 (8th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 967, 100 S.Ct. 2946, 64 L.Ed.2d 827 (1980); <em>United States v.

This remedy is <em>prompt </em>insofar as a third person whose property is seized pursuant to a levy for a tax owed by another; for the third person is permitted immediate access to the courts on his claim of wrongful levy including the right to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>injunctive relief.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id.; Valley Finance, Inc. v.

United States, </em>551 F.2d 1169, 1175 n.5 (9th Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Myers is correct that the Act precludes third party attack upon the validity of the underlying tax assessment in actions brought under \u00a7 7426. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(c). <em>See Shannon v. United States, </em>521 F.2d 56, 59 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 965, 96 S.Ct. 1458, 47 L.Ed.2d 731 (1976). However, we perceive no constitutional infirmity in that restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The hearing requirements of the due process clause are neither inflexible nor absolute. The Supreme Court has been at pains to point out that \u201cthe timing and content of the notice and the nature of the hearing will depend on appropriate accommodation of the competing interests involved.\u201d <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 579, 95 S.Ct. 729, 738-39, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1965). <em>See Commissioner v. Shapiro, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 630 n.12, 96 S.Ct. at 1072 n.12; <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656-57, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In the context of the present case, we cannot say that Myers was not afforded prompt and meaningful postseizure hearing rights. Myers purchased property subject to two duly recorded (although improperly cancelled) federal tax liens. Under the provisions of \u00a7 7426, he was entitled to bring an immediate action in order to contest the levy made pursuant to those liens. During the course of that proceeding, Myers was entitled to full judicial consideration, in an adversary context, of the validity of the levy. He was entitled to show that the liens had not properly attached to the property in question, that the liens had been discharged through foreclosure and sale of the property, that the liens had been discharged through payment of the tax assessed, that his own interest in the property was superior in rank to the federal liens, and that the government had failed to follow the procedural requirements of the Act \u2014 in. short, Myers was entitled to raise virtually any legitimate and available objection he might have had to the validity of the levy. What he could not do is challenge the merits of the tax assessment itself, which had determined the tax liability of a former owner of the property \u2014 with finali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ty, under substantive law, insofar as a third person who subsequently purchases the taxpayer\u2019s property is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We do not believe due process requires that Myers, a third person, be allowed to challenge the tax liability of the former owner of the property. As we have noted, the resolution of asserted due process violations requires a careful weighing of the competing interests involved. <em>Commissioner v. Shapiro, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 630 n.12, 96 S.Ct. at 1072 n.12; <em>Goss v. Lopez, supra, </em>419 U.S. at 579, 95 S.Ct. at 738-39. The collection of the revenues is among the most paramount of governmental interests. <em>See, e. g., G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, supra, </em>429 U.S. at 352 n.18, 97 S.Ct. at 628 n.18; <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Shapiro, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 630 n.12, 96 S.Ct. at 1072 n.12; <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 92 &amp; n.24, 92 S.Ct. at 2000 &amp; n.24; <em>Bull v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 247, 259-60, 55 S.Ct. 695, 699-700, 79 L.Ed. 1421 (1935). As against this \u201cimperious need,\u201d <em>Bull, supra, </em>295 U.S. at 259, 55 S.Ct. at 699, of the federal government is balanced the interests of a property owner who acquired his rights through a foreclosure sale made subject to two duly recorded federal tax liens. That interest \u2014 although it is sufficient to require, as a matter of due process, a prompt and meaningful judicial determination of the superiority of the respective interests claimed by the property holder and the United States \u2014 does not compel us to conclude that due process requires the underlying tax assessment to be opened to collateral attack by the third party holder of the property levied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">To the contrary, we would note that a tax assessment is in the nature of a judgment, <em>Bull v. United States, supra, </em>295 U.S. at 260, 55 S.Ct. at 699-700, the merits of which the <em>taxpayer </em>himself has ample opportunity to contest, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213. In this light, we believe that well accepted notions concerning the finality of judgments and their immunity, from collateral attack provide a useful analogy in the resolution of the issue before us. In keeping with this view, courts have recognized a general rule that such assessments are not open to collateral attack by non-taxpayers. <em>Moyer v. Mathas, </em>458 F.2d 431, 434 &amp; n.4 (5th Cir. 1972). <em>See Al-Kim, Inc. v. United States, </em>610 F.2d 576, 579 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We conclude, therefore, that since the statutory scheme affords a prompt and meaningful opportunity for the postseizure judicial determination of rights relative to the levy itself, the plaintiff Myers was not denied any due process rights by the tax levy procedures at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the foreclosure and sale of the property here in question, pursuant to Louisiana\u2019s executory foreclosure process, constituted an \u201cother sale\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(b), and that therefore the foreclosing creditor\u2019s failure to serve notice upon the United States as required by that section precluded the discharge of the federal tax liens by virtue of that foreclosure sale. In addition, we hold that the levy procedures of the Act, as applied in the context of the case before us, fully comport with the requirements of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court below is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-10\">.

In its report on the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, the House Ways and Means Committee offered the following explanation of \u00a7 7425:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfH\">Under present law, a junior Federal tax lien may be discharged on foreclosure of a senior security interest. Such foreclosure may occur in a <em>plenary judicial action, </em>or, under the law of some States, by nonjudicial foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale contained in the senior security instrument. <em>In addition, in some States, foreclosure of a senior security interest may be accomplished by sale of the property by a judicial officer pursuant to a judgment entered under a \u201cconfession of judgment\u2019\u2019 signed by the debtor (typically in the security interest instrument itself). </em>Where State law so provides, a junior Federal tax lien may be extinguished without the United States either being made a party to the proceeding or having any actual notice. As a result, under current law tax liens are sometimes extinguished without the United States having actual notice of the proceedings, under circumstances where it is not possible for the Internal Revenue Service to take steps to protect the United States in the collection of its tax revenues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">Where there is a <em>plenary judicial proceeding </em>and the Government, as a junior lienor, must be joined for its interests to be discharged in the proceeding, the present procedure works well. However, <em>in other cases </em>where the interests of junior lienors may be eliminated without notice, it appears that the interest of the Government are not presently sufficiently protected. <em>Although legitimate local considerations may preclude requiring the Government (in other than plenary proceeding) to be joined as a party for its interest under a tax lien to be discharged, there does not appear to be any reason why in these cases there should not be a timely notice of the proceedings to the Government </em>where notice of its tax lien is on file. The requirement of notice gives the Government an opportunity to review its position and determine the appropriate action without placing an undue burden on a foreclosing creditor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">As explained below, the bill adds a new provision to the internal revenue laws <em>requiring the Government to be made a party in a plenary proceeding to discharge a tax lien. </em>The bill also makes provision for a <em>timely notice to the Government where it has the status of a junior lienor and there is no plenary proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">(1) Plenary foreclosure actions (sec. 7425(a) of the code)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-14\">The bill provides that <em>in a plenary judicial proceeding </em>where the Government has properly filed notice of a tax lien before the proceedings commence, but the Government is not joined as a party in the court proceeding, a judgment as to the property is not to disturb a tax lien or claim of a tax lien of the Government on this property. The same re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>suit is to occur when the property is sold pursuant to the judgment; the lien on the property continues into the hands of the third person. Where the Government is joined in these proceedings no change is made by the bill in the present operation of local law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">Where a notice of tax lien is not filed before a <em>plenary proceeding </em>commences \u2014 even in those cases where the filing is not required, such as in the case of a special lien for estate and gift taxes \u2014 a judicial sale is to have the same effect with respect to a tax lien as local law provides with respect to such matters. One exception is provided to this rule: where the Government is not joined as a party and the sale discharges the tax lien, the Government may still assert its claim against the proceeds of the sale at any time before the distribution is ordered with the same force as the lien had against the property sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(2) Other foreclosure proceedings (sec. 7425(b) of the code)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The bill provides that, <em>in the case of all other foreclosure proceedings, </em>where timely notice of the proceedings is given to the Government, the Government\u2019s claim to property under a tax lien is to be discharged in the manner provided by local law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-13\">Where foreclosures covered by this provision are made without proper notice to the Government, the bill provides that this does not affect the Government\u2019s claim under a tax lien (as where the Government is not joined in a judicial foreclosure). In these cases, the Government\u2019s claim continues against the property into the hands of a third party. On the other hand, where notice of the Government\u2019s claim under a tax lien is not filed (even in those cases where filing is not required), or where the Government is notified of the proceeding, a sale has the same effect on the claim as local law provides with respect to similar claims.

Myers quotes language to the effect that \u201c[t]he crucial inquiry is whether the personal property was sold pursuant to a judicial decree,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 755 n.l, as authority for the proposition that the crux of the distinction between \u201cjudicial sales\u201d and \u201cother sales\u201d is whether a judge was involved in the foreclosure proceedings. We disagree. The court in <em>A.H. and R.S. Coal Corp. v. United States </em>did not face the kind of executory judicial proceeding that is at issue here and did not purport to examine the distinction between \u201cjudicial\u201d and \u201cother\u201d sales in any depth. In terms, the court held only that, in the <em>absence </em>of judicial involvement, a sale could not be considered to have been made pursuant to judicial proceedings. That holding does not logically imply that the mere presence of judicial involvement is in itself enough to place an executory foreclosure proceeding within the ambit of \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d as that term is used in the Act. We conclude, therefore, that the <em>A.H. and R.S. Coal Corp. </em>case is inapposite to the inquiry now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b676-12\">. In <em>Galesi, </em>the property in question was sold pursuant to a state \u201cstrict\u201d foreclosure proceeding seeking only to cut off the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption. All other lienholders on the property were joined as defendants in the action. After the commencement of that action, however, the United States filed notice of its federal tax lien on the property. The single issue before the <em>Galesi </em>court was whether the sale in question was governed by the provisions of \u00a7 7425(a) (in which case the federal tax lien was discharged) or \u00a7 7425(b) (in which case the federal lien was not discharged). There was no suggestion in that case that the strict foreclosure proceeding was anything other than plenary. The government\u2019s attempt to characterize the sale as an \u201cother\u201d sale within the meaning of \u00a7 7425(b) was based solely on the fact that the strict foreclosure proceeding did not seek a judicial sale of the property. The court rejected the government\u2019s contention, holding that the mere fact that the foreclosure proceeding sought to cut off the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption rather than to effect the judicial sale of the property was not enough to remove that proceeding from the ambit of \u00a7 7425(a), as a \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d particularly when the government could have intervened under \u00a7 7424 to obtain a judicial sale. <em>Galesi v. United States, supra, </em>406 F.Supp. at 626-27. Significantly, the court in so doing expressly recognized the plenary-nonplenary distinction that is at issue in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\"><em>The provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7425(a) relate to sales resulting from plenary judicial proceedings </em>in which the United States is not joined as a party. The pendency of judicial proceedings, in which the United States is not joined, provides a vehicle for the Government to intervene to protect its interest, as provided in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7424, if it elects to do so. <em>Subsection (b) of 7425 applies in cases where the sale of the subject property is made outside the framework of plenary judicial action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 627 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">As we read <em>Galesi, </em>then, it stands only for the proposition that the redemption of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>pursuant to <em>plenary </em>foreclosure proceedings commenced before the filing of a federal tax lien will discharge the federal lien, even though the proceedings were a strict foreclosure (f. e., fixing the amount due, providing that in default of payment the debtor\u2019s equity of redemption is forever foreclosed, and granting junior security creditors the right to redeem the property) and did not seek judicial sale of the property, if the government had constructive notice of the proceedings and yet failed to seek intervention under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7424. Nothing in that case or in the Act would suggest that <em>nonplenary </em>foreclosure proceedings, otherwise governed by \u00a7 7425(b), are brought within the ambit of \u00a7 7425(a) merely because the United States might intervene therein by virtue of \u00a7 7424 and the provisions of state law. <em>Galesi, </em>in our view, is inapposite to the issue now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b677-12\">.
