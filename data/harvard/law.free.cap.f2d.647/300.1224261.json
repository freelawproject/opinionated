KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">These four appeals grow out of one of the most enormous commercial disputes in history, and present questions which strike to the very heart of the modern international economic order. An African nation, developing at breakneck speed by virtue of huge exports of high-grade oil, contracted to buy huge quantities of Portland cement, a commodity crucial to the construction of its infrastructure. It overbought, and the country\u2019s docks and harbors became clogged with ships waiting to unload. Imports of other goods ground to a halt. More vessels carrying cement arrived daily; still others were steaming toward the port. Unable to accept delivery of the cement it had bought, the nation repudiated its contracts. In response to suits brought by disgruntled suppliers, it now seeks to invoke an ancient maxim of sovereign <em>immunity </em>\u2014 par <em>in parent imperium non habet</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 to insulate itself from liability. But Latin phrases speak with a hoary simplicity inappropriate to the modern financial world. For the ruling principles here, we must look instead to a new and vaguely-worded statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (\u201cFSIA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 a law described by its draftsmen as providing only \u201cvery modest guidance\u201d on issues of preeminent importance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For answers to those most difficult questions, the authors of the law \u201cdecided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to put [their] faith in the U.S. courts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Guided by reason, precedent, and equity, we have attempted to give form and substance to the legislative intent. Accordingly, we find that the defense of sovereign immunity is not available in any of these four cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The facts of the four appeals are remarkably parallel, and can be stated in somewhat consolidated form.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Early in 1975, the Federal Military Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cNigeria\u201d) embarked on an ambitious program to purchase immense amounts of cement. We have already had occasion in another case to call the program \u201cincredible,\u201d see <em>National American Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>597 F.2d 314, 316 (2d Cir. 1979), but the statistics speak for themselves. Nigeria executed 109 contracts, with 68 suppliers. It purchased, in all, over sixteen million metric tons of cement. The price was close to one billion dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Four of the 109 contracts were made with American companies that were plaintiffs below in the cases now before us: Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. (\u201cTexas Trading\u201d), Decor by Nikkei International, Inc. (\u201cNikkei\u201d), East Europe Import-Export, Inc. (\u201cEast Europe\u201d), and Chenax Majesty, Inc. (\u201cChenax\u201d). The four plaintiffs are not industrial corporations; they are, instead, \u201ctrading companies,\u201d which buy from one person and sell to another in hopes of making a profit on the differential. Each of the plaintiffs is a New York corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">The contracts at issue were signed early in 1975. Each is substantially similar; indeed, Nigeria seems to have mimeographed them in blank, and filled in details with individual suppliers. Overall, each contract called for the sale by the supplier to Nigeria of 240,000 metric tons of Portland cement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the contracts required Nigeria, within a time certain after execution,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to establish in the seller\u2019s favor \u201can Irrevocable, Transferable abroad, Divisible and Confirmed letter of credit\u201d for the total amount due under the particular contract, slightly over $14 million in each case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The contract also named the bank through which the letter of credit was to be made payable. Nikkei and East Europe named First National City Bank in New York, and Texas Trading specified Fidelity International Bank, also in New York. Chenax denominated Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst &amp; Co. of Hamburg, West Germany. Drafts under the letters of credit were to be \u201cpayable at sight, on presentation\u201d of certain documents to the specified bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">Within a time certain after establishment and receipt of the letter of credit,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>seller was to start shipping cement to Nigeria. The cement was to be bagged, and was to meet certain chemical specifications. Shipments were to be from ports named in the contracts, mostly Spanish, and were to proceed at approximately 20,000 tons per month. Delivery was to the port of Lagos/Apapa, Nigeria, and the seller was obligated to insure the freight to the Nigerian quay. Each contract also provided for de-murrage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Nikkei and East Europe contracts provided they were to be governed by the laws of the United States. The Chenax contract specified the law of Switzerland, and the Texas Trading contract named the law of Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In short, performance under the contracts was to proceed as follows. Nigeria was to establish letters of credit. The suppliers were to ship cement. Each time a supplier had loaded a ship and insured its cargo to Lagos/Apapa, the supplier could take documents so proving to the bank named in the contract and, \u201cat sight,\u201d be paid for the amount of cement it shipped. The ship might sink on the way to Nigeria, or it might never leave the Spanish port at all, but \u2014 on presentation of proper documents showing a loaded ship and an insured cargo \u2014 the supplier had a right to be paid. Demurrage was to operate in the same manner: if a ship was detained in Nigerian waters, the supplier would receive certain documents. It could present the documents to the bank, and receive payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The actual financial arrangements differed from those set forth in the cement contracts. Instead of establishing \u201cconfirmed\u201d letters of credit with the banks named, Nigeria established what it called \u201cirrevocable\u201d letters of credit with the Central Bank of Nigeria (\u201cCentral Bank\u201d), an instrumentality of the Nigerian government,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and advised those letters of credit through the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company (\u201cMorgan\u201d) of New York. That is, under the letters of credit as established, each seller was to present appropriate documents not to the named bank, but to Morgan. And, since the letters were not \u201cconfirmed,\u201d Morgan did not promise to pay \u201con sight\u201d; it assumed no independent liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Each of the letters of credit provided it was to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (\u201cUCP\u201d) (1962 Revision), as set forth in Brochure No. 222 of the International Chamber of Commerce.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">The principal objects of the Bank shall be to issue legal tender currency in Nigeria, to maintain external reserves to safeguard the international value of that currency, to promote monetary stability and a sound financial structure in Nigeria and to act as banker and financial adviser to the Federal Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Nigeria\u2019s choice of Morgan as the bank to which suppliers presented documents and from which suppliers secured payments came in the course of a longstanding relationship between Nigeria and Morgan. Central Bank used Morgan as its correspondent bank in the United States, and Morgan conducted myriad transactions on Nigeria\u2019s behalf. Employees of Central Bank regularly came to Morgan for training seminars. On Nigeria\u2019s request, Morgan made payments to Nigerian students in the United States, to American corporations to which Nigeria owed money, and to the Nigerian embassy and consulates in the United States. Indeed, Nigeria used Morgan to make payments (for salaries, operating expenses, and the like) to Nigerian embassies in other countries as well. Until 1974, Morgan had the right to draw up to $1 million per day from Nigeria\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to satisfy Nigeria\u2019s obligations. Nigeria raised the limit to $3 million per day in 1974, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Morgan enjoyed unlimited drawing rights on Nigeria\u2019s funds beginning in November 1975. Central Bank kept over $200 million of securities in a custody account at Morgan. Morgan advised as much as $200 million in letters of credit established by Nigeria, and confirmed, in addition, letters of credit totalling at least $70 million more.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">After receiving notice that the letters of credit had been established, the suppliers set out to secure subcontracts to procure the cem\u00e9nt, and shipping contracts to transport it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They, through their subcontractors, began to bag the cement and load it on ships, as suppliers across the globe were doing the same. Hundreds of ships arrived in Lagos/Apapa in the summer of 1975, and most were carrying cement. Nigeria\u2019s port facilities could accept only one to five million tons of cement per year; at any rate, they could not begin to unload the over sixteen million tons Nigeria had slated for delivery in eighteen short months. Based on prior experience, Nigeria had made the contracts expecting only twenty percent of the suppliers to be able to perform. By July, when the harbor held over 400 ships waiting to unload \u2014 260 of them carrying cement \u2014 Nigeria realized it had misjudged the market considerably.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">With demurrage piling up at astronomical rates, and suppliers, hiring, loading, and dispatching more ships daily, Nigeria decided to act. On August 9, 1975, Nigeria caused its Ports Authority to issue Government Notice No. 1434, a regulation which stated that, effective August 18, all ships destined for Lagos/Apapa would be required to convey to the Ports Authority, two months before sailing, certain information concerning their time of arrival in the port. The regulation also stated vaguely that the Ports Authority would \u201cco-ordinate all sailing,\u201d and that it would \u201crefus[e] service\u201d to vessels which did not comply with the regulation. Then, on August 18, Nigeria cabled its suppliers and asked them to stop sending cement, and to cease loading or even chartering ships. In late September, Nigeria took the crucial step: Central Bank instructed Morgan not to pay under the letters of credit unless the supplier submitted \u2014 in addition to the documents required by the letter of credit as written \u2014 a statement from Central Bank that payment ought to be made. Morgan notified each supplier of Nigeria\u2019s instructions, and Morgan commenced refusing to make payment under the letters of credit as written. Almost three months later, on December 19, 1975, Nigeria promulgated Decree No. 40, a law prohibiting entry into a Nigerian port to any ship which had not secured two months\u2019 prior approval, and imposing criminal penalties for unauthorized entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Nigeria\u2019s unilateral alteration of the letters of credit took place on a scale previously unknown to international commerce. Officers of Morgan explained the potential consequences of Nigeria\u2019s action to representatives of Central Bank; Central Bank was adamant that Morgan not pay. After a meeting with Central Bank personnel, one Morgan officer stated that Central Bank\u2019s Deputy Governor \u201cresponded that the [Nigerian] Government was willing to go to court if we did pay.\u201d Within weeks of Nigeria\u2019s instructions to Morgan not to pay without the additional documentation, Morgan warned Central Bank in a telex: \u201cWe believe that there is an increasing possibility that litigation against you may be instituted in New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Nigeria\u2019s next step was to invite its suppliers to cancel the contracts. As part of the program, Nigeria convened a meeting at Morgan\u2019s offices in New York, to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Nigeria\u2019s position with members of the American financial community. Over forty suppliers eventually did settle. <em>See National American Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, supra, </em>597 F.2d at 316. Nigeria asked Morgan to effect several of the settlement payments; some were for settling suppliers not located in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Cement suppliers who did not settle sued in courts all over the world.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The four suppliers at issue here \u2014 Texas Trading, Nikkei, East Europe, and Chenax \u2014 sued in the Southern District of New York. Named as defendants were both Nigeria and Central Bank. The complaints alleged that Central Bank\u2019s September instructions to Morgan, changing the terms of payment under the letters of credit, constituted anticipatory breaches of both the cement contracts (requiring Nigeria to establish \u201cIrrevocable\u201d letters of credit with certain terms of payment) and the letters of credit (requiring Central Bank to authorize payment when certain documents were presented to Morgan). Defendants do not seriously dispute that their actions constitute such anticipatory breaches;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> their defenses go more to the propriety of jurisdiction under the FSIA. Judge Cannella in <em>Texas Trading, </em>D.C., 500 F.Supp. 320, found jurisdiction lacking; Judge Pierce in the consolidated <em>Nikkei, East Europe, </em>and <em>Che-nax </em>actions, D.C., 497 F.Supp. 893, held it present. Judge Pierce proceeded to a trial on the merits, and awarded $1.857 million to Nikkei, $1.986 million to East Europe, and nothing to Chenax. These appeals followed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">The law before us is complex and largely unconstrued, and has introduced sweeping changes in some areas of prior law. <em>See </em>House Judiciary Committee, <em>Jurisdiction of United States Courts in Suits Against Foreign States, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 7-8, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 6605, 6604-6 <em>(\u201cHouse Report </em>\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In structure, the FSIA is a marvel of compression. Within the bounds of a few tersely-worded sections, it purports to provide answers to three crucial questions in a suit against a foreign state: the availability of sovereign immunity as a defense, the presence of subject matter jurisdiction over the claim, and the propriety of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>See House Report </em>at 6611-12. Through a series of intricately coordinated provisions, the FSIA seems at first glance to make the answer to one of the questions, subject matter jurisdiction, dispositive of all three. <em>See Hearings on H.R. 11315 Before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the House Committee on the Judiciary, </em>94th Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1976) <em>(\u201c1976 Hearings\u201d) </em>(testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser, Department of State).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This economy of decision has come, however, at the price of considerable confusion in the district courts. In fact, Congress intended the sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction decisions to remain slightly distinct, and it drafted the Act accordingly. Moreover, Congress has only an incomplete power to tie personal jurisdiction to subject matter jurisdiction; its prerogatives are constrained by the due process clause. These cases present an opportunity to untie the FSIA\u2019s Gordian knot, and to vindicate the Congressional purposes behind the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Turning to the specific provisions of the law, a description of the FSIA\u2019s analytic structure is helpful. The jurisdiction-conferring provision of the Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a), creates in the district courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azb\">original jurisdiction without regard to amount in controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections 1605-1607 of this title or under any applicable international agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AET\">Although \u00a7 1330(a) refers to sections 1605-1607, the section most frequently relevant,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the one applicable here, is \u00a7 1605. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">(a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">the United States or of the States in any case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">(2) in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">Crucial to each of the three clauses of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) is the phrase \u201ccommercial activity.\u201d In it is lodged centuries of Anglo-American and civil law precedent construing the term \u201csovereign immunity.\u201d If the activity is not \u201ccommercial,\u201d but, rather, is \u201cgovernmental,\u201d then the foreign state is entitled to immunity under section 1605, and \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d is not present under \u00a7 1330(a).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">For the definition of \u201ccommercial activity,\u201d we turn to subsection 1603(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-16\">(d) A \u201ccommercial activity\u201d means either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act. The commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>If \u201ccommercial activity\u201d under \u00a7 1603(d) is present, and if it bears the relation to the United States required by \u00a7 1605(a)(2), then the foreign state is \u201cnot entitled to immunity,\u201d and the district court has statutory subject matter jurisdiction over the claim through \u00a7 1330(a). And, if the exercise of that jurisdiction falls within the judicial power set forth by Article III of the Constitution, subject matter jurisdiction over the claim exists.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Our analysis next proceeds to the question of personal jurisdiction; we come again to \u00a7 1330. Subsection (b) of section 1330 provides: \u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim for relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a) where service has been made under section 1608 of this title.\u201d The Act, therefore, makes the statutory aspect of personal jurisdiction simple: subject matter jurisdiction plus service of process equals personal jurisdiction. <em>See House Report </em>at 6622. But, the Act cannot create personal jurisdiction where the Constitution forbids it. Accordingly, each finding of personal jurisdiction under the FSIA requires, in addition, a due process scrutiny of the court\u2019s power to exercise its authority over a particular defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In short, a \u201c\u00a7 1605(a)(2) case\u201d calls for the resolution of a series of five questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">1) Does the conduct the action is based upon or related to qualify as \u201ccommercial activity\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">2) Does that commercial activity bear the relation to the cause of action and to the United States described by one of the three phrases of \u00a7 1605(a)(2), warranting the Court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1330(a)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">3) Does the exercise of this congressional subject matter jurisdiction lie within the permissible limits of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d set forth in Article III?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">4) Do subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1330(a) and service under \u00a7 1608 exist, thereby making personal jurisdiction proper under \u00a7 1330(b)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">5) Does the exercise of personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1330(b) comply with the due process clause, thus making personal jurisdiction proper?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">It is to those questions we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Before undertaking the threshold \u201ccommercial activity\u201d analysis, our first task is to identify what particular conduct in this case is relevant. Subsection 1603(d) states that \u201ccommercial activity\u201d might consist of either \u201ca regular course of commercial conduct\u201d or \u201ca particular commercial transaction or act.\u201d The words \u201cregular course of ... conduct\u201d seem to authorize courts to cast the net wide, and to identify a broad series of acts as the relevant set of activities. <em>See House Report </em>at 6615. Here, the relevant \u201ccourse of ... conduct\u201d is undoubtedly Nigeria\u2019s massive cement purchase program. Alternatively, each of its contracts or letters of credit with these four plaintiffs would qualify as \u201ca particular ... transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">The determination of whether particular behavior is \u201ccommercial\u201d is perhaps the most important decision a court faces in an FSIA suit. This problem is significant because the primary purpose of the Act is to \u201crestrict\u201d the immunity of a foreign state to suits involving a foreign state\u2019s public acts. <em>House Report </em>at 6605. If the activity is not \u201ccommercial,\u201d it satisfies none of the three clauses of \u00a7 1605(a)(2), and the foreign state is (at least under that subsection) immune from suit. Unfortunately, the definition of \u201ccommercial\u201d is the one issue on which the Act provides almost no guidance at all. Subsection 1603(d) advances the inquiry somewhat, for it provides: \u201cThe commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose.\u201d No provision of the Act, however, defines \u201ccommercial.\u201d Congress de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>liberately left the meaning open and, as noted above, \u201cput [its] faith in the U.S. courts to work out progressively, on a case-by-case basis . . . the distinction between commercial and governmental.\u201d <em>1976 Hearings </em>at 53 (testimony of Monroe Leigh). <em>Accord, House Report </em>at 6615; <em>Hearings on HR. 3493 Before Subcommittee on Claims and Governmental Relations of the House Committee on the Judiciary, </em>93d Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1973) (\u201c1973 <em>Hearings\u201d) </em>(testimony of Charles N. Brower, Legal Adviser, Department of State).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Kahale &amp; Vega, <em>Immunity and Jurisdiction: Toward a Uniform Body of Law in Actions Against Foreign States, </em>18 ColumJ. Transnat\u2019l L. 211, 236 (1979). We are referred to no less than three separate sources of authority to resolve this fundamental definitional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The first source is statements contained in the legislative history itself. Perhaps the clearest of them was made by Bruno Ris-tau, then Chief of the Foreign Litigation Section of the Civil Division, Department of Justice. Ristau stated: \u201c[I]f a government enters into a contract to purchase goods and services, that is considered a commercial activity. It avails itself of the ordinary contract machinery. It bargains and negotiates. It accepts an offer. It enters into a written contract and the contract is to be performed.\u201d <em>1976 Hearings </em>at 51. The House Report seems to conclude that a contract or series of contracts for the purchase of goods would be <em>per se </em>a \u201ccommercial activity,\u201d <em>see House Report </em>at 6615, and the illustrations cited by experts who testified on the bill \u2014 contracts, for example, for the sale of army boots<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or grain<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u2014 support such a rule. Or, put another way, if the activity is one in which a private person could engage, it is not entitled to immunity. <em>See 1976 Hearings </em>at 24 (testimony of Monroe Leigh), 53 (same); <em>1973 Hearings </em>at 15 (testimony of Charles N. Brower).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The second source for interpreting the phrase \u201ccommercial activity\u201d is the \u201cvery large body of case law which exist[ed]\u201d in American law upon passage of the Act in 1976. <em>See 1976 Hearings </em>at 53 (testimony of Monroe Leigh). <em>See also id. </em>at 94 (testimony of Michael M. Cohen, Chairman, Committee on Maritime Legislation, Maritime Law Association of the United States). Testifying on an earlier version of the bill, Charles N. Brower, then Legal Adviser of the Department of State, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">[T]he restrictive theory of sovereign immunity from jurisdiction, which has been followed by the Department of State and the courts since it was articulated in the familiar letter of Acting Legal Adviser Jack B. Tate of May 29, 1952, would be incorporated into statutory law. This theory limits immunity to public acts, leaving so-called private acts subject to suit. The proposed legislation would make it clear that immunity cannot be claimed with respect to acts or transactions that are commercial in nature, regardless of their underlying purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\"><em>1973 Hearings </em>at 15.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See generally Petrol Shipping Corp. v. Kingdom of Greece, </em>360 F.2d 103 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 931, 87 S.Ct. 291, 17 L.Ed.2d 213 (1966); <em>Victory Transport, Inc. v.

Section 1602 of the Act, entitled \u201cFindings and declaration of purpose,\u201d contains a cryptic reference to international law, but fails wholly to adopt it.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The legislative history states that the Act \u201cincorporates standards recognized under international law,\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 6613, and the drafters seem to have intended rather generally to bring American sovereign immunity practice into line with that of other nations. <em>See 1976 Hearings </em>at 25 (testimony of Monroe Leigh), 32 (testimony of Bruno A. Ristau); <em>1973 Hearings </em>at 18 (testimony of Charles N. Brower). At this point, there can be little doubt that international law follows the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity. <em>House Report </em>at 6613. <em>See, e. g., </em>State Immunity Act, 1978, s. 3 (United Kingdom); Council of Europe, European Convention on State Immunity, art. 4 (1972), <em>reprinted in 1976 Hearings </em>at 37, 38; <em>Empire of Iran, </em>45 I.L.R. 57 (1963) (West Germany).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Under each of these three standards, Nigeria\u2019s cement contracts and letters of credit qualify as \u201ccommercial activity.\u201d Lord Denning, writing in <em>Trendtex Trading Corp. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>[1977] 2 W.L.R. 356, 369, 1 All E.R. 881, with his usual erudition and clarity, stated: \u201cIf a government department goes into the market places of the world and buys boots or cement \u2014 as a commercial transaction \u2014 that government department should be subject to all the rules of the marketplace.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s activity here is in the nature of a private contract for the purchase of goods. Its purpose \u2014 to build roads, army barracks, whatever \u2014 is irrelevant. Accordingly, courts in other nations have uniformly held Nigeria's 1975 cement purchase program and appurtenant letters of credit to be \u201ccommercial activity,\u201d and have denied the defense of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We find defendants\u2019 activity here to constitute \u201ccommercial activity,\u201d and we move on to the next step of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">C. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">We need look no further than the third clause of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) to find statutory subject matter jurisdiction here. That clause provides: \u201cA foreign state shall not be immune ... in any case ... in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>action is based ... upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The focus of our analysis is to determine whether \u201cthe act cause[d] a direct effect in the United States\u201d within the meaning of the FSIA.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The \u201cdirect effect\u201d clause has been the subject of considerable commentary<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> but remains somewhat abstruse. The House Report, for example, states only that the direct effect clause \u201cwould subject [commercial] conduct [abroad] to the exercise of jurisdiction by the United States consistent with principles set forth in section 18, Restatement of the Law, Second, Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1965).\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 6618. The reference is a bit of a <em>non sequitur, </em>since \u00a7 18 concerns the extent to which substantive American law may be applied to conduct overseas, not the proper extraterritorial jurisdictional reach of American courts <em>n\u2019importe quelle </em>substantive law.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Nor is the House Report\u2019s vague reference to the District of Columbia\u2019s long-arm statute, D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-423(a), especially helpful; that provision looks to personal jurisdiction, not subject matter jurisdiction, and in any event is concerned in its \u201ceffects\u201d provision only with torts. We are left with the words, \u201cdirect effect in the United States,\u201d and with Congress\u2019s broad mandate in passing the FSIA: \u201cUnder section 1605(a)(2), no act of a foreign state, tortious or not, which is connected with the commercial activities of a foreign state would give rise to immunity if the act takes place in the United States or has a direct effect within the United States.\u201d <em>1973 Hearings </em>at 42 (State Department Section-by-Section Analysis of 1973 bill).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Fortunately, a certain amount of case law interprets both components of the proble<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>matic phrase: \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cin the United States.\u201d For a paradigm of \u201cdirect,\u201d we look to the vivid examples of <em>Harris v. VAO Intourist, Moscow, </em>481 F.Supp. 1056 (E.D.N. Y.1979), and <em>Upton v. Empire of Iran, </em>459 F.Supp. 264 (D.D.C.1978), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>607 F.2d 494 (D.C.Cir.1979). In <em>Harris, </em>a man lost his life in a hotel fire; in <em>Upton, </em>a man was injured when the roof of a building collapsed on him. Both men undoubtedly suffered \u201cdirect\u201d effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Applying the term to a corporation is not so simple. Unlike a natural person, a corporate entity is intangible; it cannot be burned or crushed. It can only suffer financial loss. Accordingly, the relevant inquiry under the direct effect clause when plaintiff is a corporation is whether the corporation has suffered a \u201cdirect\u201d financial loss. To discover whether breach of a contract causes this type of loss, we look to <em>Carey v. National Oil Corp., </em>592 F.2d 673, 676-77 (2d Cir. 1979) <em>(per curiam). </em>In <em>Carey, </em>we decided that a direct effect can arise not only from a tort, e. <em>g., Harris </em>and <em>Upton, supra, </em>but from cancellation of a contract for the sale of oil as well. Here, under either theory of recovery, breach of the cement contracts or breach of the letters of credit, the effect of the suppliers was \u201cdirect.\u201d They were beneficiaries of the contracts that were breached. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Effects Jurisdiction Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the Due Process Clause, </em>55 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 474, 500-10 &amp; n.192 (1980) (\u201cNYU Note\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Finally, the most difficult aspect of the direct effect clause concerns its phrase, \u201cin the United States.\u201d State law abounds with decisions locating \u201ceffects\u201d for personal jurisdiction purposes. But those cases are not precisely on point, for they are concerned more with federalism, and less with international relations, than was Congress in passing the FSIA.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Reliance on state cases is not necessary here because the financial loss in these cases occurred \u201cin the United States\u201d for two much simpler reasons. First, the cement suppliers were to present documents and collect money in the United States, and the breaches precluded their doing so. Second, each of the plaintiffs is an American corporation. Whether a failure to pay a foreign corporation in the United States<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> or to pay an American corporation overseas<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> creates an effect \u201cin the United States\u201d under \u00a7 1605(a)(2) is not before us. Both factors are present here, and the subsection is clearly satisfied. <em>See </em>NYU Note at 510-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The foregoing analysis demonstrates that neither \u201cdirect\u201d nor \u201cin the United States\u201d is a term susceptible of easy definition. A corporation is no more than a series of conduits, filtering profit \u2014 or loss\u2014 through each stage from the company\u2019s customers to its shareholders, who may themselves be fictional entities as well. Harm to any component is somewhat \u201cindirect,\u201d and locating the site of the injury, especially when the harm consists in an omission, is an enterprise fraught with artifice. Courts construing either term should be mindful more of Congress\u2019s concern with providing \u201caccess to the courts\u201d to those aggrieved by the commercial acts of a foreign sovereign, <em>House Report </em>at 6605, than with cases defining \u201cdirect\u201d or locating effects under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>state statutes passed for dissimilar purposes. Before the FSIA, plaintiffs enjoyed a broad right to bring suits against foreign states, subject only to State Department intervention and the presence of attachable assets. Congress in the FSIA certainly did not intend significantly to constrict jurisdiction; it intended to regularize it. <em>See House Report </em>at 6605-06. The question is, was the effect sufficiently \u201cdirect\u201d and sufficiently \u201cin the United States\u201d that Congress would have wanted an American court to hear the case? No rigid parsing of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) should lose sight of that purpose. We have no doubt that Congress intended to bring suits like these into American courts, <em>see House Report </em>at 6618, and we hold that statutory subject matter jurisdiction here exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The final step in establishing the court\u2019s right to hear the claim is to find a constitutional basis for the statutory exercise of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., </em>260 U.S. 226, 234, 43 S.Ct. 79, 82, 67 L.Ed. 226 (1922). Each of these four suits is \u201cbetween a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States,\u201d U.S. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, and therefore comes within the judicial power by way of the diversity grant. Indeed, it is to that clause that the drafters of the FSIA looked in securing a constitutional basis for FSIA suits generally. <em>See House Report </em>at 6611, 6632. <em>Cf. Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 320 (2d Cir. 1981) (suit by alien against foreign state not supported by constitutional diversity grant). The district court, we conclude, had the power to hear these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">D. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Subsequent to the determination of subject matter jurisdiction is the issue of personal jurisdiction. The statutory aspects of the analysis are quite simple. Subsection 1330(b) provides for personal jurisdiction over the foreign state as to any claim the district court has power to hear under \u00a7 1330(a), so long as service has been made under \u00a7 1608.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Service here has been made, or at least not objected to. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1). Subject matter jurisdiction exists, so statutory personal jurisdiction exists as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Turning to the constitutional constraints on personal jurisdiction, our first inquiry must be whether the safeguards of due process, which otherwise regulate every exercise of personal jurisdiction, apply to FSIA cases at all. Specifically, is a foreign state a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the due process clause? Cases on the point are rare, since pre-FSIA suits against foreign states were generally brought <em>quasi in rem, </em>and the due process clause was not uniformly applied to <em>quasi in rem </em>suits until 1977, a year after the FSIA was passed. <em>See Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977). Nonetheless, in <em>Amoco Overseas Oil Co. v. Compagnie Nation ale Algerienne de Navigation, </em>605 F.2d 648 (2d Cir. 1979), a <em>quasi in rem </em>suit filed before the FSIA and decided after <em>Shaffer, </em>we applied constitutional due process analysis to a suit against a foreign state. We affirm that holding today. <em>Thos. P. Gonzalez Corp. v. Consejo Nacional de Producci\u00f3n de Costa Rica, </em>614 F.2d 1247 (9th Cir. 1980) (applying due process clause in suit against foreign state <em>in personam); Petrol Shipping Corp. v. Kingdom of Greece, supra, </em>360 F.2d at 110 (same); <em>Purdy Co. v. Argentina, </em>333 F.2d 95, 98 (7th Cir. 1964) (same); <em>Rovin Sales Co. v. Socialist Republic of Romania, </em>403 F.Supp. 1298, 1302 (N.D.Ill.1975) (same); <em>T.J. Stevenson &amp; Co. v. 81,193 Bags of Wheat Flour, </em>399 F.Supp. 936, 938 (S.D.Ala.1975) (same) (counterclaim).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Since the constitutional constraints apply here, our next concern must be to delineate the contacts that are relevant. The inquiry has two aspects: whose contacts, and with what? To bring any defendant before the court, of course, the due process analysis must be satisfied as to him. Nonetheless, it is not only defendant\u2019s activities in the forum, but also actions relevant to the transaction by an agent on defendant\u2019s behalf, which support personal jurisdiction. <em>Gelfand v. Tanner Motor Tours, Ltd., </em>385 F.2d 116, 120-21 (2d Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 996, 88 S.Ct. 1198, 20 L.Ed.2d 95 (1968); <em>Frummer v. Hilton Hotels International, Inc., </em>19 N.Y.2d 533, 538, 281 N.Y.S.2d 41, 44-45, 227 N.E.2d 851, 854, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 923, 88 S.Ct. 241, 19 L.Ed.2d 266 (1967). Under the <em>Gelfand </em>standard, Central Bank\u2019s activities with respect to the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d are chargeable to Nigeria, and Morgan\u2019s activities are chargeable to both. If Morgan had not performed for Central Bank, and Central Bank for Nigeria, the entire payment mechanism supporting the cement contracts, Nigeria would have been required to make the payments directly. <em>See Gelfand, supra, </em>385 F.2d at 121. Since service was made under \u00a7 1608, the relevant area in delineating contacts is the entire United States, not merely New York. <em>Compare </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608 (service of process provision for FSIA) <em>with </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21(f) (service of process provision for antitrust laws), 77v (same for securities laws). <em>See Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., </em>519 F.2d 974, 998-1000 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1018, 96 S.Ct. 453, 46 L.Ed.2d 389 (1975); <em>Mariash v. Morrill, </em>496 F.2d 1138, 1143 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>Leasco Data Processing Equipment Corp. v. Maxwell, </em>468 F.2d 1326, 3,340 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Whether a defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum are so numerous that they reach the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d required by <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), depends broadly on whether \u201cmaintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 66 S.Ct. at 158, <em>citing Milliken v. Meyer, </em>311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S.Ct. 339, 343, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940). That standard, in turn, involves at least four separate inquiries. Under the cases from <em>International Shoe </em>to <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980), the court must examine the extent to which defendants availed themselves of the privileges of American law, the extent to which litigation in the United States would be foreseeable to them, the inconvenience to defendants of litigating in the United States, and the countervailing interest of the United States in hearing the suit. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 292, 297, 100 S.Ct. at 564, 567; <em>Kulko v. California Superior Court, </em>436 U.S. 84, 97-98, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 1699-1700, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978); <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 1239, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958); <em>McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 223, 78 S.Ct. 199, 201, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957); <em>International Shoe Co., supra, </em>326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao3\">The facts of these cases establish that Central Bank, and through Central Bank Nigeria, repeatedly and \u201cpurposefully avail[ed themselves]\u201d of the privilege of conducting activities in the United States. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, supra, </em>357 U.S. at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1240, <em>citing International Sho</em>e <em>Co., supra, </em>326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. at 159. (Central Bank alone sent its employees to New York for training, kept large cash balances here, and maintained a custody : account as well. If Morgan had converted ' Central Bank\u2019s funds from either account, New York law would have protected Central Bank, and allowed it to sue. Central Bank made it a regular practice to advise letters of credit through Morgan, and to use Morgan as its means of paying bills throughout the world. New York law protected Central Bank in each of its instructions, transfers, and withdrawals. Central Bank\u2019s activities with respect to the cement contracts and the letters of credit, directly chargeable to Nigeria under <em>Gelfand, </em>show the same pattern. In Nigeria\u2019s behalf and on Nigeria\u2019s instructions, Central Bank advised each of the letters of credit through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Morgan, in the United States, regardless of the individual supplier\u2019s wishes. Having chosen American law and process as their protectors, Nigeria and Central Bank were not hesitant to invoke them; at the mere hint Morgan was reluctant to honor defendants\u2019 amendments to the letters of credit, an officer of Central Bank threatened to \u201cgo to court\u201d to enforce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Having so thoroughly \u201cinvok[ed] the benefits and protections of [American] laws,\u201d <em>Hanson v. Denekla, supra, </em>357 U.S. at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1240, Nigeria and Central Bank would have every \u201creason to expect to be haled before a ... court\u201d here. <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 216, 97 S.Ct. at 2586. Having threatened litigation on their own, and having been notified of its likelihood by Morgan, defendants cannot now assert they could not have expected it. Moreover, the very function of the due process clause is to give \u201ca degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. at 567. In light of defendants\u2019 intentional activities in the United States, litigation was clearly foreseeable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Although the United States is certainly distant from Nigeria, litigation here is not unduly inconvenient for defendants. Every modern transnational commercial contract presents problems of adjudicatory cost; in the cement purchase program, where Nigeria bargained with corporations from a plethora of nations, required in the contracts that the goods came mostly from Europe, and provided in some letters of credit that payment was to be made in the United States, the inconvenience was at least expected. Moreover, Nigeria in the cement contracts agreed to submit to arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d). The ICC\u2019s headquarters are in Paris, but its arbitrations can take place anywhere in the world. <em>See </em>ICC, <em>ICC Arbitration </em>\u2014 The <em>International Solution to Business Disputes, </em>art. 12 (undated). Further, any assertion of inconvenience here is belied by defendants\u2019 constant resort to the United States for a myriad of services, and by the frequent visits of Central Bank officials to Morgan in New York. <em>Cf. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">In <em>McGee v.

Here, we should not be unmindful that Congress has passed the FSIA specifically to provide \u201caccess to the courts.\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 6605. Similarly, the plaintiff has an \u201cinterest in obtaining convenient and effective relief.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

We need not belabor the point that the specific act or acts upon which these suits are based \u2014 the anticipatory repudiation of the cement contracts and letters of credit \u2014 took place at least in part \u201coutside the territory of the United States.\u201d It was from Nigeria that Central Bank sent the instructions amending the letters of credit; it was in Nigeria that Nigeria instructed Central Bank to do so. Congress in writing the FSIA did not intend to incorporate into modern law every ancient sophistry concerning \u201cwhere\u201d an act or omission occurs. Conduct crucial to modern commerce \u2014 telephone calls, telexes, electronic transfers of intangible debits and credits \u2014 can take place in several jurisdictions. Outmoded rules placing such activity \u201cin\u201d one jurisdiction or another are not helpful here.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Moreover, should defendants establish that the \u201cact\u201d or \u201ccommercial activity\u201d the action is \u201cbased upon\u201d took place not \u201coutside the territory of the United States\u201d but inside it, then the first or second clauses of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) might become relevant. We need not decide the question. Given Congress\u2019s broad approach in the language of \u00a7 1605(a)(2), it is not at all improbable that a suit could be brought under more than one clause. See <em>House Report </em>at 6618 (stating that all cases covered by second clause might also come within first clause), <em>1973 Hearings </em>at 42 (State Dep\u2019t Section-by-Section Analysis) (stating that \u00a7 1605(a)(2) covers all cases with an act or direct effect in United States). <em>See generally Gemini Shipping, Inc. v.

To the extent the substantiality and foreseeability requirements of the legislative reach cases are designed to minimize unnecessary conflict between United States and foreign substantive law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606 renders the requirements irrelevant, since it implies that federal substantive law will not always govern in FSIA cases. <em>See generally Bersch v.

We recognize that <em>International Shoe </em>and its progeny were decided under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while this case falls within the purview of the similar clause in the Fifth Amendment. In <em>Leasco Data Processing, supra, </em>a Fifth Amendment case, we applied the Fourteenth Amendment analysis, see 468 F.2d at 1340, but we added that the assertion of personal jurisdiction \u201cmust be applied with caution, particularly in an international context,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1341, <em>citing </em>von Mehren &amp; Trautman, <em>Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, </em>79 Harv.L.Rev. 1121, 1127 (1966). <em>See also Bersch v.

While circumspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tion is appropriate in transnational disputes, certain other factors which might limit the exercise of personal jurisdiction are not present in such suits. The concerns of federalism discussed at length by the Supreme Court in <em>Shaffer, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 216-17, 97 S.Ct. at 2586-87, and <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp., supra, </em>444 U.S. at 292, 100 S.Ct. at 564, for example, would not be relevant in an FSIA suit since states within a federal system, strictly speaking, are not involved. Further, more or less solicitude might be in order because defendant is a government, not a natural person or corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We find neither distinction dispositive here. Like the states of our nation, the United States is a member of an international community. While it has not formally renounced part of its long-arm power by signing an international constitution, considerations of fairness nonetheless regulate every exercise of the federal judicial machinery. <em>See </em>Restatement of the Law, Second, Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 37 (1965); von Mehren &amp; Trautman, <em>supra, </em>79 Harv.L.Rev. at 1125 n.8. The analogy between the national and international systems may not be sufficiently exact to lead to the same result in every case, but here we see no reason to stray from our former adherence to the analysis developed under the Fourteenth Amendment. Similarly, \u201cwe see no reason to treat a commercial branch of a foreign sovereign differently from a foreign corporation.\u201d <em>Victory Transport, Inc., supra, </em>336 F.2d at 363.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">. Having lost the sovereign immunity decision and the jurisdictional questions, defendants attempt to place a further obstacle in the way of the speedy adjudication of the claims against them: the act of state doctrine. We decline to apply it here. Our decision does not depend on a determination that this case falls within one of the several purported \u201cexceptions\u201d to the rule. Act of state analysis depends upon a careful case-by-case analysis of the extent to which the separation of powers concerns on which the doctrine is based are implicated by the action before the court. <em>Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, </em>425 U.S. 682, 728, 96 S.Ct. 1854, 1877, 48 L.Ed.2d 301 (1976) (Marshall, <em>J., </em>dissenting); <em>see Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, </em>376 U.S. 398, 428, 84 S.Ct. 923, 940, 11 L.Ed.2d 804 (1964). Here, adjudication of the legality of Nigeria\u2019s and Central Bank\u2019s challenged conduct does not threaten to embarrass the executive branch in its conduct of United States foreign relations, and hence does not seriously implicate the relevant policy considerations. These cases contain none of the elements that other courts have viewed to contain the seeds of such embarrassment. We are not being asked, as the Court was in <em>Sabbatino, </em>to judge a foreign government\u2019s conduct under ambiguous principles of international law. These are not cases where the challenged governmental conduct is public rather than commercial in nature, <em>see Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, supra, </em>or where its purpose was to serve an integral governmental function, <em>cf. Hunt v.
