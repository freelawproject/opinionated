No. 94-430, 90 Stat. 1346 (1976), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3796-3796c (Supp. III 1979) (\u201cPSOBA\u201d). The case now comes before the court on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. Claimants\u2019 decedent, a fireman, was afflicted by smoke inhalation while fighting a house fire. He collapsed from a heart attack the same day and died from a second heart attack six weeks later. The fireman\u2019s heart had apparently already begun to deteriorate prior to the smoke inhalation incident. LEAA determined that the smoke inhalation, <em>i. e., </em>\u201ctraumatic injury\u201d, did not proximately cause the fireman\u2019s death and that, consequently, a death benefit could not be paid. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">PSOBA provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cIn any case in which the Administration [LEAA] determines, under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Administration shall pay a benefit of $50,000 ... one-half to the surviving ... children of such officer in equal shares and one-half to the surviving spouse....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a)(2) (Supp. Ill 1979); <em>accord, </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.3 (1980). The implementing regulations state that, \u201c \u2018Personal injury\u2019 means any traumatic injury, as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such an injury, but not occupational diseases.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(e) (1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulations further provide: \u201c \u2018Occupational disease\u2019 means a disease which routinely constitutes a special hazard in, or is commonly regarded as a concomitant of the officer\u2019s occupation.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g) (1980). \u201c \u2018Traumatic injury\u2019 means a wound or other condition of the body caused by external force, including injuries inflicted by bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other physical blows, chemicals, electricity, <em>climatic conditions, </em>infectious diseases, radiation, and bacteria, but excluding stress and strain.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(f) (1980) (emphasis supplied). A \u201cCommentary\u201d which appears directly following the regulations in the Federal Register (but which does not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations) states that \u201cClimatic conditions include atmospheric conditions, <em>such as dense smoke ...\u201d </em>42 Fed.Reg. 23260 (1977) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-14\">The regulations further indicate that \u201c \u2018Direct and proximate\u2019 or \u2018proximate\u2019 means that the antecedent event is a substantial factor in the result.\u201d 28 C.F.R. 32.2(d) (1980). LEAA\u2019s General Counsel on September 12,1977 issued a legal opinion to the PSOB Program, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-15\">Generally, you should consider a traumatic injury a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in an officer\u2019s death when (1) the injury itself would be sufficient to kill the officer, regardless of the officer\u2019s physical condition at the time of death; or (2) the injury contributes to the officer\u2019s death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>to as great a degree as any other contributing factor, such as pre-existing chronic, congenital, or progressive disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The \u201cCommentary\u201d states: \u201cIn determining whether an injury was a substantial factor in the officer\u2019s death, LEAA will make no presumptions with respect to the length of time between the injury and death. The claimant has the burden in all cases of showing that the injury was a substantial factor in the officer\u2019s death.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 23260 (1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">The \u201cCommentary\u201d also expresses the agency\u2019s viewpoint that deaths resulting from heart disorders, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cchronic, congenital, or progressive cardiac and pulmonary diseases,\u201d would not be covered by PSOBA \u201cunless a traumatic injury was a substantial factor in the death.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In <em>Smykowski v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl., 647 F.2d 1103, at 1105 (1981), decided this date, we stated that LEAA\u2019s exclusion of \u201cstress, strain, and heart disorders from the coverage of the Act [was] amply justified by the statutory language, legislative history, and medical statistics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">Lastly, the implementing regulations contain the provision that, \u201cThe Administration shall resolve any reasonable doubt arising from the circumstances of the officer\u2019s death in favor of payment of the death benefit.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4 (1980). The \u201cCommentary\u201d states: \u201cIn those cases where LEAA cannot reasonably determine which factor \u2014 the heart condition or the personal injury \u2014 was the substantial causal contribution to death, it \u2018shall resolve any reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d in accordance with the foregoing rule. 42 Fed.Reg. 23260 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">The decedent, John C. Morrow, was a fireman with the Evansville, Indiana Fire Department. Morrow\u2019s crew was dispatched to fight a house fire on October 8, 1976. He became ill at the scene for a brief period, partially as the result of smoke inhalation, then continued to fight the fire. After returning to the fire station, Morrow again became ill and collapsed. He was taken to the hospital, where his illness was diagnosed as cardiac arrest. He was in the hospital 8Vft weeks before being discharged. On November 16, 1976, he returned to the hospital after suffering severe chest pains at home. He was treated for 4 days before dying at the hospital on November 20,1976. The diagnosis at autopsy was \u201cmarked\u201d atherosclerotic heart disease. Evidence of an earlier healed myocardial infarction was noted. The death certificate listed the immediate cause of death as cardiac arrest due to myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">Claimants thereafter filed for PSOBA benefits. Prior to making its determination, LEAA sent the medical information in the file to Dr. Robert L. Thompson, Chairman of the Armed Forces Institute of Par thology, Department of Forensic Sciences, Walter Reed Hospital, for review. Dr. Thompson found no traumatic injury that might have contributed to Morrow\u2019s death. He found that the cause of death was \u201cacute myocardial infarct secondary to ar-teriosclerotic heart disease.\u201d On February 15,1978, LEAA issued an initial determination of ineligibility. The decision noted that \u201c[a]n injury resulting from smoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>inhalation is a traumatic injury under Section 32.2(f).\u201d The decision continued: \u201cOn the basis of the evidence presented in this case, however, we have concluded that Firefighter Morrow\u2019s smoke inhalation on October 8, 1976, was not a substantial factor in his fatal myocardial infarction on November 20,1976.\u201d Instead, \u201cthe overriding factor in his death was his severe underlying heart disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">On March 3, 1978, claimants submitted a request for formal agency reconsideration of the initial denial. An oral hearing was held in Evansville on May 27, 1978. The hearing was then continued to permit further analysis of the data by medical and chemical experts. On August 15, 1978, the hearing officer issued a decision upholding the denial. The analysis was based upon the definition of \u201csubstantial factor\u201d previously announced by LEAA\u2019s General Counsel. The salient points of the analysis were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-5\">(1) \u201cMr. Morrow was suffering from marked coronary arteriosclerosis before his cardiac arrest on 8 October 1976. The autopsy showed the presence of a previous, healed myocardial infarction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-6\">(2) \u201cThe smoke inhalation which Mr. Morrow suffered at the scene of the fire along with the stress and strain of the event undoubtedly precipitated the acute infarct [of 8 October 1976].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-7\">(3) \u201cIt can be assumed from [the] evidence and from the information contained in the referenced publications, that Mr. Morrow did inhale sufficient carbon monoxide to block off consciousness of his activities following his exit from the fire room, but since he later recovered full consciousness, and no edema was reported by Dr. Sterne at the time of examination in the emergency room ... it can be assumed further that the effects of the carbon monoxide on his body were not sufficient to cause real respiratory problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-8\">(4) \u201cThe behavior of Mr. Morrow following the probable onset of his cardiac arrest \u2014 falling down stairs, loss of memory \u2018for the rest of the day,\u2019 living for an additional six weeks \u2014 suggests that the amount of smoke inhaled was not sufficient to cause real problems on a purely respiratory basis. His symptoms were primarily cardiac with chest pain and collapse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-10\">(5) \u201c[Although Mr. Morrow probably inhaled enough carbon monoxide to have blocked out his memory of events following his departure from the bedroom in which the fire was located, and to have caused cardiac irregularities which contributed to the onset of cardiac arrest, the actual cause of death was the chronic, progressive, cardiovascular disease. Smoke inhalation effects were secondary and minor in comparison with the damage offered by the underlying, chronic disorder and did not, therefore, promote a \u2018traumatic injury\u2019 in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">The hearing officer\u2019s conclusion may be restated as follows. Since the smoke inhalation was not by itself sufficient to kill the fireman, nor did it contribute to the fireman\u2019s death to as great a degree as the pre-existing heart disease, it cannot be deemed to have been a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the fireman\u2019s death. Thus, proximate causation has not been established. Benefits cannot be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">On September 6,1978, claimants appealed the decision of the hearing officer to the LEAA Administrator. On January 3, 1979, the Administrator adopted the hearing officer\u2019s decision as the final agency action. Claimants filed their petition in this court on September 17, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">This court has held that it has limited authority in reviewing administrative decisions. Generally, such review is limited to determining (1) whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory and implementing regulations; (2) whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the Government officials involved; and (3) whether there was substantial evidence supporting the decision. <em>See, e. g., Urbina v. United States, </em>209 Ct.Cl. 192, 197, 530 F.2d 1387, 1389-1390 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>Claimants first allege a want of substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s determination that smoke inhalation was <em>not </em>a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in Morrow\u2019s death. The allegation is baseless. The agency received extensive lay and scientific evidence and solicited several expert evaluations. Claimants had complete discretion to enter relevant materials. The resulting record thoroughly supports the agency\u2019s position.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Claimants next allege that the Administrator has failed to comply with the regulatory requirement that \u201cany reasonable doubt arising from the circumstances of the officer\u2019s death [be resolved] in favor of payment of the death benefit.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4 (1980). The allegation, relating to the agency\u2019s finding upon the issue of proximate causation, is again without foundation. There is no <em>reasonable </em>doubt to the effect that smoke inhalation might have been a substantial factor in Morrow\u2019s death six weeks hence. The obvious and overwhelming cause of death was heart disease \u2014pre-existing, prolonged, and degenerative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">All other arguments raised by claimants, although not directly addressed in this opinion, have been considered and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">Accordingly, after consideration of the administrative record and the submissions of the parties, with oral argument of counsel, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied. Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">. The exclusion for occupational diseases should apparently be read as limiting the entire first clause of the regulation, rather than just the immediately antecedent clause thereof. <em>See Smykowski v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl., 647 F.2d 1103 at 1104 n.2(1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">. The House Judiciary Committee Reports on H.R. 365 (firefighters) and H.R. 366 (public safety officers) noted the Committee\u2019s intent that the \u201cdirect and proximate result\u201d requirement cover \u201cthose cases where the personal injury is a substantial factor in bringing about the officer\u2019s death.\u201d H.R.Reps.Nos.94-1031 and 94-1032, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 4 and 5, respectively (1976); <em>accord, </em>42 Fed.Reg. 23260 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">The \u201cCommentary!\u2019 indicates: \u201cIn applying terms such as \u2018direct and proximate result\u2019 or \u2018line of duty,\u2019 or in determining proof of relationship, the applicable State law will be considered, but will not be determinative. LEAA seeks to assure that eligibility will be determined by a uniform set of rules, regardless of where in the country the officer died or his beneficiaries reside. LEAA believes that the establishment of uniform rules and precedents best manifests congressional intent.\u201d 42 Fed. Reg. 23260 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1177-15\">. The \u201cCommentary\u201d further indicates: \u201cPrior to making this determination, LEAA will submit the claim file to a forensic pathologist for review. If appropriate, the opinions of other pathologists or cardiologists will be solicited.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 23260 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">. We make no holding as to the propriety of LEAA General Counsel\u2019s particular construction of the term \u201csubstantial factor\u201d \u2014 which strikes us as somewhat cramped \u2014 since we do not believe that claimants herein can prevail under any plausible construction of the term. <em>See generally Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1179-23\">. Claimants have also made various constitutional allegations.
