No. 94-430, 90 Stat. 1346 (1976), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3796-3796c (Supp. Ill 1979) (\u201cPSOBA\u201d). The cause now comes before the court on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. Claimants\u2019 decedent died from a heart attack suffered shortly after engaging in a physical struggle in the line of duty. The crucial issue is whether these circumstances constitute a compensa-ble event under PSOBA. We hold that they do not and, therefore, are unable to award the contested death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">PSOBA provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cIn any case in which the Administration [LEAA] determines, under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, that a public safety officer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Administration shall pay a benefit of $50,000 ... one-half to the surviving ... children of such officer in equal shares and one-half to the surviving spouse....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a)(2) (Supp. Ill 1979); <em>accord, </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.3 (1980). The implementing regulations state that, \u201c \u2018Personal injury\u2019 means any traumatic injury, as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such an injury, but not occupational diseases.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(e) (1980). The regulations further provide: \u201c \u2018Occupational disease\u2019 means a disease which routinely constitutes a special hazard in, or is commonly regarded as a concomitant of the officer\u2019s occupation.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(g) (1980). \u201c \u2018Traumatic injury\u2019 means a wound or other condition of the body caused by external force, including injuries inflicted by bullets, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other physical blows, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious diseases, radiation, and bacteria, but excluding stress and strain.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(f) (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-16\">LEAA accompanied its promulgation of these regulations with a \u201cCommentary\u201d in the Federal Register to the effect that deaths resulting from heart disorders, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cchronic, congenital, or progressive cardiac and pulmonary diseases,\u201d would not be covered by PSOBA \u201cunless a traumatic injury was a substantial factor in the death.\u201d (The \u201cCommentary\u201d does not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.) Such disorders, in addition to being highly stress-related, are considered to fall within the exclusion in the implementing regulations for occupational diseases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statement indicates that, \u201cWhere, for instance, LEAA determines the cause of death to be myocardial infarction resulting from a coronary thrombosis, no benefit will be paid unless the claimant can demonstrate a substantial causal connection between a traumatic injury and the thrombosis.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 23260 (1977); <em>accord, </em>42 Fed.Reg. 23254 (1977) (\u201cSupplementary Information\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">The decedent, Hubert J. Smykowski, was a police officer in Garfield Heights, Ohio. On October 5, 1976, while on duty, he responded to a call for assistance from fellow officers who were in pursuit of two suspects. When Smykowski arrived at the scene, one of the suspects had been captured and the other was known to be hiding in a nearby house. Smykowski and two other policemen entered the house and found the suspect hiding in a closet off a narrow hallway. Smykowski and one of the officers then struggled with the suspect to pull him from his hiding place and lock him in handcuffs. The struggle lasted some two to three minutes and spilled from the hallway into an adjoining bedroom. Shortly after the struggle ended, Smykowski collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, where he was soon pronounced dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The report of autopsy disclosed no external or internal evidence of injury. The coroner\u2019s verdict was that \u201cdeath in this case was the end result of Coronary Sclerotic Hypertensive Heart Disease with Acute and Healed Myocardial Infarcts, due to stress during and following the altercation incident to the arrest of the suspect.... \u201d This determination is reflected in other medical evidence which also appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Claimants thereafter filed for PSOBA benefits. On June 13, 1977, LEAA issued an initial determination of ineligibility. Claimant then requested formal agency reconsideration and the opportunity for an oral hearing before a hearing officer, who ultimately decided that the initial determination of ineligibility should be reversed. The Administrator, upon his own motion, reviewed the award made by the hearing officer and concluded that the initial denial should be reinstated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">The Administrator reasoned that \u201cOfficer Smykowski\u2019s death was not the direct and proximate result of a personal injury as defined in implementing regulations 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(e) and (f) governing the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefit Act....\u201d The Administrator\u2019s decision continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-10\">Deaths resulting from chronic, congenital, progressive cardiac or pulmonary diseases are not covered by the Act unless a traumatic injury was a substantial factor in the death. A traumatic injury was not a substantial factor in the death of Officer Smykowski. The stress and strain incident to a struggle was not a traumatic injury as defined by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">The Administrator\u2019s decision was dated January 19, 1979. Claimants filed in this court on August 20, 1979.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">Claimants do not take issue with the agency\u2019s position excluding stress, strain, and heart disorders from the coverage of the Act, exclusions which, in any event, are amply justified by the statutory language, legislative history,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and medical statistics.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number><em>See </em>42 Fed.Reg. 23260 (1977); <em>Udall v. Tall-man, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1964); <em>Harold v. United States, </em>225 Ct.Cl. -, -, 634 F.2d 547, 549 (1980). Their argument, instead, is that the Administrator overlooked a crucial factor in arriving at his decision. They essentially contend that the physical struggle in which Officer Smykowski engaged just pri- or to his death should itself be deemed to be a compensable \u201ctraumatic injury\u201d under the regulations. We have no doubt that physical struggle involves something qualitatively different from mere stress and strain. We also agree that physical struggle is categorizable as a traumatic event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">Regardless, we cannot accept the ultimate step in claimants\u2019 chain of reasoning, <em>viz., </em>that physical struggle represents a form of traumatic injury. To our minds, the words \u201cstruggle\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d convey totally different notions. Our view is consistent with the definition in the regulations, providing that, \u201c[tjraumatic injury means a wound or other condition of the body . ... \u201d <em>See supra </em>at 1104. Properly speaking, a struggle cannot be deemed to be either of these. At most, a physical struggle can serve as the occasion for the sustaining of injuries. If proven, these injuries could authorize an award of benefits under PSOBA. In the instant case, however, the Administrator found that no injury had been suffered. This finding is supported by substantial evidence and therefore will not be disturbed by this court. <em>See, e. g., Power v. United States, </em>209 Ct.Cl. 126, 129-130, 531 F.2d 505, 507 (1976). Thus, no basis for recovery under the regulations \u2014 or statute \u2014 has been demonstrated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">The public policy questions whether, and under what circumstances, heart attack deaths in the line of duty should be made compensable under PSOBA involve technical and fiscal judgments best left to Congress and the agency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We would welcome legislation in which Congress addresses with specificity the applicability of PSOBA to heart ailment situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-14\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-15\">All other arguments raised by claimants, although not directly addressed in this opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>ion, have been considered and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">Accordingly, after consideration of the administrative record and the submissions of the parties, with oral argument of counsel, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied. Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">.

The exclusion should apparently be read as modifying the entire first clause of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(e) (1980), rather than just the immediately antecedent clause of the regulation. See <em>supra </em>at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1180-18\">. The \u201cCommentary\u201d continues: \u201cSimilarly, where an officer suffering from heart disease, such as arteriosclerosis, has sustained a traumatic injury and died of a \u2018heart attack,\u2019 a benefit will be paid only if the injury is determined to be a substantial factor in the officer\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-19\">The issue of proximate causation under PSO-BA is addressed more fully in <em>Morrow v.
