Her five-month old Buick Electra left Suitland Parkway in the District of Columbia and careened across a grassy field until it collided with a tree. The accident left Mrs. Hall a quadriplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-19\">Mrs. Hall and her husband, invoking federal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship, commenced this damage action against the manufacturer, General Motors Corporation (\u201cGM\u201d), and the dealer, Larry Buick, Inc. Prior to trial, the plaintiffs entered into a settlement with the dealer, pursuant to which Mrs. Hall received $700,-000, and her husband, $50,000. In accordance with the settlement, plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Larry Buick and Larry Buick's cross-claim against GM were dismissed with prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-20\">A bifurcated jury trial was held at which United States District Judge June L. Green presided. On May 2, 1979, the jury returned a verdict against GM on the issue of liability. On May 31, the jury awarded damages in the amount of $5 million for Mrs. Hall, and $1.5 million for her husband. On GM\u2019s motion, Judge Green ordered and the plaintiffs accepted a remittitur reducing Mr. Hall\u2019s award (for loss of consortium) to $500,000. Judge Green denied GM\u2019s motion to reduce the damage awards by 50% because of the Halls\u2019 pre-trial settlement with the co-defendant Larry Buick, Inc. She did, however, reduce the awards by the amounts the Halls had received pursuant to the settlement. The total judgment, as adjusted, is therefore $4.75 million, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>$4.3 million for Georgia Hall and $450,000 for her husband.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">In this appeal, GM seeks reversal or modification of the District Court\u2019s judgment on three principal grounds. First, GM asserts that the charge erroneously permitted the jury to find liability based on an unidentified defect in the Buick. The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence identified only the drive shaft as defective, GM points out. Since plaintiffs did not attempt to prove a causative defect in any part of the vehicle other than the drive shaft, GM claims entitlement to an instruction tying liability to a finding that the drive shaft was defective. Second, GM challenges several rulings made in the course of trial. Third, GM maintains that the Halls\u2019 settlement with the co-defendant Larry Buick, Inc., requires reduction of the judgment against GM by 50%.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We conclude that Judge Green, adhering to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Stewart v. Ford Motor Co., </em>553 F.2d 130 (D.C.Cir.1977), properly instructed the jury; that her rulings at trial yielded no reversible error; and that she properly denied GM\u2019s motion for a 50% reduction in the judgment. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">On September 29, 1975, in full daylight, Georgia Hall was driving alone in her 1975 Buick, purchased some five months earlier. She was in the right-hand, eastbound lane on Suitland Parkway, maintaining a speed of 40-45 miles per hour along the dry, smooth road. As GM described the accident, the car veered to the right, crossed the shoulder into a field of grass, then traveled across an elevated exit-entrance ramp into a wooded area where it hit a tree that stood over 700 feet from the road. When the ear crossed the ramp, Mrs. Hall was thrown from behind the wheel. Witnesses found her lying across the front seat with her foot \u201chooked up\u201d between the accelerator and the brake pedal. She had suffered a broken neck, resulting in permanent quadriplegia.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Mrs. Hall\u2019s testimony indicated that, at the time of the accident, she was a healthy woman, who did not drink or take drugs. She was an experienced driver and, when the fateful episode occurred, she was traveling on a familiar road maintaining, according to her testimony, a moderate speed. She said she heard a loud explosion while the car was on the road, followed by vibrations and popping. As the car surged off the road, she claimed that she mashed continuously on the brakes but the car would not stop. She had lost control.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">The Halls presented evidence of their multiple complaints about the car, complaints they reported repeatedly to the dealer, Larry Buick, Inc. Surging, vibrations, and other malfunctions existed, the Halls said, from the time Mrs. Hall purchased the ear until the time of the accident. Despite inspections and servicing by the dealer, no correction was accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">The car\u2019s drive shaft system was found after the accident to have been destroyed. At trial, the Halls attempted to show that a defect in the shaft had caused the accident. GM, on the other hand, maintained that the destroyed drive shaft was the result of the accident, not its cause. The cause, GM suggested, was Mrs. Hall\u2019s momentary inattention to the road, followed by panic, which led her to apply the accelerator instead of the brake.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">Expert testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs accounted for the accident roughly as follows. A defective joint in the drive shaft exploded on the highway, causing the rear of the shaft, with part of the joint still attached, to drop to the road, still spinning rapidly. The force of the contact with the road produced a forward reaction, upward and to the right, which pushed the drive shaft tube into the rear of the transmission housing with sufficient force to raise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>car off its suspension and drive it from the road. This testimony also attributed the intermittent vibrations, about which the Halls had complained prior to the accident, to defects in the rear portion of the drive shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">GM, contrarily, presented evidence to support its contention that the drive shaft did not disintegrate until the car smashed into the ground after traversing the elevated exit-entrance ramp. In particular, GM showed that the seventeen separate parts of the shaft found after the accident were all in the immediate vicinity of the area where the violent ground impact had occurred. GM further pointed out that the police accident investigator, called to the scene immediately after the accident, found no scratches or stains on the road that could be associated with the Halls\u2019 theory of the accident. In addition, GM presented a wealth of expert testimony supporting its position that Mrs. Hall\u2019s Buick was not defective in any material respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">II. <em>The </em>Stewart <em>Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">Judge Green gave the following instruction to the jury regarding GM\u2019s liability:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">[Pjlaintiffs need not prove a specific defect [in the Buick].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">It is sufficient if you find from the evidence that the motor vehicle in question went out of control causing the accident as a result of some mechanical failure due to an obvious or hidden defect in the car which existed at the time that it left General Motors Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In <em>Stewart v. Ford Motor Co., </em>553 F.2d 130, 136, 141 (D.C.Cir.1977), based on District of Columbia precedent, we approved this form of instruction for use in motor vehicle accident product liability cases. GM asserts that the state of the evidence in this case warranted an instruction less generous to the plaintiffs. The jury should have been instructed to return a verdict for the Halls, GM contends, only if it found that \u201csome unreasonably dangerous defect in the drive shaft assembly\u201d caused the accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that Judge Green properly patterned her instruction on the <em>Stewart </em>model.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">This court held in <em>Stewart </em>that a plaintiff established her case by presenting (1) evidence tending to negate causes for the accident other than a defect in the car, and (2) evidence tending to show that the defendant-manufacturer introduced into the car whatever defect might have existed. <em>Id. </em>at 137. The court stated explicitly that the quantum of evidence required for these showings is not great. Further, the Stewart opinion indicated that proof that the product was new would warrant a jury inference that a defect, if there was one, existed at the time the product entered the stream of commerce. In addition, <em>Stewart </em>observed that a plaintiff would be called upon to negate only the most obvious causes, such as intoxication or excessive speed, unless the defendant offered specific accounts of how the accident might have happened in the absence of a defect in the automobile. <em>Id. </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">The Halls brought their case comfortably within the <em>Stewart </em>frame. Mrs. Hall testified that, prior to the accident, her physical condition was excellent. She did not drink, suffer from diabetes, sickle cell anemia, epilepsy, or any other disease that could have caused dizziness or blackout spells. She did not have any mental disorders or high blood pressure and did not use any drugs. She further testified that she was an experienced driver (for fourteen years she had been a part-time cab driver), that she was familiar with the area in which the accident occurred (it was about a mile from her home), and that her speed at the time she heard an explosion had been 40-45 miles per hour.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">Mrs. Hall had purchased her Buick five months prior to the accident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From the start, the Halls experienced difficulties with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the vehicle and sought correction from the seller, GM dealer Larry Buick, Inc. On several occasions following the purchase, the Halls complained to the dealer that the engine would miss, vibrate, hesitate upon acceleration, backfire, and run hot; the brakes would squeal; the idle was rough; sometimes the ear would pull to the right, sometimes it would \u201cjust take off.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">GM did not vigorously contest these facts. It did, however, strenuously challenge the testimony of experts called by the Halls to show that a drive shaft defect caused the accident. GM put on a massive array of technical evidence to convince the jury that the accident was not caused by any defect in Mrs. Hall\u2019s Buick. Most of this evidence was designed to rebut the plaintiffs\u2019 proof concerning the drive shaft. In addition, GM sought to eliminate other possible manufacturer-related causes of the accident. Experts called by GM stated and explained their opinion that the drive shaft did not fail and that no other defects in Mrs. Hall\u2019s Buick could have occasioned the accident. Moreover, on cross-examination, both of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts conceded that they had identified no specific defect in the car, other than the drive shaft. In particular, they acknowledged that, as far as they could determine, there was no malfunction in the automobile\u2019s steering, acceleration, or braking systems.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">GM urges that its evidentiary presentation and the concessions it elicited from plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses eliminated every possible cause of the accident apart from a defect in the drive shaft and Mrs. Hall\u2019s own negligence. Accordingly, GM maintains, Judge Green\u2019s instructions should have riveted the jury\u2019s attention to the drive shaft as the sole legally permissible basis for a finding of manufacturer\u2019s liability in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">We believe the showing GM made did not warrant displacement of the <em>Stewart </em>instruction. The Halls sought to present the jury with alternative arguments: (1) a \u201cspecific theory\u201d that an identifiable automobile part had failed, causing the accident; and (2) a \u201cgeneral theory\u201d that <em>some </em>unpinpointed defect introduced into the automobile by the manufacturer was responsible for the accident. <em>Stewart </em>held that the effort to prove a specific defect does not foreclose submission of the case to the jury on a general theory. If an attempt to pinpoint a defect tied plaintiffs to a specific theory, personal injury claimants would be deterred from introducing evidence beyond proof tending to show absence of fault on the part of the accident victim and unexplained malfunctioning of the vehicle. 553 F.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">In this case, in addition to post-accident expert testimony concerning the drive shaft, Mrs. Hall presented substantial evidence of numerous unresolved problems she had experienced with her Buick prior to the accident. She could not detect the source of the problems, nor had GM\u2019s dealer eliminated them when Mrs. Hall complained and brought in the car for post-purchase inspections. We cannot say that GM\u2019s evidence or its cross-examination of witnesses for the Halls foreclosed the jury from finding that Mrs. Hall\u2019s Buick was defective when she purchased it, was never put in proper repair despite Mrs. Hall\u2019s repeated efforts to secure dealer correction, and went out of control as a result of some mechanical failure, apart from the drive shaft, attributable to GM.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">III. <em>Trial Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">GM complains that Judge Green\u2019s control of the trial unreasonably inhibited its de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>fense. She committed reversible error, GM asserts, in (1) rejecting test evidence proffered by GM, (2) denying GM the right to counter \u201csurprise evidence\u201d a witness for the plaintiffs supplied for the first time on rebuttal, (3) providing the jurors with a copy of a deposition favorable to plaintiffs while withholding from them portions of other depositions favorable to GM, and (4) truncating GM\u2019s cross-examination of one of plaintiffs\u2019 two expert witnesses. We have reviewed GM\u2019s objections and are unable to conclude that \u201canything done or omitted\u201d by the trial court was \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\n<em>Test Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In an attempt to pinpoint a specific defect in Georgia Hall\u2019s Buick, the plaintiffs sought to establish that the drive shaft broke off at the constant velocity joint,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> causing the car to surge upward and to the right, careening out of control off the road. As part of its massive effort to disprove this theory, GM conducted a series of tests. In the first test GM ran, a \u2022 1975 Buick Electra\u2019s drive shaft was taped, not bolted, at the rear; it was then pushed by another car until it attained a speed of 50 miles per hour, at which point the engine speed was correspondingly increased and the transmission was shifted into \u201cdrive.\u201d Supporting GM\u2019s position, the shaft eventually dropped to the road, but there was no upward or rightward pull.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">At a pre-trial session, Judge Green rejected this test on the ground that it did not depict a situation sufficiently comparable to that of Mrs. Hall\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Over plaintiffs\u2019 objection, however, and although the trial was to start in two weeks time, Judge Green permitted GM to pursue further testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">GM next conducted tests with bolted rather than taped rear flange yokes. The yokes were deliberately and increasingly weakened with the aim of determining what would happen when a defective rear flange yoke breaks and the drive shaft then drops to the ground. This aim was not achieved because the shaft never came apart. Judge Green permitted GM to introduce expert testimony explaining this testing. Still photographs were admitted as well, but not motion pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">GM also sought to introduce testimony that a car used in the experiments, equipped with the most defective yoke, withstood a trip from Michigan to Washington, D.C., without incident. Plaintiffs\u2019 representative, who had attended the earlier testing, all of it occurring in Michigan, had returned to Washington, D.C., to prepare for trial before the road test occurred. Judge Green excluded evidence concerning this test on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that time for GM\u2019s experiments had run out.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Judge Green\u2019s central concern, in ruling on GM\u2019s tests, was to keep from the jury experiments conducted under conditions not sufficiently similar to the circumstances surrounding the accident. A test is not admissible unless the test conditions are \u201cso nearly the same in substantial particulars [as those involved in the episode in litigation] as to afford a fair comparison in respect to the particular issue to which the test is directed.\u201d <em>Illinois Central Gulf R. R. v. Ishee, </em>317 So.2d 923, 926 (Miss.1975), <em>quoted with approval in Barnes v. General Motors Corp., </em>547 F.2d 275, 277 (5th Cir. 1977). The trial judge has broad leeway in making this determination; her ruling will not be upset unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Derr v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>404 F.2d 634, 639 (10th Cir. 1968). We cannot say that Judge Green\u2019s test evidence rulings exceeded the latitude appropriately accorded trial courts in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Judge Green excluded GM\u2019s first prt\u00edf-fered test for insufficient comparability: the drive shaft was taped, not bolted, at the rear; the test car was pushed, not driven, to a speed of 50 miles per hour. We find no abuse of discretion in her determination. <em>Cf. Collins v. B. F. Goodrich &amp; Co., </em>558 F.2d 908 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>Weaver v. Ford Motor Co., </em>382 F.Supp. 1068 (E.D.Pa.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As to the second test series, Judge Green acceded to GM\u2019s proffer, except for the film. We see no clear error in her exclusion of motion pictures that \u201c[did] not portray original facts in controversy.\u201d <em>See </em>McCormick, Law of Evidence \u00a7 214, at 534 (2d ed. 1972). Nor do we see error in Judge Green\u2019s exclusion of the test drive from Michigan to Washington, D.C., a test of limited probative value conducted at the eleventh hour when plaintiffs\u2019 representative was no longer in attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>\u201cSurprise\u201d Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">GM claims that a key issue at trial was whether the <em>engine </em>in Mrs. Hall\u2019s Buick was still running when the car crashed into a tree. GM presented substantial evidence in support of its contention that the engine was on. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Vanderhoof testified on rebuttal that an exhibit used by GM to demonstrate that the engine was running (the harmonic balancer removed from Mrs. Hall\u2019s car) had been altered after GM purchased the wreck from the Halls. GM, claiming surprise, sought to call every person who had touched the car or had custody of the exhibit from the time of the accident to the time of trial to prove that there had been no alteration. Judge Green refused to allow further testimony. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t know of any provision that permits a rebuttal of a rebuttal.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">If Judge Green intended her ruling to be an exercise of discretion, her remark failed to convey that intention. GM correctly points out that surrebuttal evidence is permitted in appropriate circumstances. <em>See United States v. Compania Cubana de Aviacion, S. A., </em>224 F.2d 811, 822 (5th Cir. 1955). We agree that the ruling here should not have been made \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d Nonetheless, we believe that no substantial right of GM was affected by exclusion of the surrebuttal testimony GM proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">GM sought to recall \u201ceverybody that had possession of [Mrs. Hall\u2019s] car.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The proffered parade of witnesses would have been an extremely time-consuming presentation of cumulative testimony. Abundant evidence already in the record supported GM\u2019s position that the engine was running even after the calamitous collision with the tree, including eyewitness testimony and detailed explanations by GM\u2019s experts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, GM\u2019s counsel failed to make a specific offer of proof clarifying which witnesses it proposed to call and the anticipated content of their testimony. In light of these factors, we do not share GM\u2019s assessment of the significance of Judge Green\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">\n<em>Jury Access to Depositions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">During its deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court requesting \u201cDepositions \u2014 Ms. Hall, Officer Wing, Ms. Williams, Mr. Porter.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Judge Green furnished the jury with Mr. Porter\u2019s deposition. She declined to send in the others. We find GM\u2019s objection to her ruling merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">Mr. Porter was an eyewitness to the accident. He died prior to trial. Without objection, counsel for plaintiffs read into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>record his entire deposition except for the last few sentences.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The other witnesses gave live testimony. Snippets of Officer Wing\u2019s deposition were used by GM first to refresh his recollection, then to rehabilitate him following cross-examination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A sliver of Ms. Williams\u2019 testimony was used by GM for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A few lines at page 68 of Mrs. Hall\u2019s deposition were read by counsel for GM during the cross-examination of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness, William Wall.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Another few lines, from page 59 of Mrs. Hall\u2019s deposition, were read into the record by GM\u2019s counsel just before the defense rested.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Counsel for plaintiffs objected to furnishing the jury with isolated portions, \u201cblurbs\u201d from lengthy depositions, unaccompanied by related live testimony against which the jury could measure the lines snipped from the pre-trial statements.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Judge Green agreed that supplying the jury with a few lines of a deposition would not be fair.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Her judgment seems to us unassailable.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The difference between a deposition of a dead witness read in full in lieu of live testimony and extracted portions of a deposition used to impeach, refresh recollection, or rehabilitate is apparent. The danger of acceding to a request that a few lines from a deposition read at trial go to the jury room is well illustrated in the transcript before us. One example suffices. To impeach Ms. Williams, GM read to her a brief portion of her pre-trial statement in which she described a conversation with Mrs. Hall at the hospital. An answer she gave favored GM\u2019s version of the accident. After the deposition extract was read to the jury, Ms. Williams was asked: \u201cYou gave those answers to those questions, did you not?\u201d Ms. Williams replied: \u201cYes, that was a mistake.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">GM took the position that \u201cthe jury should be provided with those portions of each of the requested depositions that had been read into evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Counsel for GM did not request that Judge Green respond to the jury\u2019s note by sending them, together with extracts from the depositions, related portions of the transcript amplifying, or inconsistent with, the deposition extracts. If such a request had been made and denied, we would be presented with a different question.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">\n<em>Qualifications and Cross-Examination of Plaintiffs\u2019 Expert Vanderhoof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axf\">Plaintiffs\u2019 witness, Mr. Vanderhoof, was offered and accepted as an expert in auto mechanics and accident reconstruction.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> GM contends that Mr. Vanderhoof possessed requisite qualifications only in the field of auto mechanics. GM challenges Judge Green\u2019s initial ruling, her adherence to it, and, most vigorously, her refusal to permit GM to cross-examine Vanderhoof on his purported expertise as an \u201caccident re-constructionist.\u201d We believe Judge Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>committed no reversible error when she accepted Vanderhoof as an expert<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and later adhered to that ruling on the ground that objection made after completion of Vander-hoof\u2019s direct examination came too late. Nor did she abuse her discretion to control the order of evidentiary presentation when she refused to permit GM to use cross-examination as a substitute for the voir dire inquiry GM failed to pursue.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Even if we could credit GM\u2019s contention that its counsel was caught unaware or tricked when plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sought and obtained the initial ruling, we would be left without a satisfactory explanation for GM\u2019s failure to raise the point during the direct examination of Vanderhoof.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It was not until the next day, after its cross-examination was well under way, that GM first apprised Judge Green that it objected to treatment of Vanderhoof as an accident reconstruction expert.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At that point Judge Green ruled that GM was free to cross-examine Vanderhoof on the bases for opinions he ventured on direct, but not on his qualifications as an expert.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> GM has supplied no persuasive ground for overturning that determination.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 922 (Chadbourn Rev.1970); <em>Far-ris v. Delta Air Lines, </em>456 F.2d 236, 237 n.l (5th Cir. 1972) (once witness is offered and accepted as an expert, impeachment through cross-examination as to basic qualifications is inappropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The long trial in this action required an attentive, sustained effort by the participants. It is impossible, in such a venture, for the human actors in it to play out their roles free from flaw. For this reason, Fed. R.Civ.P. 61 instructs judges to \u201cdisregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d Operating under a more stringent standard, courts \u201cwould become Penelopes, forever engaged in unravelling the webs they wove.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Because we find no ruling in this case \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice,\u201d we reject GM\u2019s plea that we vacate the judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">IV. <em>The Co-Defendant\u2019s Settlement</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1d\">On the eve of the trial, the Halls\u2019 claims against the dealer, Larry Buick, Inc., were dismissed with prejudice, as was Larry Buick\u2019s indemnification cross-claim against GM. The dismissals followed Buick\u2019s pretrial settlement with the Halls. GM asserts that the settlement deprived it of the right to seek pro rata contribution it otherwise would have had against Buick. To compensate for the alleged loss of a right to seek contribution, GM contends that the judgment should be pared down by half (from $5.5 million to $2.75 million). Judge Green offset the amount of the settlement ($750,-000), but refused to reduce the judgment further.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">We conclude that GM received the appropriate credit in this action and is not entitled to more. First, it is not at all clear that the settlement stripped GM of a right to contribution it otherwise would have had. Second, no District of Columbia case recognizes a right to pro rata (50%) reduction of a plaintiff\u2019s judgment against a nonsettling defendant when the settling defendant\u2019s liability <em>vei non </em>has not been determined. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Finally, if GM wished to safeguard any legitimate claim it might have to lessen the burden of a plaintiffs\u2019 verdict, a cross-claim against Larry Buick was available to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">GM assumes that the settlement left it without recourse to an independent action for contribution against Larry Buick. We believe that question remains open. Our own decisions are inconclusive,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and GM has not called to our attention, nor have we found, any answer in decisions of the District of Columbia courts. We decline to forecast the ruling that might be made were GM to sue Larry Buick for contribution. In view of our decision in <em>Williams v. Steuart Motor Co., </em>494 F.2d 1074, 1082-84 (D.C.Cir.1974), we have reason to doubt whether GM would wish to pursue such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In <em>Williams v. Steuart Motor Co., </em>this court held that when a car manufacturer and dealer are both found liable for an accident caused by a defect in the car, and the charge against the dealer is negligent failure to detect and repair the defect, the manufacturer ordinarily must indemnify the dealer. The dealer\u2019s right to indemnification against the manufacturer is hardly consistent with a right in the manufacturer to seek contribution from the dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Turning to the relevant District of Columbia case law on pro rata reduction of a damage award, we find brackets around the case GM portrays this one to be. If a trier of fact has found the settling defendant liable, pro rata (50%) reduction may be ordered. <em>Martello v. Hawley, </em>300 F.2d 721, 724 (D.C.Cir.1962). If a trier of fact has exonerated the settling defendant, only pro tanto (the amount of the settlement) reduction is available. <em>Snowden v. D.C. Transit System, </em>454 F.2d 1047 (D.C.Cir.1971). Larry Buick, the settling defendant here, was neither found liable nor exonerated. Again, we decline to proceed beyond the point where District of Columbia precedent leaves off, for GM had a clear opportunity to settle the issue of Larry Buick\u2019s liability. It might have filed a cross-claim against Buick.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">GM correctly points to the general rule that cross-claims are permissive, not compulsory. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(g). But in this case, GM was on the receiving end of a cross-claim. Larry Buick, Inc., when it answered the Halls\u2019 complaint, also asserted a cross-claim against GM. The cross-claim stated that if the Halls should succeed in establishing that the vehicle was defective, then Larry Buick avers that the car was defective when obtained from GM. The defective condition, Buick contended, would constitute a breach of GM\u2019s warranty to Buick. GM generally denied the allegations contained in Buick\u2019s cross-claim, but asserted no claim on its part against Buick.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">We do not hold that GM was compelled to meet dealer Buick\u2019s cross-claim with one of its own. If matured claims were involved, an answering cross-claim might well be compulsory.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> But claims for contribution and indemnity contingent upon the outcome of another claim have not been placed in the compulsory category.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus GM\u2019s decision not to cross-claim against Buick in this action does not preclude GM from pursuing Buick in a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>We do hold, however, that in view of the multiple uncertainties clouding GM\u2019s alleged contribution right, the Halls\u2019 judgment should not be altered. GM has offered us no reason to believe that, had there been no settlement between Larry Buick and the Halls, part of the compensation awarded the Halls would have come out of dealer Buick\u2019s pocket. <em>See Williams v. Ste-uart Motor Co., supra. </em>Nor is it clear that the settlement between the Halls and Buick deprives GM of any genuine contribution claim it may have against Buick. <em>See </em>note 36 <em>supra. </em>GM had an opportunity to cross-claim and passed it by. GM is therefore not comfortably situated to urge that we chart new law regarding reduction of judgments when an alleged joint tort-feasor settles. <em>See </em>p. 184 <em>supra. </em>In summary, GM presents no convincing justification for withholding from the Halls full compensation for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-13\">.
