App.P. 34(a); Tenth Circuit R. 10(e). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-28\">Plaintiff, a prisoner at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>filed a pro se complaint charging the United States Parole Commission with violating his civil rights by wrongfully denying his application for parole. Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the Commission\u2019s parole procedures denied him due process. This claim is cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Candelaria v. Griffin, </em>641 F.2d 868 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>Schuemann v. Colorado State Board of Adult Parole, </em>624 F.2d 172, 173 n.l (10th Cir. 1980); <em>Williams v. Ward, </em>556 F.2d 1143, 1150-51 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>434 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 469, 54 L.Ed.2d 323 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Plaintiff also seeks a mandatory injunction ordering the Commission to parole him. This claim is properly heard pursuant to our habeas corpus jurisdiction, since its object is release from confinement. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>Schuemann v. Colorado State Board of Adult Parole, </em>624 F.2d 172, 173 n.l (10th Cir. 1980). Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Plaintiff presents six grounds in support of his claim for relief. We affirm summarily the district court\u2019s dismissal of five of these grounds. Plaintiff\u2019s challenges to the Commission\u2019s reliance on \u201csalient factor scores\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20), record keeping (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(f)), denial of appeal (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4215), notice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(b)), and failure to set a presumptive parole date (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.12(b)) are without legal merit. Even assuming, without deciding, that plaintiff has a liberty interest in his parole,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the procedures which he complains of accorded him that minimal due process required in such a parole proceeding. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 155 (1979). \u201c[Ljiberty interests can be created by rules,\u201d <em>Walker v. Hughes, </em>558 F.2d 1247, 1255 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>see Gurule v. Wilson, </em>635 F.2d 782, 785 (10th Cir. 1980), but the record reveals no violation of statutory and administrative directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">We comment on plaintiff\u2019s sixth challenge because it is a matter of first impression before us. Plaintiff claims that the Commission\u2019s designation of his case as an \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d case prejudiced his parole application and that he deserved advance notice of this designation and an opportunity to challenge it. The procedure for and purpose of designating a case as \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d is set out at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.17. Even assuming that plaintiff has a liberty interest in his parole, the designation of his case as \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d did not violate his right to due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">Designation of a case as original jurisdiction does not reflect a judgment by the Board as to the merits of an inmate\u2019s application for parole. The referral has the sole effect of bringing the case before the National Directors of the Board of Parole for the initial parole release decision, whereas in the normal case the authority to make the initial decision is delegated to the hearing examiners. The referral also has the additional effect of providing the inmate with an appeal to the entire Board of Parole, at which time his representative may appear and argue his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">The purpose of the increased voting quorum requirements is not to make parole more difficult to obtain but to protect confidence in the integrity of the Parole Board by assuring that there is a broader consensus among Board members in cases where there is more likely to be public or private pressure to parole or not to parole. 40 Fed.Reg. 5357 (February 5, 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>King v.

Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 155 (1979), the Supreme Court held that the mere possibility of parole does not create a liberty interest. Nebraska\u2019s parole system did create a liberty interest but was considered unique insofar as it <em>required </em>that a prisoner be paroled <em>unless </em>the parole board, upon consideration of four factors, concluded that parole should be deferred. The Ninth Circuit has intimated, without deciding, that the federal parole system does create a liberty interest. <em>Bowles v. Tennant, </em>613 F.2d 776, 778 (9th Cir. 1980). <em>But see Shahid v.
