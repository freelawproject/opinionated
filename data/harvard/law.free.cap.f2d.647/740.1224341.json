The defendant was convicted of assault and of conveying a weapon within the prison. The defendant appeals certain evidentiary rulings regarding the assault charge and raises arguments concerning sufficiency of the evidence and double jeopardy regarding the conveying charge. We reverse both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">On November 18, 1979, John Andrew Greschner and John Henry Logan were inmates at the United States Penitentiary, Marion, Illinois. Greschner was a resident of the control unit. Logan was in the control unit, cutting Greschner\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">At some point while Logan was cutting Greschner\u2019s hair, a fight developed between the two. Greschner swung at Logan. During the fight, Greschner was seen holding a homemade knife in his hand. A correctional officer stopped the fight. Logan was taken to the hospital with multiple stab wounds. Greschner had no wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">At trial, Greschner represented himself and presented a defense of self-defense. Defense witnesses testified that Logan attacked Greschner with a knife and that another inmate gave Greschner a knife, that he then used in self-defense. Gres-chner was convicted on both the assault, 18 U.S.C. 113(f), and conveying, 18 U.S.C. 1792, charges and was sentenced to ten years on each charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">The defendant argues that certain evi-dentiary rulings of the trial court deprived him of the opportunity to present his defense adequately. The defendant attempted to present a theory of self-defense. The law allows such a theory. <em>See generally </em>Strong, <em>The Predicates of Criminal Liability, </em>1980 Wis.L.Rev. 441. In presenting his defense, the defendant sought to prove that Logan had a character trait for violence and that Logan had a motive for attacking the defendant. The trial court excluded evidence on each issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">First, the defendant attempted to present evidence that Logan previously had stabbed another inmate. The government objected on grounds of relevancy. The trial court upheld the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">To determine whether the proffered line of inquiry was relevant to the defendant\u2019s case, we begin by reviewing Fed.R.Evid. 401, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-18\">\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-19\">As the Advisory Committee\u2019s Note indicates, the standard of probability is not stringent. The standard for relevancy is only that the evidence would make the existence of the fact \u201cmore probable.\u201d As Professor McCormick has stated, \u201c[a] brick is not a wall.\u201d Advisory Comm.\u2019s Note, <em>quoting McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 152 at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-20\">In this case, the question becomes whether the victim\u2019s participation in a previous stabbing has \u201cany tendency\u201d to make the existence of the fact in issue \u2014 that he had a violent character \u2014 more probable. We conclude that such evidence does make the existence of that fact more probable. Also, the \u201cviolent character\u201d line of proof is relevant to the defendant\u2019s theory of self-defense in that it makes his version that the victim attacked him \u201cmore probable.\u201d Therefore, the character evidence proffered was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Character evidence, although relevant, generally is not admissible for the purpose of proving that a person acted in conformity with that character. But Fed. R.Evid. 404 creates a specific exception allowing a defendant to offer evidence of a pertinent character trait of a victim. Offering such evidence was precisely what the defendant was trying to do in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The government next argues that, even if the evidence was relevant and admissible under Rule 404, it was still properly excluded because it would have been \u201cdistracting\u201d, cumulative, hearsay, and because the defendant did not lay the proper foundation for his questions. These arguments are virtually frivolous. Since evidence of Logan\u2019s character is relevant to the defendant\u2019s defense, we do not see how it could be \u201cdistracting\u201d any more than any other acceptable defense theory. The government\u2019s argument that such evidence would be cumulative because \u201cmost incarcerated prisoners have committed violent crimes\u201d is totally unsubstantiated. Even if the government could establish that the quoted statement is true, that would not indicate that the evidence in the defendant\u2019s trial was cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The government next argues that the defendant\u2019s attempt to introduce the victim\u2019s character trait of violence through an inmate witness was hearsay. The witness testified that Logan was placed in the control unit \u201cfor a stabbing.\u201d But regardless of whether that particular statement might have been hearsay,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court ruled that the <em>subject matter </em>of the proffered character evidence was irrelevant and directed the defendant, representing himself, to move on to another area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Had the exclusion been based merely on hearsay, which it was not, the defendant would have had the opportunity to reformulate his questions or subpoena other witnesses, if possible, to substantiate the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Finally, the government argues that the defendant failed to lay the proper foundation for the introduction of evidence regarding Logan\u2019s propensity for violence. But as we stated in <em>United States v. Fountain, </em>642 F.2d 1083, at 1087 n.3 and 1088 n.4 (7th Cir. 1981), we decline to elevate procedural formalities to insurmountable barriers, especially where a defendant is not represented by counsel. In this case, where the court clearly ruled the evidence irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>vant, that the defendant may have mis-stepped along the sophisticated procedural path of \u201claying a foundation,\u201d cannot overcome the improper exclusion of the proffered evidence. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence regarding the victim\u2019s character trait for violence was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The trial court also excluded evidence tending to show that Logan had a specific motive for attacking the defendant. The defendant\u2019s theory was that Logan thought that the defendant had spread the word within the prison that Logan was an informer. The government objected, on relevancy grounds, to this evidence. The trial court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The defendant argues that evidence that Logan thought the defendant had labelled Logan an informant would make the defendant\u2019s theory \u201cmore probable\u201d and therefore, the evidence was relevant. We agree. It is beyond reasonable dispute that labelling an inmate an informer presents a very serious liability to the labelled inmate. If an inmate believes that he or she has been labelled an informer, the inmate might seek revenge. Of course, we express no opinion as to whether the defendant\u2019s proof would be persuasive. But it certainly would be a \u201cbrick in his wall.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401, Advisory Comm.\u2019s Note. Therefore, the proffered evidence was relevant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s ruling excluding this motive evidence as irrelevant was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">The excluded evidence related specifically to the defendant\u2019s self-defense theory. The trial court\u2019s improper exclusion of the character and motive evidence was seriously prejudicial to that theory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the improper evidentiary rulings require reversal of the defendant\u2019s assault conviction<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">We now consider the defendant\u2019s argument that his conviction for \u201cconveying\u201d a knife must be reversed. The defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>arguments are very similar to arguments we considered recently in <em>United States v. Fountain, </em>642 F.2d 1083 (7th Cir. 1981), and we are guided by the principles set forth there.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The defendant argues that convictions for both the assault charge and the conveying charge amounted to double jeopardy because both charges punish him for the same action. We reject this argument for the same reasons we rejected it in <em>Fountain, </em>at 1093-1095. First, there is no evidence of legislative intent to punish the crimes other than separately. Second, the elements of an assault charge are different from the elements of a conveying charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Third, in order to avoid double jeopardy, the proof required for conviction must meet the test announced in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). <em>See Albernaz v. United </em>States,-U.S.-,-, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1140, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981). The <em>Blockburger </em>test is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">[WJhere the same act <em>or </em>transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Here, looking to the elements of each crime, <em>see </em>note 7 <em>supra, </em>we see that each crime requires proof of facts the other does not. Under the assault charge, the government must prove that the defendant assaulted the victim and that the assault resulted in serious injury. As will be discussed, assault with a knife, without more, does not necessarily include \u201cconveying\u201d that knife. Therefore, we find that the defendant\u2019s convictions of both assault and conveying do not violate his rights against being placed in double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Second, the defendant argues that his conviction for conveying the knife should be reversed for insufficient evidence. He argues that the evidence did not establish that his possession, use, and surrender of the knife amounted to \u201cconveying\u201d the knife. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">In <em>Fountain, </em>at 1092-1093, we reviewed the case law regarding what \u201cuse\u201d of a weapon amounts to a \u201cconveying\u201d of a weapon. We emphasized that mere possession could not support a conveying conviction; some transportation must occur. We then found that the facts there clearly amounted to substantial transportation. <em>Id. </em>at 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">But the facts in the present case do not demonstrate any significant transportation, aside from the actual possession, use, and surrender of the knife. A close review of the evidence only shows that the defendant used the knife to stab Logan; he then surrendered the knife to prison officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-17\">First, unlike the situation in <em>Fountain, </em>where the evidence clearly showed that one of the defendants \u201cconveyed\u201d the knife to the location of the stabbing, at 1093, here, there was no such evidence. Government witnesses saw the stabbing only after it began; the defense witnesses testified that another inmate gave the knife to the defendant after he had been attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-18\">Second, in <em>Fountain, </em>the evidence strongly showed a \u201cconveyance\u201d during the stabbing by the defendants that went far beyond the actual use. The defendants pursued their victim over a wide area, chasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>him and stabbing him. At one point, a defendant was stabbing the victim, walked away from the victim to threaten correctional officers, then walked back to the victim and continued stabbing him. At 1085-1086. The evidence in the case before us does not show a similar chase scene inconsistent with self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Third, although the defendant did engage in some transportation of the knife in order to surrender it, we decline to hold that such transportation amounted to \u201cconveying\u201d. When correctional officers first broke up the incident, the defendant was told to \u201cback off\u201d from the victim. He did so. The record does not reflect that the defendant was told to drop the knife. Apparently, the defendant stood motionless while the victim was removed. Then the defendant walked approximately ten feet to a waiting correctional officer and surrendered the knife. Given that this transportation was solely to surrender the knife, we conclude that this transportation does not rise to \u201cconveying\u201d a knife within the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Although in many cases a defendant will both \u201cconvey\u201d and use a weapon, there must be some line between the two actions. The line may not be a bright one, but it must exist. We cannot allow a \u201cconveying\u201d charge to be tacked on to every assault charge. There must be independent evidence of the \u201cconveying\u201d beyond the actual possession and use. <em>See generally United States v. Kirkland, </em>637 F.2d 654 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Here, the evidence only showed use of the weapon. The government did not satisfy the requirement for independent evidence of conveyance. Transportation solely for surrender will not meet that requirement. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s conviction for conveying must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s conviction for assault is REVERSED AND REMANDED for a new trial and his conviction for conveying is REVERSED with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-5\">. Although, under certain narrow circumstances, evidence of prior convictions can be used to impeach <em>witnesses, </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609, the general rule is that such evidence tends to be so prejudicial that, absent compelling circumstances, it should not be admitted. See the thoughtful discussion of this issue in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>405 F.Supp. 938, 939-43 (E.D.N.Y.1975) (Weinstein, J.). See <em>also United States v. Fountain, </em>642 F.2d 1083, at 1091\u2014 1093 (7th Cir. 1981); and <em>United States v. Cook, </em>608 F.2d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. <em>denied, </em>444 U.S. 1034, 100 S.Ct. 706, 62 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980). The reason that prior convictions are disfavored, however, is <em>not </em>that they are irrelevant, but that they may be extremely prejudicial. In the instant case, there was no issue of prejudice since Logan was neither a defendant nor a witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">. The government does not proffer a specific argument \u2014 aside from a conclusory statement \u2014 that the testimony <em>was </em>hearsay. Presumably, the government asks us to take judicial notice that the witness did not personally know why the victim was in the control unit. A judicially noticed fact \u201cmust be one not subject to reasonable dispute.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 201. This is a high standard. See <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>631 F.2d 118, 120 (9th Cir. 1980). The fact in issue here \u2014 the witness\u2019 knowledge\u2014 might very well be the subject of reasonable dispute. Therefore, we decline to sua sponte take judicial notice that the witness\u2019 statement was hearsay and, if so, was outside the scope of the hearsay exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-11\">. Q. Do you know what he was placed in the control unit for?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-13\">Q. Would you tell me, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-14\">A. A stabbing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-15\">MS. BEAUPARLANT: Your Honor, I object to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-16\">THE COURT: I sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-17\">That\u2019s irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-18\">MR. GRESCHNER: Well, Your Honor, I believe it is relevant in that my defense is self-defense and that the actual incident this man was placed in the control unit for is relevant to the self-defense defense I\u2019m putting on here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-19\">THE COURT: I sustain the objection, Mr. Greschner. Move on to something else, sir. Tr\u201e 112.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">. The government does not point to any other evidentiary rule under which this evidence would be inadmissible. Indeed, the government does not even discuss this evidentiary issue in its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\">. In <em>Fountain, </em>a very similar case which will be discussed in greater detail later in this opinion, the defendant had been allowed to introduce evidence that his victim had a violent nature and had committed homosexual attacks on other inmates. At 742.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\">. Because of our reversal on these evidentiary grounds, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to let the defendant, in closing argument, comment on the government\u2019s failure to call the victim as a witness. But because this issue may come up again at a new trial, we indicate that we see no grounds for the refusal of such comment in the defendant\u2019s closing argument. That the defendant could have called the victim as a witness and did not do so, does not estop him from commenting on the government\u2019s failure to produce the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Both the defendant and the government discuss the law regarding the propriety of an instruction that an inference of unfavorable testimony arises whenever a party, who has it peculiarly within his or her power to produce a witness, does not do so. But the question of <em>comment </em>in final argument is different from the question of an <em>instruction </em>from the court. As we stated in <em>United States v. Mahone, </em>537 F.2d 922, 927-28 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1025, 97 S.Ct. 646, 50 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976), even when an absent witness instruction is not required, an absent witness comment in final argument can be allowed. In <em>Mahone, </em>we quoted approvingly from <em>United States v. Young, </em>463 F.2d 934, 943 (D.C.Cir.1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-17\">There is a difference between an instruction, which has the weight of law, and argument of counsel, which is only that .... [I]n the in-between case where each side has the physical capacity to locate and produce the witness, and it is debatable which side might more naturally have been expected to call the witness, there may be latitude for the judge to leave the matter to debate without an instruction, simply permitting each counsel to argue to the jury concerning the \u201cnatural\u201d inference of fact to be drawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-18\">In this case, we understand that the victim was available to both the defendant and the government. Thus, <em>Young </em>and <em>Mahone </em>suggest that either side should be allowed to comment on the other side\u2019s failure to produce the victim. We agree. If, however, the defendant is prevented from producing the victim by government officials, an absent witness instruction may be required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b820-11\">. The elements to be proved for an assault conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(f) are that the defendant: (1) was under federal jurisdiction, (2) assaulted a human being, and that the assault (3) resulted in serious bodily injury. The elements to be proved for a conveying conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1792 are that the defendant: (1) conveyed a weapon from place to place within a federal prison; and (2) knowingly conveyed the weapon, <em>United States v. Swindler, </em>476 F.2d 167, 169 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 837, 94 S.Ct. 183, 38 L.Ed.2d 72 (1973). The elements of the two crimes are not similar except for the fact that a defendant must be within federal jurisdiction. Neither crime is proscribed within the definition of the other crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
