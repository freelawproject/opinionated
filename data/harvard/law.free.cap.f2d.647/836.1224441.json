Ku-chenbecker, against Northern Wyoming Drilling Co. (Northern Wyoming), Joe Banks, Loy Banks, and Milo Wiseman. Joe Banks and Loy Banks were the sole shareholders and principal officers of Northern Wyoming, and Milo Wiseman was a foreman employed by Northern Wyoming. The district court granted the three individual defendants summary judgment, and then proceeded to a trial against Northern Wyoming. A judgment was entered against Northern Wyoming pursuant to a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff for $175,000. Ku-chenbecker appeals from the order granting summary judgment to the three individual defendants. We agree that entry of summary judgment was erroneous; we vacate the judgment entered and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-19\">In the fall of 1978, Northern Wyoming contracted to drill a water well in Philip, South Dakota, and hired John Kuchenbecker as a laborer. Milo Wiseman was job foreman. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendants were negligent in various particulars.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The depositions submitted to the court at the time of the motion for summary judgment generally show that on December 29, 1978, a pressure pump at the well site exploded, killing Kuchenbecker. The explosion was allegedly due to the malfunction of a safety valve designed to prevent excessive pressure in the pump. The valve allegedly failed because a device used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>to set the automatic discharge pressure level had broken several days before and because the valve may have frozen in sub-zero temperatures. Northern Wyoming had not enclosed the pump to protect it from low temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Northern Wyoming elected not to carry worker\u2019s compensation insurance coverage and thus was subject to suit by its employees under the common law. S.D. Codified Laws \u00a7 62-3-11. The three individual defendants were sued in their individual capacities as co-employees of Kuchenbecker.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The district court held that the defendants \u201cJoe Banks, Loy Banks and Milo Wise-man were acting within their corporate supervisory capacities at the time of the accident in question and therefore under South Dakota law are not subject to common law liability for the death of Plaintiff\u2019s decedent.\u201d The court relied upon <em>Blumhardt v. Hartung, </em>283 N.W.2d 229 (S.D.1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">In <em>Blumhardt, </em>as well as in <em>Wilson v. Hasvold, </em>86 S.D. 286, 194 N.W.2d 251 (1972) the South Dakota Supreme Court held that an employer\u2019s immunity from common law liability, which arises from the availability of worker\u2019s compensation, also extends to any co-employee, partner, officer or director of such employer, for acts taken within the ambit of corporate responsibility. The parties are in disagreement as to whether the district court granted summary judgment in mistaken reliance upon <em>Blumhardt\u2019s </em>worker\u2019s compensation immunity doctrine or ruled that regardless of the presence of worker\u2019s compensation, an employee cannot be held individually liable for the breach of duties that are the employer\u2019s responsibility. The order of the district court is not clear in this regard. Nonetheless, under either line of reasoning we hold the district court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">As indicated, <em>Blumhardt </em>holds that where an employer elects to provide worker\u2019s compensation, the employer\u2019s immunity also extends to the individual employees for injuries occurring because of working conditions that were the employer\u2019s responsibility. As stated in <em>Blumhardt: </em>\u201cInjuries resulting from their failures in that capacity ... have been compensated under the worker\u2019s compensation law. The umbrella of immunity extends accordingly.\u201d 283 N.W.2d at 232 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Of course, <em>Blumhardt </em>and similar decisions are not controlling here since the employer has elected to have no worker\u2019s compensation coverage. Under these circumstances, there is no employer immunity from which the employees can derive immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Defendants urge that the district court held that even in the absence of worker\u2019s compensation, under South Dakota law employees cannot be held individually liable for a breach of an employer\u2019s duty to provide safe working conditions. We need not pass judgment on the validity of this legal theory, for in the absence of an evidentiary record we think to do so would be premature. Even if the legal theory is correct, under the complaint and depositions within the record summary judgment was improper here. It is sufficient to note that under South Dakota law, it is clear that \u201can employee defendant may be individually liable insofar as his personal negligence caused or contributed to plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Hasvold, </em>194 N.W.2d at 255. In this factual context, the Restatement of Torts (Second) \u00a7 324A is relevant to determining whether there have been sufficient allegations of personal negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-13\">Liability to Third Person for Negligent Performance of Undertaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-14\">One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>essary for the protection of a third person or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-4\">(a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-5\">(b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-6\">(c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-7\"><em>See also </em>Comment d, Illustration 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">In this case, plaintiff\u2019s complaint and depositions provide direct and inferential factual support to Kuchenbecker\u2019s contention that foreman Wiseman was directly responsible for safety at the drilling site, was aware of the defective condition of the pressure-setting device and took no steps to repair it or to warn the employees of the danger. Kuchenbecker also alleged that Joe and Loy Banks were Wiseman\u2019s immediate supervisors and assumed responsibility for the equipment and safety conditions at the drilling site. Nevertheless, they allegedly did nothing to protect the pump from the cold weather or to warn other employees of the hazards arising during freezing weather. These allegations raise material issues of fact as to personal negligence by the defendants arising from responsibilities they assumed and the breach of the duties arising from those responsibilities. Whether plaintiff can prove the defendants owed the decedent a duty and whether he can factually prove that the defendants negligently violated any duty remains to be decided. <em>See Wilson v. Hasvold, </em>194 N.W.2d at 255 (reversing summary judgment due to issue of fact as to personal negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The factual issue in dispute relates to whether plaintiff can prove the individual defendants have breached any duty. This is a mixed question of fact and law and depends upon the factual circumstances involved. Here, although the complaint is highly conclusory the evidence remains to be spread on the record. Although we pass no judgment on the legal issue, we think it sufficient to observe that the testimony within the depositions does not conclusively establish the absence of personal negligence by the defendants. As we have often noted, \u201cSummary judgment is a harsh remedy and is to be granted sparingly....\u201d, <em>McLain v. Meier, </em>612 F.2d 349, 355 (8th Cir. 1979). We again reiterate, as we have so often done, that unless factual issues are completely absent, it is a much better practice for the district court to submit negligence issues to a jury. <em>Williams v. Chick, </em>373 F.2d 330 (8th Cir. 1967). Here it was clear that the case would proceed to trial against Northern Wyoming. In the interest of judicial economy it would have afforded little detriment to the time of the court or defendants to submit the liability of all defendants to the jury. If the court concluded after the verdict that there was no proof of a duty or breach of duty, any erroneous verdict could have been corrected by a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. In the words of Judge Sanborn, written 28 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-11\">It is safe to say that in a case such as the one before us, it is unwise for a trial judge to direct a verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. We think that, even though the trial court is of the opinion that the evidence will not support a verdict for the plaintiff, the court should ordinarily reserve its ruling on a motion for a peremptory instruction until after verdict. That course will usually hasten the ultimate termination of the litigation and best serve the interests of both parties. The jury\u2019s view of the sufficiency of the evidence may coincide with that of the court. If it does not, the court, despite the verdict, can enter judgment for the defendant. An appeal from such a judgment, entered after verdict, will usually terminate the controversy one way or the other, and avoid a retrial with its resulting delay, trouble and expense and the possibility of a second appeal. Compare, <em>Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., </em>340 U.S. 573-574, 71 S.Ct. 428, 95 L.Ed. 547.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-12\"><em>Barnett v. Terminal Railroad Association, </em>200 F.2d 893, 896 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>345 U.S. 956, 73 S.Ct. 938, 97 L.Ed. 1377 (1953). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>We have long adhered to this rule and we repeat it here for emphasis to avoid recurrence of the problem. <em>See Parker v. Seaboard Coastline Railroad, </em>573 F.2d 1004, 1006 n.3 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>Hladyshewski v. Robinson, </em>557 F.2d 1251, 1255 n.3 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>Holmgren v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>516 F.2d 856, 859 n.2 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Tiedeman v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad, </em>513 F.2d 1267, 1271 n.4 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Hoppe v. Midwest Conveyor Co., </em>485 F.2d 1196, 1198 n.l (8th Cir. 1973); <em>Passwaters v. General Motors Corp., </em>454 F.2d 1270, 1272-73 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>Stofer v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>249 F.2d 285, 291 (8th Cir. 1957); <em>Homolla v. Gluck, </em>248 F.2d 731, 732 n.l (8th Cir. 1957); <em>Frank B. Connet Lumber Co. v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>236 F.2d 117, 127 (8th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Under the circumstances, we have no alternative but to remand to the district court for a new trial against the individual defendants. The judgment of the district court is vacated and remand is ordered to the district court in accord with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-13\">. Paragraph VII of the complaint reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-14\">On December 29, 1978, and for some time prior thereto, the defendants were negligent in failing to maintain a safe place to work, in failing to safely and properly operate and maintain their equipment, in failing to furnish equipment which was reasonably safe and in failing to give appropriate safety instructions to their employees and were otherwise negligent. As a direct and proximate result of said negligence, the plaintiffs decedent was killed while working in the employment of the defendants on December 29, 1978.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b914-8\">.
