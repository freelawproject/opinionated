Her request for bail pending appeal from the order was denied by the district court on the basis that the appeal was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The appellant asserts that her refusal to testify is based on just cause, and in support thereof contends that (a) she should be accorded the protections of a parent-child testimonial privilege, and (2) the government\u2019s grant of use immunity is an insufficient substitute for her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We reject both contentions and affirm the order of civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The appellant was subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury convened in the western district of Texas. In anticipation of the appellant\u2019s refusal to testify before the grand jury on grounds of self-incrimination, the government requested an order granting the appellant use immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002 and \u00a7 6003. The district court issued an order, effective upon the appellant\u2019s refusal to testify, that (1) directed the appellant to give the testimony withheld on the basis of her privilege against self-incrimination, and (2) prevented the use of the testimony or information derived from it against the appellant in criminal proceedings except in prosecution for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">At the grand jury proceedings, the appellant was questioned with regard to her mother and stepfather\u2019s involvement in a homicide under investigation by the grand jury. She invoked her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and was thereby subject to the district court\u2019s order granting her use immunity. She nevertheless persisted in her refusal to testify and was adjudicated in civil contempt and incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">On appeal from the district court\u2019s order of civil contempt, the appellant attempts to justify her refusal to testify on two bases: (1) she claims that her testimony is subject to the parent-child privilege, and (2) she asserts that use immunity insufficiently protects her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">We can find no federal judicial support for recognition of a \u201cparent-child\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>privilege,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and decline to create one under the circumstances of the present appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Nor do we find merit in the appellant\u2019s fifth amendment claim: The Supreme Court has held that \u201cimmunity from use and derivative use [under \u00a7 6002] is coextensive with the scope of the [fifth amendment] privilege against self-incrimination, and therefore is sufficient to compel testimony over a claim of the privilege.\u201d <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1661, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">\n<em>Conclusion:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">For the reasons above stated, the district court\u2019s order of civil contempt is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-15\">Whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self \u2022incrimination, to testify or provide other information in a proceeding before or ancillary to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-16\">(1) a court or grand jury of the United States,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-17\">(2) an agency of the United States, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-18\">(3) either House of Congress, a joint committee of the two Houses, or a committee or a subcommittee of either House, and the person presiding over the proceeding communicates to the witness an order issued under this part, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination; but no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-28\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6003 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-29\">(a) In the case of any individual who has been or may be called to testify or provide other information at any proceeding before or ancillary to a court of the United States or a grand jury of the United States, the United States district court for the judicial district in which the proceeding is or may be held shall issue, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, upon the request of the United States attorney for such district, an order requiring such individual to give testimony or provide other information which he refuses to give or provide on the basis of his privilege against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>self-incrimination, such order to become effective as provided in section 6002 of this part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">(b) A United States attorney may, with the approval of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or any designated Assistant Attorney General, request an order under subsection (a) of this section when in his judgment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">(1) the testimony or other information from such individual may be necessary to the public interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">(2) such individual has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">(a) Whenever a witness in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States refuses without just cause shown to comply with an order of the court to testify or provide other information, including any book, paper, document, record, recording or other material, the court, upon such refusal, or when such refusal is duly brought to its attention, may summarily order his confinement at a suitable place until such time as the witness is willing to give such testimony or provide such information.

Discussion of such a privilege is conspicuously absent from the discussions of scholarly evi-dentiary authorities. See generally 2 Wein-stein\u2019s Evidence j| 501 (1980); 8 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2285-2286 (1961); 23 Wright and Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5421 et seq. (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b589-20\">. The appellant urges our recognition of a parent-child privilege on the basis of New York state jurisprudence approving of such a privilege. See <em>Application of A and M, </em>61 A.D.2d 426, 403 N.Y.S.2d 375 (1978); <em>People v. Fitzgerald, </em>101 Misc.2d 712, 422 N.Y.S.2d 309 (Westchester County Ct. 1979). Disregarding the question of the persuasiveness of the opinions as authority for this court, we can distinguish the cases on the basis that they involved confidential communications from the child to the parent, and were founded for the most part on the desire to avoid discouraging a child from confiding in his parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
