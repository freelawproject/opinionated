KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b393-26\">This appeal presents issues sufficiently similar to those resolved today in <em>Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. v. Federal Republic of </em>Nigeria<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that we need only apply much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>of the doctrine developed there to the facts at issue here. \u201cTafeo\u201d is an imperfect acronym for the Foreign Trade Organization for Chemicals and Foodstuffs. Tafeo is wholly owned by the Syrian government; it buys food for consumption in Syria. \u201cSyri-amar\u201d is similar shorthand for the Syrian General Organization for Maritime Transport. Syriamar is also wholly owned by the Syrian government; it hires ships for the use of the Syrian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Between 1976 and 1979, Tafeo made several purchases of rice and soybeans under a United States government program popularly known as \u201cP.L. 480.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under P.L. 480, the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides financing for sales of food by American corporations to friendly foreign countries. P.L. 480 requires the buying nation to publish in the United States \u201cinvitations for bids.\u201d The invitations are opened in the United States. Then, the sales are effected through government-to-government diplomatic negotiations, and are consummated in the buying country. Half the goods sold must be transported on American ships.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Syria\u2019s P.L. 480 purchases involved numerous telexes from Syria to the United States, visits to the United States by Tafeo officials, and the receipt of food contract bids at the Syrian embassy in Washington. Tafeo did not, however, maintain an office in the United States, and did not execute the contracts of sale here. Syriamar retained a shipping agent in the United States to secure transportation for the food Tafeo bought.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The sale most relevant here occurred in 1976, when Tafeo bought 10,727 metric tons of rice through the P.L. 480 program from the Connell Rice &amp; Sugar Co. of Westfield, New Jersey. Under the terms of the rice contract, Tafeo established a letter of credit in Connell\u2019s favor at the Commercial Bank of Syria Ltd. That bank advised the letter of credit through the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, and Chase confirmed it. If Connell wanted to collect, Connell presented documents to Chase, and Chase paid Connell for Tafeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The rice was at a port in California. Syr-iamar contracted for the shipping with International Trading and Shipping Enterprises, S.A. (\u201cItrash\u201d), a Belgian corporation. Itrash secured the shipping through Gemini Shipping, Inc., a New York corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their agreement provided that Itrash would pay 90% of the freight charges to Gemini when the ship was loaded in California. If Itrash did not pay, Gemini had a right of lien over the ship\u2019s cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Gemini hired a ship, and it was loaded in California on August 31, 1976. Gemini demanded payment of 90% of the freight charges from Itrash (about $300,000), and Itrash insisted on deducting $80,000 for certain port charges. As the ship left California, Gemini became concerned about Itrash\u2019s ability to pay both the freight charges and the demurrage (should it be incurred), and telexed Tafeo on September 1 that it intended to exercise its right of lien over the cargo. Tafeo and Syriamar telexed Gemini on September 2 in New York that Tafeo had already paid Itrash, and should not have to pay twice. The Syrians\u2019 telex also stated, however, \u201cwe guarantee to pay you demurrages at both ends.\u201d The telex did not specify where payment would be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Itrash paid Gemini the freight charges on September 7, while the ship was between California and Syria. The ship continued to Syria, and arrived on September 23. In alleged reliance on the demurrage guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tee, Gemini forbore exercising its right of lien over the cargo, and freed the vessel to be unloaded. The ship encountered substantial delays at the port, and took 115 days to discharge the rice. The demurrage incurred amounted to $378,957 under Gemini\u2019s agreement with Itrash. Itrash refused to pay. Gemini sued Itrash in England, and secured a default judgment. It remains unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Gemini then asked Tafeo and Syriamar to honor their demurrage guarantee. They refused. Gemini sued them in the Southern District of New York, claiming jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330 (\u201cFSIA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d). Defendants moved to dismiss. Taking the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint as true, as we have in setting forth the facts above, the district court, 496 F.Supp. 256, granted the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The relevant legal provision is the first clause of \u00a7 1605(a)(2) of the Act, providing for jurisdiction over any suit \u201cbased upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is clear beyond doubt that defendants\u2019 activity here was \u201ccommercial\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(d). At hearings before the passage of the Act, one of the drafters of the FSIA stated of \u00a7 1603(d), \u201cThis would mean, for example, that a foreign state\u2019s purchase of grain from a private dealer would always be regarded as commercial .... \u201d <em>Hearings on H.R. 11315 Before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the House Committee on the Judiciary, </em>94th Cong., 2d Sess. 27 (1976) <em>(\u201c1976 </em>Hearings\u201d) (testimony of Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser, Department of State). The suit is \u201cbased upon\u201d the commercial activity because the guarantee was part and parcel of the rice sale. It was made when Gemini threatened to exercise its lien, and was breached after Gemini released the grain. While, in a narrow sense, Gemini\u2019s suit might be said to be \u201cbased upon\u201d only the breach of the guarantee, the drafters of the FSIA intended no such niggardly construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">We therefore need decide only whether, under the language of \u00a7 1605(a)(2), the commercial activity here was \u201ccarried on in the United States.\u201d Section 1603(e) of the Act provides that a commercial activity is carried on here if it has \u201csubstantial contact with the United States.\u201d Defendants\u2019 conduct certainly satisfies that standard, for Syria solicited bids in the United States, and paid under the contract through a letter of credit confirmed by a New York bank. The House Report to the bill that became the FSIA lists \u201cimport-export transactions involving sales to, or purchases from, concerns in the United States\u201d among the conduct within the first clause of \u00a7 1605(a)(2). House Judiciary Committee, <em>Jurisdiction of United States Courts in Suits Against Foreign States, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 16, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 6604, 6615 <em>(\u201cHouse Report </em>\u201d). Moreover, Syria received financing for the transaction from the Department of Agriculture; the House Report states that the \u201csubstantial contact\u201d standard of \u00a7 1603(e) can be satisfied by as little activity as \u201creceivpng] financing from a private or public lending institution located in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6615-16. In fact, one of the experts who testified before passage of the Act referred specifically to P.L. 480 sales as a target of the bill. <em>See 1976 Hearings </em>at 96 (testimony of Michael M. Cohen, Chairman, Committee on Maritime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Legislation, Maritime Law Association of the United States). The events at issue are therefore sufficiently tied to the United States to place this case within the class of suits over which Congress intended to confer jurisdiction when it passed the FSIA. <em>See Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. v. Federal Republic of </em>Nigeria, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Since this case involves a commercial activity carried on in the United States under \u00a7 1605(a)(2), subject matter jurisdiction is present, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as is personal jurisdiction, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 1330(b). Accordingly, there remains only the inquiry whether defendants\u2019 contacts with the United States are sufficient to square exercise of that jurisdiction with the due process clause. Tafeo has a plethora of \u201ccontacts,\u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), with the United States, including the solicitation of P.L. 480 bids here, trips taken by officers, the receipt of American government financing, and the establishment of a confirmed letter of credit at Chase. Syria-mar maintained a shipping agent here, and made contracts here. Defendants have \u201cavail[ed themselves] of .. . the benefits and protections\u201d of American law in many ways, <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 1239, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958), and the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally proper. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The order is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-16\">. See <em>Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 300 (2d Cir. 1981). <em>Texas Trading </em>and this case are two of seven appeals decided today involving the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, Pub.L. 94-583, 90 Stat. 2891, <em>codified at </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330; 1332(a)(2)-l332(a)(4); 1391(f); 1441(d); and 1602-1611. In the <em>Texas Trading </em>opinion, we disposed of three other cases as well. They are: <em>Decor by Nikkei International, Inc. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>No. 80-7783; <em>Chenax Majesty, Inc. v. Federal Republic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>of Nigeria, </em>No. 80-7771; and <em>East Europe Import-Export, Inc. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>No. 80-7773. The other two cases of the seven were treated in separate opinions. They are <em>Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 320 (2d Cir. 1981), and <em>Reale International, Inc. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 330 (2d Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-12\">. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1427, 1431, 1691 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b394-13\">.
