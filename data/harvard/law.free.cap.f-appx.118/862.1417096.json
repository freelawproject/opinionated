Young has also filed motions to subpoena medical records and to appoint a private investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-18\">Young has failed to address the district court\u2019s determination that the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, this claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Further, this court may not consider Young\u2019s claim that city, county, and state officials knowingly withheld relevant medical records because this claim was not presented to the district court. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Finally, Young\u2019s allegations of conspiracy, discrimination, and torture are not relevant to the district court\u2019s review of his disabled widower\u2019s claim. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Young\u2019s motions to subpoena medical records and to appoint a private investigator are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-23\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b886-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
