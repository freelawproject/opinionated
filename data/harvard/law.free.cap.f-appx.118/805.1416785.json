Anderson argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from a hidden compartment within his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-31\">Anderson first disputes the district court\u2019s findings that the private search by Anderson\u2019s wife of the hidden compartment was reasonably foreseeable. Anderson secondarily argues that his wife lacked actual or apparent authority to consent to the search of the hidden compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Based on Anderson\u2019s wife\u2019s status as co-owner and co-occupant of the marital home, it was reasonably foreseeable that she might enter and search the hidden compartment, despite Anderson\u2019s orders to the contrary and regardless of the circumstances surrounding Anderson\u2019s extra-marital activities. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>337 F.3d 529, 536-38 (5th Cir.2003), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1229, 124 S.Ct. 1507, 158 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004). Similarly, given Anderson\u2019s wife\u2019s equal rights to the use and occupation of the marital home, she was authorized to give valid consent to the search of the premises. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Anderson\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>6 F.3d 287, 289 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b829-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
