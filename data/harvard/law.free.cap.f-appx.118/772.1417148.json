Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-23\">Jackson\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence. Legal conclusions underlying the denial of a motion to suppress are reviewed de novo and factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-24\">We have fully reviewed the materials submitted by the parties, including the transcript of the suppression hearing and the district court\u2019s opinion, and find no error in the district court\u2019s order denying in part Jackson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
