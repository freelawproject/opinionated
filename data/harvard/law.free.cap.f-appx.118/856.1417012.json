Hayes contends that the officers who arrested him testified improperly at trial that it was their opinion and belief that the weapon found at the scene came from his person. (Hayes had been apprehended after a pursuit; when he was lifted to his feet, the officers had observed a holstered pistol under Hayes\u2019 body.) Because Hayes did <em>not </em>object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions on the basis that they were intended to induce improper opinion testimony, we review only for plain error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 823, 124 S.Ct. 152, 157 L.Ed.2d 43 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">\u201cUnder the plain error analysis, the court may reverse a criminal conviction only if (1) there was error, and (2) the error was clear and obvious, and (3) the error affected a substantial right.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>256 F.3d 330, 340 (5th Cir.2001). Further, the court retains discretion to reverse a conviction on the basis of plain error; generally, we will reverse only if the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-18\">Under Fed.R.Evid. 701, if a witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness may testify in the form of opinions or inferences only if the testimony (1) is rationally based on the witness\u2019 perceptions, (2) is helpful to a clear understanding of the testimony or the determination of a fact issue, and (3) is not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Parsee, </em>178 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.1999). Although a witness may not offer legal conclusions, \u201ctestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact\u201d. Fed.R.Evid. 704(a); <em>see United States v. Izydore, </em>167 F.3d 213, 218 (5th Cir.1999) (applying Rule 704(a) to lay testimony). The officers\u2019 testimony was limited to opinions that were rationally based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>on the officers\u2019 observations, and the testimony was helpful to a clear determination of a fact issue. There was no error. But even assuming <em>arguendo </em>the admission of the officers\u2019 testimony was error, it was <em>not </em>the \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error required by our plain error review. <em>See Farsee, </em>178 F.3d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Hayes also challenges remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument. He contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the officers\u2019 credibility on several occasions; however, he objected to only two of the four remarks he challenges on appeal. Plain error review is applied to the comments for which there was no objection. The objected-to comments are reviewed to determine whether they were improper and, if so, affected Hayes\u2019 substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Gallardo-Trapero, </em>185 F.3d 307, 320 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Although Hayes stopped short of testifying that the arresting officers were lying, his testimony about the discovery of the firearm conflicted substantially with the officers\u2019. A prosecutor may \u201cpresent what amounts to be a bolstering argument if it is specifically in rebuttal to assertions made by defense counsel in order to remove any stigma cast upon [the prosecutor] or his witness\u201d. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>12 F.3d 1350, 1367 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1095, 114 S.Ct. 1861, 128 L.Ed.2d 483, <em>and cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1114, 114 S.Ct. 2119, 128 L.Ed.2d 676 (1994). The other comments challenged by Hayes were permissible requests that the jury draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and a permissible argument that, under the evidence presented, the officers had no reason to he. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>44 F.3d 1271, 1278 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1132, 115 S.Ct. 2011, 131 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1995). There was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Hayes also claims for the first time on appeal that the prosecutor also made an improper plea for law enforcement. \u201cThis circuit has held that appeals to the jury to act as the conscience of the community are permissible, so long as they are not intended to inflame.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>72 F.3d 1200, 1208 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 807, 117 S.Ct. 48, 136 L.Ed.2d 13 (1996). The prosecutor\u2019s remark was not clear or obvious error. <em>See Jimenez, </em>256 F.3d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Finally, Hayes urges reversal based on cumulative error. Obviously, in the light of the foregoing, that claim fails also.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
