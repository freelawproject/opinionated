For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-19\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b892-20\">In August 1997, Anita Evaro (\u201cEvaro\u201d) suffered a back injury while employed as a produce inspector for RX Staffing Corporation at its Anchor West facility. Continental Casualty Co. (\u201cContinental\u201d) provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance to RX Staffing. Evaro filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for her injury. Continental denied the claim and contested the compensability of Evaro\u2019s injury before the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cTWCC\u201d). After a contested case hearing, TWCC determined that Evaro\u2019s injury was compensable. Continental appealed the decision to the Appeals Panel, which also ruled in Evaro\u2019s favor. Subsequently, Continental began payment of both income and medical benefits to Evaro in 1998. Evaro consulted a team of physicians for her injury, among them Dr. Oei, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>a pain management specialist. Evaro was eventually diagnosed with a herniated disk and under went surgery on March 16, 2000. In March 2001, Dejaune Phillips, an adjuster with Continental, requested a peer review to determine whether the continued course of treatment Evaro was undergoing with Dr. Oei was reasonable and necessary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Theodore Pearlman, a psychiatrist, conducted the peer review by looking over Evaro\u2019s medical records. In a report dated March 22, 2001, Dr. Pearl-man concluded that Evaro\u2019s continued treatment by Dr. Oei and other doctors was not reasonable or medically necessary. He opined that Evaro\u2019s continued problems resulted from non-physical, psychological factors which could be preventing her improvement or contributing to the symptoms Dr. Oei and other providers were treating.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He recommended that follow-up visits be terminated and Evaro weaned from pain medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Dr. Oei continued to see Evaro through October 2001; although Continental denied payment for Evaro\u2019s visits to Dr. Oei from May 2001 through October 2001, citing the lack of medical necessity for the services as indicated by Dr. Pearlman\u2019s report. Continental also refused to preauthorize a request by Dr. Oei for diagnostic tests in October 2001. Dr. Oei did not contest Continental\u2019s refusal to pay with TWCC nor did he ask Continental to reconsider their non-payment. Evaro contends she paid for Dr. Oei\u2019s services herself from the end of January of 2001 until the end of 2002; however, the district court noted there was no evidence Evaro paid for the treatments herself nor evidence that she challenged the denial of payment to TWCC or Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In August 2002, Dr. Oei performed two ganglionectomies on Evaro that Continental Casualty had prospectively approved. Continental paid Dr. Oei for the operations but in an amount which was reduced to meet applicable TWCC fee guidelines. Dr. Oei did not challenge the reduced fee to Continental nor did he request medical dispute resolution with TWCC. On or about January 14, 2003, Dr. Oei notified Evaro of his decision to cease treatment of her as a patient. Evaro contends that Dr. Oei withdrew as her physician because of Continental\u2019s non-payment. Evaro asserts that her condition has worsened since Dr. Oei stopped treating her. On March 27, 2003, Evaro filed suit in Texas state court against Continental for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing because Continental denied payment of workers\u2019 compensation medical benefits without a reasonable basis. Continental removed the case to United States District Court, Western District of Texas based on diversity of citizenship. On January 28, 2004, the district court granted summary judgment for Continental based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court concluded that Evaro did not exhaust her administrative remedies before TWCC pri- or to initiating this judicial proceeding. Evaro filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>See Mowbray v. Cameron County, Tex., </em>274 F.3d 269, 278 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate only when the record indicates \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">II. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Continental asserts that the district court was correct in finding it lacked jurisdiction over Evaro\u2019s suit because Evaro has not exhausted her administrative remedies with the TWCC. Continental contends the TWCC has never ruled that Evaro is entitled to the challenged medical treatments, and therefore, the courts have no authority to award damages for treatment the TWCC has not determined Evaro is entitled pursuant to <em>Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. </em>Fodge, 63 S.W.3d 801 (Tex. 2001). According to Continental, Dr. Oei should have requested medical dispute review of the denial of payment, as was his right, so that TWCC could rule on whether payment was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Evaro counters that the TWCC made a final decision determining she is entitled to benefits when it concluded her injury was compensable. \u201cAn employee who suffers a compensable injury is entitled to all health care reasonably required by the nature of the injury as and when needed.\u201d Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 408.021(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Evaro asserts that there is at least a fact issue about whether Continental\u2019s denial of medical benefits was a bad faith attempt to challenge the prior compensability decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The power to award compensation benefits lies exclusively with the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. <em>Bone v. Utica Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. of Texas, </em>2003 WL 21810944, at *2 (Tex.App. Aug.7, 2003), <em>rek\u2019g denied, </em>(Dec. 5, 2003) (quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Fodge, </em>63 S.W.3d at 803. TWCC has jurisdiction over disputes involving income benefits, preauthorization of medical care, and reimbursement of medical expenses. <em>Fodge, </em>63 S.W.3d at 803 (quotation marks omitted). The TWCC has promulgated rules through which an insurance carrier can review the medical claims of health care providers. Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 133.301-.305 (West 2004). In turn, the rules provide for a dispute resolution process through which a health care provider or claimant can challenge the reduced payment or non-payment by a carrier. <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>133.305; Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 413.031(a)-(b). A party who is dissatisfied with the outcome of dispute resolution may seek relief from the State Office of Administrative Hearings, and subsequently, from the courts. <em>Texas Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n v. Patient Advocates of Texas, </em>136 S.W.3d 643, 652-53 (Tex.2004); Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 413.031(k). A party <em>must </em>exhaust their administrative remedies and there <em>must </em>be a final decision of the TWCC\u2019s Appeals Panel before a party may seek a judicial remedy. <em>Cervantes v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>130 S.W.3d 152, 157 (Tex.App.2003); Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 410.251. A court has no jurisdiction to award damages based on an insurance company\u2019s denial of preauthorization or failure to reimburse medical expenses if the TWCC has not determined that the claimant is entitled to preauthorization or reimbursement. <em>Malish v. Pac. Employers Ins. Co., </em>106 S.W.3d 744, 746 (Tex.App.2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">The district court found that the only ruling TWCC ever made concerning the dispute between Evaro and Continental was its 1998 ruling that Evaro\u2019s injury was compensable. Evaro maintains that the 1998 ruling by TWCC that her injury was compensable, and thus that she is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>to all reasonable health benefits associated with her injury, is a final decision that satisfies the exhaustion requirement. Continental notes that retrospective, prospective or concurrent review of medical treatment is distinct from compensability. <em>See </em>Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 134.600(h)-(i). Although, Continental cannot challenge the final decision of the TWCC concerning the compensability of Evaro\u2019s injury, Continental asserts it was entitled to review the reasonableness or the necessity of Evaro\u2019s medical treatments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 133.301(a)(9); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 133.304; <em>see also </em>Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 413.014.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Evaro submits that her case is controlled by <em>Gregson v. Zurich Am. Ins. </em>Co.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The insurance carrier in <em>Gregson </em>found the plaintiffs injury compensable and agreed to provide coverage for back surgery. However, the carrier refused payment for the medication prescribed to the plaintiff following surgery; the plaintiff argued that was a breach of its duty of good faith. This Court found that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing suit. First, the Court found that <em>Fodge </em>did not apply because the insurance carrier already found Gregson\u2019s injury compensable and agreed to provide coverage for his back surgery and all other reasonable and necessary benefits incident to the treatment \u2014 which included the post-surgery prescription. Therefore, the issue before it was whether an employee must exhaust administrative procedures with the TWCC when the carrier denies coverage of a medical benefit incident to the approved medical treatment. The Court stated that \u00a7 413.031(a) of the Texas Labor Code<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides for medical dispute resolution of disputes arising from <em>medical services rendered; </em>but, Gregson did not receive the medication so no medical service was rendered. Moreover, the provision stated it provided for review where <em>authorization of payment is sought; </em>however, a prescription does not require preauthorization of payment by the insurance carrier. Based on those conclusions, the Court found the medical dispute resolution procedure did not apply to Gregson\u2019s situation, nor did any other section of the Texas Labor or Administrative Code require an employee who sought a medical benefit which did not require preauthorization to exhaust any particular remedy. Therefore, Gregson was not required to exhaust an administrative remedy. In contrast, Dr. Oei was denied payment for a medical service that was actually rendered, and the invasive treatments Dr. Oei provided did require pre-authorization. Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 413.014; Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 134.600(h)-(i). Accordingly, Evaro and Dr. Oei were entitled to seek an administrative remedy. Tex. Lab.Code \u00a7 413.031(a)-(c); <em>Continental Cas. Ins. Co. v. Functional Restoration Assocs., </em>19 S.W.3d 393, 409 (Tex.2000) (\u201cWhen a workers\u2019 compensation insurer denies payment ... the worker or the health care provider can request review by a \u2018health care provider professional review organization.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bone, </em>2003 WL 21810944 (finding the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate insurer\u2019s refusal to pay pain management bill where employee and physician did not exhaust their administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>remedies). Thus, <em>Gregson </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The district court found that because Evaro did not utilize the medical dispute resolution process, Evaro did not exhaust her administrative remedies. Furthermore, the district court concluded\" Evaro was required to exhaust her administrative remedies pursuant to Texas state law before she filed a claim in court. We affirm essentially for the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum order. Because Evaro was required to exhaust her administrative remedies, and she did not, the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">II. Stay versus dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Evaro argues that if this Court finds the courts lack jurisdiction over her claim, the appropriate remedy is a stay rather than dismissal. Evaro avers that because she is not a health care provider, the statute does not provide standing for her to assert an administrative proceeding. Since TWCC does not have the power to grant her relief, Evaro argues TWCC\u2019s primary jurisdiction does not apply here and thus, a stay is more appropriate than a dismissal. For the reasons stated above, we find Evaro\u2019s arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">If a claim is not within a court\u2019s jurisdiction, and the impediment to jurisdiction cannot be removed, then it must be dismissed. <em>Fodge, </em>63 S.W.3d at 805 (quotation marks omitted). The TWCC provisions state that a medical dispute review must be initiated within a year after the service in dispute. Tex. Ajdmin. Code \u00a7 133.307. Evaro\u2019s one year window to initiate review of Continental\u2019s non-payment in 2001 and reduced payment in 2002, or have Dr. Oei initiate review, has passed. Since, Evaro failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and is now time barred from doing so, dismissal is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the ruling of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
