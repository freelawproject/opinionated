Jones filed this \u00a7 1983 action against the officials, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>leging violations of his constitutional rights and various state law claims. The district court granted judgment to the officials on all counts, and Jones appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">On July 21, 1999, Officer Steven D. Saunders secured a search warrant for the home of Jones\u2019 girlfriend, Crystal Mercer, at 716 Clark Street in Nashville, N.C. Saunders obtained the warrant in connection with Jones\u2019 organization of, and participation in, an illegal lottery. The warrant stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cOrlando Jones would be at 716 Clark Street, Nashville, N.C. operating a 1999 green Ford Navigator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">When Nash County deputies executed the warrant, also on July 21, they discovered Jones and Mercer conducting an illegal lottery in Mercer\u2019s house. The deputies seized more than $19,000 in cash, along with Jones\u2019 Navigator. Jones alleges that following these events Nash County Sheriff James B. Grimes told him that (1) the officers seized his Navigator pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-299; (2) he could have the car returned to him but Mercer might serve jail time on account of her prior convictions; and (3) he might want to consider a plea agreement, whereby he could transfer title to the Navigator to Nash County.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">After this alleged conversation with Grimes, Jones met with Assistant District Attorney Keith E. Werner, signed a waiver of counsel form, and entered into a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d with the government. Under the terms of the agreement, Jones signed over title to his Navigator to Nash County and submitted to unsupervised probation for three months. In exchange for compliance with these and other terms, the government agreed to dismiss the lottery charges against Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">In a January 2000 order, a Nash County Superior Court judge directed various items to be returned to Jones and ordered the currency that had been seized during the search of Mercer\u2019s house to be disbursed to the Nash County general fund as provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">Two years later, on January 23, 2002, Jones filed this action against Grimes; Werner; four Nash County officers, including Saunders; and Western Surety Company (\u2018Western Surety\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the North Carolina Constitution, as well as claims for conversion and civil conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">In an order filed May 20, 2003, the district court dismissed all claims against the Nash County officers, as well as the claims under the North Carolina Constitution, leaving Grimes, Western Surety, and Werner as named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">In an order filed November 12, 2003, the district court denied Jones\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment to Grimes and Werner. Jones timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-18\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment <em>de novo. PSINet, Inc. v. Chapman, </em>362 F.3d 227, 233 (4th Cir.2004). After hearing oral argument in this case, and carefully reviewing the record, briefs, and applicable case law, we conclude that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>correctly resolved the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">. Jones\u2019 claim against Western Surety appears to derive from his assertion that he can collect on Grimes' \"bond for the faithful execution of his office as sheriff.\u201d A finding for Grimes, therefore, disposes of Jones\u2019 claim against Western Surety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-17\">. To the extent that the district court did not separately explain its dismissal of Jones\u2019 conversion claim against Grimes (and to the extent that Jones appeals that dismissal), we note that summary judgment as to that claim was also proper since Jones has not alleged facts sufficient to satisfy the elements of a conversion cause of action. <em>See Di Frega v. Puqliese, </em>596 S.E.2d 456, 463 (N.C.Ct.App. 2004) (defining elements of conversion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
