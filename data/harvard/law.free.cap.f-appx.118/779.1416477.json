We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s order constituted reversible error as to the term of Gadberry\u2019s supervised release. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Accordingly, we: (1) affirm the district court\u2019s order with respect to the fourteen-month term of imprisonment; (2) vacate the district court\u2019s order with respect to the twenty-four-month term of supervised release; and, (3) remand this case to the district court for imposition of a term of supervised release that shall not exceed twenty-two months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(h) (West Supp.2004); <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 341-43 (4th Cir.2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
