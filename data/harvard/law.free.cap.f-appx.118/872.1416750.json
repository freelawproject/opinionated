R.Civ.P. 59(e) and the denial of his request, as a sanctioned litigant, for permission to file a civil complaint in the district court. Our review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>3 F.3d 931, 934 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Gelabert v. Lynaugh, </em>894 F.2d 746, 748 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">Balawajder contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce a sanction order that had been issued by another district court and that the enforcement of the sanction constituted a denial of due process. We have previously rejected this argument. <em>Balawajder v. Scott, </em>160 F.3d 1066, 1068 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">Balawajder asserts that the district court did not provide sufficient notice of the requirements that he must fulfill to obtain permission to file a complaint in the district court. He challenges the district court\u2019s determinations that his complaint is excessive in length and contains misjoined parties and claims, contract causes of action that were devised to circumvent the statute of limitations, and outlandish allegations of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">In his appellate brief, Balawajder has not challenged the district court\u2019s conclusion that his complaint contained civil rights claims that would be barred by the statute of limitations; thus, he has abandoned any such challenge. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Balawajder has not provided facts and citations to authority to support his assertion that his contract claims are legally viable and sufficient claims. Although we apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel and liberally construe the briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 28. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Balawajder has not shown error in the district court\u2019s determinations regarding his contract claims. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Balawajder\u2019s conclusional allegations are not sufficient to demonstrate a conspiracy. <em>Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Balawajder incorrectly contends that the district court dismissed his complaint because the complaint contained parties and claims joined in violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 18(a) and 20. The district court denied Balawajder leave to file the complaint for all the reasons specified in its order. Balawajder has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gelabert, </em>894 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b897-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
