Santos was sentenced to ninety-eight months imprisonment. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Santos alleges that his statement should have been suppressed because it was not voluntary and was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Specifically, he contends that he did not understand English well enough to understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, that he was intimidated by a gun in the interrogator\u2019s office, that he confessed in exchange for a promise of leniency, and that he was under duress during the interrogation due to pain and pain medication. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). Reviewing the evidence as required, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding Santos\u2019 statement was voluntary, and thus the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Because Santos\u2019 claims fail on appeal, we affirm his conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
