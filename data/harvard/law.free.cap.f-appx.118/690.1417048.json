Prior to trial, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to suppress evidence seized from them when Corporal Mike J. Riazzi stopped their vehicle shortly after the robbery. The Government appeals. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">While on patrol at 4:25 a.m. October 2, 2003, Riazzi, a twelve-year police department veteran (with a decade of patrol experience), heard a police radio broadcast stating that a Quality Mart on Peace Haven Road in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, had just been robbed. The broadcast described the suspect as an armed, white man wearing a black hooded sweatshirt last seen running north from the convenience store. Riazzi, who was familiar with the upper-middle class neighborhood along Peace Haven Road, thought the robber might flee by car through the intersection of Robinhood Road and Peace Haven Road, so he drove there.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Peace Haven Road is a through street and numerous streets intersect it along the 3.7 miles between the Quality Mart and Robinhood Road. But because of the early hour, very few cars were on the road. Soon after arriving at the intersection, Riazzi saw a red vehicle pass through it. He followed the red car for eight blocks to see if the driver would commit a traffic violation. When the driver did so, Riazzi turned on his blue lights and pulled up beside the car. Based on the driver\u2019s demeanor when told of the robbery and Riazzi\u2019s calculation that the suspect could not have reached the intersection so quickly, Riazzi ruled the driver out as a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Upon his return to the intersection, Riazzi observed a \u201cbeat-up\u201d car \u2014 occupied by the defendants \u2014 drive north on Peace Haven, stop at a red light, and turn right onto Robinhood. About four minutes had passed since the radio broadcast. Riazzi followed the car for eight miles but did not see the driver commit any traffic violations. The car took an indirect route to a highway to Greensboro. When the car entered a lighted area on the highway, Riazzi pulled alongside it and saw that it was occupied by two men with light complexions; he could not tell if they were white. He noticed that the driver was wearing a black sweater. The driver nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ther made eye contact with him nor looked at him, even though, as Riazzi remembers it, no other cars were on the road. Riazzi pulled the defendants over and, after asking some questions, frisked the defendants and the car, finding a pistol, a black hooded sweatshirt, and a mask similar to those used in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress this evidence, the district court carefully considered Riazzi\u2019s testimony. The court noted that Riazzi had relied on several factors as justification for the stop: the car arrived at an intersection that someone escaping the robbery might pass through; the car was beat-up and, therefore, out of place in the well-to-do neighborhood; the driver took an indirect path to Route 421; the driver wore a black sweater; both occupants of the car had light complexions; and the driver did not look at or make eye contact with Riazzi when the officer pulled up alongside the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The district court concluded that these factors did not provide \u201can articulable suspicion for the officer to pull the driver over for an investigatory stop.\u201d The court reasoned that because two dozen streets intersect Peace Haven in the 3.7 miles between the Quality Mart and Robinhood Road, the presence of the defendants\u2019 car at the Robinhood/Peace Haven intersection did not mean it came from the Quality Mart. The court further held that neither the condition of the car nor the circuitous route it took to the highway proved anything. And the court noted that although the driver fit the description of the suspect in that he had a light complexion and wore a black sweater, the police broadcast did not mention a second man or indicate that the suspect had a car \u2014 the suspect had last been seen on foot. The district court concluded that although this was a \u201cclose case,\u201d the stop was not based on reasonable suspicion, but only a good hunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">We agree with the district court that this is a very close case.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">The Supreme Court has held that when a police officer possesses a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity \u201cmay be afoot\u201d the Fourth Amendment permits a brief investigative stop of a vehicle, without probable cause of criminal activity. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Reviewing courts \u201cmust look at the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (citation omitted). This means that courts cannot engage \u201cin the sort of \u2018divide-and-conquer analysis\u2019 that treats each action by a defendant in isolation, finds each of them to be possibly innocent, and thus picks apart an officer\u2019s reasonable assessments.\u201d <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>363 F.3d 317, 327 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274-75).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">Given these generous standards of review and the district court\u2019s failure to consider the effect of one critical fact in assessing the totality of the circumstances, we must reverse its grant of the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">The district court examined the relevant evidence with commendable care except for its failure to give due weight to one important factor: the early morning hour. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure \u00a7 </em>9.4(g) at 206-07 (3d ed.1996). While the high volume of cars on the road at 4:30 <em>p.m. </em>render it somewhat unlikely that a car at the intersection originated at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Quality Mart, the few cars on the road at 4:80 <em>a.m. </em>significantly increase that probability. Similarly, while it may not be unusual for a driver not to acknowledge a marked police car driving next to him on a highway at 4:30 <em>p.m. </em>during rush hour, it may seem highly unusual for a driver to fail to acknowledge a marked police car driving right next to him on a highway at 4:30 <em>a.m. </em>when few, if any, other cars are on the road, and particularly when, as here, the police car had followed the driver for some time. <em>See Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 275-76 (\u201cWe think it quite reasonable that a driver\u2019s slowing down, stiffening of posture, and failure to acknowledge a sighted law enforcement officer might well be unremarkable in one instance (such as a busy San Francisco highway) while quite unusual in another (such as a remote portion of rural southeastern Arizona).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">No case is identical to that at hand. But we, and other courts, have upheld the reasonableness of investigatory stops in similar circumstances. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 757 (6th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>187 F.3d 210, 216-17 (1st Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Colelough, </em>549 F.2d 937, 940 (4th Cir.1977). We must conclude that the stop here was also reasonable, though an even closer case than some of those cited above, and withstands constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
