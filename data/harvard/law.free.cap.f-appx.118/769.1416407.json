With respect to his motion to vacate, properly deemed a motion for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), the order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas action requires a certificate of appealability). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that McSheffrey has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss that portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">With respect to the denial of McSheffrey\u2019s motions for the return of property and to inspect grand jury transcripts, we have reviewed the record and the court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. McSheffrey, </em>Nos. CR-92-76, CA-92-729 (E.D.Va. Mar. 29, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">McSheffrey also petitions this Court for a writ of mandamus seeking an order directing the district court to vacate its September 1992 order. Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). In seeking mandamus relief, McSheffrey carries the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate means to attain the relief sought and that his right to such relief is clear and indisputable. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). We find that McSheffrey has failed to meet this burden. Accordingly, we deny the mandamus petition. While we grant MeSheffrey\u2019s motions to file supplemental authorities pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) and to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, we deny his motions for oral argument, for clarification and/or more definite statement, and to place the case in abeyance for <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838, 2004 WL 1713654 <em>(cert. granted, </em>Aug. 2, 2004, argued Oct. 4, 2004) (No. 04-104), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838, 2004 WL 1713655 <em>(cert. granted, </em>Aug. 2, 2004, argued Oct. 4, 2004) (No. 04-105). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
