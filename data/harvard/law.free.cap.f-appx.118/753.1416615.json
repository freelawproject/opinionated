We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">In 1994, Walker was convicted of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and was sentenced to 105 months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release. In 2003, the district court revoked Walker\u2019s supervised release based on his admitted drug use. Because Walker\u2019s 1994 conviction is a Class C felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3), he was subject to a potential maximum term of imprisonment of 24 months for the supervised release violation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The probation officer noted this fact in Walker\u2019s violation report, and he also noted that under the applicable Policy Statement \u2014 -U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4\u2014 the guideline range for Walker\u2019s violation was 21 to 24 months because it is a Grade B violation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Without objection, the district court sentenced Walker to a term of 21 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">On appeal, Walker argues that his supervised release violation is a Grade C violation under \u00a7 7B1.4 and that his sentencing range therefore should have been 8-14 months. Because he did not present this argument in the district court, we review for plain error. Under the plain error standard, Walker must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even when these conditions are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">As a Chapter 7 Policy Statement, \u00a7 7B1.4 is a \u201cnon-binding advisory\u201d guide. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). Regardless of whether Walker\u2019s violation is classified under \u00a7 7B1.4 as a Grade B violation or a Grade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>C violation, the district court was authorized under \u00a7 8583(e)(3) to sentence him to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 24 months. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Walker has failed to establish that the district court plainly erred (if it erred at all) in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of 21 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-12\"> Because Walker\u2019s original criminal history category was Category VI, the range set forth for his Grade B violation in \u00a7 7B 1.4(a) is 21-27 months. However, pursuant to \u00a7 7B 1.4(b)(3)(A), the applicable range became 21-24 months because the sentence cannot be greater than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
