As to plaintiff-appellant Katherine Tonnas\u2019s first argument \u2014 that the evidence that she submitted to the district court creates a genuine issue of material fact as to the life insurance policy\u2019s beneficiary \u2014 we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgement, grounded in the reasons patiently, fully, and correctly set forth in its order dated May 20, 2004, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-23\">As to Tonnas\u2019s second argument concerning the district court\u2019s disbursement of the policy proceeds, she has waived it. She challenges the disbursement for the first time on this appeal. Those issues not raised before the district court are waived on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
