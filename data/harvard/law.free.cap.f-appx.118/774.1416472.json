Diagana challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to meet his burden of proof to qualify for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-21\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Diagana fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Diagana cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-22\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction over Diagana\u2019s challenge to the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture because he failed to properly exhaust this claim in his appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>73 U.S.L.W. 3135, \u2014 U.S. -, S.Ct.-, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. Aug. 23, 2004) (No. 04-256).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-25\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
