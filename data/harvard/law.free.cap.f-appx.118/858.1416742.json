Gloria de Nieto (Nieto\u2019s wife), and Jonathon Nieto (Nieto\u2019s son), have applied as riders on Nieto\u2019s applications. Nieto argues that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of past persecution by guerrilla forces based on his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-22\">When, as in this case, the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The record reflects that Nieto was persecuted for his failure to provide monetary and other assistance to Columbian guerrillas rather than for any personal political view. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The IJ\u2019s determination that Nieto had not shown that he was persecuted on political grounds is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Although Nieto identified the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim, he fails to address this issue in the body of his brief. Accordingly, the CAT claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986) (issues not briefed are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Nieto also argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by curtailing his testimony at the asylum hearing. The record reflects that the IJ was instructing counsel to ask Nieto specific questions. Nieto fails to explain what specific testimony the IJ precluded him from presenting. Nieto therefore has not made an initial showing of substantial prejudice with respect to this claim. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Nieto\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b883-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
