The district court sentenced Idema to four years imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>lease. The court also ordered Idema to pay a total of $200,000 in restitution to more than fifty victims of his fraud. Idema completed his term of imprisonment in September 1997 and his supervised release in September 2000. The government alleges that Idema has failed to make any restitution payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Beginning in September 2002, the government issued and served subpoenas on numerous individuals and entities allegedly associated with Idema to obtain information relating to his assets. Although the government designated the subpoenas as \u201ccivil\u201d in nature, the subpoenas were filed in Idema\u2019s criminal case. In 2003, the government applied for writs of continuing garnishment in Idema\u2019s criminal case to recover restitution on behalf of the private victims of Idema\u2019s fraud. The district court issued the writs of garnishment, which were then served on several entities thought to have possession of Idema\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Idema moved to quash the writs of garnishment and the subpoenas. Several recipients of the subpoenas joined in Idema\u2019s motion to quash the subpoenas. The district court denied both motions to quash, and Idema now appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to quash the writs of garnishment, and we dismiss for lack of standing Idema\u2019s appeal of the denial of the motion to quash the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Idema argues that the government may not seek to recover restitution in his underlying criminal case because the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d) divested the district court of jurisdiction over his criminal case by no later than the end of his supervised release in September 2000. Alternatively, Idema contends that the VWPA requires the government to file a separate civil action to recover restitution. In addition, he argues that the government is not permitted under the VWPA to seek recovery on behalf of private victims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">Idema argues that the VWPA divested the district court of jurisdiction in his criminal case in September 2000 when he completed his term of supervised release. Thus, he contends the writs of garnishment and the subpoenas were improperly issued. Idema\u2019s reliance on the time limitation provisions in the VWPA is misplaced for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">First, the VWPA provisions cited by Idema are not jurisdictional. The VWPA generally authorizes a district court to order restitution at sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1) (West 1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court may require restitution to be paid within a specified period, in specified installments, or immediately. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663(f)(1), (3). For the type of sentence imposed on Idema, if the court orders payment within a specified period or in installments, the end of the specified period or the last installment must be no later than five years after release from incarcer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663(f)(2)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This restitution provision simply requires the district court to ensure, if it determines that restitution should not be paid immediately, that the final payment be scheduled for no later than five years after incarceration ends. This provision does not limit the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to enforce its restitution order if the defendant fails to comply with its order and the restitution remains unsatisfied five years after the defendant completes his term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Second, the time limitations in the VWPA do not apply to this case because the district court ordered Idema to pay restitution immediately. The time limitations in \u00a7 3663(f) apply only when the district court schedules payments over time or by installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Idema was sentenced by the district court to pay the full amount of restitution immediately on January 11, 1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government claims that Idema has failed to comply with the court\u2019s order and that the restitution component of his sentence remains unsatisfied. The VWPA did not divest the district court of jurisdiction in Idema\u2019s criminal case to enforce its restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Idema also argues that the VWPA requires the government to file a separate civil action to enforce a restitution order. In support of this argument, he cites the VWPA provision allowing the government to enforce a restitution order \u201cin the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(h)(1)(B). We again find Idema\u2019s reliance on the VWPA misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">The VWPA is a criminal statute. It authorizes the district court to impose restitution at sentencing and also provides that an \u201corder of restitution may be enforced ... by the United States ... in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663(h)(1)(B). Although this provision allows the government to pursue restitution by using the same practices and procedures that would be available in a civil action, it does not purport to require the filing of a separate civil action to enforce an existing criminal sentence. Idema has offered no principled basis\u2014 and we have found none \u2014 to prohibit the government from seeking to enforce this restitution order against him in the same criminal case in which it was originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">Idema next argues that the government is not allowed under the VWPA to seek recovery on behalf of private victims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">The VWPA permits the district court at sentencing to order \u201cthat the defendant make restitution to any victim of [the defendant\u2019s] offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1). The Act further provides that an \u201corder of restitution may be enforced ... by the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663(h)(1). Thus, the VWPA authorizes the district court to award restitution to private victims, and it authorizes the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>eminent to take action to enforce a restitution order on behalf of private victims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We hold that the district court properly asserted jurisdiction in Idema\u2019s criminal case to issue writs of garnishment and entertain other proceedings by the government seeking to enforce the court\u2019s restitution order. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Idema\u2019s motion to quash the writs of garnishment obtained by the government in its attempt to enforce the restitution order on behalf of the private victims of Idema\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Idema also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to quash several subpoenas issued by the government to individuals and entities allegedly associated with him. Idema claims that the subpoenas do not comply with various requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Ordinarily, a party does not have standing to challenge a subpoena issued to a nonparty unless the party claims some personal right or privilege in the information sought by the subpoena. <em>Hertenstein v. Kimberly Home Health Care, Inc., </em>189 F.R.D. 620, 635 (D.Kan.1999); 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2459 (1995). Idema has failed to make any showing that he has a personal right to, or privilege in, the information being sought in the subpoenas. Thus, he lacks standing to contest whether the subpoenas were properly issued, and we dismiss this portion of his appeal. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>185 F.3d 183 (4th Cir.1999) (dismissing appeal for lack of standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Idema\u2019s motion to quash the writs of garnishment. We dismiss Idema\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to quash the subpoenas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">. The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act O'MVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, was enacted in 1996 and made effective to cases in which the defendant's conviction became final on or after April 24, 1996. Idema\u2019s conviction became final in 1995, so the government has not sought to invoke the provisions of the MVRA in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-15\">. The VWPA has been amended since 1995. All references to \u00a7 3663 in this opinion are to the language in effect in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">. Section 3663 has different deadlines for other types of sentences. For example, if probation is imposed, restitution payments cannot be scheduled to be paid after probation ends. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(f)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-10\">. This is Idema\u2019s second appeal. In the first appeal, we affirmed Idema\u2019s conviction but remanded the case to the district court to make findings of fact regarding the order of restitution. <em>United States v. Glosson, </em>83 F.3d 416 (4th Cir.1996) (unpublished). On remand, after making the necessary findings of fact, the district court ordered Idema to pay restitution immediately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\">. Idema also argues that the government is not authorized to recover restitution on behalf of private victims because the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act (''FDCPA\u201d) allows the government to seek recovery only of a debt \"owing to the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3002(3)(B). This argument lacks merit because it ignores the government\u2019s separate authority under the VWPA to enforce restitution orders on behalf of private victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a), (h). Moreover, the FDCPA specifically provides that it \"shall not be construed to curtail or limit the right of the United States under any other Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3003(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b768-25\">. We have also considered the other arguments raised on appeal by Idema and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
