Aeman contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for smuggling bulk cash out of the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a)(1), because the Government failed to prove that he knowingly concealed more than $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">\u201cThe verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This Court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burqos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court does not review the credibility of the witnesses and assumes that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the Government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">After careful consideration of the facts, and taking the view most favorable to the Government, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support Aeman\u2019s conviction. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a)(1); <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">Following Aeman\u2019s conviction, but prior to sentencing, Aeman filed a Motion to Vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to move for a mistrial following the erroneous admission of polygraph evidence at the Grand Jury proceedings. At sentencing, the district court denied the motion, finding that any error was cured because the trial jury returned a guilty verdict without any knowledge of inadmissable polygraph evidence. On appeal, Aeman contends that the district court erred by denying his initial \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits unless the appellant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The relevant inquiry is whether \u201c \u2018reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Aleman has not made the requisite showing. <em>United States v. Mechanik, </em>475 U.S. 66, 106 S.Ct. 938, 89 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986) (holding that an error in the grand jury proceedings was rendered harmless by petit jury\u2019s finding of guilt). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of Aleman\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Finally, we turn to Aleman\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion reiterating his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the indictment. The district court dismissed the motion without prejudice, stating that Aleman\u2019s notice of appeal in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion deprived it of jurisdiction. We note, however, that because Aleman previously filed a motion under \u00a7 2255, the second filing is properly construed as a successive motion for which he has not received authorization from this Court. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 205 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss appeal No. 04-7085 as well. <em>See Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 374 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004) (finding certificate of appealability necessary to appeal order denying \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">No. 04-4180 <em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">No. 04-7085 <em>DISMISSED</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
