See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b790-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b790-26\">Mohamed Osman, a native and citizen of Somalia, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board). The Board order affirmed without opinion the results of the immigration judge\u2019s decision. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-27\">Osman concedes that his asylum application was untimely, with no showing of changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5) (2004). In any case, we lack jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Osman\u2019s asylum application was untimely filed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Osman\u2019s claim that this Court can review the timeliness ruling as a habeas corpus claim, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), lacks merit, as Osman has not applied for habeas corpus relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 (2000). Further, this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a \u00a7 2241 application. <em>Dragenice v. Ridge, </em>389 F.3d 92, 100 (4th Cir.2004) (holding \u00a7 2241 does not confer authority on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>court of appeals to entertain a habeas petition). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of Osman\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">We do, however, retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of Osman\u2019s request for withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). To be eligible for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000), an alien must show that it is more likely than not that, if he is removed to his native country, his life or freedom would be threatened. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir.2004). Based on our review of the record, we find substantial evidence to support the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Osman has failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Accordingly, we deny Osman\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
