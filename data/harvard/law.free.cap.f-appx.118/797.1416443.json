Montoya\u2019s claim is unavailing because \u00a7 1915A \u201capplies regardless of whether the plaintiff has paid a filing fee or is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>\u201d. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 274-75 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-20\">Montoya claims the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion, which maintained the pendency of his state and federal habeas applications equitably tolled the two-year limitations period, rendering his civil rights complaint timely filed. Montoya has not demonstrat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>ed he was prevented from pursuing his \u00a7 1983 civil rights claims by the pendency of his state or federal habeas proceedings. <em>See Holmes v. Texas A &amp; M Univ., </em>145 F.3d 681, 684-85 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 257 (5th Cir.1993). The denial was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Midland West Corp. v. FDIC, </em>911 F.2d 1141, 1145 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Montoya cannot attack his disciplinary proceedings resulting in the loss of good time credits in a \u00a7 1983 action until his \u201cconvictions\u201d in those proceedings have been expunged, reversed, or otherwise set aside. <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998)(en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1151, 119 S.Ct. 1052, 143 L.Ed.2d 58 (1999). Because Montoya\u2019s claims call into question the validity of those convictions, he must satisfy the conditions of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 484-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), before he can proceed in a civil rights action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Accordingly, the dismissal is AFFIRMED, but the judgment is MODIFIED to state that his claims challenging his disciplinary convictions are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE to then-being asserted again until the <em>Heck </em>conditions are met. <em>Johnson v. McElveen, </em>101 F.3d 423, 424 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\"> Pursuant to 5th <em>Cir. </em>R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
