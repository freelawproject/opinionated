Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), action for failure to state a claim. Guerrero sued FCI Three Rivers; Manuel Ruano, the Health Services Administrator; and Lynn Weiss, a Health Services assistant, asserting that he was being denied eye surgery recommended by an ophthalmologist. The district court determined that Guerrero had not alleged personal involvement or supervisory liability on the part of any of the defendants. The district court also held that Guerrero had failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim based on deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-23\">Guerrero contends that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because the eye drops, acetaminophen, and eye glasses he received as treatment are insufficient to resolve the severe pain he is suffering. He asserts, for the first time on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>appeal, that Ruano has ignored his requests for eye surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Guerrero\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim de novo. <em>See Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998). <em>Bivens </em>provides a cause of action against federal agents only in their individual capacities and requires a showing of personal involvement. <em>Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, </em>164 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Thompson v. Steele, </em>709 F.2d 381, 382 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see Izen v. Catalina, </em>382 F.3d 566, 570 n. 3 (5th Cir.2004) (recognizing <em>Bivens </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions are analogous). Despite the district court\u2019s request for Guerrero to provide a more definite statement of \u201chow each defendant was personally involved in the alleged denial of medical care,\u201d Guerrero made no such allegations before the district court. We decline to consider Guerrero\u2019s assertion that Ruano ignored Guerrero\u2019s requests for eye surgery because it is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Guerrero\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Guerrero\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Guerrero is cautioned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
