The Travel Agents allege the conspir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>acy began in 1995 and ended by late summer 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Since the initial filing of this action on June 21, 2000, it has been dismissed, on varying grounds, against Alitalia, Delta Air Lines Global Services, Inc., Midway, and Lufthansa. The action has also been stayed against Air Canada, TWA, United, and U.S. Airways, based upon notices of bankruptcy filed by those airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The case proceeded against the remaining defendant-airlines (hereinafter collectively the Airlines): Airtran, Air France, Alaska, America West, American, Continental, Delta, Frontier, KLM, Midwest Express, and Northwest. After full discovery, the Airlines moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On October 30, 2003, in a lengthy published opinion, the district court examined the Travel Agents\u2019 proffered evidence against the Airlines and found no triable issue of fact. <em>Hall v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>296 F.Supp.2d 652 (E.D.N.C.2003). Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Airlines. Notably, the district court directed the clerk of court to enter final judgment in favor of the Airlines pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), which allows a district court to order the entry of final judgment as to less than all parties and all claims in an action when there is no just reason for delay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). The Travel Agents noted a timely appeal of this final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Moreover, in assessing the merits of a motion for summary judgment, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here the Travel Agents, and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-moving party\u2019s favor. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[ejvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. Therefore, to establish a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, as the Travel Agents have alleged, \u201ca plaintiff must show: (1) a contract, combination or conspiracy; (2) that imposed an unreasonable restraint of trade.\u201d <em>American Chiropractic Assn., Inc. v. Trigon Healthcare, Inc., </em>367 F.3d 212, 223 (4th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Significantly, purely unilateral action does not violate \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. <em>Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., </em>467 U.S. 752, 767-68, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984). Rather, concerted activity between at least two legally distinct persons or entities is at the heart of a \u00a7 1 Sherman Act violation. <em>American Chiropractic Assn., Inc., </em>367 F.3d at 223. To elaborate, \u201cconcerted activity susceptible to sanction by section 1 is activity in which multiple parties join their resources, rights, or economic power together in or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>der to achieve an outcome that, but for the concert, would naturally be frustrated by their competing interests (by way of profit-maximizing choices).\u201d <em>Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v. Historic Green Springs, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 277, 282 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We have carefully reviewed and considered the district court\u2019s opinion, the voluminous appellate record, and the parties\u2019 oral and written appellate arguments. We agree with the district court that the Travel Agents have not proffered sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to them and when drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, to support a finding of concerted activity by the Airlines, which finding is necessary to establish a \u00a7 1 Sherman Act violation. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Airlines, and we affirm entry of final judgment in favor of the Airlines on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Hall, </em>296 F.Supp.2d at 661-78, 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\">.
