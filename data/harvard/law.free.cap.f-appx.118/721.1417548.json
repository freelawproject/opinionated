On April 22, 2003, the Board Ordered that the Company pay employees Jerry Kennedy (\u201cKennedy\u201d) and Manuel Mantec\u00f3n (\u201cMantec\u00f3n\u201d) backpay with interest.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Board cross-applies for enforcement of its Order, and we have granted United Automobile, Aerospace <em>&amp; </em>Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\u201cthe Union\u201d) leave to intervene. Reviewing this case for an abuse of discretion, we defer to the findings of the Board and hold that the Board properly calculated and awarded backpay with interest. As explained below, we deny the Petitions for Review and grant the Cross-Applications for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">On June 30, 1997, we affirmed the Board\u2019s findings that the Company had violated sections 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), (3). We then remanded the case to the Board for a recalculation of backpay. <em>Performance Friction v. NLRB, </em>117 F.3d 763, 766 (1997). On November 24, 1998, the Board\u2019s Regional Director received evidence and heard argument before ordering the Company to provide backpay to both Kennedy and Mantec\u00f3n, along with four others. The Board calculated the amount of back-pay utilizing a \u201ccomparable or representative employee\u201d formula based on an average of eighteen employees who worked throughout the entire backpay period in comparable positions to Mantec\u00f3n and Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The Company now petitions for review of the decision challenging the Board\u2019s award of backpay on three fronts. First, the Company argues that \u201cKennedy and Mantecon\u2019s mendacious behaviors were a fraud on and a flagrant abuse of Board processes and therefore completely bar any backpay.\u201d Next, the Company argues that the Board improperly awarded back-pay without requiring Kennedy to prove that he mitigated his damages. Lastly, the Company contends that the calculation method was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">The disposition of this case turns solely on the application of the standard of review, which is settled law in this Circuit. The NLRA mandates that the Board\u2019s factual findings \u201cshall be conclusive\u201d so long as \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>Sam\u2019s Club v. NLRB, </em>173 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1999). Credibility determinations are given deference absent exceptional circumstances and are reviewed solely for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>467 U.S. 883, 898-99, 104 S.Ct. 2803, 81 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984). The Board\u2019s interpretation of the NLRA is deferred to so long as \u201creasonably defensible,\u201d <em>WXGI, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>243 F.3d 833, 840 (4th Cir.2001), and the Board\u2019s application of the law to the facts is reviewed solely to determine whether it is \u201csupported by substantial evidence based upon the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Sam\u2019s Club, </em>173 F.3d at 239. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Further, the Board\u2019s ordered remedy is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and will only be disturbed in the extraordinary circumstance where it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the [NLRA].\u201d <em>Coronet Foods v. NLRB, 158 </em>F.3d 782, 788 (4th Cir.1998) (internal quotations omitted); <em>ABF Freight Sys. v. NLRB, </em>510 U.S. 317, 324, 114 S.Ct. 835, 127 L.Ed.2d 152 (1994); <em>Aneco Inc. v. NLRB, </em>285 F.3d 326, 329 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In this Court\u2019s view, the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record, and there are no exceptional circumstances that warrant a finding that the Board abused its discretion. Consequently, we affirm the findings and conclusions of the Board. First, with respect to Mantecon\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s behavior, while \u201c[f]alse testimony in a formal proceeding is intolerable,\u201d <em>ABF Freight Sys., </em>510 U.S. at 323, the Board explicitly found that \u201cMantec\u00f3n did not make any intentional misleading statements.\u201d J.A. 526 n. 11. Here, there was neither exceptional circumstances, nor an abuse of discretion. Consequently, we defer to the Board\u2019s credibility determination. However, with respect to Kennedy, the Company argues that he purposely lied about his incarceration and efforts to mitigate, and should therefore be denied backpay. In <em>American Navigation Co. v. Adams, </em>the Board held that \u201cdiscriminatees found to have willfully concealed from the Board their interim employment will be denied backpay for all quarters in which they engaged in the employment so concealed.\u201d 1983 WL 24760, 268 N.L.R.B. 426, 427 (1983). Therefore, the Board appropriately withheld payment for the quarters corresponding to the term of Kennedy\u2019s incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Second, we conclude that any omission in the Board\u2019s Order with respect to Kennedy\u2019s mitigation efforts are attributable to the Company\u2019s failure to meet its burden of proof. While \u201cemployees who lose their jobs as a result of an unfair labor practice must mitigate their damages by making a \u2018reasonable effort to obtain interim employment,\u201d\u2019 <em>Aneco Inc., </em>285 F.3d at 330 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Coronet Foods, </em>158 F.3d at 800), the burden rests upon \u201cthe <em>employer who </em>committed an unfair labor practice to establish facts that reduce the amount due for gross backpay.\u201d <em>Minette Mills, Inc., </em>1995 WL 149236, 316 N.L.R.B. 1009,1010 (1995). The Company offered no evidence to justify a reduction in the amount of backpay awarded to Kennedy. The Company failed to meet its burden and, therefore, the Board did not abuse its discretion in awarding backpay to Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Third, backpay was calculated utilizing a comparable or representative employee formula based on an average of eighteen employees who worked throughout the entire backpay period in comparable positions to Mantec\u00f3n and Kennedy. The Board\u2019s calculation method was objectively reasonable based on substantial evidence and is entitled to deference. There has been no abuse of discretion. <em>See Coronet Foods, </em>158 F.3d at 800 (quoting <em>Bagel Bakers Council v. NLRB, </em>555 F.2d 304, 305 (2d Cir.1977) (finding that the Board\u2019s decision to \u201cproceed by one method rather than another hardly makes out a case of abuse of discretion\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Performance Friction Corporation\u2019s Petition for Review is denied; the Board\u2019s Cross-Application for Enforcement of its Decision and Order of April 22, 2003, is granted; the Intervenor Union\u2019s Petition for Review as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Mantec\u00f3n is denied, and the Intervenor Union\u2019s Application for Enforcement of the Board\u2019s decision as to Kennedy is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW IS DENIED; CROSS-APPLICATION FOR ENFORCEMENT IS GRANTED; INTERVENOR\u2019S PETITION FOR REVIEW IS DENIED; AND INTERVENOR\u2019S APPLICATION FOR ENFORCEMENT IS GRANTED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b747-10\"> The Board awarded Mantec\u00f3n backpay in the amount of $5,438 plus interest and awarded Kennedy backpay in the amount of $11,738 plus interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
