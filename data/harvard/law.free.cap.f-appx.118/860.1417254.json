She argues that the district court erred in departing upward from the sentencing guideline range of three to nine months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3), 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-21\">Considering that Stanphill\u2019s sentence for the offense of conviction was the result of a downward departure, an upward departure was authorized. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.4). The district court appropriately considered Stanphill\u2019s need for drug treatment, and the 36-month sentence was well below the statutory maximum imprisonment term of 20 years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 286-87 (5th Cir.1997). The sentence was therefore legal. <em>See Pena, </em>125 F.3d at 288. The district court did not plainly err or abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b884-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
