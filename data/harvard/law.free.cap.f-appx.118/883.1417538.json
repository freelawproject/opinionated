Sheikh and her husband, Mirza A. Baig, remained in the United States beyond their voluntary departure date, and the BIA held that they were statutorily ineligible for an adjustment of status and denied a motion to reopen. Sheikh contends that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist to excuse her failure to depart under voluntary departure, thereby warranting the reopening of the proceedings. She further argues that the BIA violated due process by denying the motion to reopen before the Immigration and Naturalization Service responded to a request for an extension of the voluntary departure date.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-23\">Sheikh\u2019s brief is nearly identical to the brief filed by Baig in a separate petition for review, which we have already denied. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons previously articulated in Baig\u2019s appeal, Sheikh\u2019s petition for review is denied. <em>See Baig v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-60592 (5th Cir. Aug.25, 2004)(unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-24\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
