California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Hidalgo-Peralta has received a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and brief but has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Our independent review of the record discloses one possible nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Hidalgo-Peralta may have an argument that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) invalidates his sentence. However, Hidalgo-Peralta\u2019s sentence was based on the statutory minimum sentence, not the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and this court has held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 14, 2004). Nonetheless, counsel could have raised a potential <em>Blakely </em>issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review. <em>See McKnight v. General Motors Corp., </em>511 U.S. 659, 660, 114 S.Ct. 1826, 128 L.Ed.2d 655 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Because our independent review of the record has revealed this possible nonfiivolous issue for appeal, we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. By denying the motion to withdraw, Hidalgo-Peralta has preserved the <em>Blakely </em>issue for further review. We pretermit further briefing, however, in light of <em>Pineiro, </em>and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b888-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
