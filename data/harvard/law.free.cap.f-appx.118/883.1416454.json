Valenti, Ms. Catherine Lam-berg, and Ms. Cynthia Wiggins. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated their constitutional rights by building and operating their subsidized housing on a waste site, thus creating horrible living conditions, and \u201cretaliating\u201d against plaintiffs. Although plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint did not cite 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the district, court construed their pro se compliant liberally and found that their allegations might be construed as being brought under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-22\">The district court gave plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint against Mr. Carmen F. Valenti, Ms. Catherine Lamberg and Ms. Cynthia Wiggins, all employees of the Housing Authority of New Orleans, to plead facts sufficient to overcome their defense of qualified immunity. <em>See Schultea v. Wood, </em>47 F.3d 1427 (5th Cir.1995). After considering all of plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent filings the district court found that plaintiffs had not pleaded facts sufficient to make out such a claim, or any other federal claim, and dismissed their claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Upon a review of the record we find that plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to establish any federal cause of action and the district court therefore properly dismissed their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b908-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
