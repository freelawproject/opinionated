Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996), a prisoner who has had three or more actions or appeals dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, may not proceed without prepayment of fees unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (2000). The district court, in rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Lewis\u2019 motion to proceed under the PLRA, determined Lewis previously had at least three actions or appeals dismissed as frivolous or for failing to state a claim. Two of the actions relied upon by the district court were civil rights complaints that were in fact dismissed by the district court for failure to state a claim. <em>See Lewis v. Angelone, </em>No. CV-02-317 (E.D.Va. Nov. 5, 2002); <em>Lewis v. Angelone, </em>No. CV-00-161 (E.D.Va. May 16, 2001). However, the other two actions the district court cited were not qualifying dismissals. <em>See In re Lewis, </em>2002 WL 31430531 (4th Cir. Oct.31, 2002) (No. 02-7275) (unpublished); <em>In re Lewis, </em>2002 WL 214558 (4th Cir. Feb.12, 2002) (No. 01-7795) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">However, because Lewis is proceeding without prepayment of fees, this Court shall dismiss the appeal if the action fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000). It plainly appears from the face of the complaint that it is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Accordingly, while we grant Lewis\u2019 motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauper-is, we dismiss the appeals for failing to state a claim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions of the parties are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">We note because Lewis initiated these appeals while he was incarcerated and they are dismissed for failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, the appeals count as \"strikes\u201d three and four with respect to \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, should Lewis find himself incarcerated again and file a civil lawsuit in federal court, he will be subject to the filing fee limitations imposed by \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
