We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-21\">Berry was charged with conspiring to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846 (West 1999) (Count One); distributing more than 50 grams of cocaine base, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (West 1999) (Count Two); and distributing more than five grams of cocaine base, <em>see id. </em>(Count Three). The indictment also contained a notice alleging the Government was entitled to forfeiture of at least $10,000 of Berry\u2019s assets. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-22\">Berry pled guilty to all three counts without a plea agreement. The Government then proffered that Berry\u2019s offenses included the sale of 56.4 grams of cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>base for $1,800 and the sale of 12.9 grams of cocaine base for $475. Later the same day, the district court entered an order documenting the forfeiture of $10,000 to the United States. The district court clerk subsequently entered a judgment against Berry for the $10,000 forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The district court sentenced Berry to 120-month terms of imprisonment on Counts One and Two and a 108-month term on Count Three, all to be served concurrently. The court also imposed concurrent five-year terms of supervised release and ordered Berry to pay a $5,000 fine. Although the fine amount was below the $15,000-to-$10,000,000 range prescribed by the guidelines, <em>see United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(e) (2002); 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), (B) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2004), the court found that Berry would not be able to satisfy a fine in the guideline range. The district court also ordered that as a special condition of Berry\u2019s supervised release, he would forfeit the property specified in the forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Berry contends that the district court erred in ordering him to forfeit $10,000 in the absence of evidence linking assets in that amount to his drug trafficking crimes. He concedes that he never objected to the order and thus that we should conduct plain error review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">Our authority to correct forfeited errors is granted by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), which provides that \u201c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d In order to establish our authority to notice an error not preserved by timely objection, Berry must demonstrate that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if Berry can satisfy these requirements, correction of the error remains within our discretion, which we \u201cshould not exercise ... unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks <em>&amp; </em>alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Here, even if we assume that ordering the forfeiture constituted plain error, Berry cannot demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights, <em>ie., </em>that it was prejudicial. <em>See id. </em>at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir.1998) (explaining that an error is prejudicial when it \u201cactually affected the outcome of the proceedings\u201d). That is so because the amount of the fine imposed was based on Berry\u2019s ability to pay, and the fine and the forfeiture were part of the single, integrated sentence. Berry has failed to show that any reduction in the amount of the forfeiture would not simply have resulted in a commensurate increase in the amount of the fine imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In sum, because Berry has failed to show that he was prejudiced by the issuance of the forfeiture order he challenges, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. The Government maintains that Berry waived review of the forfeiture order by virtue of his guilty plea and his failure to contest the Government\u2019s forfeiture allegation. The Government therefore contends that we should not review the forfeiture order even for plain error. In light of our conclusion that Berry cannot satisfy the plain error requirements, we do not address this waiver argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-12\">. We note that even were we to hold that Berry demonstrated plain error affecting his substantial rights, we would decline to exercise our discretion to notice the error under the specific facts of this case. Berry was aware of the forfeiture order and was the person best positioned to know whether it was based in fact, yet he did not challenge it when given the opportunity; the forfeiture did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>the Eighth Amendment; and, Berry will be able, via 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2004) motion, to challenge his counsel\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b771-7\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">I respectfully dissent. I would hold that the district court committed plain error in imposing a forfeiture on Berry without the required \u201cfactual nexus\u201d between the forfeiture amount and his drug crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Criminal forfeiture is authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853, which provides for the forfeiting of property \u201cconstituting, or derived from any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\u2019 certain controlled substance violations. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(1) (1999). Property \u201cused, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of\u2019 such a violation is likewise subject to forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 853(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">In <em>Libretti v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 29, 116 S.Ct. 356, 133 L.Ed.2d 271 (1995), the Supreme Court considered 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853 and held that criminal forfeiture \u201cis less a substantive offense and more an element of the offender\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>116 F.3d 948, 950 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <em>Libretti </em>516 U.S. at 39, 116 S.Ct. 356). Because forfeiture is part of the sentence, the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 do not apply. <em>Libretti </em>516 U.S. at 39-41, 116 S.Ct. 356. \u201cThis does not mean, however, that the government can forfeit assets for the asking.\u201d <em>White, </em>116 F.3d at 950. Rather, the <em>Libretti </em>Court made clear that \u201c \u00a7 853 limits forfeiture by establishing a factual nexus requirement: Only <em>drug-tainted </em>assets may be forfeited.\u201d 516 U.S. at 42, 116 S.Ct. 356 (emphasis added). Thus, the Government must establish a connection between the forfeited property and the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2, which governs the procedure for the forfeiture of assets in a criminal case, confirms this requirement. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-17\">If the government seeks a personal money judgment, the court must determine the amount of money that the defendant will be ordered to pay. The court\u2019s determination may be based on evidence already in the record, including any written plea agreement or, if the forfeiture is contested, on evidence presented by the parties at a hearing after the verdict or finding of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjWY\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(1). <em>Libretti </em>noted that a district court did not have to accept a defendant\u2019s agreement to forfeit property, \u201cparticularly when the agreement is not accompanied by a stipulation of facts supporting forfeiture, or when the trial judge for other reasons finds the agreement problematic.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 519 U.S. at 43, 117 S.Ct. 417. It also stated that in the case before it \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>need not determine the precise scope of a district court\u2019s independent obligation, if any, to inquire into the propriety of a stipulated asset forfeiture embodied in a plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, this was because \u201cthere is ample evidence that the District Court both understood the statutory requisites for criminal forfeiture and concluded that they were satisfied on the facts of this case at the time the sentence was imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 117 S.Ct. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">As the majority notes, because Berry did not object to the order of forfeiture, the district court\u2019s decision to impose forfeiture in the amount of $10,000 is reviewed for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Fant, </em>974 F.2d 559, 564 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In this case, there were no \u201cstipulated facts\u201d concerning forfeiture for the district court to consider because Berry did not plead guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. The district court judge also did not make any inquiry into what facts supported the forfeiture of $10,000. Similarly, the Government did not proffer any evidence to support a forfeiture of that amount. In short, no evidence supported a factual nexus between the drug crimes to which Berry pled guilty and the $10,000 forfeiture amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of the clear language of \u00a7 853, Rule 32.2, and the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Libretti, </em>this was \u201cerror\u201d under prong one of the plain error analysis as set out in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). This error was also \u201cplain\u201d under prong two because <em>Libretti </em>explicitly stated that \u00a7 853 included a factual nexus requirement. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (explaining that \u201cplain\u201d is synonymous with clear or equivalently obvious); <em>United States v. Neal, </em>101 F.3d 993, 998 (4th Cir.1996) (explaining that an error is clear or equivalently obvious \u201cif the settled law of the Supreme Court or this circuit establishes that an error has occurred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Although such error occurred, Berry must also demonstrate that the error affected his \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d In most cases, this means that the error must have been prejudicial in that it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. The majority reasons that any error did not affect Berry\u2019s substantial rights because his forfeiture and his fine were part of a single, integrated sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>in which the district court judge assessed a lower fine amount than that authorized by statute and the Sentencing Guidelines. However, in imposing a smaller fine, the district court judge specifically noted at sentencing: \u201cThe Court finds that you are without the ability to satisfy a fine in the prescribed range or pay interest.\u201d J.A. 36. This finding was in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2, which gives a court authority to impose a smaller fine if the defendant establishes that he is unable or not likely to become able to pay all of the required fine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The judge then noted that, \u201cYou will forfeit property to the United States as specified in the final order of forfeiture.\u201d J.A. 36. The judge did not mention the $10,000 forfeiture amount or tie that forfeiture amount to his finding that Berry was without the ability to pay the fine. Thus, neither the judge\u2019s findings at sentencing nor other evidence in the record support the majority\u2019s assertion that a reduction in the amount of forfeiture may have resulted in a commensurate increase in the amount of fine imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336 (4th Cir.2002), supports a finding that this error affected Berry\u2019s substantial rights. In <em>Maxwell, </em>the court conducted plain error review when a judge sentenced a defendant to a longer term of supervised release than that allowed by statute. 285 F.3d at 339. After finding that prongs one and two of <em>Olano </em>were met, the court found that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights because \u201cthe terms and conditions of supervised release are a substantial imposition on a person\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342. Likewise, the forfeiture here is a term of Berry\u2019s supervised release. It is a term that will likely subject Berry to much financial hardship and also restrain him because he is now subject to a $10,000 debt after he serves his sentence-a considerable amount. Therefore, I would find that the district court\u2019s imposition of the $10,000 forfeiture as a condition of Berry\u2019s supervised release, without any evidence suggesting that such a forfeiture amount was correct, affected Berry\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The last consideration, whether this error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings, is usually more difficult to demonstrate. However, our holding in <em>Maxwell </em>suggests that it may be \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d to uphold a plain error that substantially affects one\u2019s rights during a sentencing proceeding, when a resentencing can easily occur.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\">the restrictions on a person\u2019s liberty while serving a term of supervised release are quite substantial. To refuse to order a resentencing when a defendant will be required to endure such restrictions on his liberty, including restrictions on his ability to travel, for nearly a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>year longer than required by law, strikes us as fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVOe\"><em>Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d at 342-43. Similarly, it is \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d to subject Berry to a $10,000 forfeiture when the terms of his supervised release can be easily modified at resentencing. In this regard it is entirely reasonable to view a $10,000 forfeiture as just as, if not more, onerous than subjecting one to an additional eleven months of supervised release as in <em>Maxwell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Yet, aside from this \u201cfundamental unfairness,\u201d this case involves broader concerns. In <em>Libretti, </em>the Court recognized that it had previously found that broad forfeiture provisions, such as 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853, \u201ccarry the potential for Government abuse and \u2018can be devastating when used unjustly.\u2019 \u201d 516 U.S. at 43, 116 S.Ct. 356 (quoting <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, </em>491 U.S. 617, 634, 109 S.Ct. 2646, 105 L.Ed.2d 528 (1989)). \u201cNonetheless, [it] concluded that \u2018[c]ases involving particular abuses can be dealt with individually by the lower courts, when (and if) any such cases arise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Caplin &amp; Drydale, </em>491 U.S. at 635, 109 S.Ct. 2667). Because the facts of this case indicate that the Government imposed a forfeiture amount arbitrarily and without any factual nexus whatsoever to the drug crimes in question, I conclude that this is such a case of abuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">I believe such abuse seriously affects the fairness, integrity and public reputation of judicial proceedings. First, this overreaching implicates both the fairness and public reputation of our judicial system because it undermines a system that is built on finding facts only through evidence as well as on following procedural safeguards adequate to protect the public\u2019s rights. Second, and equally important, is that the forfeiture amount was imposed neither with any judicial finding that such an amount was appropriate nor any evidence in the record to justify a $10,000 forfeiture. In this regard, this case directly and seriously affects the integrity of our judicial system, a system in which the judge must be the arbiter of such forfeiture findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Accordingly, as I would find that it was plain error to subject Berry to a $10,000 forfeiture without establishing a factual nexus between this amount and his drug crimes, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-13\">. The preponderance of the evidence standard governs forfeiture questions. <em>United States v. Tanner, </em>61 F.3d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-14\">. The Government urges us to read this statement to mean that while the district court does not have to rely upon a stipulation in a written plea agreement, it has the discretion to accept the Government\u2019s proffered forfeiture amount in the absence of any plea agreement. Appellee's Br. at 17. Such an interpretation goes beyond the holding of <em>Libretti </em>and is implausible in light of the <em>Libretti </em>Court\u2019s reiteration that \u00a7 853 requires a \"factual nexus.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">. While the majority declines to reach the Government\u2019s argument that Berry waived review of the forfeiture order by pleading guilty, I would find that a waiver did not occur. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding that forfeiture is part of a defendant\u2019s sentence and not a substantive charge, <em>Libretti, </em>516 U.S. at 39-41, 116 S.Ct. 356, forecloses the Government\u2019s argument that Berry\u2019s guilty plea acted as a waiver to his right to challenge the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The Government also fails to demonstrate why this court should treat Beriy\u2019s failure to object to his forfeiture amount differently from a failure to object to any other part of his sentence. For example, if the Government gave Berry notice that it planned to seek an upward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines and the district court imposed such departure without objection, Berry\u2019s argument on appeal that such a departure was unwarranted would clearly be subject to plain error review. I fail to see how the absence of an objection to the amount of forfeiture is distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-12\">. The record does not reveal any reason that the forfeiture amount was set at $10,000. The Presentence Investigation Report, issued on December 3, 2003, indicated that Berry had $15 in known assets and $212 in unsecured debt. Given that Berry's charged drug transactions only amounted to $2,275, it appears that the Government may have set this amount arbitrarily. At oral argument, the Assistant United States Attorney admitted that the record does not reflect how the $10,000 amount was calculated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">. There is some authority that unobjected to errors in sentencing should be reviewed with a less deferential standard as the costs of resentencing are lower than the costs of retrial. In <em>United States v. Sofsky, </em>287 F.3d 122 (2d Cir.2002), the Second Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">We have also noted that noticing unobjected to errors that occur at trial precipitates an entire new trial that could have been avoided by a timely objection, whereas correcting a sentencing error results in, at most, only a remand for resentencing, or as, in this case, for a modification of the allegedly erroneous condition of supervised release. Accordingly, although the Government is correct that plain error review applies, it appears that in the sentencing context there are circumstances that permit us to relax the otherwise rigorous standards of plain error review to correct sentencing errors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. By using the term \"abuse,\u201d I do not mean to suggest that the Government acted with any animus towards Berry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
