The regular foreman of plaintiff\u2019s gang was out in the yard, and the laborer who spoke to plaintiff acted as foreman of the gang and would tell them what the foreman of the machine-shop said he wanted done. Plaintiff was a good workman, and had been employed by defendant since November, 1882. The frame weighed about 1,200 pounds. The regular foreman of the plaintiff\u2019s gang did not know about the truck in question being used before for that purpose; he would not allow it to be so used until after two 'other trucks were broken. There formerly was, besides a two-wheel wagon, a larger truck, which was used when they had to move a heavy frame. The one in question was like a common cotton truck, and was not large enough for this purpose; plaintiff\" had known of it for a long time; it had been used at least twice before for moving this frame, but it was insufficient for the purpose; the frame' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>on account of its weight was easy to slip or dump off\u2019. The frame was longer than the truck and a little broader. In moving it, the truck handles might be got hold of, but with risk of mashing fingers. They had no better truck for this purpose; plaintiff testified that they had no other, and that the frame was placed on it as securely as possible. After the injury, this frame was moved with the two-wheel wagon. The truck was not insufficient if managed right; they had to try to get it as near on a balance as possible. Plaintiff appeared to be careful; the work did not seem to be dangerous. Besides himself, three other men were moving the truck at the time of the injury, Harrison, Thompson and the laborer who received the order from the foreman of the machine-shop. Harrison had been on the gang only two or three days. Thompson\u2019s wrist was somewhat weakened from once having been broken, but he did work requiring strength. The foreman of the gang and perhaps others of defendant\u2019s servants knew of this weak wrist; plaintiff did not know. \"Whenever there was anything to be done, they called on each other for help, and in that way they got together around this frame; plaintiff' and Thompson were pulling, the other two pushing the truck. It was common labor, not requiring skill. Pour men were insufficient to move the frame with the truck, but they had previously done so. Plaintiff' did not ask for more help; they would have told him they did not see where it was necessary, as they had moved the frame before. They had to go with a rush ten or fifteen feet up an inclined plane into the blacksmith-shop, through a passage four or five feet wide. The floor of the shop was concrete, uneven and worn with holes. Imbedded in it near the anvil was a piece of iron used to throw other pieces of iron on. Plaintiff had never noticed it, though he had been through the shop enough to be familiar with it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>piece of iron was not easy to see, being in a shadow. The truck wheel struck it, tilted the truck and threw the frame off, mashing plaintiff\u2019s foot and rendering necessary the amputation of his great toe and three other toes. He suffered great pain and still suffers ; is not able to wear a shoe long. The loss of the toes will probably impair his ability to stand long without pain. He incurred certain specified expenses for physician, nurse, medicine, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">On motion, the court granted a nonsuit, and exception was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-6\">Garrard &amp; Meldrim, Charlton &amp; Mackall and Denmark, Adams &amp; Adams, for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMb\">cited Code, \u00a72088; 77 <em>Ga. </em>82; 80 <em>Ga. </em>809; 13 Am.

No negligence on the part of the railroad company was shown by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. The work in which the plaintiff was engaged at the time he was hurt was an ordinary laborer\u2019s work; and he had been employed by the cempany for several years and knew all about the work, and it is to be presumed that he took the risk of any danger incident thereto. He complains that there were not sufficient men employed in the work he was engaged in to perform it safely and securely; but he knew this before he commenced his work, and yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>made no complaint to those in authority. Another complaint is that the truck, which was an ordinary cotton truck, was insufficient for the purpose of performing the work safely; and yet he showed by his testimony that he was aware of this defect and made no complaint in reference thereto. He alleges that while the truck was being pushed into the defendant\u2019s blacksmith-shop, the wheel struck an obstruction, thereby causing an iron frame which was on the truck to fall off and on to the plaintiff\u2019s foot, which was badly mashed; yet he did not show by any testimony he introduced wherein there was any negligence on the part of the defendant or any co-employee of his. This seems to be one of those casualties which arise in every business employment, and for which no one seems to be to blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
