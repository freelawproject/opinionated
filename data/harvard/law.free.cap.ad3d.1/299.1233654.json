Metz, a former corporate officer of the defunct defendant Bechtoldt Corporation (hereinafter Bechtoldt), established through her testimony that the assignment of leases made by Bechtoldt to Metz and another person was for a legitimate business purpose, and was fair and reasonable to Bechtoldt <em>(see Norlin Corp. v Rooney, Pace Inc., </em>744 F2d 255, 265 [1984]). The assignment was made by Bechtoldt, as the managing agent for certain cooperative apartment corporations, for the purpose of enabling Metz to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>commence summary proceedings, inter alia, for the nonpayment of rent by delinquent tenants of the respective cooperatives. Thus, Metz made a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact that the assignment was unlawful <em>(see </em>Business Corporation Law \u00a7 720 [a] [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"AcgoO\">The plaintiffs remaining contentions either are academic or without merit. Santucci, J.E, S. Miller, McGinity and Schmidt, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
