In addition, Truberry appeals from the denial of its motion for summary judgment. Because a genuine issue of material fact precludes summary judgment to Keenan, we reverse that aspect of the court\u2019s judgment. Because the denial of Truberry\u2019s motion for summary judgment is not a final, appealable order, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of that aspect of Truberry\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 2} In 2000, Truberry was hired to construct a new home for Harold McClune. Truberry served as the general contractor for the construction project and subcontracted with Keenan to frame the home; another subcontractor, Circelli, was to install the plumbing. As part of its framing duties, Keenan was responsible for installing a temporary prefabricated staircase from the structure\u2019s first floor to the basement. Keenan installed the prefabricated staircase by attaching the top riser of the stairs to the first floor joist using approximately four to five nails in a straight or slightly staggered line. The bottom of the staircase was supported by two-by-fours attached to both sides of the stringers, which vertically extended to the floor joist.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 3} On May 1, 2000, the temporary staircase collapsed as Circelli and McClune descended it. Circelli fell approximately 12 feet to the basement ground and, as a result, sustained physical injuries. On March 22, 2002, plaintiffs filed suit in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas against Keenan and Truberry, alleging that (1) Keenan had \u201cnegligently installed the collapsed stairs giving rise to [Frank Circelli\u2019s] injuries\u201d and that (2) Truberry had violated its duty to keep the construction premises safe and, further, had either negligently installed the stairs or had caused them to be negligently installed. Truberry and Keenan filed cross-claims for indemnification and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 4} Truberry and Keenan each moved for summary judgment on all claims, and plaintiffs moved for summary judgment against Keenan on the negligence claim. The trial court ultimately entered a judgment entry denying Truberry\u2019s and plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment, granting Keenan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and finding \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The trial court granted summary judgment to Keenan because it found that Keenan did not owe Circelli an affirmative duty under R.C. 4101.11. Moreover, even if Keenan owed Circelli a duty of ordinary care, the trial court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether Keenan had used less than ordinary care in installing the prefabricated staircase. Accordingly, the court found Keenan entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim and Truberry\u2019s cross-claim for indemnification. In the same decision and entry, the trial court denied Truberry\u2019s motion for summary judgment because it found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Truberry had actively participated in Circelli\u2019s work, which in turn created a genuine issue about whether Truberry, pursuant to R.C. 4101.11, owed Circelli an affirmative duty to keep the construction site in a reasonably safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 6} On August 24, 2005, plaintiffs and Truberry filed a joint notice of appeal. Plaintiffs assigns a single error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Defendant-Appellee Keenan Construction by misapplying R.C. 4101.11, the Frequenter Statute, finding that Keenan Construction did not owe a duty to Plaintiff-Appellant Frank Circelli and that Keenan Construction was not negligent in their installation of the staircase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Truberry assigns two errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">1. The trial court erred in denying Appellant Truberry Group\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment against Appellee Frank Circelli in the Decision and Entry filed on June 15, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">2. The trial court erred in granting Appellee Keenan Construction\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment against Appellant Truberry Group in the Decision and Entry filed on June 15, 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 7} An appellate court\u2019s review of summary judgment is conducted under a de novo review. <em>Koos v. Cent. Ohio Cellular, Inc. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 579, 588, 641 N.E.2d 265, citing <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. We apply the same standard as the trial court and conduct an independent review, without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Maust v. Bank One Columbus, N.A. </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 103, 107, 614 N.E.2d 765; <em>Brown </em>at 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment if any of the grounds that the movant raised before the trial court support the judgment. <em>Coventry Twp. v. Ecker </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 38, 41-42, 654 N.E.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">{\u00b6 8} Summary judgment is appropriate only where (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>as a matter of law; and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, that conclusion being adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. A party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record * * * which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">{\u00b6 9} Since plaintiffs\u2019 single assignment of error and Truberry\u2019s second assignment of error are functionally equivalent, they will be discussed together. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are that (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Keenan because R.C. 4101.11 does not preclude plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim and (2) because Keenan owed Circelli a duty of ordinary care, a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether Keenan breached that duty by installing the prefabricated staircase in a substandard fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[I]n order to establish actionable negligence, one seeking recovery must show the existence of a duty, the breach of the duty, and injury resulting proximately therefrom.\u201d <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 285, 21 O.O.3d 177, 423 N.E.2d 467. R.C. 4101.11, commonly referred to, with its companion provisions, as the \u201cfrequenter\u201d statutes, imposes an affirmative duty upon an employer to keep its property in a reasonably safe condition for the welfare of its employees and frequenters of the workplace. An independent contractor, however, \u201cwho lacks a contractual relationship with a second independent contractor owes no affirmative duty beyond that of ordinary care to the employees of the second contractor, where the first contractor does not supervise or actively participate in the second contractor\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Kucharski v. Natl. Engineering Contracting Co. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 430, 633 N.E.2d 515, syllabus. As a result, even when two or more independent contractors are engaged in work on the same premises that does not implicate the frequenter statute, the first independent contractor owes a duty in prosecuting its work to use ordinary and reasonable care not to cause injuries to the employees of the second contractor. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 11} Here, Circelli was the plumbing subcontractor and Keenan was the framing subcontractor for Truberry, the general contractor. As the trial court correctly concluded, Keenan did not owe Circelli an affirmative duty under R.C. 4101.11 because Keenan was an independent subcontractor that did not employ, contract with, supervise, or actively participate in Circelli\u2019s plumbing work. Keenan, however, owed Circelli a duty of ordinary care arising from his spatial relationship to Circelli on the construction site. Although the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>also found insufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that Keenan had breached its duty of ordinary care to Circelli, the record contains evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, suggesting that Keenan did not use ordinary care in installing the prefabricated staircase.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 12} According to the evidence submitted with the summary-judgment motions, the staircase collapsed because the top riser of the stair split across the grain of the wood. Plaintiffs presented deposition testimony explaining that a contractor should stagger nails into a riser when attaching a prefabricated staircase to a floor joist because the staggering reduces the likelihood that the riser will split. Additional deposition testimony reveals that Keenan only slightly staggered the nails into the riser when it installed the staircase. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence creates a genuine issue as to whether staggered nailing is the appropriate standard of care required in installing a prefabricated staircase and whether Keenan, in fact, installed the staircase in such manner. Such issues preclude summary judgment in favor of Keenan. Plaintiffs\u2019 single assignment of error and Truberry\u2019s second assignment of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 13} Truberry\u2019s first assignment of error contends that the trial court erred in denying Truberry\u2019s motion for summary judgment against plaintiffs. Truber-ry asserts that it was not negligent as a matter of law because it did not owe a duty to Circelli, its subcontractor, by virtue of its supervisory capacity as general contractor. Before we address the merits of Truberry\u2019s first assignment of error, we first must address whether the trial court\u2019s denial of Truberry\u2019s motion for summary judgment is a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 14} An appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to the review of \u201cjudgments or final orders\u201d of lower courts. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; R.C. 2501.02; <em>Stevens v. Ackman </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 182, 185, 743 N.E.2d 901. \u201c[T]he entire concept of \u2018final orders-\u2019 is based upon the rationale that the court making an order which is not final is thereby retaining jurisdiction for further proceedings. A final order, therefore, is one disposing of the whole case or some separate and distinct branch thereof.\u201d <em>Noble v. Colwell </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 540 N.E.2d 1381, quoting <em>Lantsberry v. Tilley Lamp Co. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 303, 306, 56 O.O.2d 179, 272 N.E.2d 127. \u201cA judgment that leaves issues unresolved and contemplates that further action must be taken is not a final appealable order.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Keith v. McMonagle, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 430, 816 N.E.2d 597, 2004-Ohio-5580, at \u00b6 4, quoting <em>Bell v. Horton </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 694, 696, 756 N.E.2d 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 15} An order adjudicating one or more but fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties must meet the requirements of R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54(B) in order to be final and appealable. <em>Noble, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>supra. Even if a trial court includes Civ.R. 54(B) language that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay,\u201d we are without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and must dismiss it without reaching the merits if the order is not a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02. <em>Noble, </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 96, 540 N.E.2d 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 16} Generally, the denial of a motion for summary judgment does not constitute a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 and thus is not subject to immediate appeal. <em>Stevens, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 186, 743 N.E.2d 901. A denial of a motion for summary judgment neither determines an action nor prevents a judgment; therefore, unless the order fits into one of the categories set forth in R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) through (6), the order is not final and appealable. See <em>Celebrezze v. Netzley </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 89, 90, 554 N.E.2d 1292. Truberry asserts that the order is final and appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) provides that an order is final when the order \u201caffects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment^]\u201d A substantial right is a legal right that is entitled to enforcement and protection by law. <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 88, 541 N.E.2d 64; see R.C. 2505.02(A)(1) (defining a \u201csubstantial right\u201d as \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect\u201d). An order affecting a substantial right is \u201cone which, if not immediately appealable, would foreclose appropriate relief in the future.\u201d <em>Bell v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 60, 63, 616 N.E.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 18} Truberry contends that the trial court\u2019s decision affects its substantial procedural right to adjudication as a matter of law under Civ.R. 56. Even if we agree that summary judgment as a rule of procedure is a \u201csubstantial right\u201d under R.C. 2505.02, we are unclear how the trial court\u2019s denying the motion \u201cdetermines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d See R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). The trial court\u2019s ruling did not prevent Truberry from obtaining a final judgment in its favor; rather, Truberry still has the right to contest its liability in the future. Since the portion of the trial court\u2019s order denying Truberry summary judgment did not determine Truberry\u2019s claim or prevent Truberry from obtaining judgment in its favor in the future, it does not qualify as a final order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). As a result, we lack jurisdiction to pass upon the merits of Truberry\u2019s contentions. Accordingly, Truberry\u2019s first assignment of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 19} Having sustained plaintiffs\u2019 single assignment of error and Truberry\u2019s second assignment of error, and having dismissed Truberry\u2019s first assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>error for lack of a final, appealable order, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-6\">Petree and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
