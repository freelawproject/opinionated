Appellant, Christopher 0. Bivens, appeals this judgment and asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cThe trial court erred by not finding that the Ohio Board of EMT\u2019s [sic] revocation order of 10/18/99 was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court erred by not finding that the Ohio Board of EMT [sic] erred in finding the revocation order of 2/18/99 was not in accordance with the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 4} In 1998, appellant was an EMT with the city of Sandusky Fire Department. On November 19,1998, the Erie County Grand Jury indicted appellant on two counts involving sexual activity with a minor child, specifically, a 14-year-old girl. Appellant was subsequently found guilty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of an amended charge of assault, a misdemeanor of the first degree. Appellant\u2019s conviction was reported to the Ohio Department of Public Safety, Division of Emergency Medical Services, by means of an anonymous telephone call. As a result, the board informed appellant that it would seek revocation of appellant\u2019s EMT certificate pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119 and Ohio Adm.Code 4765:10-03(B)(2)(c). This administrative code section authorizes the revocation of a certificate when the holder pleads guilty to or is judicially found guilty of a misdemeanor involving \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 5} After holding a hearing, the administrative hearing examiner issued a' report in which he recommended that appellant\u2019s certificate be revoked. Appellant filed written objections to the report; however, on August 14, 2000, the board accepted the examiner\u2019s recommendation and revoked appellant\u2019s certificate. Appellant then filed a timely notice of appeal in the Erie County Common Pleas Court. Upon a consideration of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs, the common pleas court found that the board\u2019s revocation order was supported by \u201creliable, probative and substantial evidence\u201d and was in accordance with the law. The court therefore affirmed the revocation order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 119.12 sets forth a specific standard of review to be applied in R.C. 119.12 administrative appeals to a common pleas court. That court must affirm the decision of the administrative agency when its decision is supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. Id. See, also, <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265. \u201cReliable evidence\u201d is evidence that is dependable and has a reasonable probability that it is true. <em>Our Place, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 570, 571, 589 N.E.2d 1303. To be probative, the evidence must be relevant in determining the issue. Id. Evidence with some weight, that is, having importance and value, is substantial evidence. Id. A common pleas court may engage in a limited weighing of the evidence and may evaluate the credibility of witnesses when determining whether an administrative decision was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. <em>Conrad, </em>63 Ohio St.2d at 111, 407 N.E.2d 1265. Nonetheless, a common pleas court must give due deference to the \u201cadministrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">{\u00b6 7} Our standard of review is more limited in that we can determine only whether the common pleas court abused its discretion in finding that the decision of the administrative agency is supported by the requisite evidence. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748. However, our review of whether the board\u2019s order is in accordance with the law is plenary. Id. <em>Webb v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 621, 767 N.E.2d 782, at \u00b6 2, citing <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 587 N.E.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 8} Because it involves a matter of law and its disposition affects our determination of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, we will initially address appellant\u2019s second assignment of error. In that assignment, appellant contends that a guilty finding on a misdemeanor charge of assault is not a guilty finding on a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cMoral turpitude\u201d is defined in the Ohio Administrative Code as \u201cthe act of baseness, vileness, or the depravity in private and social duties which one owes to society, contrary to accepted and customary rule of right and duty between human beings.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4765:1-01(R). \u201cMoral turpitude\u201d also means an \u201c \u2018[a]et or behavior that gravely violates moral sentiment or accepted standards of [the] community and is a morally culpable quality held to be present in some criminal offenses as distinguished from others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davidson, D.P.M. v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio </em>(May 7, 1998), 10th Dist. No. 97APE08-1036, 1998 WL 226436, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1991) 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 10} The elements of assault, as found in R.C. 2903.13(A), are knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm to another. Based upon these elements, appellant maintains that assault is clearly an offense involving violence and does not involve baseness, vileness, or depravity in violation of accepted, customary rights and duties of human beings. In other words, appellant asserts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>as did an opinion rendered by an Erie County prosecutor, that knowingly causing physical harm to another is insufficiently base, vile, or .depraved, in and of itself, to violate societal customs and mores. Appellant therefore maintains that the hearing examiner exceeded his authority by not following the opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the prosecutor and by looking at the facts leading to the charges made against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 11} Case law suggests that appellant is correct to a certain extent, especially in those instances in which the criminal offense, for example, rape, involves moral turpitude as a matter of law. <em>In re Jacoby </em>(1943), 74 Ohio App. 147, 157, 29 O.O. 305, 57 N.E.2d 932. Similarly, there are certain misdemeanors that may not involve moral turpitude as a matter of law. Id. Nonetheless, there are situations in which an investigation into the circumstances underlying the offense is permitted. Id. at 158, 29 O.O. 305, 57 N.E.2d 932. See, also, <em>Holycross v. State Bd. of Emergency Med. Servs., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 213, 2005-Ohio-4598, 837 N.E.2d 423 (examining the underlying facts of an EMT\u2019s criminal case to determine whether his convictions for telephone harassment, attempted telecommunications harassment, and criminal trespass were offenses that involved moral turpitude). We therefore conclude that when, as in the case of assault, a misdemeanor conviction cannot be determined as a matter of law to involve or not to involve moral turpitude, it is permissible to consider the circumstances underlying the offense for which an EMT was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 12} The Pennsylvania case, <em>Bowalick v. Pennsylvania </em>(Pa.2004), 840 A.2d 519, cited by appellant as standing for the opposite view, actually supports our conclusion. In <em>Bowalick, </em>a teacher was arrested as a result of a domestic dispute with his wife. Id. at 521. He pleaded guilty to simple assault, as defined in the Pennsylvania criminal code. Id. The Pennsylvania Board of Education subsequently sought revocation of the teacher\u2019s teaching certificate, claiming that assault was a crime involving moral turpitude. Id. The teacher argued that his wife pressed charges against him to gain an advantage in their divorce proceeding. Id. at 521-522. The Pennsylvania Education Commission granted summary judgment to the Department of Education, finding that simple assault is a crime involving moral turpitude<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as a matter of law. Id. at 522. The court reversed this decision and remanded the case, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cThis Court does not question the authority of the Commission to discipline a teacher convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. However, because simple assault is not necessarily such a crime, the Commission erred in granting judgment without a hearing. A material issue exists as to whether Teacher pled guilty to facts involving moral turpitude, an issue unresolved by reference only to the definition of the crime.\u201d Id. at 525.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">{\u00b6 14} Clearly, the decision of the <em>Bowalick </em>court is consistent with our holding in the instant case. Therefore, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, appellant contends (1) that the board lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the complaint concerning his conviction was not made to the board in writing, (2) that his due process rights were violated because the administrative hearing order denied his motion on the day of the hearing for a continuance for the purpose of engaging the services of an attorney, and (3) that the common pleas court\u2019s judgment is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Presumably in support of his third argument, appellant asserts that the administrative hearing examiner relied on hearsay evidence in making his recommendation, that the examiner did not consider an arbitrator\u2019s report, and that the examiner was not consistent in the way in which he managed this case, because he refused to consider appellant\u2019s unsworn statements and appeared \u201cto take sides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 16} We will first address the issue of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Under R.C. 4765.10(A)(1), the board has the authority to administer and enforce the statutory provisions (and rules promulgated by the board) that govern emergency medical services. R.C. 4765.10(B)(1) expressly confers subject-matter jurisdiction on the board to investigate complaints concerning any violations of the statutes and rules related to those emergency medical services. Thus, the question before us is not whether the board had subject matter jurisdiction over this case. Rather, the issue is whether the board properly exercised that jurisdiction. See <em>State ex rel. Haussler v. Walker, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2002-01-004, 2002-Ohio-3882, 2002 WL 1310415, at \u00b6 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 17} The jurisdiction of the board may be invoked in more than one manner. An emergency medical services organization may receive and review a complaint involving emergency medical services. Ohio Adm.Code 4765:10-02(A)(1). If the complaint is made against an individual, the organization is required to provide notice to the individual and allow him or her an opportunity to respond. Ohio Adm.Code 4765:10-01(A)(2). The organization is then required to refer the matter to the board. Ohio Adm.Code 4765:10-01(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The \u201cdivision\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is also authorized to receive all complaints \u201cas well as any evidence that appears to show that any person has violated any provision of R.C. 4765 or Ohio Adm.Code 4765:1 to Ohio Adm.Code 4765:19. Ohio Adm.Code 4765:10-02(A).\u201d Finally, \u201c[a]ny person\u201d may report, in a signed writing, any information that this person may have that appears to show a violation of those statutory and administrative code sections. Ohio Adm.Code 4765:10-02(A)(1). Thus, in reading all of the cited provisions together, it is clear that a writing is only one method, rather than the only method, that may be employed to inform the board of a potential violation. See <em>Internatl. Brotherhood of Elec. Workers, Local Union No. 8 v. Vaughn Industries, Inc., </em>156 Ohio App.3d 644, 2004-Ohio-1655, 808 N.E.2d 434, at \u00b6 58 (statutes and rules that relate to the same subject matter must be construed in pari materia and harmonized so as to give full effect to those statutes and regulations.). Here, the Division of Emergency Medical Services received a complaint through a telephone call. Therefore, the subject-matter jurisdiction of the board was properly invoked, and appellant\u2019s first argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant next claims that he was denied due process because the hearing examiner refused to grant his request for a continuance for the purpose of engaging the services of an attorney. The denial of a motion for a continuance of an administrative hearing is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Earth \u2018N Wood Products, Inc. v. Akron Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>9th Dist. No. 21279, 2003-Ohio-1801, 2003 WL 1824935, at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Coats v. Limbach </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 114, 116, 548 N.E.2d 917. In order to abuse this discretion, a hearing examiner\u2019s attitude in reaching a decision to deny a motion for a continuance must be unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. \u201c[N]ot every denial of a request for more time violates due process even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without counsel.\u201d <em>Ungar v. Sarafite </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 20} In the case sub judice, appellant was notified by an amended notice dated October 18, 1999, of the alleged violation, of his right to an administrative hearing, and of his right to be represented by counsel at that hearing, if he so desired.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 20, 1999, appellant requested a hearing. The hearing was initially scheduled to be held in November 1999 but was postponed indefinitely. On April 1, 2000, appellant was notified that the hearing would be held on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>20, 2000. Appellant waited until the commencement of the hearing on April 20, 2000, to inform the hearing examiner that he would like to be represented by the same attorney who had defended him in his criminal trial. As can be readily ascertained, appellant had several months in which to contact his defense attorney or, for that matter, another attorney, in order to prepare for the administrative hearing. Accordingly, the hearing examiner did not abuse his discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant asserts that the hearing examiner \u201crelied heavily\u201d on three levels of hearsay, in making his report and recommendation. Appellant apparently argues that this hearsay occurred in a report filed by the board\u2019s \u201cinvestigator,\u201d Douglas E. Brown, the compliance examiner who investigated appellant\u2019s alleged violation of the administrative code. We have thoroughly searched the record of this cause and cannot find a report authored by Brown. However, the hearing examiner did file a report in which he relied upon hearsay adduced at the administrative hearing in making his recommendation. Nevertheless, the admission of this hearsay evidence is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 22} Statements that \u201cmight constitute inadmissible hearsay where stringent rules of evidence are followed must be taken into account in [administrative] proceedings * * * where relaxed rules of evidence are applied.\u201d <em>Simon v. Lake Geauga Printing Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 41, 44, 23 O.O.3d 57, 430 N.E.2d 468. In other words, hearsay is permitted in administrative hearings, but the \u201c \u2018discretion to consider hearsay evidence cannot be exercised in an arbitrary manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fox v. Parma Community Gen. Hosp., </em>160 Ohio App.3d 409, 2005-Ohio-1665, 827 N.E.2d 787, at \u00b6 59, quoting <em>Menon v. Stouder Mem. Hosp. </em>(Feb. 21, 1997), 2d Dist. No. 96-CA-27, 1997 WL 71778.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 23} In the present case, the hearing examiner heard testimony from Detective Helen Prosowski and Captain Charles Sams of the Sandusky Police Department. This testimony included the statements made by the alleged victim and her mother during appellant\u2019s criminal case. Because this testimony was necessary to determine whether appellant had been found guilty of a crime involving moral turpitude, the hearing examiner did not act in an arbitrary manner in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{1124} Appellant also complains that the hearing examiner belatedly informed appellant that any prior exculpatory statements he made during the hearing were not evidence because they were not given under oath. Appellant neglects to mention, however, that the hearing examiner gave appellant ample opportunity to give these statements while under oath, and appellant declined to do so. Consequently, error, if any, on the part of the hearing examiner in failing to consider appellant\u2019s statements was invited error. See <em>State ex rel. Beaver v. Konteh </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 519, 520-521, 700 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Finally, the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial, probative, and reliable evidence. The following relevant facts were offered at the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">{\u00b6 26} Detective Prosowski testified that when she interviewed the victim, she learned that, on the day in question, appellant went to the victim\u2019s home looking for the victim\u2019s mother, who was supposedly appellant\u2019s friend. While there he touched the girl\u2019s breasts and \u201cdid a digital penetration with his finger to the vaginal area.\u201d He then asked the victim to \u201cperform oral sex on him.\u201d The victim refused, and appellant left the residence. However, he called the victim on the telephone about 45 minutes later. Appellant provided the victim with his pager number and told her that if she changed her mind about having sex with him, she should page him. According to the victim, appellant also said that he would pay her for her services.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 27} Captain Sams testified that after Prosowski interviewed the victim, the police, with the victim\u2019s assistance, paged appellant. Appellant immediately telephoned and agreed to meet her at a convenience store. The police went to the convenience store, where they confronted appellant. Appellant initially stated that while he was in her mother\u2019s home, the victim must have taken his pager number without his knowledge. He later changed this version of the facts and told the police that his pager had been stolen, that the thief (presumably the victim) paged him, and that they agreed to meet at the convenience store for the purpose of returning the pager. He also claimed that the girl\u2019s mother had told him that the victim was a \u201cbad girl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 28} It is obvious from the foregoing testimony that, in this particular case, the finding of guilty on a charge of assault constitutes a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4765:10-03(B)(2)(c). Thus, we cannot say that the common pleas court abused its discretion in determining that the revocation of appellant\u2019s EMT certificate is supported by substantial, probative, and reliable evidence. Therefore, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 29} On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice was done the party complaining, and the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Erie County.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-9\">Singer, P.J., and Skow, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-10\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel urges that it is \"obvious\u201d that appellant entered an <em>Alford </em>guilty plea and maintained his innocence throughout the criminal proceedings. Counsel apparently believes that this alleged fact should have some bearing on the instant administrative proceedings. First, there is no evidence in the record of this cause to show that appellant entered an <em>Alford </em>guilty plea. Second, it is the finding of guilty, not the plea, that is the basis of review by the board. <em>Jaros v. Ohio State Bd. of Emergency Med. Serv., </em>6th Dist. No. L-01-1422, 2002-Ohio-2363, 2002 WL 1065876, at \u00b6 21, fn. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">. An opinion of a prosecutor is not binding law; thus, the hearing examiner, the board, the common pleas court, and this court are not required to follow that opinion.
