Grendell, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Darryl M. Kelsey, appeals the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, ordering the sale at auction of a family Bible as part of the administration of the estate of decedent, Dorothy F. Kelsey. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">{\u00b6 2} Dorothy F. Kelsey, of Concord Township, died testate at Lake East Hospital on January 30, 2000. According to the decedent\u2019s last will and testament, her son, Darryl M. Kelsey, was nominated executor of the estate. Pursuant to the provisions of the will, \u201call of [decedent\u2019s] property whether real, personal or mixed,\u201d was left to her children, Darryl M. Kelsey and appellee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Marguerite J. Barton, \u201cin fee simple absolute in equal shares, to share and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 3} On February 6, 2001, Kelsey filed an application to probate the will and an application for authority to administer the estate. On February 9, 2001, Barton filed a request for hearing on Kelsey\u2019s application to administer the estate. Barton challenged Kelsey\u2019s suitability to serve as executor of the estate, citing the fact that Kelsey waited over a year before proceeding with the probate of'decedent\u2019s estate, that Kelsey failed to file a timely estate tax return for the estate, that Kelsey transferred real estate belonging to the decedent to his daughter shortly before decedent\u2019s death, and that \u201cthere exists hostility and distrust\u201d between Kelsey and Barton.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 4} On June 19, 2001, Kelsey and Barton were appointed co-executors of decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 5} On January 4, 2002, the probate court issued writs of citation for failure to file an inventory and ordered Kelsey and Barton to file estate inventories by January 17, 2002. On January 23, 2002, Barton filed an estate inventory. Barton inventoried decedent\u2019s tangible personal property as follows: \u201cHousehold goods &amp; furnishings, jewelry, antiques\u201d valued at $3,987. Kelsey did not sign Barton\u2019s inventory and did not file his own inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">{\u00b6 6} On January 9, 2002, Barton filed several motions with the court, including a motion to have Kelsey removed as a co-executor. Attached to Barton\u2019s motions was an affidavit that stated that decedent\u2019s personal property was appraised on September 10, 2001, and that she had been denied access to decedent\u2019s personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">{\u00b6 7} On February 12, 2002, Kelsey filed objections to Barton\u2019s inventory on the grounds that certain items of property were not valued or were undervalued.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">{\u00b6 8} In April 2002, a hearing was held on the parties\u2019 various motions and objections at which the parties agreed to withdraw as co-executors. On May 8, 2002, the probate court entered judgment removing Kelsey and Barton as co-executors and appointing Richard T. Spotz, Jr. successor administrator with the will annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">{\u00b6 9} In November 2002, a hearing was held on matters pending before the court, including Kelsey\u2019s objections to Barton\u2019s inventory. At this hearing, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. This agreement provided: \u201cEach party shall submit their list of desired personal property to the other party not later than December 5, 2002, and each party shall retain as their sole property all items in their sole possession that are not desired by the other party. The administrator shall sell any property desired by both parties. * * * Each party also hereby fully and finally releases the other party hereto from any and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>claims that said party has, might have, or claims to have, regarding this estate, and any advances claimed to be made on behalf of this estate, services claimed to be rendered to the decedent or to this estate, or in any way relating to this estate or to the decedent, Dorothy Kelsey.\u201d The trial court adopted the parties\u2019 agreement in a judgment entry dated November 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 10} On November 20, 2002, a judgment entry was filed approving the inventory and appraisement of the estate of Dorothy F. Kelsey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 11} On October 28, 2003, Spotz filed a final and distributive account for the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 12} On December 4, 2003, Barton filed objections to the final account, in which she alleged that Kelsey had improperly given the family Bible to his daughter pursuant to a power of attorney during the decedent\u2019s lifetime. A hearing on Barton\u2019s objections was held in February 2004. On March 23, 2004, the probate court entered judgment ordering Spotz to sell the family Bible and distribute the proceeds in accordance with the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">{\u00b6 13} On May 24, 2004, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on a motion filed by Kelsey. The probate court found that Kelsey had given the family Bible to his daughter during decedent\u2019s lifetime pursuant to a power of attorney. Therefore, \u201c[t]he family Bible was not an asset of decedent\u2019s estate at the time of her death, and was not listed on the estate inventory.\u201d The probate court found, however, that Kelsey\u2019s power of attorney \u201cdid not contain any grant of authority to make gifts\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe transfer is presumptively invalid.\u201d The probate court concluded that Kelsey had failed to rebut the presumption and that the Bible was properly a part of the decedent\u2019s estate. From this judgment, Kelsey timely brings appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">{\u00b6 14} Kelsey raises the following assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[1.] The Lake County Probate Court erred in failing to apply res judicata to the exclusion of the family Bible from the inventory of the Estate of Dorothy J. Kelsey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[2.] The Lake County Probate Court erred in concluding the gift of the family Bible failed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[3.] The Lake County Probate Court erred in concluding that the release included in the settlement agreement relating to the objection to inventory did not bar the claim made for the family Bible at the final account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201c[4.] The Probate Court was without jurisdiction to make the determination it made with respect to the family Bible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 19} Under the first assignment of error, Kelsey argues that res judicata applies to prevent Barton from challenging the exclusion of the family Bible from the estate inventory. Kelsey maintains that Barton has waived her right to challenge the estate\u2019s accounting as to the family Bible by not raising the issue at the time the probate court approved the inventory. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWhen an inventory is filed and approved by the probate court without exceptions having been taken it is not res judicata to a [subsequent] action seeking to include other assets in the estate that were not in the approved inventory.\u201d <em>Eger v. Eger </em>(1974), 39 Ohio App.2d 14, 68 O.O.2d 150, 314 N.E.2d 394, paragraph three of the syllabus. Accord <em>In re Ross </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 395, 398-399, 583 N.E.2d 1379; cf. <em>In re Rudy </em>(Dec. 3, 1993), 11th Dist. No. 93-T-4850, 1993 WL 545111, at *2 (\u201cthe inclusion of the personalty in the inventory filed by appellees is not <em>res judicata, </em>and does not prejudice the claims of appellants as to ownership\u201d). Moreover, \u201cthe failure of an executor * * * to include an asset of which he had knowledge in the inventory or failure of a beneficiary or other interested person to file timely exceptions to an inventory are not valid defenses in a [subsequent] action seeking to include assets in an estate.\u201d <em>Eger, </em>39 Ohio App.2d at 19, 68 O.O.2d 150, 314 N.E.2d 394; <em>Ross, </em>65 Ohio App.3d at 398-399, 583 N.E.2d 1379 (failure of beneficiaries to file exceptions to inventory did not bar them from litigating in a declaratory judgment action issues that could have been excepted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">{\u00b6 21} In the present case, Kelsey had delivered possession of the family Bible to his daughter prior to the death of the decedent and the creation of the estate. Thus, the Bible was not in the decedent\u2019s possession at the time of her death and, according to Kelsey, the Bible was not the \u201cpersonal property of the decedent\u201d such as should be included in an inventory. See R.C. 2115.02. Since title to the family Bible was disputed, Barton should not be penalized for failing to raise the issue at the time the estate was inventoried.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">{\u00b622} Kelsey argues Barton could have raised the issue when the probate court considered his objections to her inventory, since she knew of the Bible\u2019s existence at this time. There is no support for this position under Ohio law. The only instances in which res judicata has been applied in this situation are where the probate court has actually litigated a claim regarding a particular asset. See, <em>e.g., Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co. </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 517, 17 O.O. 156, 27 N.E.2d 145, at syllabus (\u201c[a] final adjudication, that certain inventoried personal property is assets of a decedent\u2019s estate and lawfully included in the inventory thereof * * * by filing exceptions to the inventory, is <em>res judicata </em>when properly pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>as a defense in a subsequent action\u201d); cf. <em>In re Lewis </em>(July 23, 1999), 4th Dist. No. 98CA17, 1999 WL 595458, at <em>*2 </em>(holding that res judicata did not apply to bar subsequent litigation where appellants filed, but subsequently dismissed, exceptions to estate inventory); <em>Ross, </em>65 Ohio App.3d at 398-399, 583 N.E.2d 1379; <em>Eger, </em>39 Ohio App.2d at 19, 68 O.O.2d 150, 314 N.E.2d 394. In the present case, the issue of whether the family Bible was properly an asset of the estate had never been raised, litigated, or determined prior to Barton\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, since the trial court determined that Kelsey\u2019s gifting of the family Bible to his daughter was invalid, the Bible had the status of a concealed asset of the estate. In the case of concealed assets, there is no time limit for the filing of exceptions to the exclusion of that asset from the estate. R.C. 2115.16. Accordingly, there was nothing untimely about Barton\u2019s challenge to the inventory, albeit raised as an objection to the final accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 24} Kelsey\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b625} Under the second assignment of error, Kelsey argues that the probate court erred in invalidating the transfer of the family Bible to his daughter. Kelsey\u2019s first argument is that the presumption of undue influence in transactions involving fiduciaries does not apply in this case because Kelsey\u2019s daughter, the donee of the Bible, was not in a fiduciary relationship with the decedent. According to Kelsey, the \u201cfamily gift presumption\u201d applies, which holds that transfers of property between family members are presumed to be gifts. See <em>Creed v. Lancaster Bank </em>(1852), 1 Ohio St. 1, at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">{\u00b6 26} Kelsey misrepresents the factual situation. The trial court did not find that the decedent herself had gifted the Bible to her granddaughter, but that Kelsey had made the gift. The focus, therefore, was on Kelsey\u2019s authority to make that gift. During the proceedings on Barton\u2019s objections, Kelsey made the following stipulation: \u201cPrior to decedent\u2019s death, Darryl Kelsey gave the family Bible to his daughter, Katherine Kelsey, under the Power of Attorney.\u201d The trial court properly concluded that Kelsey\u2019s power of attorney did not grant Kelsey authority to make gifts on the decedent\u2019s behalf. See <em>In re Meloni, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-T-0096, 2004-Ohio-7224, 2004 WL 3090190, at \u00b6 34 (a fiduciary, as agent of the principal, \u201cmay not make gratuitous transfers of the principal\u2019s assets unless the power of attorney from which the authority is derived expressly and unambiguously grants the authority to do so\u201d). Therefore, decedent\u2019s relationship with Kelsey\u2019s daughter is not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">{\u00b6 27} Kelsey also argues that, even if a presumption of undue influence exists by virtue of his position as the decedent\u2019s fiduciary, that presumption does not defeat the family-gift presumption that existed between him and the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>dent. We disagree. The law is well settled in this district \u201cthat in cases where * * * family members are also in a fiduciary relationship, the family gift presumption yields to the more specific presumption of undue influence, which arises in fiduciary relationships.\u201d <em>In re Anderson </em>(Dec. 15, 2000), 11th Dist. No. 99-T-0160, 2000 Ohio App LEXIS 5928, at *4-*5, citing <em>In re Guardianship of Blumetti </em>(Jan. 14, 1994), 11th Dist. No. 92-T-4752, 1994 WL 45250, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">{\u00b6 28} Kelsey\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">{\u00b6 29} Under the third assignment of error, Kelsey argues that Barton is barred from challenging the exclusion of the Bible by the language in the settlement agreement providing that \u201c[e]ach party * * * fully and finally releases the other party * * * from any and all claims * * * regarding this estate.\u201d Barton argues that this language does not apply to her because she is \u201cnot asserting a claim to the Bible\u201d but, rather, seeks \u201cto determine title to the Bible.\u201d We reject Barton\u2019s argument. Barton would not have standing to raise the issue of title to the Bible unless she was able to claim an interest in the Bible as a beneficiary of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 30} The release provision of the settlement agreement, however, conflicts with another provision of the agreement providing that both parties may make claims to particular items of personal property and that the administrator should sell property that is claimed by both parties. It is also significant that, under the peculiar procedural history of this case, when the parties entered their agreement, there was no approved inventory of the estate, and no itemized appraisal of decedent\u2019s personal property had been filed with the probate court. The agreement does not purport to define the personal property that belongs to the estate. In light of these considerations, the release language should not be construed to bar Barton from asserting her interest in the personal property of the estate, although title to that particular property was disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">{\u00b6 31} Kelsey\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">{\u00b6 32} Under the fourth and final assignment of error, Kelsey claims that the probate court lacked jurisdiction to determine title to the Bible. Kelsey relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Burns v. Daily </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 693, 683 N.E.2d 1164, which states that, where \u201ctitle does not reside in the decedent upon her death, but passed to a third party by <em>inter vivos </em>transaction or gift, then such property may not be included as an estate asset, and may not be retrieved by a summary proceeding in the probate court.\u201d Id. at 702-703, 683 N.E.2d 1164. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">{\u00b6 33} The probate court\u2019s conclusion that the Bible was not an asset of the estate for the purpose of inventorying the estate does not mean that title did not reside in the decedent upon her death. The probate court\u2019s conclusion was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>on the fact that the Bible was not in the decedent\u2019s possession and that there had been an attempted transfer of title. Where, as here, a dispute exists regarding title, the probate court is not deprived of jurisdiction to resolve the dispute under <em>Burns. </em>See <em>Rudloff v. Efstathiadis, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-T-0119, 2003-Ohio-6686, 2003 WL 22931382, at \u00b6 9 (\u201c[bjecause the gifts * * * are invalid, ownership never passed from the decedent and these assets are properly part of the estate, albeit wrongfully withheld\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">{\u00b6 34} Kelsey is also incorrect that Barton\u2019s sole remedy in this situation is to file a concealment/embezzlement action under R.C. 2109.50 or an action for declaratory judgment under R.C. 2721.05. It is well settled that the probate court can determine title to personal property on exceptions to an inventory and that it is a matter of discretion whether the exceptor should be ordered to pursue other remedies. <em>In re Gottwald </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 405, 58 O.O. 235, 131 N.E.2d 586, at paragraph two of the syllabus. This court has also held that the probate court has concurrent jurisdiction, under R.C. 2101.24(B)(1)(b), to determine title to disputed assets in addition to the jurisdiction granted under R.C. 2109.50 in concealment/embezzlement actions. <em>Burwell v. Rains, </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-T-0042, 2005-Ohio-1893, 2005 WL 940580, at \u00b6 29, citing R.C. 2101.24(B)(1)(b) (\u201c[t]he probate court has * * * the same powers at law and equity as, the general division of the court of common pleas * * * to hear and determine * * * [a]ny action that involves * * * a power of attorney\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 35} Kelsey\u2019s fourth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">{\u00b6 36} For the foregoing reasons, Kelsey\u2019s assignments of error are without merit. The judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, ordering the sale at auction of the family Bible as part of the administration of the estate of Dorothy F. Kelsey, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b730-9\">Rige, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b730-10\">O\u2019neill, J., dissents with a dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-13\">.

O\u2019Neill, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Amm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">{\u00b6 37} I dissent in order to uphold the principles that govern administration of probate estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">{\u00b6 38} There are at least three overarching principles that govern the administration of probate estates. The first is that the general powers of the probate court are limited by statute. As stated by the Tenth Appellate District:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cProbate Courts are not courts of general jurisdiction * * * no authority is needed in support of the statement. Their jurisdiction is such and only such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>as is conferred upon them by constitution or statute, with such auxiliary and incidental powers as are necessary and proper to carry into effect those expressly granted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">{\u00b6 40} The second principle is that the state of Ohio seeks to \u201c \u2018facilitate the orderly administration of estates.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 41} The third and final principle is that the law favors speedy settlement of estates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">{\u00b6 42} I believe that the course of the litigation in the probate court violated all three of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">{\u00b6 43} The significant dates and events in the administration of Ms. Kelsey\u2019s estate are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">{\u00b6 44} January 30, 2000 Death of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB6\">{\u00b6 45} February 6, 2001 Application to probate will and application for authority to administer estate filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae3\">{\u00b6 46} June 19,2001 Appointment of Kelsey and Barton as co-executors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD8\">{\u00b6 47} September 10, 2001 Appraisal of decedent\u2019s personal property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A08\">{\u00b6 48} January 23, 2002 Barton files estate inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMR\">{\u00b6 49} February 12, 2002 Kelsey files objections to inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjG\">{\u00b6 50} May 8, 2002 Spotz appointed administrator with the will annexed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aly\">{\u00b6 51} November 20, 2002 Judgment entry approving inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP4\">{\u00b6 52} June 5, 2003 Spotz files partial account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az7\">{\u00b6 53} October 28,2003 Spotz files final account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQP\">{\u00b6 54} December 4, 2003 Barton files exceptions to final account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-20\">{\u00b6 55} Therefore, Barton filed exceptions to Spotz\u2019s final account 23 months after she filed the estate inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">{\u00b6 56} Notably, Barton was herself a fiduciary of the estate for the period from June 19, 2001, up to and including May 8, 2002. While a fiduciary, she filed an estate inventory, which omitted the family Bible that is in dispute. This omission was in derogation of the statute that required her to list all the assets of which she had knowledge or which were in her possession on the estate inventory. R.C. 2115.02 charges the executor with the duty to file an inventory of the decedent\u2019s probate assets as of the decedent\u2019s date of death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-22\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cWithin three months after the date of the executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s appointment * * * the executor or administrator shall file with the court an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>inventory of the decedent\u2019s interest in real estate located in this state and of the tangible and intangible personal property of the decedent that is to be administered and that has come to the executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s possession or knowledge.

She signed the inventory. Under the heading \u201ctangible personal property,\u201d Barton listed the following: \u201c[h]ousehold goods and furnishings, jewelry, antiques\u201d and stated the value thereof to be $3,987. No further description of the tangible personal property was given in the inventory, though the record reflects that in September 2001, the parties had commissioned an independent appraiser to ascertain the value of tangible personal property then in the possession of Kelsey and Barton.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">{\u00b6 62} On May 30, 2002, Barton wrote a letter to her attorney drawing to his attention the fact that various items of tangible personal property were not listed in the appraiser\u2019s report with respect to the property in Kelsey\u2019s possession. Among those items, Barton listed the family Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">{\u00b6 63} Barton failed to include the family Bible in the estate inventory when she was the fiduciary and then took exception to its omission at the 11th hour in the estate administration. She commissioned a private appraisal of the decedent\u2019s personal property during September 2001. After the appraisal, she knew that the family Bible had not been included in the appraisal. Yet for reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>known only to Barton, she inserted a summary description of the tangible personal property on the estate inventory filed in January 2002 and chose not to list the specific items of tangible personal property that she was aware of from the commissioned appraisal. The estate inventory filed by Barton, without the inclusion of the family Bible, was approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">{\u00b6 64} Barton\u2019s acts of omission with respect to her knowledge of the family Bible continued after the filing of the estate inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">{\u00b6 65} Subsequent to the filing of the estate inventory, Barton entered into a settlement agreement in November 2002, also without any reference to the family Bible. The probate court approved this settlement agreement \u201cin its entirety\u201d and incorporated many of its provisions into its own judgment entry. Contrary to this judgment entry, Barton failed to comply with the court-ordered requirement to provide a list of tangible personal property that she had requested by December 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">{\u00b6 66} When Spotz, the new administrator appointed by the probate court, filed his first partial account, Barton filed no exceptions to the account. However, after he filed his final account on October 28, 2003, Barton excepted on the ground that Kelsey had refused to turn over one-half of the family photographs to her and that the family Bible had not been included as an asset of the estate. This occurred 35 months after her mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">{\u00b6 67} Exceptions to a fiduciary\u2019s account are permitted by R.C. 2109.33:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cAny person interested in an estate or trust may file exceptions to an account or to matters pertaining to the execution of the trust. All exceptions shall be specific and written.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">{\u00b6 69} The account itself shall include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">{\u00b6 70} \u201c[A]n itemized statement of all receipts of the administrator or executor during the accounting period and of all disbursements and distributions made by the executor or administrator during the accounting period. In addition, the account shall include an itemized statement of all funds, assets, and investments of the estate known to or in the possession of the administrator or executor at the end of the accounting period and shall show any changes in investments since the last previous account.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">{\u00b6 71} All interested parties are to receive notice of the hearing on the account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe notice shall set forth the time and place of the hearing and shall specify the account to be considered and acted upon by the court at the hearing and the period of time covered by the account.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">{\u00b6 73} At the hearing on the account, \u201cthe court shall inquire into, consider, and determine all matters relative to the account and the manner in which the fiduciary has executed the fiduciary\u2019s trust * * * and may order the account approved and settled or make any other order as the court considers proper.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">{\u00b6 74} Exceptions to an account \u201cgo only to what the executor has done in his administration as set forth in his account and not to what he has failed to do[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c[Exceptions test the correctness of all items in the account with which the executor charges and credits himself, whether the account shows that the executor charges himself with all funds of the estate coming into his hands, whether the account shows all payments made by him during the period of the account, and whether such payments were authorized and legal; whether the executor failed to pay certain debts which should have been paid is not a matter raised by such exceptions.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 76} Thus, Barton\u2019s exceptions to Spotz\u2019s final account should have tested only those entries made by Spotz in his account, limited to the time period for which Spotz was reporting. Exceptions are not intended as a device to test anything and everything that may have happened in the administration of the estate. When Spotz filed his first partial account and it was approved, the order approving that account had the effect of a judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such judgment had finality, as is consistent with trying to achieve orderly administration of estates. Barton attempted at the 11th hour to inject new matter into the probate proceedings by filing exceptions to Spotz\u2019s final account.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cIf an executor, administrator, or other interested party discovers that an asset was not included in the inventory or supplemental inventory of a decedent, and that the asset may belong to the estate, such party may bring an action in declaratory judgment under R.C. 2721.05, or use the special proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>of R.C. 2109.50 to determine whether such asset belongs in the estate of the decedent.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">{\u00b678} During the 34 months this estate was open, she neither pursued a declaratory judgment action nor a concealment-of-assets action. Instead, she waited until the 11th hour to assert her claim that the family Bible should be included as an asset of the estate. This was improper and should not have been allowed by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">{\u00b6 79} Moreover, Barton should be estopped by her conduct to assert that the family Bible should be included as part of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 80} In his first assignment of error, Kelsey argues that the doctrine of res judicata bars the court from accepting the family Bible as part of the estate inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 81} The Supreme Court of Ohio has explained the relationship between res judicata and collateral estoppel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cAs it has come to be recognized in its modern form, <em>res judicata </em>also takes in the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which provides that \u2018if an issue of fact or law actually is litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, such determination being essential to that judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">{\u00b6 83} With regard to probate administration, the rule regarding res judicata has been summarized in the case of <em>In re Estate of Cecere :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cThe leading case this Court has found which holds that a judgment with respect to an inventory is <em>res adjudicata </em>as to the title of assets therein contained is <em>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Company </em>[1940], 136 Ohio St. 517 [17 O.O. 156, 27 N.E.2d 145], wherein the Supreme Court states: \u2018When in an action an issue is determined and judgment rendered all parties are bound and thereafter estopped from asserting rights in conflict therewith in subsequent litigation in the same or another judicial tribunal.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>{\u00b6 85} In light of these principles regarding res judicata and collateral estop-pel, I believe that Barton should not be able to relitigate issues that were or might have been litigated previously in the same matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-23\">. <em>Abicht v.
