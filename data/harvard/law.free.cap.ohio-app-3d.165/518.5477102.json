Huffman, appeals his convictions for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, voyeurism, and pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment with the exception of Huffman\u2019s felony sentences, which we vacate. We remand the cause for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">\n<em>I. Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">{\u00b6 2} A young man and his parents contacted Reading Police Detective Terry Zimmerman to report a possible hidden camera in a tanning room at the Maximum Exposure Tanning Salon. The young man showed the detective a photograph of what appeared to be a camera lens hidden behind a circular fan.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">{\u00b6 3} That afternoon, Detective Zimmerman went to the salon, where he encountered Huffman, the owner of the business. Detective Zimmerman pretended that he was interested in purchasing a tanning package for his wife. Huffman described the available tanning procedures and showed the detective the rooms where the procedures took place. As the detective entered one of the tanning rooms, he saw a camera hidden behind a circular fan in the wall, just as the young man\u2019s report had indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">{\u00b6 4} Detective Zimmerman obtained a search warrant for the salon and executed it that evening with other police officers. During their search, the officers found a wireless camera mounted behind the wall fan, as the detective had earlier observed. Another wireless camera was hidden behind a hole in the wall of a tanning-spray room. The officers determined that signals from the two cameras were fed through a wireless receiver into one of Huffman\u2019s DVD players.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The officers recovered camera equipment as well as numerous DVDs containing videos of female patrons using the tanning rooms. The officers compared the recording dates and times of the videos with the tanning-visit dates on the salon\u2019s patron cards to identify Huffman\u2019s victims. The officers also recovered several DVDs that contained pornographic images of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 6} As a result of the investigation, Huffman was indicted for three counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, in violation of R.C. 2907.328(A)(1); three counts of voyeurism involving a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.08(C); two counts of voyeurism, in violation of R.C. 2907.08(B); 20 counts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(1); and one count of illegal cultivation of marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 7} Huffman filed a motion to dismiss the pandering counts, arguing that the pandering statute, R.C. 2907.322(A)(1), was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 8} Huffman then waived his right to a jury trial, and the case proceeded to a bench trial. The court found Huffman guilty of two counts of illegal use of a minor, each of the five voyeurism counts, and two of the pandering counts. Huffman was acquitted of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 9} The court imposed three-year prison terms on both counts of illegal use of a minor and four-year prison terms on both counts of pandering. The court imposed 180 days\u2019 incarceration on three of the voyeurism counts and 60 days\u2019 incarceration on two of the voyeurism counts. The court ordered the sentences to be served concurrently, for an aggregate term of four years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 10} On appeal, Huffman now challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss, the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence upon which he was convicted, and the trial court\u2019s imposition of more than the minimum prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">\n<em>II. Huffman\u2019s Constitutional Challenges to R.C. 2907.322(A)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2907.322 prohibits the pandering of sexually oriented matter involving minors. Huffman was convicted of violating R.C. 2907.322(A)(1), which provides, \u201cNo person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved, shall * * * [c]reate, record, photograph, film, develop, reproduce, or publish any material that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">{\u00b6 12} In his first assignment of error, Huffman argues that R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. In analyzing a constitutional challenge to a statute, we are mindful that legislative enactments enjoy a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>strong presumption of constitutionality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To overcome this presumption, a person challenging a statute must prove that the statute is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\n<em>A. States May Lawfully Proscribe Child Pornoyraphy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 13} The First Amendment does not protect child pornography. In <em>New York v. </em>Ferber,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court held that states may constitutionally proscribe the distribution of child pornography. The court held that this limitation on the freedom of speech is justified by the state\u2019s compelling interest in safeguarding the well-being of its children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court found that the distribution of child pornography is intrinsically linked to sexual abuse in two ways. First, the material survives as a permanent record of the victimization and abuse of a child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, prohibitions on the material\u2019s distribution act as a means of controlling its production, thus preventing future abuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>State v. </em>Meadows,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Ohio Supreme Court applied Ferber\u2019s reasoning in its consideration of R.C. 2907.322(A), the statute at issue here. Meadows was convicted of violating subsection (A)(5), which prohibits the possession or control of child pornography. The court held that the same child-protection interests recognized in <em>Ferber </em>to justify a ban on the distribution of child pornography justified a ban on its possession as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result, the court held that the statute did not violate the First Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 15} The United States Supreme Court considered another of Ohio\u2019s child-pornography statutes<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in <em>Osborne v. Ohio.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Osborne </em>court concluded, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the <em>Meadows </em>court had, that the interests described in <em>Ferber </em>warranted prohibitions on the possession and viewing of child pornography.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 16} While the interests recognized by <em>Ferber </em>and <em>Osborne </em>justify prohibitions of pornography created using children, the United States Supreme Court later held that those interests are not implicated by pornography created without using children, material that has been termed \u201cvirtual child pornography.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>B. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech </em>Coalition,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (\u201cCPPA\u201d), which prohibited the possession or distribution of child pornography.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 18} Under Section 2256(8) of the CPPA, child pornography was defined to include any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct where \u201c(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (B) such visual depiction is, or <em>appears to be, </em>of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (C) such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (D) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that <em>conveys the impression that </em>the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 19} The \u201cappears to be\u201d prohibition of Section 2256(8)(B) reached a variety of visual depictions, including \u201cvirtual child pornography\u201d created without the use of children.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The proscription of Section 2256(8)(D) went further by encompassing sexually explicit works pandered as child pornography, irrespective of their content.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 20} The plaintiffs in <em>Ashcroft </em>challenged subsections (B) and (D) of Section 2256(8) as unconstitutionally overbroad. The plaintiffs argued that the \u201cappears to be\u201d and \u201cconveys the impression\u201d provisions of the subsections created a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>chilling effect on the production of sexually explicit works protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">{\u00b6 21} The court noted that its earlier decisions in <em>Ferber </em>and <em>Osborne </em>had upheld state bans on child pornography because of the state\u2019s interest in protecting children exploited by the pornography production process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But, the court reasoned, \u201c[i]n contrast to the speech in <em>Ferber, </em>speech that is itself the record of sexual abuse, the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As a result, the court struck down subsections (B) and (D) as overbroad. The court held that the prohibitions on pornography created without using real children encompassed materials beyond those described in <em>Ferber, </em>resulting in the abridgement of \u201cthe freedom to engage in a substantial amount of lawful speech.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>C. R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) Is Not Unconstitutionally Overbroad</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 22} Huffman argues that R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) is unconstitutionally overbroad because its proscriptions encompass virtual child pornography, which <em>Ashcroft </em>held to be protected by the First Amendment. Huffman contends that virtual child pornography so closely resembles pornography depicting real children that the state\u2019s proscription tends to inhibit lawful speech. Huffman reads <em>Ashcroft </em>too broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 23} <em>Ashcroft </em>struck down a federal ban on virtual child pornography. But <em>Ashcroft </em>did not alter the Supreme Court\u2019s child-pornography jurisprudence: child pornography depicting real children remains unprotected speech.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 24} As <em>Ashcroft </em>recognized, states may lawfully proscribe the distribution, possession, and viewing of child pornography if their statutes criminalizing child pornography are limited to works that depict explicit sexual conduct by children below a specified age.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 25} Since <em>Ashcroft </em>was decided, courts across the country have rejected similar overbreadth challenges to state statutes aimed at pornography involving real children.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And federal courts have rejected overbreadth challenges to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>provisions of the CPPA left undisturbed by <em>Ashcroft, </em>which applied if an actual minor was involved.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cThere is nothing in <em>Ashcroft </em>to indicate that the court was prepared to start recognizing a First Amendment protection for child pornography involving actual minors.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) is by its terms limited to the depiction of sexual activity by a minor. \u201cMinor\u201d is statutorily defined as a person under the age of 18.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Ohio courts have held that because R.C. 2907.322 proscribes only pornography depicting an actual minor, Ashcroft\u2019s protection of virtual child pornography is not implicated by the statute.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b627} Only one Ohio court has sustained an overbreadth challenge to R.C. 2907.322(A)(5). In <em>State v. Tooley,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Eleventh Appellate District acknowledged that the Ohio Supreme Court had previously held that the statute did not violate the First Amendment, but reasoned that <em>Meadows </em>had been decided \u201cwell before\u201d <em>Ashcroft.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court based its overbreadth determination upon subsection (B)(3) of R.C. 2907.322, which provides, \u201cIn a prosecution under this section, the trier of fact may infer that a person in the material or performance involved is a minor if the material or performance, through its title, text, visual representation, or otherwise, represents or depicts the person as a minor.\u201d The court found that this language nearly mirrored the CPPA language held unconstitutional in <em>Ashcroft, </em>and concluded that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>{\u00b6 28} We respectfully disagree with the <em>Tooley </em>court\u2019s reasoning. Instead, we are persuaded by the reasoning of the Ninth Appellate District in <em>State v. </em>Morris,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> in which the court rejected an overbreadth challenge to R.C. 2907.322. With respect to the language in subsection (B)(3), the court held, \u201cThere is no indication that the provision * * * was intended to encompass virtual child pornography. Rather, we read the provision to permit what the common law has always permitted, that the State may prove its case with circumstantial evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) clearly proscribes pornography that depicts an actual minor. Unlike the CPPA provisions struck down in <em>Ashcroft, </em>the statute does not attempt to criminalize the possession of virtual child pornography. Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) is not unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>D. R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) Is Not Void for Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 30} Huffman further argues that R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) is void for vagueness. The vagueness doctrine is premised on the Fourteenth Amendment due-process requirement that laws give fair notice of offending conduct.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A criminal statute is void for vagueness if it fails to define a criminal offense with sufficient clarity for ordinary people to understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> A greater degree of precision is required if a law inhibits the exercise of First Amendment freedoms.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 31} In this case, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. The plain language of R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) makes clear what conduct is prohibited.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> A reading of the statute informs an ordinary citizen that its prohibitions apply to pornography depicting an actual minor.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The precision of the language leaves no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>discretion for the application and enforcement of the statute, describing with sufficient particularity what a person must do to commit a violation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 32} Huffman argues that advances in computer technology make it impossible for a person to distinguish between images created with actual minors and those that are not. So, Huffman contends, the statute deters him from exercising his right to possess virtual child pornography. We perceive no such problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 33} As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, a statute\u2019s scienter requirement may operate to eliminate any claimed vagueness.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) requires that an offender have \u201cknowledge of the character of the material or performance involved.\u201d This scienter requirement has been held to be a constitutionally adequate indicium of scienter to uphold a pandering-obscenity conviction.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We conclude that the scienter requirement has a similar ameliorating effect on any asserted vagueness in R.C. 2907.322(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 34} Because R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) is neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague, we hold that the trial court properly denied Huffman\u2019s motion to dismiss. We overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\n<em>III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 35} In his second assignment of error, Huffman argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, an appellate court must examine the evidence admitted at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether that evidence could have convinced any rational trier of fact that the essential elements of the crimes had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\n<em>A. Pandering Sexually Oriented Matter Involving a Minor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">{\u00b6 36} Huffman argues that his convictions for pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(1), were based upon insufficient evidence. Huffman\u2019s pandering convictions were based upon two images, marked as State\u2019s Exhibits 36 and 43. The images in question were each found on three different disks, marked as State\u2019s Exhibits 8, 10, and 11. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>disks had been recovered from the office area at Huffman\u2019s business. At trial, Huffman stipulated that he had been in sole possession of the disks.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 37} State\u2019s Exhibits 8, 10, and 11 consisted of compact disks enclosed in clear cases. The case jacket in State\u2019s Exhibit 8 was labeled on its front and side in black ink, with the handwritten notation \u201cInternet Downloads Porn Disk # 2.\u201d The compact disk itself had the same handwritten words on it. A handwritten note attached to State\u2019s Exhibit 10, between its jacket and case, read, \u201cTeen Closed.\u201d A handwritten note attached to the inside of the jacket on State\u2019s Exhibit 11 read, \u201cTeen Open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 38} For the image in State\u2019s Exhibit 43, the state presented the testimony of Vernon Warr, a police officer for Peoria, Illinois. Warr testified that he had worked as the primary investigator on a child-pornography and child-molestation case involving a man named Michael Hoevenaar. As a result of the investigation, Hoevenaar had been convicted and was serving a prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 39} The victim of Hoevenaar\u2019s crimes was his young daughter, to whom we refer as MH. During his investigation, Warr had discovered on the Internet images depicting Hoevenaar\u2019s sexual abuse of MH. Warr identified State\u2019s Exhibit 43 as an image of MH and her father when MH was about eight years old. The image depicted MH performing fellatio on her father. Warr produced a certified copy of MH\u2019s birth certificate, which indicated that MH was still a minor at the time of the trial in the present case. Warr testified that he personally knew MH, and that she was a real child.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 40} Next, Susan Koteen, a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, testified that she had investigated a sexual battery in Lake County, Florida, in 1997. The victim of the battery was an eight-year-old girl, to whom we refer as AM. As a result of the investigation, AM\u2019s father had been convicted of multiple counts of capital sexual battery of a child. Koteen identified State\u2019s Exhibit 36 as an image that had been recovered from AM\u2019s father\u2019s computer. The image contained a montage of four separate depictions, including one of AM performing fellatio on her father. Koteen testified that she knew AM, and that she was a real child.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">\n<em>1. Authentication of the Pornographic Images</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 41} Huffman argues that the trial court erred by admitting State\u2019s Exhibits 36 and 43 into evidence, because the images had not been properly authenticated. Huffman contends that the state should have been required to present testimony from a person present when each image was taken, including either the perpetrator-creator of the image or the child victim depicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">{\u00b6 42} The requirement of authentication as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>question is what its proponent claims it to be.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Here, the state offered evidence to show that each exhibit was what the state claimed it to be \u2014 images obtained from disks recovered from Huffman\u2019s office.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 43} Courts have held that the authentication requirement for pornographic images and materials is satisfied when the state offers evidence to show that each exhibit is what the state claims it to be. For example, pornographic magazines, including the images they contained, were held to be sufficiently authenticated by evidence that the magazines had been mailed to the defendant at his request;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and photographs, negatives, and a videotape were held to be sufficiently authenticated by evidence that the items had been in the defendant\u2019s trailer or otherwise in his possession.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Similarly, authentication was held satisfactory by a showing that the material had been recovered from the defendant\u2019s bedroom<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> or computer.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 44} In this case, the state offered evidence to show that each exhibit was \u25a0 what the state claimed it to be. A police lieutenant testified that the images in question were each found on three different disks introduced as State\u2019s Exhibits 8, 10, and 11. He further testified that the disks were in the same condition that prevailed when they had been recovered from Huffman\u2019s office. Moreover, in his brief, Huffman concedes that the images were found on disks that had been \u201cauthenticated as recovered during the search \u2014 chain-of-eustody.\u201d Because the essence of the offense itself was the possession and reproduction of the material, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the images into evidence.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\n<em>2. Sufficient Evidence of Reproduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 45} Huffman argues that the state failed to prove that he had created, recorded, photographed, filmed, developed, reproduced, or published sexually oriented matter under R.C. 2907.322(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>{\u00b6 46} The state\u2019s computer-analysis expert, Cincinnati Police Specialist David Ausdenmore, testified that he had analyzed materials recovered from Huffman, including three computers and many pieces of removable media and hard drives that had not been installed in computer systems. Ausdenmore testified that the images on State\u2019s Exhibits 8, 10, and 11 had been on Huffman\u2019s computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 47} Ausdenmore reviewed files on one of Huffman\u2019s computers and determined that the computer had been used for Internet development. The images and data files on that computer were arranged in a hierarchy so that they indicated where on an Internet page those images could be viewed. Ausdenmore found the same type of hierarchical range of data on the disks when he examined them. In other words, the arrangement of the image files on the disks matched the mapping structure found on the hard drive of one of Huffman\u2019s computers. Ausdenmore opined that the disks were actually backups of data that had at one time been stored on the hard drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 48} Ausdenmore testified that the most common way to back up the contents of a hard drive was simply to create a compact disk of all the contents of that hard drive or a particular section of that hard drive, which would then match the directory structure of the hard drive. When asked about the labeling \u201cInternet Downloads Porn,\u201d Ausdenmore further testified that images could be downloaded from the Internet and stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 49} Based on the evidence presented by the state, we hold that a rational trier of fact could reasonably have concluded that Huffman had reproduced the images, either by backing up the data that had been on his hard drive or by downloading it from the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\n<em>3. Sufficient Proof that Actual Minors Were Depicted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 50} Next, Huffman contends that the state failed to prove that the images in State\u2019s Exhibits 36 and 43 showed actual minors participating or engaging in sexual activity. We find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">{\u00b6 51} Courts have held that the question whether images are virtual or real is for the trier of fact.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The state need prove only that the images involve actual children, and \u201cthis may be done by a view of the images themselves, or by non-expert testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Therefore, the state is not required to present any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>additional evidence or expert testimony to demonstrate that the images depict real children and not virtual children.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Juries are capable of determining whether a real child is depicted in a particular image.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 52} Here, the state presented the testimony of Warr and Koteen, who personally knew the children depicted in the images, and who had been involved in the prosecution of their molesters. Thus, the state presented sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could have reasonably inferred that the depicted children were actual children.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>B. Illegal Use of a Minor in Nudity-Oriented Material or Performance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 53} With respect to his convictions for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, Huffman argues that the state failed to prove that lewd exhibitions or graphic displays were involved. R.C. 2907.323(A)(1) provides, \u201cNo person shall * * * [p]hotograph any minor who is not the person\u2019s child or ward in a state of nudity, or create, direct, produce, or transfer any material or performance that shows the minor in a state of nudity.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The statute applies \u201cwhere such nudity constitutes a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the genitals.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 54} The Ohio Supreme Court has stated that the term \u201clewdness\u201d is one in common usage: \u201cWebster defines \u2018lewd\u2019 as: \u2018 * * * sexually unchaste or licentious * * * lascivious * * * inciting to sensual desire or imagination * * *.\u2019 * * * \u2018Lascivious\u2019 is defined by Webster as: \u2018 * * * inclined to lechery: lewd, lustful * * *, tending to arouse sexual desire * * *.\u2019 Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986), 1301. The Oxford dictionary defines \u2018lascivious\u2019 as: \u2018inclined to lust, lewd, wanton.\u2019 The Oxford English Dictionary ([2d Ed.]1989).\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 55} Ohio courts have found sufficient evidence of lewdness in photographs of a 16-year-old girl\u2019s naked breasts and bikini line with visible pubic hair,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>images of a pubescent juvenile female standing outside a bathtub with the camera focused on her breasts and genitals,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and in images of young women using the bathroom with their pubic areas clearly visible.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 56} In this case, the state presented evidence of two digital videos of a 16-year-old girl as she used Huffman\u2019s tanning facilities on two different dates. The images were captured by a camera hidden behind a fan near the tanning bed. The camera was positioned to focus on the girl\u2019s genitals. During the recording of one of the videos, the camera was manually adjusted to capture a clearer image of the girl\u2019s genitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 57} Given the secretive nature of the videotaping and its blatant focus on the victim\u2019s genitals, we hold that the state presented sufficient evidence of lewdness to sustain Huffman\u2019s convictions for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">C. <em>Voyeurism</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 58} Huffman also argues that his five convictions for voyeurism under R.C. 2907.08(B) and (C) were based upon insufficient evidence. He argues that the state failed to prove that he had photographed the victims, or that he had done so for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">\n<em>1. \u201cPhotograph\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 59} R.C. 2907.08(B) provides, \u201cNo person, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying the person\u2019s self, shall commit trespass or otherwise surreptitiously invade the privacy of another to <em>photograph </em>the other person in a state of nudity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Division (C) contains identical language, with the additional element that the victim is a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">{\u00b6 60} Huffman argues that the verb \u201cphotograph\u201d does not include the act of videotaping. He points to R.C. 2907.08(E), which provides, \u201cNo person shall secretly or surreptitiously <em>videotape, </em>film, <em>photograph, </em>or otherwise record another person under or through the clothing being worn by that other person for the purpose of viewing the body of, or the undergarments worn by, that other person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) He argues that the distinction made in R.C. 2907.08(E) between videotaping and photographing indicates an intent to exclude videotaping from R.C. 2907.08(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>{\u00b6 61} The state\u2019s evidence of voyeurism consisted of five video tracks recorded on two DVDs. Two of the tracks depicted the same female minor and, as we have already held, supported Huffman\u2019s convictions for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance. Huffman had filmed two more females, an adult and a minor, during their separate tanning sessions in a horizontal tanning bed. A fourth female had been filmed by another hidden camera as she used Huffman\u2019s \u201cspray-on\u201d booth. None of the victims knew that she was being filmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 62} Huffman admits that he videotaped the victims, but contends that he did not \u201cphotograph\u201d them. We find this argument to be disingenuous. During closing argument at trial, Huffman\u2019s attorney conceded that the defense expert witness had testified that the recordings were a series of photographs. Specifically, the witness had testified that digital video is a series of digital still images that are put together \u201cand then naked to your eye it looks like motion, same as a movie film, you know, a series of frames.\u201d Moreover, the state\u2019s expert witness testified that a digital image is simply a \u201cdigital representation of a photograph or other type of visual display.\u201d Thus, the state proved that Huffman had photographed the victims as contemplated by R.C. 2907.08(B) and (C).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>2. Self-Gratification or Arousal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 68} Huffman also argues that the state failed to prove that his actions were motivated by sexual arousal or self-gratification. The trier of fact may infer a person\u2019s intent from the surrounding facts and circumstances.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Courts have found a purpose to sexually arouse or self-gratify in cases where a voyeur kept autoerotic materials in his car while he peered through a home\u2019s window,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> where a voyeur repeatedly peered through a home\u2019s window while apparently masturbating,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and where a voyeur climbed a ladder to peer through a window and watch a young girl as she dressed for school.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 64} In this case, the state presented evidence that Huffman had enticed at least two of the victims to work at the salon in exchange for free tanning sessions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Huffman had induced one of the victims to try a \u201cspray tan\u201d by offering the service at no charge when she expressed reservations about it. Huffman had filmed each of the victims without her knowledge or permission. Huffman had then kept the footage in the same office area where his other pornographic materials were discovered. Given Huffman\u2019s secretive tactics and his evident interest in sexually explicit material, the trier of fact could have reasonably inferred that Huffman\u2019s acts were done for the purpose of sexual arousal or self-gratification. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Huffman\u2019s convictions for voyeurism under R.C. 2907.08(B) and (C). We overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>IV. Weight of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 65} In his third assignment of error, Huffman argues that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. On this record, we cannot say that the trier of fact clearly lost its way or that it created a manifest miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This is not the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Accordingly, we overrule the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\n<em>V. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 66} In his fourth assignment of error, Huffman challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of more than the minimum sentence on each of the counts of illegal use of a minor and on each of the counts of pandering. The four offenses were felonies of the second degree, each allowing a prison term ranging from two to eight years.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The court imposed three-year prison terms on both counts of illegal use of a minor, and four-year prison terms on both counts of pandering.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 67} The trial court imposed more than the minimum sentence based on its findings under R.C. 2929.14(B)(2) that the minimum term would \u201cdemean the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct\u201d and \u201c[would] not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 68} While this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court of Ohio held, in <em>State v. </em>Foster,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> that R.C. 2929.14(B) is unconstitutional in that it \u201crequirefs] judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>factfinding before imposition of a sentence greater than the maximum term authorized by a jury verdict or admission of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 69} The <em>Foster </em>court held that the unconstitutional provision could be severed.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Following severance, \u201c[tjrial courts have full discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required to make findings or give their reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 70} In this case, because the imposition of more than the minimum sentences for the felonies of the second degree was based on an unconstitutional statutory provision, we sustain the fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 71} According to <em>Foster, </em>Huffman is entitled to a new sentencing hearing on the second-degree felonies.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> On remand, the trial court must \u201cconsider those portions of the sentencing code that are unaffected by <em>[Foster </em>] and impose any sentence within the appropriate felony range.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Because the court will be sentencing Huffman to multiple prison terms, \u201cthe court is not barred from requiring those terms to be served consecutively. While [the defendant] may argue for reductions in [his] sentences, nothing prevents the state from seeking greater penalties.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\n<em>VI. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 72} Huffman\u2019s first three assignments of error are overruled. His fourth assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the sentences for the second-degree felonies are vacated. The cause is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-11\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\">.
