White.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee filed an application to seal records pertaining to a felony theft conviction in case No. 92CR-09-4448. Appellant filed a written objection to the application, and the trial court held a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">{\u00b6 3} At the hearing, the trial court acknowledged that appellee still owed restitution on the theft offense. Thus, the trial court initially told appellee: \u201c[A]t this point in time I can\u2019t grant your request.\u201d However, the trial court ultimately decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-17\">Let me do this. [Appellant] isn\u2019t here. I will teach him a lesson. I am going to grant this. [Appellant] will appeal this, and I will be overturned. The Court of Appeals will not let me do this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-18\">In that short period of time you may be able to get a job. If you can, then it will come back here, and I will have to get you back in the courtroom, and then we can talk about the restitution aspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s application to seal records pertaining to her felony theft conviction. Appellant appeals, raising one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">A court lacks jurisdiction to seal the record when the applicant has not made restitution as required by the sentencing entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 5} In its single assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s application to seal records pertaining to her felony theft conviction because appellee still owed restitution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 6} Under R.C. 2953.32(A)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">[A] first offender may apply to the sentencing court if convicted in this state * \u2022 * * for the sealing of the conviction record. Application may be made at the expiration of three years after the offender\u2019s final discharge if convicted of a felony, or at the expiration of one year after the offender\u2019s final discharge if convicted of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">{\u00b6 7} An offender is not finally discharged for purposes of R.C. 2953.32(A)(1) if the offender still owes restitution. <em>State v. Wallace </em>(Dec. 6, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 79669, 2001 WL 1557523; <em>State v. Pettis </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 618, 619-620, 729 N.E.2d 449; <em>State v. Wainwright </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 793, 795, 600 N.E.2d 831. Here, appellee had not been finally discharged pursuant to R.C. 2953.32(A)(1) when she applied to seal the theft-conviction records because she had not paid the ordered restitution. Thus, appellee was not yet eligible to apply to seal the theft-conviction records, and the trial court erred by granting the application. Therefore, we sustain appellant\u2019s single assignment of error, and we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-11\">Bryant and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
