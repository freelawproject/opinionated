Plaintiff-appellant, Lanny Snell, appeals the decisions of the Monroe County Common Pleas Court, Probate Court Division, that granted summary judgment to defendant-appellee, Sharon Kilburn, as executor of the estate of Wayne Snell, on Lanny\u2019s 'will-contest action and dismissed his motion for a declaratory judgment to construe the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">{\u00b62} Lanny argues that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether Wayne Snell had testamentary capacity and whether the will was properly executed. However, the trial court properly granted summary judgment since Lanny provided no evidence supporting his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">{\u00b6 3} Lanny also argues that the trial court erred by construing the will within the will-contest action. He contends that the will was properly construed in the declaratory-judgment action and that the issue should have been res judicata in the will-contest action. However, the trial court properly dismissed Lanny\u2019s will-contest action since both it and the declaratory-judgment action raised identical issues of construction and he has a similar interest in the outcome of both claims. Moreover, the trial court properly construed the will to determine that Wayne intended to disinherit Lanny. For all these reasons, the trial court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">{\u00b6 4} In the 1950s and 1960s Wayne was married to Beulah Snell and the couple had one child, Lanny. When the Snells divorced in the mid-1960s, Beulah retained custody of Lanny and moved to Mount Vernon, Ohio. Lanny testified that he maintained a relationship with his father at all times over the years since the divorce. Wayne remained in Monroe County, Ohio, until his death on May 17, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 5} Wayne\u2019s will bequeathed the remainder of his property, both tangible and intangible, to Rosa Mehler, a woman whom Wayne had been dating since the 1970s. According to the will, if Mehler died before Wayne, then the remainder of Wayne\u2019s property, both tangible and intangible, was to go to Kilburn, Mehler\u2019s niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 6} Wayne\u2019s will was admitted to probate and Kilburn was named executor. On June 25, 2003, Lanny commenced a will-contest action in the Monroe County Probate Court, claiming the will was deficient in four ways: (1) undue influence, (2) lack of testamentary capacity, (3) improper execution, and (4) improper construction. Kilburn subsequently moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Lanny timely appealed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 7} Several months after the trial court granted summary judgment in that action, Kilburn filed her final account of Wayne\u2019s estate. Snell commenced another action objecting to the final account and asking for declaratory judgment to construe the will. The trial court overruled these objections on the basis that the same issues had been raised or should have been raised during the summary-judgment proceedings. Lanny also timely appealed this decision. We have consolidated Lanny\u2019s two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, Lanny raises five assignments of error, each of which challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment on a particular issue. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must construe the record and all inferences therefrom in the opposing party\u2019s favor. <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 531, 535, 629 N.E.2d 402. The party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden of informing the court of the motion\u2019s basis and identifying those portions of the record tending to show that there are no genuine issues of material fact on the essential elements of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The movant must be able to point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) that affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support his or her claim. Id. If this initial burden is met, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>there is a genuine issue for trial, and if the nonmovant does not respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be granted. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 9} An appellate court reviews a decision granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment is properly granted when (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1976), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Will Contest</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 10} In his first four assignments of error, Lanny challenges various aspects of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to Kilburn in the will-contest action. The purpose of a will contest is to contest the validity of a will admitted to probate. R.C. 2107.71. The admission of a will to probate is prima facie evidence of its execution, attestation, and validity. R.C. 2107.74. With regards to prima facie evidence, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that \u201cprima facie evidence is not conclusive.\u201d <em>Krischbaum v. Dillon </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 58, 64, 567 N.E.2d 1291. The admission of a will to probate thus creates a presumption as to the will\u2019s validity; however, this presumption is not irrebuttable. Id. In order to rebut the presumption of validity created when a will is admitted to probate, a contestant must \u201cproduce evidence which furnishes a reasonable basis for sustaining his claim.\u201d <em>Kata v. Second Natl. Bank </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 210, 55 O.O.2d 458, 271 N.E.2d 292, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Testamentary' Capacity</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 11} In his first assignment of error, Lanny argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by dismissing the will contest on summary judgment upon the grounds that there was no evidence that decedent Wayne Snell lacked testamentary capacity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 13} Lanny contends that Wayne could not have had testamentary capacity when signing his will since there is no indication that he considered including his son as a beneficiary under the will. Without the requisite testamentary capacity, Lanny argues that the will is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTestamentary capacity exists when the testator has sufficient mind and memory: First, to understand the nature of the business in which he is engaged; Second, to comprehend generally the nature and extent of his property; Third, to hold in his mind the names and identity of those who have natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>claims upon his bounty; [and] Fourth, to be able to appreciate his relation to the members of his family.\u201d <em>Birman v. Sproat </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 65, 67-68, 546 N.E.2d 1354, citing <em>Niemes v. Niemes </em>(1917), 97 Ohio St. 145, 119 N.E. 503. The burden of proof in determining testamentary capacity is on the party contesting the will. <em>Kennedy v. Walcutt </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 442, 161 N.E. 336, paragraph six of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 15} Lanny relies on <em>Springer v. Lee </em>(May 2, 1996), 3rd Dist. No. 5-95-42, 1996 WL 223699, for the proposition that a genuine issue of material fact is created when a testator does not mention the names of the heirs of his body when executing a will. In <em>Springer, </em>the appellant, the son of the decedent, filed a will-contest action against the executor of the estate. The executor subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment. The appellant asserted that the decedent lacked the testamentary capacity to execute the will. This assertion was based on evidence that the decedent\u2019s memory was failing at the time he executed his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 16} Evidence of the decedent\u2019s memory failure came from two places. First, the appellee testified as to conversations he had had with the decedent about funeral arrangements. While the appellee stated that he believed the decedent to be of sound mind, his other testimony suggested otherwise. The appellee testified that during the funeral arrangement conversations, the decedent indicated to him only that he had a sister. No mention was made of the decedent\u2019s son or of numerous other siblings. Furthermore, the decedent also failed to inform the appellee that he had a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The second piece of evidence presented was the decedent\u2019s form for funeral arrangements. In filling out. this form, the decedent gave incorrect information about his date of birth, place of birth, and mother\u2019s name. After reviewing this evidence, the executor\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 17} On appeal, the appellant argued that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment on the issue of testamentary capacity. The court of appeals concluded that the decedent\u2019s failure to mention his son created an issue of fact under the <em>Niemes </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 18} This case is distinguishable from <em>Springer </em>because Kilburn introduced evidence showing that Wayne did, in fact, have testamentary capacity at the time he executed his will. Kilburn introduced the affidavits of three witnesses, Janet Valkovic, Ruth Valkovic, and Wayne\u2019s attorney, James W. Peters, each of whom averred that they believed Wayne to be of sound mind at the time he executed the will. Lanny offered no evidence contradicting the affidavits of these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Because Kilburn introduced evidence demonstrating Wayne\u2019s testamentary capacity, this case is similar to <em>Martin v. Dew, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-734, 2004-Ohio-2520, 2004 WL 1109562. In <em>Martin, </em>the decedent\u2019s cousin filed a will-contest action after the decedent\u2019s will was admitted into probate. The appellant claimed an interest in the will as a cousin of the decedent (i.e., a lineal descendent of decedent\u2019s paternal grandparents). In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity. The defendant moved for summary judgment, providing affidavits and deposition testimony reflecting that the witnesses believed the decedent to be fully aware of the nature and consequences of her actions on the day the will was executed. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 20} On appeal, the court held that \u201cthe evidence presented was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether [the] decedent lacked testamentary capacity\u201d when she executed her will. Id. at \u00b6 20. The court noted that \u201cthe only evidence in the record addressing the issue of [the] decedent\u2019s testamentary capacity at the time she executed her will was contained in the affidavits and deposition testimony of Gayton and his wife, and the affidavit of Dew.\u201d Id. Because the \u201cappellant offered no evidence that [the] decedent was affected by dementia on the date she executed [her] will,\u201d the court determined that reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion. Id. at \u00b6 20, 25. This reasoning was based on the fact that the \u201cuncontradicted statements by the individuals who witnessed [the decedent] sign the will indicated [that] she * * * [had] testamentary capacity.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 21} Given the evidence in this case, the trial court correctly concluded that Kilburn was entitled to summary judgment on this issue. In contrast to the testimony in <em>Springer, </em>the evidence in this case shows that Wayne was of sound mind when he executed his will. Lanny provided no evidence to the contrary, even within his own affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b622} Furthermore, Wayne\u2019s failure to mention his son\u2019s name is very different from the decedent\u2019s failure to do likewise in <em>Springer. </em>The decedent in <em>Springer </em>forgot to mention his son, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren while discussing funeral arrangements. Wayne did not mention his son while drafting and executing his will. This difference is important because the <em>Springer </em>decedent\u2019s failure was forgetful while Wayne\u2019s failure was intentional. Wayne executed four wills over a period of almost 22 years without ever mentioning his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, the evidence in the record demonstrates that there is not a genuine issue of material fact regarding Wayne\u2019s testamentary capacity at the time he executed his will. The trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue. Wayne\u2019s first assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Proper Execution of the Will</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 24} In his second assignment of error, Lanny argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law, by dismissing the will contest upon the grounds that Wayne Snell\u2019s will was properly executed according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 26} Lanny contends that the will was not properly attested to as required by R.C. 2107.03. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cExcept oral wills, every last will and testament shall be in writing, but may be handwritten or typewritten. Such will shall be signed at the end by the party making it, or by some other person in such party\u2019s presence at his express direction, and be attested and subscribed in the presence of such party, by two or more competent witnesses, who saw the testator subscribe, or heard him acknowledge his signature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 2107.03 requires four things to create a valid will: (1) a written document, (2) signed at the end by the testator or the testator\u2019s agent, (3) in the presence of two witnesses, (4) who must observe the testator\u2019s signature or hear him acknowledge his signature. It is important to remember that in order to overcome the presumed validity of a will admitted to probate, the contestant in a will contest action must \u201cproduce evidence which furnishes a reasonable basis for sustaining his claim.\u201d <em>Kata, </em>26 Ohio St.2d 210, 55 O.O.2d 458, 271 N.E.2d 292, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 29} In many ways, this case is similar to <em>In re Will of McGraw </em>(1967), 14 Ohio App.2d 87, 43 O.O.2d 207, 236 N.E.2d 684. In <em>McGraw, </em>a will was drafted by an attorney in a hospital room, during the last illness of the testator. The will bore an attestation clause, the testator\u2019s signature, and the signatures of two witnesses, one of which was the attorney\u2019s. Both witnesses testified that they were present when the testator signed the will. The will was denied admittance to probate since the attorney had improperly witnessed the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">{\u00b6 30} The proponent of the will appealed, alleging that the trial court erred when it failed to admit the will to probate. The appellate court found that the will met the statutory requirements and should have been admitted to probate for three reasons. It first noted that the fact that the will was drawn by the attorney who was present at its execution was strong presumptive evidence that the execution of the will was regular. Id. at 89, 43 O.O.2d 207, 236 N.E.2d 684. It held that this presumption of due execution could be overcome only by other evidence, but not by a mere absence of evidence. Id. Finally, it relied on the fact that the attestation clause which recited compliance with all statutory requirements for the valid execution of the will. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Here, Wayne\u2019s will was similarly executed. It was drafted by the attorney who was present at its execution; the will was regular on its face and, therefore, was entitled to a presumption of proper execution; and the attestation clause was signed by two witnesses and recited compliance with the statutory requirements. Finally, the witnesses all signed affidavits stating that the will was properly executed. Lanny offered no evidence contradicting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 32} Nevertheless, Lanny contends that the witnesses did not properly attest to the will since the attestation clause in the decedent\u2019s will does not comply with the technical requirements of R.C. 2107.03. Specifically Lanny argues that the clause in question is on a separate sheet of paper, the sheet is not numbered or dated, and the sheet has no reference to this particular will.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 33} No Ohio case has directly addressed this issue, but we find an Oklahoma case on this issue to be persuasive. In <em>In re Dunlap\u2019s Will </em>(1922), 87 Okla. 95, 209 P. 651, the mother of a deceased man challenged the admission of a will to probate. One of the issues raised was whether the will was properly attested to. The evidence showed that the will, including the signature of the testator, was entirely written on one sheet of paper, and the attestation clause and the signatures of the witnesses were on another sheet. There was not sufficient space on the first sheet of paper to include the attestation clause. The two sheets had been previously held together by a clipless fastener and were stapled at the time of trial. The will was admitted to probate over the widow\u2019s challenge, and appeal was taken all the way to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 34} The court held the separation of the will and the attestation clause to be immaterial. <em>Dunlap </em>at 652. The court\u2019s reasoning was based primarily on the fact that the statute did not forbid the use of separate sheets of paper or direct how they should be fastened together, nor did it require that the signature of the subscribing witnesses be upon the same sheet as the signature of the testator. Id. at 652. It was enough that the court could tell that the two sheets belonged together.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 35} Here, R.C. 2107.03 requires only that a will be attested to by two witnesses who saw the testator sign his name or heard him acknowledge his signature. There is no requirement that there be an actual attestation clause, that the signatures of the witnesses be on the same sheet as signature of the testator, that the pages be numbered, or that the attestation clause be dated. While these things would certainly entitle the will to a greater presumption of validity, the lack of them does not negate the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 36} Because Lanny has not met his burden of providing evidence to sustain his claim, and because Wayne\u2019s will complies with the statute, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Kilburn on this issue. Lanny\u2019s second assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Construing a Will in a Will-Contest Action</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 37} In his third assignment of error, Lanny argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThat the trial court erred as a matter of law, by dismissing the will contest to construe the will so that decedent Wayne Snell\u2019s son Lanny would receive the remainder of the estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 39} Lanny\u2019s arguments within this assignment of error are confused, but it appears that he is trying to argue that the trial court erred by ruling on issues of will construction during a will-contest action. Lanny alleges that this ruling was outside the scope of the will contest, which should have been limited to issues of validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">(\u00b6 40} The probate court clearly has the authority to construe the will. Probate courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and have only those powers granted to it by statute. <em>Roll v. Edwards, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 227, 2004-Ohio-767, 805 N.E.2d 162, at \u00b6 16. In enacting R.C. 2101.24, the General Assembly has specifically set forth those matters that are properly placed before the probate court, one of which is the exclusive jurisdiction to construe and determine the validity of wills. Id. at \u00b6 17; R.C. 2101.24(A)(l)(k) and (p).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 41} Whenever a probate court has a case before it, it also \u201chas plenary power at law and in equity to dispose fully of any matter that is properly before the court, unless the power is expressly otherwise limited or denied by a section of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 2101.24(C). \u201cThe legislative grant of plenary power to the probate court is the nature of the power and authority of the probate court to take that action which is necessary to fully dispose of any matter properly before it.\u201d <em>Roll, </em>156 Ohio App.3d at 233-234, 805 N.E.2d 162, citing <em>Madigan v. Dollar Bldg. &amp; Loan Co. </em>(1935), 52 Ohio App. 553, 563, 6 O.O. 478, 4 N.E.2d 68. \u201cIt authorizes the probate court to grant any relief required to fully adjudicate the subject matter within the probate court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d Id., citing <em>State ex rel. Lewis v. Moser </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 25, 29, 647 N.E.2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 42} Nothing in these statutes prevents a probate court from construing a will, one of the duties placed by law on the probate court, while it is also determining the validity of a will, another of the duties specifically assigned to the probate court. Furthermore, both the Civil Rules and case law indicate the opposite. Civ.R. 18(A) requires \u201ca party asserting a claim to relief as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, may join, either as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims, legal or equitable, as he has against an opposing party.\u201d Thus, in cases such as <em>Waldecker v. Erie Cty. Humane Soc. </em>(Feb. 27, 2004), 6th Dist. No. E-03-022, 2004 WL 368098, courts have held that the failure to raise issues of will construction in an action determining the validity of a will acts as res judicata on a later action to construe the will. Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Lanny is incorrect when he argues that a probate court cannot construe a will in a will-contest action. Thus, his third assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 44} In his fifth assignment of error, Lanny argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe court below erred as a matter of law by ruling that its prior order denying the request to construct the will in the will contest was binding upon its decision in the will construction action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 46} Lanny contends that the probate court\u2019s decisions in the will contest should not have had a preclusive effect on his objections to the account and his motion for a declaratory judgment to construe the will. The doctrine of res judicata involves both claim preclusion and issue preclusion and prevents the litigation of matters already decided by a court. <em>Holzemer v. Urbanski </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 129, 133, 712. N.E.2d 713. Thus, \u201c[a] final judgment or decree rendered upon the merits, without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction * * * is a complete bar to any subsequent action on the same claim or cause of action between the parties or those in privity with them.\u201d <em>Norwood v. McDonald </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 299, 27 O.O. 240, 52 N.E.2d 67, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 47} In resolving Lanny\u2019s fourth assignment of error, we conclude that the trial court could properly construe the will during the will-contest action. Lanny filed a second claim asking for an accounting of Wayne\u2019s estate and declaratory judgment to construe the will. The trial court dismissed this claim, holding it to be barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The trial court\u2019s decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">{\u00b6 48} In both the will-contest and declaratory-judgment actions, Lanny asked that the will be construed to award him the remainder of Wayne\u2019s estate. In the will contest, the court decided that Lanny was implicitly disinherited because there was no remainder of his father\u2019s estate. Because the parties and the claims are the same in both actions, the probate court properly concluded that res judicata applied to this claim. Lanny\u2019s fifth assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Disinheritance of an Heir</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">{\u00b6 49}- In Lanny\u2019s fourth assignment of error, he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to award Lanny Snell the remainder of his father\u2019s estate when his father failed to expressly disinherit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">{\u00b6 51} Lanny contends that Ohio courts should not allow a parent to disinherit a child without some kind of overwhelming evidence that the parent actually intended to do so. He contends that in order to have this type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>overwhelming evidence, a parent must expressly state in the will that the parent intends to disinherit a child. According to Lanny, without this kind of express intent explicitly stated, courts should presume that a child inherits from a parent. Lanny\u2019s argument is not the law of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 52} It is a primary rule applicable to the construction of wills that the heir at law shall not be disinherited by conjecture, but only by express words or necessary implication. <em>Crane v. Doty\u2019s Exrs. </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 279, 283, 1853 WL 28. \u201cThat implication has been defined to be such a strong probability that an intention to the contrary cannot be supposed.\u201d Id. at 283. A testator cannot, by any words of exclusion used in his will, disinherit one of his lawful heirs, in respect to property not disposed of by that will. Id. at 283. \u201cTo allow a testator to leave his property undisposed of, and by will to control the course of descent and distribution, would be to allow him to repeal the law of the land.\u201d Id. at 283. However, it is important to note that Ohio law allows a testator to disinherit a child without specifically stating that he intends to disinherit that child. \u201c[I]f [a] testator makes no mention of one of his children in his will and by such will disposes of all of his property, such child is as completely disinherited as if the testator had specifically so provided.\u201d <em>Birman v. Sproat </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 65, 69, 546 N.E.2d 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Birman, </em>the illegitimate daughter of a deceased man contested the execution and construction of his will. By will, the decedent made several small bequests and left the residue of his estate to his wife. The proponents of the will made a motion for summary judgment, and the motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 54} On appeal, the appellant argued that there is a presumption against disinheritance universally recognized by Ohio courts. The appellate court did not disagree with this argument. It did, however, hold that children, legitimate or not, can be completely disinherited by implication if a testator completely disposes of all his property by will. Id. at 69, 546 N.E.2d 1354. That disposition of property overcomes the presumption against disinheritance. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 55} The facts in this case resemble those in <em>Birman. </em>Here, Wayne completely disposed of all his real and personal property. In the first clause of his will, Wayne stated: \u201cI direct that all my just debts and funeral expenses be paid out of my estate as soon as practicable after the time of my decease.\u201d In the fourth clause of his will, Wayne stated, \u201cIn the event that Rosa A. Mehler, should predecease me, I give all the remainder of my property, tangible and intangible, of every kind, nature and description and wheresoever situated, which I may have or own, to Sharon Kilburn.\u201d Because Mehler predeceased Wayne, the remainder of all his property was to go to Kilburn after Wayne\u2019s debts were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>{\u00b6 56} In this case, Wayne clearly intended to disinherit Lanny. Wayne\u2019s will completely disposes of his property and makes no mention of his son. This disposition of his property overcomes the presumption against disinheritance. Accordingly, Lanny\u2019s fourth assignment of error is also meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 57} In these cases, Lanny has challenged the validity of the will, how it is construed, and whether his father validly disinherited him. However, the trial court properly granted summary judgment against Lanny on each of these issues. Lanny provided no evidence that his father lacked testamentary capacity when he executed his will. Moreover, the will is valid on its face since it has the testator\u2019s signature and was attested to by two witnesses. Additionally, the trial court had the authority to construe the will during the will-contest action and that construction had preclusive effect on Lanny\u2019s declaratory-judgment action. Finally, the words in Wayne\u2019s will show that he intended to disinherit Lanny and overcome the presumption against disinheritance. For all these reasons, the judgment of the probate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-8\">Vukovich and Waite, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
