Riley Wilson, appeals from the decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas that granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Florence Cook. The case stems from the alleged breach of a real-estate purchase contract and promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On April 11, 2003, the parties entered into a contract for the sale of real estate located at 1755 Oak Street, Columbus, Ohio, for the purchase price of $54,000. The contract was signed by appellee, as seller, and by appellant, \u201cJ.R. Wilson, Pres.,\u201d as buyer. The purchase contract instructed that the deed to the property was to be prepared in the name \u201cPrimal Resources, Co. and/or assignee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">{\u00b6 3} A promissory note in the amount of the purchase price, payable to appellee, was signed by \u201cJ.R. Wilson, Trustee for 1755 Oak Street Family Trust.\u201d Under the terms of the note, the entire sum was due on or before December 10, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">{\u00b6 4} On June 9, 2003, pursuant to the purchase contract, appellee executed a deed that transferred the property to J.R. Wilson, Trustee. Also on June 9, 2003, the trust executed a mortgage in favor of appellee, in the amount of the purchase price. The mortgage was not recorded until February 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The deed was recorded by the trust on December 24, 2003, at the same time that the trust, acting through appellant, executed and recorded a second mortgage in favor of Primal Resources in the amount of $23,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 6} No payments were made on the promissory note, and the note was in default as of December 11, 2003. Both the deed from appellee and the second mortgage to Primal Resources were filed after the promissory note was in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 7} On April 20, 2004, appellee filed suit against J. Riley Wilson, Primal Resources, Co., J.R. Wilson, Trustee of the 1755 Oak Street Family Trust and the 1755 Oak Street Family Land Trust. The complaint raised claims of willful misconduct, breach of the purchase agreement, and default of the promissory note and sought ejectment and recovery of the real property and to quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellee moved for summary judgment on January 25, 2005. Appellee supported her motion with her affidavit and other documents. Appellant opposed the motion on February 22, 2005, and attached several documents, including what purports to be a valuation of the real estate by a professional appraiser. These documents were not supported by affidavit or otherwise authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 9} On May 23, 2005, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee on her claims for breach of the purchase agreement and promissory note. The court denied the claim for willful misconduct, finding it to be tantamount to a claim for punitive damages, which are not available for breach of contract. Appellee was given the option to collect money damages or rescind the purchase agreement and reconvey the property. Appellee elected rescission. The decision was journalized on June 8, 2005. On July 6, 2005, appellant, J. Riley Wilson, filed notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant raises the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQW\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">The trial court erred in finding that the defendant materially breached the Purchase Agreement and Not [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">The trial court erred in finding that the failure of the plaintiff to satisfy hens against the property was not a condition precedent to performance by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">The trial court erred and abused its discretion by refusing to recognize the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report prepared by Terri L. White, Appraiser and Charles Kent, Supervisory appraiser (State of Ohio Certification No. 000387123) attached as an exhibit to defendant\u2019s Memorandum Contra Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment, that established that the defendant made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>substantial improvements on the property that significantly increased its fair market value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 11} Before considering the assignments of error raised by appellant, the court will address appellee\u2019s assertion that the brief should be stricken for failure to comply with the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure. Appellee asserts that appellant failed to cite the portions of the record that allegedly support appellant\u2019s argument on appeal as required by App.R. 16(D); that appellant\u2019s brief does not contain a statement of the issues presented as required by App.R. 16(A)(4); and that appellant failed,to include a table of cases or statutes, a statement of facts, or a proper statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 12} Procedural rules adopted by courts are designed to promote the administration of justice and to eliminate undue delay. A substantial disregard of procedural rules cannot be tolerated. As stated by the Ohio Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">There is no excuse for the failure of any member of the bar to understand or to comply with the rules of this court. They are promulgated so that causes coming before the court will be presented in a clear and logical manner, and any litigant availing himself of the jurisdiction of the court is subjected thereto. Not to be minimized is the necessity of compliance as an accommodation to the correct dispatch of the court\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\"><em>Drake v. Bucher </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 37, 39-40, 34 O.O.2d 53, 213 N.E.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 13} We have urged members of the bar to follow the Rules of Appellate Procedure, as well as this court\u2019s local rules, to promote the administration of justice and to eliminate undue delay. <em>Hahn v. Satullo, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 412, 2004-Ohio-1057, 806 N.E.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant\u2019s brief fails to comply with certain portions of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. For example, appellant\u2019s brief fails to argue each assignment of error separately as required by App.R. 12(A)(2). The rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">The court may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party raising it fails to identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based or fails to argue the assignment of error separately ip the brief, as required under App.R. 16(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">{\u00b6 15} The purpose behind the rule is to require the appellant to specifically identify the error the appellant claims occurred and the portion of the record that supports the claim of error. Courts of appeals \u201ccannot and will not search the record in order to make arguments on appellant\u2019s] behalf.\u201d <em>Helman v. EPL Prolong, Inc. </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 231, 240, 743 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Effective appellate advocacy includes a clear statement of a litigant\u2019s position on a specific issue. Argument that is restricted to a single issue and is supported by authority is far more effective than a brief that combines multiple assignments of error on different points of law. App.R. 12(A)(2) recognizes this need for clarity and requires that assignments of error be argued separately. The failure to argue separately assigned errors' is grounds for summary affirmance. <em>Guerry v. Guerry </em>(Oct. 11, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 77819, 2001 WL 1230830. See <em>Helman, </em>supra, 139 Ohio App.3d at 239-240, 743 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 17} In the instant appeal, appellant has raised three assignments of error. However, appellant has not separately argued each assignment of error in his brief. Hence, as in <em>Guerry, </em>summary affirmance would be within this court\u2019s discretion. App.R. 12(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 18} However, courts prefer to determine cases on the merits rather than upon procedural default. Despite appellant\u2019s failure to follow the Rules of Appellate procedure, we chose to decide this case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 19} An appellate court reviews summary judgment de novo. <em>Koos v. Cent. Ohio Cellular, Inc. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 579, 588, 641 N.E.2d 265. An appellate court will affirm if any of the grounds the movant raised at trial support the judgment of the trial court. <em>Coventry Twp. v. Ecker </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 38, 41-42, 654 N.E.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 20} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court committed error by finding that the defendants materially breached the real estate purchase agreement and promissory note. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 21} As relevant to this appeal, Civ.R. 56(A) allows a party seeking to recover upon a claim to move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment in the party\u2019s favor as to all or any part of the claim. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact * * * show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">{\u00b6 22} Civ.R. 56(E) includes the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party\u2019s pleadings, but the party\u2019s response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided by this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>genuine issue for trial. If the party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 23} The rule is mandatory. While there is no \u201cdefault\u201d summary judgment, when a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported as required by the rule and the motion demonstrates that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the opposing party must respond. The failure of the opposing party to respond with evidence of the type required by the rule leaves the trial court with no other choice but to grant the motion. See <em>State ex rel. Trafalgar Corp. v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-6406, 819 N.E.2d 1040; <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 24} Here, appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was supported by appellee\u2019s affidavit, which is evidence of the type required by Civ.R. 56(C). The affidavit sets forth the existence of the purchase agreement and note and states that the property was conveyed and was titled in the name of appellant, J. Riley Wilson, that the principal amount of $54,000 was due to appellee under the agreement, but no payments had been made and the note was in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 25} Additionally, the answer to plaintiffs complaint admitted paragraphs one, two, three, and nine, although it denied personal responsibility on the part of appellant. These paragraphs alleged the existence and terms of the purchase contract between the parties and the existence and terms of the promissory note. Therefore, those facts were undisputed when the trial court considered the motion for summary judgment. The answer further admitted paragraph four of the complaint \u2014 that none of the defendants, including appellant, had paid any portion of the promissory note. Therefore, those facts were undisputed when the trial court considered the motion. Those undisputed facts support a finding that the buyers, including appellant, were in material breach of both the purchase agreement and the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant states that there were unpaid liens against the property and makes other factual allegations that appellant believes rebut appellee\u2019s evidence in support of summary judgment. However, Civ.R. 56(C) prohibits a court from considering evidence that does not meet the requirements of the rule. \u201cNo evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule.\u201d Appellant offered no evidence of the type required by Civ.R. 56 to rebut appellee\u2019s evidence. Appellee\u2019s claims were properly supported as required; appellant\u2019s claims were not. The evidence properly before the trial court, together with the admissions contained in the pleadings, left the trial court with no option but to find that appellant and the other defendants materially breached the purchase agreement and promissory note. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error asserts that the trial court should have recognized that the failure to satisfy liens against the property was a condition precedent to performance by appellant and the other defendants. However, as with the first assignment of error, appellant failed to present any evidentiary material of the type recognized by Civ.R. 56 that would support his claim that there were unpaid liens against the property. Simply asserting the existence of facts does not comply with the duties placed upon a party opposing summary judgment. Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 28} The problem with appellant\u2019s lack of evidentiary support for his response to the motion for summary judgment was noted by the trial court. The trial court found that the defendants had made \u201cunsupported claims that they invested as much as fifteen to twenty thousand dollars * * * in the property.\u201d The court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">These issues could undoubtedly affect rescission of the Purchase Agreement, Foreclosure of the Trust Mortgage, or reconveyance of the property, had they been properly preserved in the record with evidence proper under Civ.R. 56. Absent a material dispute of fact, however, the only question truly remaining open is what relief the Plaintiff elects to receive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 29} We must agree with the trial court. In proceedings in summary judgment, claimed facts that are not supported as required by Civ.R. 56 do not exist for the purpose of ruling upon the motion. It was appellant\u2019s obligation to support his assertions of fact with evidence. The failure to do so is fatal to his attack upon the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 30} Finally, even if appellant had properly supported his opposition to summary judgment, the result would not change. It is settled law in Ohio that when a deed is delivered and accepted without qualification pursuant to a real-estate purchase agreement, the agreement merges with the deed and no separate cause of action under the contract exists. \u2018Where a deed is delivered and accepted without qualification pursuant to agreement, no cause of action upon the prior agreement thereafter exists.\u201d <em>Fuller v. Drenberg </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 109, 32 O.O.2d 91, 209 N.E.2d 417, paragraph one of the syllabus. This rule of law has been well settled in Ohio for well over a century. See <em>Brumbaugh v. Chapman </em>(1887), 45 Ohio St. 368, 13 N.E. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">{\u00b6 31} With few exceptions, under this doctrine of merger, the purchaser is limited to the express covenants in the deed. <em>Fuller, </em>supra; <em>37 Robinwood Assoc. v. Health Industries, Inc. </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 156, 158, 547 N.E.2d 1019; <em>Newman v. Group One, Ohio Partnership, </em>Highland App. No. 04CA18, 2005-Ohio-1582, 2005 WL 737579. Therefore, once the deed for the Oak Street property was unconditionally accepted by the buyers, appellant\u2019s claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>appellee had not fulfilled contractual conditions precedent was extinguished. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 32} In his third assignment of error, appellant states that the trial court should have considered evidence in the form of an appraisal report that supported appellant\u2019s claim that appellant and the other defendants had made improvements to the property. In opposing summary judgment, appellant attached what purports to be a report from a professional real-estate appraiser. When supporting documents fall outside Civ.R. 56(C), the evidence must be incorporated by reference in a properly framed affidavit. <em>Blanton v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 61, 2002-Ohio-6044, 779 N.E.2d 788. However, appellant did not authenticate the report or provide an affidavit of the appraiser to support the document. Civ.R. 56(C) is very clear. \u201cNo evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule.\u201d Therefore, the trial court was prohibited from considering the attached appraisal report. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 33} Having overruled each of the assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-8\">Sadler and McGrath, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
