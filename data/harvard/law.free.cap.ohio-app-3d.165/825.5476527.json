For the reasons set forth below, the trial court judgment is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, appellant sets forth a single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-9\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting the appellee\u2019s motion to suppress as there was reasonable articulable suspicion to stop the appellee\u2019s vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">{\u00b6 4} The following undisputed facts are relevant to the issue raised on appeal. On June 4, 2005, at 2:15 a.m., appellee was stopped by a Bowling Green police officer. The officer observed appellee violate a \u201cno turn on red\u201d traffic-control sign posted at a major intersection. Following the stop, appellee was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, prohibited alcohol content, and possessing an open alcohol container in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">{\u00b6 5} Appellee filed a motion to suppress, asserting that the officer lacked reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct the traffic stop. On September 27, 2005, a hearing was conducted on appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. The substantive basis of appellee\u2019s motion is the contention that because the traffic-control sign which appellee violated was never formally \u201cauthorized\u201d by the Bowling Green City Council, the officer\u2019s reasonable, articulable suspicion is fatally compromised. In support, appellee argued that \u201cno conviction is possible due to a prohibition which is not enforceable by reason of unauthorized signs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">{\u00b6 6} Simply put, appellee maintains that because she could not be convicted of the traffic-sign violation, the entire stop is fatally compromised. Appellee relies upon the recent decision by this court in <em>State v. Godwin </em>(June 24, 2005), 6th Dist. No. WD-04-094, 2005-Ohio-3204, 2005 WL 1492059. The trial court concurred in this analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">{\u00b6 7} On September 28, 2005, the trial court filed its decision on the motion to suppress. The trial court held, \u201c[Bjased upon Sixth Court of Appeals holding in <em>State v. Godwin, </em>2005-Ohio-3204, this court finds that Officer Clingenpeel did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>have reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop the defendant since the \u2018no turn on red\u2019 sign was never approved by city council nor placed in the city traffic control file. Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence flowing from her traffic stop is granted.\u201d On October 3, 2005, appellant filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">{\u00b6 8} In order to determine the veracity of appellant\u2019s assignment of error, we must identify the determinative facts relied upon in <em>Godwin, </em>compare them with the determinative facts in this case, and ascertain whether the cases are substantively analogous. If so, the <em>Godwin </em>holding will determine the outcome of this case. We must identify what the court relied upon to support its legal conclusions in <em>Godwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">{\u00b6 9} In its assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in determining that the officer lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop appellee\u2019s vehicle and, thus, erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. The <em>Godwin </em>case stems from a November 14, 2003 traffic stop in response to a motorist\u2019s violation of a municipal-parking-lot traffic-control sign. It was later determined that the sign violated in <em>Godwin </em>was not formally authorized by the Bowling Green Traffic Commission. However, the sign in <em>Godwin </em>is a type of sign expressly authorized by the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (\u201cOMUTCD\u201d). The sign in <em>Godwin </em>complied with the technical specifications mandated by the OMUTCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">{\u00b6 10} Despite full OMUTCD compliance, the sign in <em>Godwin </em>was not formally authorized by the local traffic commission or city council. On that basis, this court applied the facts in <em>Godwin </em>to our analysis in <em>State v. Berry, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-02-043, 2003-Ohio-1620, 2003 WL 1699840, and concluded the officer lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop appellee\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">{\u00b6 11} Given the above, to assess the legitimacy of appellee\u2019s Godwin-based argument, we must also examine <em>Berry. Godwin\u2019s </em>reliance upon <em>Berry </em>furnishes the factual and legal context of the <em>Godwin </em>ruling. The <em>Berry </em>case arose from a traffic sign at the exact same location as the sign in <em>Godwin. </em>The <em>Berry </em>case, like <em>Godmn </em>and this case, involved a late-night traffic stop resulting in the discovery of alcohol and/or drug violations in Bowling Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">{\u00b6 12} The <em>Berry </em>case began in 2002. On June 2, 2002, an officer observed a vehicle violate a municipal parking lot traffic-control sign. The traffic sign in <em>Berry </em>read \u201cDo not exit.\u201d It was determined that the OMUTCD did not authorize the existence of such a sign. Thus, the sign itself was not recognized or permitted by OMUTCD and was intrinsically unenforceable and a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">{\u00b6 13} Based upon the null status of the sign, this court held in <em>Berry </em>that the officer lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion specifically because the sign itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>could never legitimately exist pursuant to OMUTCD. This unique factual scenario is what legally negated reasonable, articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">{\u00b6 14} In response to <em>Berry, </em>the city of Bowling Green erected a new traffic-control sign at the same location. This replacement sign was a type of sign specifically authorized by OMUTCD. The replacement sign was the subject of <em>Godwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">{\u00b6 15} Significantly, this court explicitly cautioned against a mistakenly over-broad interpretation of the impact of the <em>Berry </em>ruling. We stated in <em>Berry, </em>\u201cOur decision should not be misinterpreted as saying that anytime an officer stops a driver for an offense for which the offender may ultimately be acquitted, the officer did not have reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop the offender. We have, in fact, held otherwise.\u201d <em>Berry </em>at \u00b6 11.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">{\u00b6 16} Nevertheless, the majority in <em>Godwin </em>held that because the replacement sign was unenforceable, the officer lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion. The <em>Godwin </em>court held, \u201cThe officer did not observe a traffic violation because the \u2018wrong way do not enter\u2019 and \u2018no left/right turn\u2019 signs were not enforceable. Absent an offense, there is no reason to stop appellant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">{\u00b6 17} The factual basis for not enforcing the parking-lot traffic sign in <em>Berry </em>was that the sign\u2019s very existence was not authorized by OMUTCD. The sign was a nullity under any circumstances. In <em>Godwin, </em>the factual basis for not enforcing the replacement sign was the failure of the Bowling Green traffic commission or city council to formally authorize the replacement sign. The sign\u2019s existence was permitted and was in conformity with the specifications set forth in the OMUTCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">{\u00b6 18} We find that there are fundamental, determinative factual distinctions between this case and <em>Godwin. </em>These critical distinctions render this case materially distinguishable from <em>Godwin. </em>This case is not controlled by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Godwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">{\u00b6 19} The determinative fact in <em>Berry </em>was that the sign\u2019s very existence was a nullity under the OMUTCD. It was not authorized under any circumstances, regardless of local authorizations or approvals. As a legal nullity, it was wholly unenforceable. <em>Godwin </em>arose from the replacement sign at this same location. The replacement sign was constructed due to <em>Berry. </em>By contrast, this case involves a common, widely used, \u201cno turn on red\u201d intersection sign authorized by OMUTCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">{\u00b6 20} This court held in <em>Godwin </em>that the officer also lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion because the sign was a nullity. The court held that the officer could not have had reasonable, articulable suspicion that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>was violating the law because the sign was a nullity; it did not exist under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">{\u00b6 21} In this case, the record shows that the disputed traffic control is authorized by OMUTCD. Thus, <em>Godwin </em>is inapplicable to our analysis of this case. We adhere to the position delineated by this court in its analysis in the <em>Berry </em>decision. <em>Berry </em>explicitly acknowledged that an officer can possess reasonable, articulable suspicion in support of a stop despite a defendant being acquitted for the offense for which the stop was initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">{\u00b6 22} As applied to this case, we find that although the failure of the Bowling Green traffic commission or city council to formally authorize the no-turn-on-red sign may prohibit enforcement of the sign, it did not negate an officer\u2019s reasonable, articulable suspicion to initiate an investigatory traffic stop based upon observation of a violation of that disputed traffic sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">{\u00b6 23} Our position is in conformity with our holding in <em>State v. Nickelson </em>(July 20, 2001), 6th Dist. No. H-00-036, 2001 WL 1028878, in which, as summarized in Berry, at \u00b6 11, we held that \u201cthe officer did not need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the driver was violating the statute; he needed only reasonable suspicion that the driver was violating the ordinance. We held that the officer had such reasonable suspicion under those circumstances.\u201d We affirmed this legal principle in <em>Berry, </em>the case relied upon by <em>Godwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">{\u00b6 24} Other appellate courts in Ohio have come to similar conclusions. In <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>4th Dist. No. 02-CA37, 2003-Ohio-5970, 2003 WL 22532819, the Fourth District held that the <em>Berry </em>decision did not invalidate an officer\u2019s reasonable, articulable suspicion in making a traffic stop for a violation of a \u201cno u turn\u201d sign even after it was revealed that the disputed sign was constructed one foot smaller than called for by the OMUTCD. The <em>Dunfee </em>court found that although the disputed sign was not enforceable, reasonable, articulable suspicion was not compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">{\u00b6 25} Similarly, we conclude that although the violation of the no-turn-on-red sign is unenforceable, the officer in this case possessed reasonable, articulable suspicion to make the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">{\u00b6 26} We have thoroughly reviewed and considered the record in this case. This case is materially distinguishable from <em>Godwin. </em>We find the officer possessed reasonable, articulable suspicion. This finding is based upon the facts of this case in conjunction with our opinions in <em>Berry </em>and <em>Nickelson </em>and the Fourth District holding in <em>Dunfee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">{\u00b6 27} <em>Godwin </em>does not support appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress. The enforceability of the \u201cno turn on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>red\u201d sign did not negate the officer\u2019s reasonable, articulable suspicion. The stop was proper. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">{\u00b6 28} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and remanded. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal are awarded to Wood County.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b872-7\">Handwork and Skow, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
