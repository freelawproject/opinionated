The tortfeasor and her insurance company settled with appellees for the policy limits of $62,500 with appellant\u2019s consent. Appellant is appellees\u2019 underinsured-motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) insurance provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">{\u00b6 3} Appellees filed a complaint against appellant for UIM coverage. They alleged that the amount of coverage from the tortfeasor was not enough to cover their damages resulting from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">{\u00b6 4} The case proceeded to a jury trial. The jury returned a verdict for appellant. Appellees subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court held a hearing on appellees\u2019 motion. It subsequently entered a judgment simply stating that the motion for a new trial was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on March 18, 2005. Because the trial court had failed to specify the reason for granting a new trial, this court remanded the ease for the trial court to enter a new judgment entry stating its reasons. The trial court subsequently entered a judgment stating that the verdict was not sustained by sufficient evidence, that manifest injustice was done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to appellees, and that the jury\u2019s damage verdict was inadequate and appeared to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant now raises two assignments of error. For ease of discussion, we will address appellant\u2019s second assignment of error first. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion in granting a new trial under Civ[.] R. 59(A)(6) because there was sufficient credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 8} Here, appellant first argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment entry does not properly state the grounds on which the motion for new trial was granted. It asserts that merely stating that the jury\u2019s verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence is not a specific enough reason for granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 9} Civ.R. 59(A)(6) provides, \u201cA new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues upon any of the following grounds: * * * [t]he judgment is not sustained by the weight of the evidence.\u201d Civ.R. 59(A) continues, \u201cWhen a new trial is granted, the court shall specify in writing the grounds upon which such new trial is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 10} Because the trial court initially failed to specify the reason for granting a new trial, this court remanded the case for the trial court to enter a new judgment entry stating its reasons. The trial court then entered a judgment, stating in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cBased upon the courts [sic] own observation of the evidence as presented by counsel at the trial, and taking into consideration the briefs and the arguments of counsel at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the court feels that the verdict of the jury is not sustained by sufficient evidence, and that manifest injustice has been done to the plaintiffs. Therefore, this court grants plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial, based upon Ohio Civil Rule 59(A)(6), that is, that the verdict of the jury is against the manifest weight of the evidence and based upon Ohio Civil 59(A)(4), that the jury\u2019s damage verdict was inadequate and appears to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 12} A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Koch v. Rist </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 250, 251, 730 N.E.2d 963. Abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment entry is insufficient for the reasons set out in <em>Antal v. Olde Worlde Prods., Inc. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 144, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>9 OBR 392, 459 N.E.2d 223. In <em>Antal, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held: \u201cWhen granting a motion for a new trial based on the contention that the verdict is not sustained by the weight of the evidence, the trial court must articulate the reasons for so doing in order to allow a reviewing court to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial.\u201d Id. at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">{\u00b6 14} In that case, the trial court\u2019s order granting a new trial stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018Having reviewed the charges of error contained in * * * [appellees\u2019] motion, having considered the arguments of counsel of the parties and being duly advised, the Court finds that the jury\u2019s-verdict awarding compensatory damages to each of the * * * [appellants] is not sustained by the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, it will not be necessary for the Court to pass on the other claimed errors and it is ORDERED the * * * [appellees\u2019] motion for a new trial be and hereby is granted.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 16} The Supreme Court held that this Was insufficient. It reversed the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court so it could reconsider the motion for a new trial. In doing so, it reasoned that meaningful appellate review is impossible when the trial court grants a new trial and fails to specify the reasons beyond a conclusory statement that the verdict is not sustained by the weight of the evidence. Id. at 145-46, 9 OBR 392, 459 N.E.2d 223. Noting that the standard of review in these cases is abuse of discretion, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWere a trial court to be permitted the freedom to disregard a jury\u2019s verdict by simply invoking the apothegm that the verdict \u2018is not sustained by the weight of the evidence,\u2019 the jury trial itself could become a futile prelude. Furthermore, without some articulated basis for granting a new trial, the trial court\u2019s decision is virtually insulated from meaningful appellate review. As previously stated, an appellate tribunal will not reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling absent an abuse of discretion. However, when the trial court offers no reasons for its decision, the court of appeals practically must defer to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. * * * Given the recognized importance of the trial court\u2019s input when reviewing whether a verdict is supported by the evidence, we feel it is all the more crucial to require that the trial court so state the basis for its decision.\u201d Id. at 146-47, 9 OBR 392, 459 N.E.2d 223.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">{\u00b6 18} Finally, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe question remains as to how specific must a trial court be when granting a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. The record of the case at bar reveals that the trial court articulated no reasons whatsoever, other than stating generally that the jury\u2019s verdict was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u2018sustained by the weight of the evidence.\u2019 While the determination of whether a trial court\u2019s statement of reasons is sufficient should be left to a case-by-case analysis, we can say with a reasonable degree of certainty that such reasons will be deemed insufficient if simply couched in the form of conclusions or statements of ultimate fact.\u201d Id. at 147, 9 OBR 892, 459 N.E.2d 223.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 20} The court revisited the issue and reaffirmed <em>Antal </em>in <em>Mannion v. Sandel </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 318, 744 N.E.2d 759. In <em>Mannion, </em>the court found that a judgment entry granting a new trial in favor of the plaintiffs was specific enough when it stated that both experts had \u201c \u2018testified that by failing to remove the polyurethane foam coating of Plaintiffs left breast implant upon removal of the implant, the Defendant violated the standard of care as it existed at the time.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 322, 744 N.E.2d 759. The court found that this language could not be construed as simply being couched in the form of conclusions of ultimate fact. Id. It then reiterated that it could not set a hard-and-fast rule as to the sufficiency of the grounds specified by a trial court in support of the determination that a new trial is warranted and noted that the determination was to be made on a case-by-case basis. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 21} Under <em>Antal </em>and <em>Mannion, </em>the trial court\u2019s judgment granting appel-lees a new trial is not specific enough to grant a new trial based on the weight of the evidence. The trial court merely concluded that based on its observations at trial and the parties\u2019 arguments, it felt that the verdict was not sustained by sufficient evidence and that manifest injustice had been done to appellees. It did not specify what evidence it relied on to reach this conclusion. In fact, it did not mention any specific evidence whatsoever in its entry. Its statement is merely conclusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Scibelli v. Pannunzio, </em>7th Dist. No. 02-CA-175, 2003-Ohio-3488, 2003 WL 21505068, this court addressed the issue. Relying on <em>Antal, </em>we noted that when the trial court\u2019s judgment entry cannot provide meaningful review, the case must be reversed and remanded to the trial court to reconsider its order and/or to state reasons for that decision. Id. at \u00b6 9. We observed that the judgment entry in that case did not comply with <em>Antal, </em>because it merely concluded that the \u201c \u2018jury\u2019s verdict did create an injustice because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 10. However, we did not remand the case to the trial court for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 23} First, we noted that the appellant did not properly raise the issue of the sufficiency of the judgment entry because his first mention of it was in his reply brief, which is not the proper place to raise a new issue for appellate review. Id. at \u00b6 11. We further noted that we would not raise the issue sua sponte. Id. Thus, we concluded that the issue was not properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Second, we concluded that the record in that specific situation provided uncontroverted testimony that the appellant was the proximate cause of some injury to the appellee. Id. at \u00b6 12. Additionally, the appellant had already admitted that he had breached his duty to the appellee. Id. We noted that if the record is clear enough to provide a meaningful review, a remand is not necessary. Id. On this issue we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTherefore, despite the insufficient journal entry, we are not reversing and remanding for more detailed findings. However, we caution the trial court that an absence of sufficiently detailed findings when holding that the jury\u2019s verdict is against the weight of the evidence will generally necessitate a reversal and remand to cure the defect. However, in this factually specific situation, i.e. the failure to properly raise the inadequacy of the journal entry, the admission of negligence, and the uncontroverted testimony that the delay proximately caused some damage, there is a sufficient factual basis in the record for this court to review the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 26} This case is distinguishable from <em>Scibelli. </em>Here, appellant properly raised the issue of the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s judgment entry. And the main issue focused on damages. Additionally, in <em>Scibelli, </em>the record was very clear as to why the trial court granted the appellee a new trial. Such is not the case here. Furthermore, in their motion, appellees raised several issues regarding different witnesses and their given testimony. We are left only with speculation as to what evidence specifically the court relied on in granting a new trial. Therefore, we have no way of reviewing whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting appellees a new trial. Thus, the trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 27} If this were the only basis for the trial court\u2019s decision, our analysis would stop here. However, the trial court gave another reason in its judgment entry for granting appellees a new trial. In addition to Civ.R. 59(A)(6), the trial court also relied on Civ.R. 59(A)(4). This leads us to appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion in granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for new trial under Civ. R. 59(A)(4) because there was no showing the jury\u2019s verdict was inadequate and due to passion or prejudice resulting from improperly admitted evidence, improper argument of counsel or other inappropriate conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant argues that appellees failed to offer any argument that the jury was swayed by passion or prejudice. Instead, it contends that appellees merely argued that the six female jurors did not like Margaret and, therefore, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>not consider the evidence. It contends that neither appellees nor the trial court was able to rely on Civ.R. 59(A)(4). And appellant again asserts that the court abused its discretion because it gave no justification in its judgment entry for supporting its finding of passion or prejudice. Thus, appellant concludes that the trial court abused its discretion by granting a new trial based solely on the size of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 30} In reply, appellees assert that the evidence at trial demonstrated that their medical bills totaled over $40,000 and that Margaret would suffer pain and disability for the rest of her life. They contend that the jury\u2019s verdict finding that they were not entitled to anything beyond the $62,500 they had already received from the tortfeasor was clearly inadequate. They further contend that the court\u2019s judgment entry was sufficient to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 31} Additionally, appellees argue that the court\u2019s finding of passion or prejudice resulted from two instances. First, they claim that it was prejudicial for the court to allow the jury to hear that appellees had already been compensated $62,500 while not allowing the jury to hear that under the UIM policy with appellant, $300,000 in coverage was available. Second, appellees argue that they were prejudiced when appellant\u2019s counsel asked the jurors whether they thought insurance premiums were too high. They contend that this question led the jurors to think that they could help keep premiums down by keeping the verdict low.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 32} Civ.R. 59(A)(4) provides that the court may grant a new trial on the grounds of \u201c[e]xcessive or inadequate damages, appearing to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice.\u201d As is the case with Civ.R. 59(A)(6), the court granting a new trial \u201cshall specify in writing the grounds upon which such new trial is granted.\u201d Civ.R. 59(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 33} Again, the trial court abused it discretion in granting appellees a new trial without providing any specific reasons. While the Ohio Supreme Court of Ohio addressed only new trials granted on the basis of weight of evidence in <em>Antal </em>and <em>Mannion, </em>its reasoning applies to new trials granted on the basis of excessive or inadequate damages given under the influence of passion or prejudice, too. Civ.R. 59(A) lists nine reasons for granting a new trial and also gives the trial court discretion to grant a new trial for good cause shown. It then states that when the court grants a new trial, it shall specify in writing the grounds on which the new trial is granted. Thus, this requirement applies to all grounds on which a new trial may be granted, not just when it is granted based on the weight of the evidence. Consequently, it is reasonable that the same amount of specificity is required of the trial court no matter which ground it based its decision on in granting a new trial. And at least one other district has applied this rationale to new trials granted on the basis of Civ.R. 59(A)(4). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Gedetsis v. Anthony Allega Cement Contrs., Inc. </em>(Sept. 23, 1993), 8th Dist. No. 64954, 1993 WL 379351; <em>Powell v. Schiffauer </em>(Feb. 2, 1989), 8th Dist. No. 54930, 1989 WL 7941.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">{\u00b6 34} Furthermore, appellees never even asserted that they should be granted a new trial based on Civ.R. 59(A)(4). In their motion for a new trial, appellees stated, \u201cPlaintiffs hereby move this court to grant a new trial, pursuant to Ohio Civil Rule 59(A)(6).\u201d Their supporting argument focused on the evidence presented at trial and the weight that they felt the jury should have given to that evidence. In their reply to appellant\u2019s brief in opposition, appellees again did not raise Civ.R. 59(A)(4) as a basis for a new trial. And at the hearing on their motion, appellees\u2019 counsel again reiterated that the motion was based on weight of the evidence and contended that the women jurors ignored the evidence because they did not like Margaret. Appellees\u2019 brief is the first place we find any mention by appellees of passion or prejudice based on the jury\u2019s hearing that appellees had already been compensated $62,500 and appellant\u2019s counsel asking the jurors whether they thought insurance premiums were too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 35} Therefore, we cannot discern what the trial court based its decision on when it found that the jury\u2019s verdict was inadequate and appeared to be given under the influence of passion or prejudice. This issue was not even before the court because appellees had not raised it. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 36} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby reversed and remanded. On remand, the trial court is to reconsider its decision granting a new trial and, if it reaches the same conclusion, it is to sufficiently detail its findings for granting a new trial by following the requirements set out in <em>Antal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-8\">Waite and DeGenaro, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
