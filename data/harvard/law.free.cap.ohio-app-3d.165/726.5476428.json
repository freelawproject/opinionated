On July 6, 2005, a complaint was filed against Franklin, who was 17 at the time, alleging that he was a' delinquent child. The complaint asserted seven counts of felonious assault against seven police officers, all first-degree felonies in violation of R.C. 2903.11 and all with accompanying firearm specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed a motion to relinquish jurisdiction, requesting that the juvenile court hold a preliminary hearing to determine whether to transfer the case to the common pleas court. The juvenile court held a hearing on the matter.' The court found that there was probable cause to believe that Franklin had committed the alleged acts. It concluded, however, that the charges are not category I or II offenses as defined by R.C. 2152.02. Therefore, it denied appellant\u2019s motion to relinquish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>{\u00b6 5} On October 10, 2005, appellant filed a motion to dismiss all charges against Franklin. On October 11, the court granted the motion and dismissed all charges. On October 13, appellant filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 6} The other appeal involves juveniles Lavelle Stanley, Lavar Paige, Aundre Scrutchen, Montrail Berry, and Keith Black. On June 8, 2005, complaints were filed against these juveniles, alleging that they were delinquent children. The complaints alleged that the juveniles participated in a pattern of criminal gang activity, a second-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2923.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 7} As in Franklin\u2019s case, appellant filed motions to relinquish jurisdiction with the juvenile court. The juvenile court held hearings on the motions and overruled them, again stating that the charges were not category I or II offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant filed timely notices of appeal on October 6, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 9} At the outset, it should be noted that while appellee Franklin has filed a brief, appellees Stanley, Paige, Scrutchen, Berry, and Black have failed to file briefs in this matter. Therefore, we may accept appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment as to those appellees if appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action. App.R. 18(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant raises one assignment of error, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhere R.C. 2152.12(B) allowed discretionary bindover in these cases, the lower court failed to apply the appropriate statute and incorrectly overruled the state\u2019s motion to relinquish jurisdiction on the grounds that the charges were neither category I nor category II offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant contends that the juvenile court erred in considering only the mandatory bindover factors and failing to consider the discretionary bindover factors in ruling on its motions to relinquish jurisdiction. It refers us to R.C. 2152.12(B). Appellant argues that it is apparent from the juvenile court\u2019s judgment entries that it considered only the mandatory bindover factors because it stated that because the charges were not category I or II offenses, the motions to relinquish jurisdiction were overruled. Appellant concedes that it did not establish grounds necessary for mandatory bindover. However, it argues that we must remand these cases so that the juvenile court can consider them pursuant to R.C. 2152.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">{\u00b6 13} In response, appellee Franklin notes that in his case, after the juvenile court refused to relinquish jurisdiction, appellant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him, which the court granted. He further contends that appellant then filed new charges against him for attempted murder instead of felonious assault. Therefore, he argues that appellant is now attempting to appeal an order from a case that has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Accordingly, Franklin argues that there is no final appealable order in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Before addressing the merits of appellant\u2019s assignment of error, we must determine whether there is a final appealable order in Franklin\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 15} The juvenile court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to relinquish jurisdiction on September 22, 2005. On October 10, appellant filed a motion to dismiss all seven counts against Franklin. On October 11, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion and dismissed all seven counts and gun specifications against Franklin. On October 13, appellant filed a notice of appeal from the court\u2019s September 22 judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 16} This timeline demonstrates that all charges against Franklin were dismissed before appellant filed a notice of appeal from the judgment denying the bindover. Therefore, when appellant filed the notice of appeal, no case existed from which to appeal. The dismissal of a criminal complaint without prejudice leaves no case to be appealed. See <em>State v. Beauregard, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 85402, 85403, 85404, 85405, 2005-Ohio-3722, 2005 WL 1706963; <em>State v. Brown, </em>8th Dist. No. 84229, 2004-Ohio-5587, 2004 WL 2361820. Thus, as to Franklin, this case lacks a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 17} As to the other appellees, however, there is no indication that the charges were ever dismissed. Therefore, we must consider the merits of appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">{\u00b6 18} A juvenile court enjoys wide latitude to retain or relinquish jurisdiction, with the ultimate decision lying in its sound discretion. <em>State v. Watson </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 93, 95, 547 N.E.2d 1181. A decision regarding a bindover should not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Golphin </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 543, 546, 692 N.E.2d 608. Abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2152.10(A) provides specific situations in which a child who is alleged to be a delinquent child is eligible for mandatory transfer and shall be transferred from juvenile court to the common pleas court. Two of those specific situations are when the child is charged with a category I or II offense and was of a certain age at the time of the act charged. R.C. 2152.10(A)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">{\u00b620} Appellant concedes that appellees were not eligible for mandatory transfer. Thus, R.C. 2152.10(A) does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2152.10(B) provides for discretionary transfers. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cUnless the child is subject to mandatory transfer, if a child is fourteen years of age or older at the time of the act charged and if the child is charged with an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult, the child is eligible for discretionary transfer to the appropriate court for criminal prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Appellees meet the requirements for the juvenile court to consider discretionary transfers. All appellees were 14 years old or older at the time of the acts charged. Additionally, they were all charged with acts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. Specifically, they were charged with participating in a pattern of criminal gang activity, a second-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2923.42. Therefore, the juvenile court should have considered whether transfer was permitted under R.C. 2152.10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 24} When determining whether to transfer a child for criminal prosecution, the juvenile court is required to follow the procedures set out in R.C. 2152.12. R.C. 2152.10(B). Those procedures are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(B) Except as provided in division (A) of this section, after a complaint has been filed alleging that a child is a delinquent child for committing an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult, the juvenile court at a hearing may transfer the case if the court finds all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(1) The child was fourteen years of age or older at the time of the act charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(2) There is probable cause to believe that the child committed the act charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(3) The child is not amenable to care or rehabilitation within the juvenile system, and the safety of the community may require that the child be subject to adult sanctions. In making its decision under this division, the court shall consider whether the applicable factors under division (D) of this section indicating that the case should be transferred outweigh the applicable factors under division (E) of this section indicating that the case should not be transferred. The record shall indicate the specific factors that were applicable and that the court weighed.\u201d R.C. 2152.12(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">{\u00b6 29} Reviewing the juvenile court\u2019s judgment entries leads to the conclusion that it failed to consider the R.C. 2152.12(B) factors in determining not to transfer appellees. In each appellee\u2019s case, the court\u2019s judgment entry states: \u201cState\u2019s Motion to Relinquish Jurisdiction is overruled since the charge is not a Category I nor II offense.\u201d The court gives this as its only reason for not transferring appellees. It makes no reference whatsoever as to whether appel-lees should or should not be transferred pursuant to the discretionary-transfer statutory sections. Because the court\u2019s only given reason for not granting appellant\u2019s motions to relinquish jurisdiction was that the charges were not category I or II offenses, we conclude that the court never considered whether it should relinquish jurisdiction based on the discretionary transfer factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">{\u00b6 30} Juv.R. 30 also provides for the relinquishment of jurisdiction in juvenile cases. It states that in any proceeding in which the court considers the transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>of a case for criminal prosecution, the juvenile court is to hold a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the child committed the act alleged and that the act would be an offense if committed by an adult. Juv.R. 30(A). Juv.R. 30(C) farther provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIn any proceeding in which transfer of a case for criminal prosecution is permitted, but not required, by statute, and in which probable cause is found at the preliminary hearing, the court shall continue the proceeding for full investigation. The investigation shall include a mental examination of the child by a public or private agency or by a person qualified to make the examination. When the investigation is completed, an amenability hearing shall be held to determine whether to transfer jurisdiction. The criteria for transfer shall be as provided by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">{\u00b6 32} There is no indication that the juvenile court held such a hearing or conducted such an investigation in these cases. In Franklin\u2019s case, the judgment entry denying the bindover specifically found that probable cause existed to believe that he had committed the acts charged. However, in the other cases, the court made no such probable-cause findings, nor does it appear that the court held hearings to determine whether probable cause existed. In judgment entries dated June 21, July 6, and July 25, 2005, the trial court stated that probable-cause hearings were scheduled. However, in its August 8 judgment entries, it stated that the probable-cause hearings were converted to hearings on the motions to dismiss. There is no further mention of probable-cause hearings. Therefore, the trial court erred in failing to make a finding as to probable cause. If it made such a finding, it should have then proceeded with an investigation and amenability hearing pursuant to Juv.R. 30(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">{\u00b6 33} Based on the record, we can only conclude that the court simply considered whether a mandatory bindover was warranted. Therefore we must conclude that the court abused its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s motions to relinquish jurisdiction without considering whether a discretionary transfer was warranted. Thus, appellant\u2019s assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">{\u00b6 34} For the reasons stated above, case number 05-MA-183 is hereby dismissed for lack of a final appealable order. The juvenile court\u2019s judgments in case number 05-MA-177 are hereby reversed and remanded for the juvenile court to hold hearings and determine whether, pursuant to the discretionary transfer provisions, it should relinquish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Cause dismissed, judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b773-10\">Yukovich and Waite, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
