Appellants also ask us to reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to appellees as to all of appellants\u2019 claims. After a thorough review, we must conclude that the trial court erred in barring the testimony of appellants\u2019 expert witness and that the grant of summary judgment to appellees was therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">{\u00b6 2} The Ottawa County Board of Mental Retardation and Developmental Delay (\u201cOttawa County MR/DD\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> leased several suites in a building called \u201cthe Buckeye Building\u201d from appellee W.W. Emerson Company (\u201cEmerson\u201d). Appel-lees Northcoast Property Management Company and its agent, Lake Investments, Inc., are allegedly responsible for maintenance of the Buckeye Building. Appellants, 15 employees of Ottawa County MR/DD, worked in the Buckeye Building from May 1996 until August 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">{\u00b6 3} In their complaint and through their deposition testimony, appellants allege that appellees had allowed the Buckeye Building to deteriorate and to develop damp, musty conditions that caused mold to grow on walls, windows, and carpeting. Appellants also allege that the damp, musty conditions caused poor indoor air quality, which in turn caused appellants to suffer from respiratory and other medical problems. Daniel Pfahl, Human Resources Director for Ottawa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>County MR/DD, complained to appellees on behalf of the employees numerous times about the conditions in the building, and he requested needed repairs. Many of the complaints involved building conditions, such as leaky windows and bathroom fixtures and a malfunctioning heating and air conditioning system. Those defects allowed water to seep into the building, causing wood rot and mold. The employees described visible mold around windows, baseboards, floor tiles, vents, and carpeting. They also described a \u201cfoul smell of mildew\u201d in the air, which became increasingly pronounced until the premises were vacated. Appellants allege that appellees\u2019 agents had walked through the building many times and that appellees were aware of the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 4} In May 2000, the Ottawa County MR/DD safety committee conducted an annual inspection of the Buckeye Building and found extremely dirty air vents, water-stained ceiling tiles, and complaints of headaches among the employees. The safety committee\u2019s report was given to appellees. In response, appellees did some cleaning of the building, including cleaning the carpets. The employees noted that during the month following the cleaning, their physical problems eased, but their symptoms returned after the carpeting again became discolored and more water streaks appeared on the walls. One employee then contacted the Ottawa County Health Department about the building\u2019s condition. In August 2000, the health department inspected the Buckeye Building and found mold growth. Shortly afterwards, Ottawa County MR/DD vacated the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 5} In early September 2000, at the request of the health department, Foley Occupational Health Consulting (\u201cFoley\u201d) conducted air-quality surveys of the building by collecting four indoor air samples on different days. Testing reflected the presence of at least five species of mold spores in the air. Notably, Foley did not collect any outdoor air samples for a comparative analysis. In a letter to Pfahl, Foley noted that one fungus, <em>stachybotrys chartarum, </em>might have been the causative agent for the symptoms described by the employees, because it is sometimes known to cause symptoms such as \u201cdermatitis, flu-like symptoms, fatigue, and diarrhea and may also affect the immune system.\u201d The report noted, however, that the testing revealed only low levels of this particular fungus.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 6} On September 25, 2000, the employees filed the instant complaint, asserting that appellees\u2019 negligence in allowing mold to grow in the building caused their health problems. Their health problems included, among other things, vomiting, chronic respiratory problems, headaches, fatigue, and joint pain. The employees\u2019 spouses added claims for loss of consortium. Shortly after the filing of the complaint, another company, Hygienetics Environmental Services, Inc. (\u201cHygienetics\u201d), retained by appellants, conducted air-quality testing in the portions of the Buckeye Building previously occupied by appellants. Hygienetics took air samples for one day, over a four-hour time span. Unlike in Foley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>testing, outdoor air samples were also taken, in order to compare them with the indoor air samples. \u201cUnopened sample media field blanks\u201d were also analyzed and compared. Hygienetics also found five types of mold present, as well as bacteria not normally present in indoor or outdoor environments. Its report compared its analysis of the indoor and outdoor air samples to Foley\u2019s results.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">{\u00b6 7} Appellants also obtained an opinion from Jonathan A. Bernstein, M.D., an allergist and immunologist, that the air quality in the Buckeye Building caused their illnesses. Appellees moved to bar Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony pursuant to Evid.R. 702, arguing that his methods could not meet the standards for admissibility of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. The trial court granted the motion, and soon thereafter, it granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that appellants could not demonstrate that the Buckeye Building\u2019s conditions were the proximate cause of their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">{\u00b6 8} Appellants present three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion excluding the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Jonathan Bernstein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the personal injury claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 case without ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">I. Appellants\u2019 Expert\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">{\u00b6 12} In their first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court misapplied <em>Daubert </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, and Evid.R. 702 in excluding their expert witness, Dr. Bernstein. Evidence orders are reviewed to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. The term \u201c \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Trial courts have substantial discretion in determining which evidence to admit or exclude at trial. <em>Peters v. Ohio Lottery Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 296, 299, 587 N.E.2d 290, certiorari denied (1992), 506 U.S. 871, 113 S.Ct. 205, 121 L.Ed.2d 146. A reviewing court cannot conclude that a trial court abused its discretion merely because, in the same circumstances, it would have ruled differently or because the trial court committed a mere error in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">{\u00b6 13}\u201cHowever, where the trial court has misstated the law or applied the incorrect law and thereby given rise to a purely legal question, appellate review is de novo. <em>Shaffer v. OhioHealth Corp., </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-102, 2004-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Ohio-63, 2004 WL 35725, at \u00b6 6, citing <em>Ohio State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Dick\u2019s Pharmacy </em>(2002), 150 Ohio App.3d 343, [2002-Ohio-6500], 780 N.E.2d 1075; <em>Castlebrook, Ltd. v. Dayton Properties Ltd. Partnership </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 340, 346, 604 N.E.2d 808.\u201d <em>First Union Natl. Bank of Delaware v. Maenle </em>(2005), 162 Ohio App.3d 479, 487, 833 N.E.2d 1279. This district adopted this standard in <em>State v. Nguyen </em>(2004), 157 Ohio App.3d 482, 487, 811 N.E.2d 1180, appeal denied by 103 Ohio St.3d 1480, 816 N.E.2d 255, in which we held that while discovery orders are normally reviewed for an abuse of discretion, the review will be de novo when the decision was \u201cbased on a misconstruction of the law or an erroneous standard.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Today\u2019s Bookstore, Inc. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 810, 823, 621 N.E.2d 1283, citing <em>Castlebrook, Ltd., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[W]here a trial court\u2019s order is based on an erroneous standard or a misconstruction of the law, it is not appropriate for a reviewing court to use an abuse of discretion standard. In determining a pure question of law, an appellate court may properly substitute its judgment for that of the trial court, since an important function of appellate courts is to resolve disputed propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cConfusion has been engendered by an unfortunate choice of words when courts have said on occasion that an abuse of discretion connotes \u2018more than an error of law.\u2019 It would be more accurate to say that an abuse of discretion is \u2018different from an error of law.\u2019 A trial court\u2019s purely legal determination will not be given the deference that is properly accorded to the trial court with regard to those determinations that are within its discretion.\u201d <em>Castlebrook, Ltd., </em>78 Ohio App.3d at 346, 604 N.E.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court carefully listed its grounds for excluding Bernstein\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[T]his Court cannot grant the admissibility of Dr. Bernstein\u2019s expert testimony because it (1) is not based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) it is not a product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) he has not applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. Also, for the reasons stated herein, this Court concludes that Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony lacks, as to the proximate cause of Plaintiffs\u2019 personal injuries, a methodology satisfying <em>Daubert </em>because: (1) Dr. Bernstein failed to adhere to an established methodology for differential diagnosis by not ruling in the suspected causes and by not ruling out other possible causes, (2) he failed to support his conclusions regarding a correlation between exposure to mold, irritants, and allergic reactions and the mold and irritants in the building as the proximate cause of Plaintiffs\u2019 ailments, (3) he relied solely on temporal causation to arrive at his conclusions, and (4) he failed to present a review of the literature to support his conclusions on this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>{\u00b6 18} We hold that the trial court applied an incorrect standard of law. Ohio Evid.R. 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. To the extent that the testimony reports the result of a procedure, test, or experiment, the testimony is reliable only if all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(1) The theory upon which the procedure, test, or experiment is based is objectively verifiable or is validly derived from widely accepted knowledge, facts, or principles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(2) The design of the procedure, test, or experiment reliably implements the theory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(3) The particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a way that will yield an accurate result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">{\u00b6 26} Generally, expert testimony is admissible and will \u201cassist the trier of fact\u201d if it both (1) involves matters \u201cbeyond the ken\u201d of the ordinary person and (2) meets a threshold standard of reliability. See, generally, 1994 Staff Notes to Evid.R. 702. Reliability is often the key to determining whether an expert\u2019s testimony is admissible. Ohio has adopted the <em>Daubert </em>test for determining the reliability of an expert\u2019s opinion. See <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 687 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">{\u00b6 27} The parties dispute neither whether Dr. Bernstein is qualified as an expert nor whether his testimony relates to matters beyond the common knowledge of lay people. Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony did not involve a test, procedure, or experiment, so the factors of Evid.R. 702(C)(1) through (3) are inapplicable. The only remaining issue, which the parties vigorously dispute, is whether his testimony meets the \u201creliability\u201d requirement of the Ohio Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">{\u00b6 28} Factors used to test reliability include (1) whether the testimony is based on a theory or method that has or can be tested, (2) whether the testimony is based on a theory or method that has been subject to peer review, (3) the error rate of the particular theory or method, and (4) whether the theory or method has gained general acceptance in the field. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 593-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>594, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. These factors were not meant to be a \u201cdefinitive checklist or test.\u201d Id. The inquiry must be \u201cflexible\u201d and the focus \u201cmust be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.\u201d Id. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. We also emphasize that even though a court may admit expert evidence, finding that it meets the threshold for reliability, the jury remains free to reject such evidence for any reason, including reasons of unreliability, incredulity, or clarity. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 59, 446 N.E.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 29} Up to this point, the trial court also followed the same standard of law. The trial court veered off this analytical path, however, when it considered the applicability of the Ohio rule\u2019s <em>Federal </em>counterpart, Fed.R.Evid. 702. That rule states:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[A] witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is <em>based upon sufficient facts or data, </em>(2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 31} Clearly, the trial court, in its decision quoted above, evaluated the evidence upon which Dr. Bernstein relied for sufficiency, and did not focus upon the <em>methods </em>he used to arrive at his conclusion. Also, at the beginning of its analysis, the court stated, \u201c[T]he physical exams, medical histories, and clinical tests reviewed by Dr. Bernstein would be insufficient to reach a scientifically valid conclusion.\u201d This clearly references the inappropriate <em>federal </em>legal standard, and improperly weighs the evidence for sufficiency. Also, in its summary of Dr. Bernstein\u2019s opinion, the court stated, \u201c[T]he limited information provided by Dr. Bernstein indicates that had \u2018differential diagnosis\u2019 been done in this case, the physical exams, medical histories, and clinical tests reviewed by Dr. Bernstein would be insufficient to reach a scientifically valid conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 32} In one of the first federal cases discussing the December 1, 2000 amendment to Fed.R.Evid. 702, which changed the rule to add a \u201csufficiency\u201d requirement, the court in <em>Rudd v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(M.D.Ala., 2001), 127 F.Supp.2d 1330, explained the difference between Daubert\u2019s reliability requirement and the federal rule by stating, \u201cNeither of these two latter questions that are now mandatory under the new rule \u2014 the inquiries into the sufficiency of the testimony\u2019s basis and the reliability of the methodology\u2019s application \u2014 were expressly part of the formal admissibility analysis under Daubert.\u201d Id. at 1337. But, see, <em>Nelson v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. </em>(C.A.6, 2001) 243 F.3d 244, 250 (\u201cThe Advisory Committee Notes [to Evid.R. 702] explain that no specific factors were articulated in the new rule because the factors mentioned in <em>Daubert </em>are neither exclusive, nor dispositive, and do not apply to every type of expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>testimony. We are satisfied that the amendment to Fed.R.Evid. 702 does not alter the standard for evaluating the admissibility of the experts\u2019 opinions in this case\u201d). Regardless, we would nonetheless hold that the trial court improperly weighed the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Dr. Bernstein\u2019s opinion in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 33} Understandably, the distinction between what is sufficient and what is reliable is easily blurred. <em>Rudd </em>further explained the federal rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[T]his sufficiency-of-basis inquiry is formally quite distinct from the sufficiency-of-evidence inquiry involved in summary-judgment analysis, that is, Rule 702 mandates a determination of whether the expert had sufficient evidence (evidence which itself may or may not be admissible) to support his or her testimony, not a determination of whether that testimony standing alone provides sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable fact-finder to find for the plaintiff on an issue of substantive law.\u201d <em>Rudd, </em>127 F.Supp.2d at 1337.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 35} When an expert\u2019s testimony is challenged for unreliability, courts may perceive that an expert could not have reached his conclusion given the evidence available to him. That is, a court may conclude that because other evidence <em>could have </em>been gathered or <em>could have </em>been relied upon, the conclusion is <em>weaker </em>than it otherwise could have been. However, evaluating the <em>strength </em>of a conclusion is the jury\u2019s proper function in weighing the evidence (and this is not merely an equivocation of qualitative terms) and in determining whether a party has met its burden of proof. Reliability, on the other hand, involves only questioning whether the methodology is scientifically valid. Granted, some overlap may exist when the type and amount of evidence relied upon by the expert is clearly insufficient in the sense that it renders the expert\u2019s opinion weak enough to be unreliable. As <em>Rudd </em>noted, these two inquiries may be identical in certain circumstances, but can easily diverge in others. Id. Here, our inquiry must diverge.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 36} Upon careful review of the materials submitted in support of and in opposition to the motion to exclude Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony, and upon careful review of the cases relied upon by the trial court, we conclude that the trial court exceeded its gatekeeping function by improperly weighing the scientific evidence when it examined whether the testimony was based upon sufficient facts and data, rather than only determining whether Dr. Bernstein\u2019s methodology was based upon scientifically valid principles. See <em>Miller, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 607, 613-614, 687 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">A. Errors Bearing on Admissibility</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">{\u00b6 37} We must first discard those portions of the trial court\u2019s analysis barring Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony due to the insufficiency of the evidence upon which he relied. We find the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>{\u00b6 38} First, the trial court found significant the fact that Dr. Bernstein did not personally conduct physical examinations of the plaintiffs-employees. This has never been the rule in Ohio. Evid.R. 703 allows an expert to base an opinion or inference on the facts or data either perceived by the expert or admitted into evidence. Here, the employees\u2019 medical records were perceived by the expert and were submitted to the trial court during discovery. \u201cExpert testimony based on the medical records certainly constituted opinions or inferences based on facts or data admitted into evidence. <em>Lambert v. Shearer </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 266, 277-278, 616 N.E.2d 965 (\u2018There is absolutely no restriction in the law that only treating physicians can testify * * *. If defendant wanted to delve more deeply into the records themselves or challenge [the expert\u2019s] construction of the evidence, he could have done so by cross-examination\u2019); <em>Virag v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 14, 1989), Cuyahoga App. No. 56391, unreported, 1989 WL 151291 (\u2018The fact that [the expert] did not personally examine [the plaintiffappellee] would go to the weight given to that testimony by the jury, but it in no way affects the propriety of admitting the evidence\u2019).\u201d <em>Goddard v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr. </em>(June 12, 1996), 1st Dist. Nos. C-95-0278 and C-950295, 1996 WL 312474, at *1. See, also, <em>Asad v. Continental Airlines, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio, 2004), 314 F.Supp.2d 726, 743-744.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 39} Dr. Bernstein stated that he had reviewed each employee\u2019s medical history, including the test results from each treating physician ordered in the course of the employee\u2019s treatment. In their motion, appellees acknowledged that Dr. Bernstein had reviewed the employees\u2019 medical records, although they characterize his review as \u201cbrief.\u201d Regardless, this type of evidence \u2014 without distinction as to the quantity of it \u2014 has always been acceptable. On the issue of sufficiency and/or quantity of evidence, <em>Goddard </em>stated, \u201c[0]nce a qualified expert\u2019s opinion is based on enough facts and data in evidence to have probative value, it is admissible. Whether the opinion represents the most credible conclusion presented is a question for the jury.\u201d <em>Goddard, </em>1st Dist. Nos. C-95-0278 and C-950295, 1996 WL 312474, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 40} Second, the trial court\u2019s observation that Dr. Bernstein \u201cdid not refer to any specific literature, suggesting that Defendants go into \u2018Entrez PubMed\u2019 where there is a whole preponderance of literature\u201d is irrelevant to a reliability analysis. It also observed, by quoting Dr. Bernstein\u2019s deposition, that he did not \u201cspecifically do a literature review and pull articles to review in preparing his report, and that he wasn\u2019t planning on doing any additional research, but that he was constantly pulling literature on \u2014 in this area, regarding building-related illness. * * * [H]e does not specifically cite any articles upon which he relies during his deposition or his correspondence concerning Plaintiffs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>This reasoning supported the trial court\u2019s fourth reason for barring Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">{\u00b6 41} The Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Beard v. Meridia Huron Hosp. </em>(2005), 106 Ohio St.3d 237, 834 N.E.2d 323, compels us to negate this portion of the analysis. It held, \u201cExpert witnesses are permitted to testify that their opinions are based, in part, on their review of the professional literature.\u201d Id. at syllabus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To require an expert to cite specific literature upon which he relied in reaching his opinion would be to offer that literature for the truth of the matter asserted, which would amount to requiring inadmissible hearsay. Id. at 240, 834 N.E.2d 323. An expert may state that his review of relevant professional literature aids and supports his conclusion; in rebuttal, learned treatises may be used to impeach the expert\u2019s credibility. Id. As in <em>Beard, </em>Dr. Bernstein did not offer statements from specific literature sources; he testified that the literature provided only a <em>partial </em>basis for his opinion and that his opinion was also based on his education, training, and experience. The trial court therefore erred in barring Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony on the basis that \u201che failed to present a review of the literature to support his conclusions on this case.\u201d Id. at 242, 834 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 42} Third, the trial court noted that Dr. Bernstein is not a \u201ctoxicologist\u201d and that Dr. Bernstein did not \u201cassert that he has any knowledge of the levels required for these various molds to become toxic or of the levels required for the molds to affect the Plaintiffs.\u201d When an expert has published numerous articles and book chapters regarding the relevant subject matter (as has Dr. Bernstein), is an established professor at a major Ohio medical university, teaching in a relevant field (as is Dr. Bernstein), states that he continually reviews applicable medical literature to keep up to date in his field (as did Dr. Bernstein), and has extensive clinical experience (as has Dr. Bernstein), then that expert\u2019s testimony is reliable as far it concerns his scholarly credentials. Further, Dr. Bernstein never asserted as a conclusion that it was the toxic nature of the molds that caused appellants\u2019 symptoms or diseases; rather, his testimony focused upon the irritant effects of mold and mold by-products, including respira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>tory effects, a subject that is within the purview of his specialty as an allergist. Later, we will further discuss the trial court\u2019s conclusions with respect to toxicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 43} Fourth, the trial court agreed with appellees that the term \u201csick building syndrome\u201d (\u201cSBS\u201d) is not a valid or scientifically recognized diagnosis, and it pointed to Dr. Bernstein\u2019s statement in deposition agreeing that SBS is not a \u201cvalid syndrome.\u201d However, both the trial court and appellees lifted Dr. Bernstein\u2019s quotes from their context. In answer to the question, \u201cDo yo\u00fa recognize sick building syndrome as a valid diagnosis?\u201d Dr. Bernstein stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cDo I recognize sick building syndrome? Well, you know, if you look at the literature, it will say there\u2019s no such thing as sick building syndrome. So maybe you can turn around and say, building related illness, and people will accept that terminology rather than sick building. Okay? Buildings aren\u2019t sick.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cBut there are \u2014 there is such a thing as building related illness. And I think that \u2014 I think it\u2019s semantics myself. * * * The \u2014 this whole issue, whether you call it sick building or building related illness, is still unresolved into the\u2014 from a scientific perspective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 46} Dr. Bernstein\u2019s discussion of the terminology appropriate to appellants\u2019 alleged maladies is not self-contradictory and is relevant. Dr. Bernstein was merely noting a lack of disagreement in his field as to the terminology \u2014 and he was also noting that the two referential terms denoted the same referent. We next examine whether the trial court correctly concluded that (notwithstanding the <em>amount </em>of evidence he considered) Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony and opinion were unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">B. General and Specific Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 47} Discarding, as we must, the foregoing points on which the trial court improperly examined the sufficiency of the evidence, we now examine whether the trial court abused its discretion in holding Dr. Bernstein\u2019s methodology unreliable pursuant to Evid.R. 702 and <em>Daubert. </em>The trial court concluded that Dr. Bernstein\u2019s differential diagnosis was not a valid scientific method, and in fact was not science, because he failed to adhere to established methods of performing a differential diagnosis. Appellants argue that Dr. Bernstein did conduct a valid differential diagnosis and that no court has excluded an expert\u2019s differential diagnosis. The trial court found Dr. Bernstein\u2019s method of differential diagnosis unreliable for three main reasons: it relied heavily upon temporal causation, it failed to \u201crule in\u201d and \u201crule out\u201d mold and other irritants or allergens as the cause of appellants\u2019 injuries, and Dr. Bernstein could neither testify about any quantitative amounts of mold to which appellants were exposed nor specify a quantitative amount of mold exposure necessary to cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>{\u00b6 48} We hold the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the reliability of Dr. Bernstein\u2019s differential diagnosis to be correct on the first two grounds, but we disagree with the third. Yet the trial court was ultimately incorrect regarding the extent to which Dr. Bernstein\u2019s opinion is admissible because of the court\u2019s failure to distinguish between general and specific causation. The trial court focused entirely upon whether Dr. Bernstein could establish specific or proximate causation, and ultimately barred his testimony on that basis, while neglecting to examine whether his testimony was relevant and reliable on the issue of general causation. In so doing, the court ignored the hornbook rule that an expert\u2019s opinion and testimony may be admissible for one issue or purpose, yet inadmissible for another. See, e.g., <em>Asad v. Continental Airlines Inc., </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 743. In effect, the trial court threw the general causation baby out with the proximate causation bathwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 49} In order to prove that X substance caused a plaintiff to suffer Y medical condition, a plaintiff must show both \u201c(1) that the toxic substance is capable of causing the condition (general causation) and (2) that the toxic substance in fact caused the plaintiffs medical condition (specific causation).\u201d <em>Valentine v. P.P.G. Industries, Inc., </em>158 Ohio App.3d 615, 2004-Ohio-4521, 821 N.E.2d 580, \u00b6 17. In order to demonstrate specific causation, the \u201cplaintiff must show that he was exposed to the toxic substance and that the level of exposure was sufficient to induce the complained-of medical condition (commonly called a \u2018dose-response relationship\u2019).\u201d Id., fn. 1. Although we vote that \u201c[e]xpert testimony ordinarily will be required to prove both general and specific causation,\u201d expert testimony is not always required. Id. at \u00b6 17. See, also, Kanemoto, \u201cScientific Expert Admissibility in Mold Exposure Litigation: Establishing Reliability of Methodologies in Light of Hawaii\u2019s Evidentiary Standard (2003),\u201d 26 U.Haw.L.Rev. 99, for an extended discussion of causation in mold cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 50} As we noted in <em>Cutlip v. Norfolk S. Corp., </em>6th Dist. No. L-02-1051, 2003-Ohio-1862, 2003 WL 1861015, some fields have not yet yielded a quantifiable threshold level of harmful exposure for certain agents, or a dose-response relationship supportive of specific causation. Citing <em>Hardyman v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 243 F.3d 255, 262, fn. 3, we described a dose-response relationship as \u201c[a] certain level of exposure to an agent below which disease does not occur and above which disease does occur.\u201d <em>Cutlip, </em>2003-Ohio-1862, 2003 WL 1861015, at \u00b6 51. When a sound differential diagnosis has been performed, the need for evidence of threshold levels is obviated. Id. Also, we recognized that \u201conly rarely are humans exposed to chemicals in a manner that permits a quantitative determination of adverse outcomes. * * * [S]uch evidence is not always available, or necessary, to demonstrate that a substance is toxic to humans given substantial exposure and need not invariably provide the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>an expert\u2019s opinion on causation.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 52, citing <em>Westberry v. Gislaved Gummi AB </em>(C.A.4, 1999), 178 F.3d 257, 264. This is especially so when a substance is commonly known to be a symptom-causing or disease-causing agent, as in <em>Westberry, </em>which considered talc as a known irritant. Threshold levels should not be required as proof when no study has been or could be conducted or when the level will always vary from individual to individual. Id. at \u00b6 55, citing <em>Hardyman, </em>243 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">{\u00b6 51} Dr. Bernstein testified to various aspects of mold and fungi that render them irritants and that can cause the symptoms appellants experienced. While explaining the difference between the allergen-, toxicity-, and irritant-induced effects of mold, he also explained that studies or experiments establishing a dose-response relationship for each of the three categories cannot be conducted due to the nature of mold exposure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cWe just \u2014 you can\u2019t challenge people. The problem is that when you start doing these studies, you can\u2019t do inhalational challenge studies on mold. They\u2019re toxins, they \u2014 they\u2019re potentially toxic, they\u2019re potentially pathogenic, they\u2019re infectious. If I\u2019m going to give someone a bolus of mold spores in their lungs, I mean, I can get sued. It\u2019s very difficult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u2018We can do provocation studies for other types of inhalational exposures, but it\u2019s \u2014 we could do ozone exposures. We\u2019ve done challenges \u2014 sulphur dioxide challenges, we\u2019ve done nitrogen dioxide challenges. Because we know what the EPA\u2019s regular \u2014 you know, total \u2014 you know, permissible exposure levels are over one hour and, you know, time weighted averages of one hour and over eight hours. We don\u2019t know what those things are for molds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cEnvironmental problems are hard to solve. It\u2019s not like studying animals. We can\u2019t lock people up in cages, and we can\u2019t \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of confounding variables that can influence things and so forth. So we have to control for those.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 55} Therefore, despite the (alleged) unavailability of a quantifiable dose-response relationship or quantifiable threshold levels of mold necessary to cause harmful effects, an expert may still opine as to specific causation; that is, he may give his opinion that some agent, able to cause harm, did in fact cause harm in a particular plaintiff. Here, similar to the situation in <em>Westberry, </em>178 F.3d 257, Dr. Bernstein opined as to the irritant and allergic effects of mold, fungus, and poor indoor air quality, not as to the toxicity of mold. Therefore, on the facts of this matter, a quantifiable dose-threshold relationship is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 56} However, a scientifically valid basis is still necessary to support an expert\u2019s conclusions regarding specific causation in order to be reliable and admissible. Appellants assert that Dr. Bernstein conducted a differential diagno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>sis, and that that diagnosis suffices to demonstrate specific causation. We agree with the trial court: Dr. Bernstein did not conduct a scientifically valid differential diagnosis, because his method relied primarily upon temporal relationships and because he did not rule out other possible causes. He was properly barred from testifying to specific causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">{\u00b6 57} This court has had prior occasion to examine whether the method of differential diagnosis passes muster pursuant to <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. The method is a \u201cstandard diagnostic tool\u201d in medicine. <em>Cutlip, </em>supra, 2003-Ohio-1862, citing <em>Glaser v. Thompson Med. Co., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1994), 32 F.3d 969, 978. \u201cDifferential diagnosis\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018the determination of which of two or more diseases with similar symptoms is the one from which the patient is suffering, by a systematic comparison and contrasting of the clinical findings.\u2019 Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 428 (25th Ed.1990). The elements of a differential diagnosis may consist of the performance of physical examinations, the taking of medical histories, and the review of clinical tests, including laboratory tests. A doctor does not have to employ all of these techniques in order for the doctor\u2019s diagnosis to be reliable. <em>Kannankeril v. Terminix Internatl., Inc. </em>(C.A.3, 1997), 128 F.3d 802, 807. See, also, <em>Hardyman v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co., </em>243 F.3d at 260-261 (defining \u2018differential diagnosis\u2019 in a similar fashion); <em>Baker v.

A soundly performed differential diagnosis satisfies the <em>Daubert </em>requirements for reliability. See id. at \u00b6 46 and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>Cutlip, </em>2003-Ohio-1862, the plaintiff, a railroad engineer, alleged that he was \u201cunnecessarily exposed to diesel fumes because of certain practices and conditions\u201d at his place of employment. The plaintiff presented several experts who each testified that diesel fumes caused his injury: his treating pulmonologist, who diagnosed reactive airway disease or asthma; a physician who, after a physical examination, diagnosed permanent asthmatic bronchitis; and a board-certified industrial hygienist, licensed engineer, and forensic toxicologist, who testified to the employer\u2019s standard of care regarding toxic substances and hazards. The railroad appealed the jury verdict, arguing that the plaintiffs expert opinion was unreliable and improperly admitted. This court held the experts\u2019 differential diagnosis that exposure to diesel fumes caused the plaintiffs injury admissible because \u201c(1) diesel fumes are toxic; (2) diesel fumes cause asthma; (3) appellee had substantial exposure to diesel fumes on the job; (4) appellee has asthma; and (5) his asthma is not related to his prior smoking habit or the chest wound from Vietnam.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>{\u00b6 59} Regarding the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Bernstein relied solely upon temporal causation, appellants admit the applicability of the rule that a diagnosis based solely upon a relationship in time is scientifically invalid. \u201cIt is well settled that a causation opinion based solely upon a temporal relationship is not derived from the scientific method and is therefore insufficient to satisfy the requirements of [Evid.R.] 702.\u201d <em>Schmaltz v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. </em>Co. (N.D.Ill., 1995), 878 F.Supp. 1119, 1122 (although the term \u201cinsufficient\u201d should be replaced with \u201cunreliable\u201d). Known to logicians as \u201cpost hoc ergo propter hoc\u201d \u2014 \u201cafter this, because of this\u201d \u2014 it is common logic that a temporal relationship \u2014 standing alone \u2014 does not establish causation. As the trial court aptly observed, a judge need not be scientifically trained in order to apply common logic and legal principles to scientific testimony, and our clerk is also \u201cblissfully innocent of any scientific training.\u201d <em>Cavallo v. Star Ent. </em>(E.D.Va.1995), 892 F.Supp. 756, 771, reversed in part on other grounds, <em>Cavallo v. Star Ent. </em>(C.A.4, 1996), 100 F.3d 1150. The trial court mined numerous cases barring expert testimony in which the expert relied solely or primarily upon a temporal relationship in order to establish a causal link between two events. See, e.g., <em>In re Breast Implant Litigation </em>(D.C.Colo.1998), 11 F.Supp.2d 1217, 1238-1239 (\u201cThe fact of a temporal relationship establishes nothing except a relationship in time. Proof of a temporal relationship merely suggests the possibility of a causal connection and does not assist Plaintiffs in proving medical causation\u201d), citing <em>In re Swine Flu Immunization Prods. Liability Litigation </em>(D.C.Colo.1980), 533 F.Supp. 567, 581; <em>Cuevas v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>(S.D.Miss.1997), 956 F.Supp. 1306, 1311 (ruling expert testimony barred pursuant to <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, because causation opinion of expert witness was based solely on temporal relationship), citing <em>Cartwright v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. </em>(M.D.Fla.1996), 936 F.Supp. 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{If 60} Upon our examination of these cases, and applying common logic and the legal rule to Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony, we find no abuse of discretion barring his testimony on specific causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 61} Although we have held that differential diagnosis does not always require plaintiffs to \u201crule in\u201d causes because differential diagnosis is a process in which physicians \u201crule out\u201d potential causes, ruling out causes is always necessary for a valid differential diagnosis. <em>Cutlip, </em>2003-Ohio-1862 at \u00b6 52-53, following <em>Westberry v. Gislaved Gummi AB, </em>supra, 178 F.3d 257. The trial court unnecessarily observed that Dr. Bernstein did not pinpoint which specific fungus acted as a toxin and whether that specific toxin specifically affected a specific plaintiff, because (1) if all other competing possible causes were ruled out for each plaintiff, and mold was the only or most likely remaining possible causative agent, then a direct link is diagnostically unnecessary and (2) Dr. Bernstein did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>advance any opinion as to any toxic effect of these plaintiffs\u2019 exposures. In fact, Dr. Bernstein stated that the current state of his field is such that \u201cin terms of inhalational and dermal exposure to toxins, less is known. They\u2019re mostly descriptive cases and very difficult \u2014 have yet to really establish true cause and effect from toxins and the mold related health effects.\u201d His opinion is comparable with a case repeatedly cited by appellees, <em>Roche v. Lincoln Property Co. </em>(E.D.Va.2003), 278 F.Supp.2d 744, which barred an expert\u2019s testimony on the issue of specific causation because the expert had not and could not conduct a reliable differential diagnosis concluding that exposure to mycotoxins caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. We agree with appellants that <em>Roche </em>is disanalogous to the present facts insofar as that court (which does not create binding precedent for this court) considered only the disputed expert\u2019s ability to pinpoint the <em>toxic </em>effects of exposure to mycotoxins. That court\u2019s decision, in our view, was impermissibly influenced by its in-depth examination of scholarly medical articles that concluded that any causal connection between mycotoxins and a \u201cpoorly defined set of symptoms\u201d is weak and unproven by scientists in the field. Also, appellants correctly observe that this matter is more akin to <em>Westberry, </em>because, as in the case of talc, no quantifiable threshold is necessary to determine that molds and fungi may have irritant- and allergen-induced effects. However, the <em>Roche </em>decision correctly, in our view, held that an expert\u2019s testimony that relies primarily upon a temporal relationship in order to establish specific causation is scientifically unreliable and thus inadmissible pursuant to <em>Daubert </em>and Evid.R. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">{\u00b6 62} Here, Dr. Bernstein, certified in allergy immunology, testified only to the general causative properties of mold as an allergen and an irritant. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think mycotoxins have anything to do with this. * * * I don\u2019t consider toxins irritants, okay, and I don\u2019t think I stated that this was due to exposure to mycotoxins, okay?\u201d His testimony with respect to the distinctions between mold\u2019s alleged toxic effects and its <em>allergen and irritant </em>effects would be helpful to a jury and is relevant and probative to the issue of general causation\u2014 whether the specific types of mold identified in Foley\u2019s and Hygienetics\u2019s reports are capable of causing certain irritant- and allergen-induced effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 63} Dr. Bernstein opined that, in general, some individuals are susceptible to the allergen and irritant effects of mold, depending on the amount and duration of exposure and other individual sensitivities, and that, in general, mold spores and other mold byproducts create air particulates that act as irritants to respiratory systems and have other effects. His scholarly and clinical experience and his reviews of the literature formed the basis of his opinions regarding the general causative properties of mold. Appellees may certainly challenge his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>testimony on general causation either upon cross-examination or through the opinion of their own expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 64} However, the trial court correctly barred Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony on the issue of specific causation. Dr. Bernstein repeatedly acknowledged the necessity of controlling for other causative variables, and indicated that he had not done so with these plaintiffs; thus, he failed to rule out other possible causes of appellants\u2019 ailments. In his deposition testimony, Dr. Bernstein never gave any specific basis establishing or tending to establish causation for any particular plaintiff beyond the relation in time between their exposure to mold and their symptoms. He testified that he based his conclusions \u201con their symptoms occurring while they were in the workplace and improving while they were outside of the workplace, and not having long-term related problems, that they aren\u2019t having these problems and so forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 65} In his reports to appellants\u2019 counsel, after briefly listing each plaintiffs symptoms and without further explanation, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cI conclude that these individuals were suffering from building-related illness due to poor ventilation, filtration and humidity control. This will or did result in accumulation of not only mold, but also mold byproducts, bacteria and other air particulates (these were not measured) resulting in many of these clinical manifestations. All of these workers, with the exception of Kathleen Taylor-Peters, have improved since being removed from the workplace, indicating that this is most likely an irritant-induced response related to the work environment. In summary, the workers who were evaluated from the Ottawa County MBDD experienced clinical symptoms consistent with building-related illness.\u201d With respect to the only other person Dr. Bernstein specifically mentioned, he wrote: \u201cMs. Terry has improved since being removed from the workplace, indicating that this is most likely an irritant-induced response to the work environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 67} Thus, although appellants contend that the trial court erroneously concluded that Dr. Bernstein relied solely upon temporal causation in reaching his opinion, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion. Appellants, citing <em>Heller v. Shaw Industries, Inc. </em>(C.A.3, 1999) 167 F.3d 146, argue that when a temporal relationship is \u201cstrong and is part of a standard differential diagnosis, it would fulfill many of the <em>Daubert </em>* * * factors.\u201d They also cite <em>Bonner v. ISP Technologies, Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 2001), 259 F.3d 924, for the proposition that \u201c[u]nder some circumstances, a strong temporal connection is powerful evidence of causation.\u201d Be that as it may, in this matter, a temporal relationship alone does not provide a reliable basis for concluding that each individual person\u2019s exposures to mold caused his or her specific illnesses. Although Dr. Bernstein stated that he had reviewed the employees\u2019 medical records, he did testify that the main and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>decisive factor in his conclusions regarding specific causation was the fact that the employees were sick while in the work environment and well when outside it. While this temporal relationship may be powerful evidence in mold cases in order to reach an ultimate conclusion as to specific causation, it cannot alone suffice for a valid differential diagnosis unless other potential causes are ruled out <em>for each particular plaintiff. </em>See <em>Cutlip, </em>supra, 2003-Ohio-1862, in which physicians ruled out smoking and a preexisting wound as causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 68} Although Dr. Bernstein explained extensively the general causative properties of mold and mold byproducts, he acknowledged that he had not evaluated the employees for exposure to irritants outside the workplace. He also admitted that he could not establish specific causation as to any particular plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cQ. [W]ould you be able to pick any names out of the list * * * and say, within a month after being removed, she was completely back to normal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cA. I would be able to \u2014 I have to go back and review the \u2014 each, you know, the record again. * * * I can only surmise what I\u2019ve learned from the records and from the notes and from \u2014 and also from discussion, that these people have, for the most part, improved and have done better since being out of the workplace.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 71} Moreover, he had not, and admittedly could not, rule out other possible causes for each particular plaintiff. He stated that his conclusion \u201clargely depends on their history, their types of symptoms, their improvement out of the workplace, worsening getting in the workplace, getting better \u2014 self limiting nature in most of these subjects. And then my clinical experience, seeing hundreds and hundreds of these types of patients, and knowing how the classical course of how these people do in and out of the workplace or home * * *.\u201d One plaintiff suffering from multiple sclerosis alleged that the Buckeye Building\u2019s conditions exacerbated that preexisting condition. When asked whether mold caused that plaintiffs symptoms to worsen, Dr. Bernstein stated, \u2018You know, I really \u2014 I really can\u2019t \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I stated that, that I could associate a cause and effect from her MS and this environmental problem, okay? I mean, I think that would be very difficult to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b6 72} Appellants argue in their reply brief that Dr. Bernstein did conduct a valid differential diagnosis supportive of specific causation because no direct link is required, citing <em>Hardyman, </em>243 F.3d 255, 262. We agree that no direct link is required, and the trial court clearly erred in requiring a \u201cdirect nexus between the levels of exposure to mold and any subsequent illnesses that affected the Plaintiffs.\u201d However, as the trial court duly noted, the validity of a differential diagnosis is derived from the thoroughness of the elimination process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>rather than from a rate of error. Here, Dr. Bernstein performed no discernible process of elimination regarding other potential causes of appellants\u2019 illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 73} Appellants also argue that even though appellees may point to alternative plausible causes, the defending party should be permitted to offer a reasonable explanation in rebuttal as to the reliability of the physician\u2019s opinion, citing <em>Cutlip, </em>2003-Ohio-1862 at \u00b6 47. Therefore, appellants assert, an evidentiary hearing should have been conducted in order to afford Dr. Bernstein an opportunity to explain his differential diagnosis pertaining to each plaintiff. They cite <em>Heller, </em>167 F.3d at 157, in arguing that a court errs \u201cin excluding expert medical testimony because a defendant\u2019s suggested alternative causes <em>(once adequately addressed by plaintiffs expert) </em>affect the weight that the jury should give the expert\u2019s testimony and not the admissibility of that testimony * * * we held that even absent hard evidence of the level of exposure in question, a medical expert could offer an opinion that the chemical caused plaintiffs illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 74} Although we ultimately conclude that the Hygienetics report and the employees\u2019 testimony is strong evidence that they were exposed, raising a genuine issue of fact, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not holding a hearing when Dr. Bernstein was clearly incapable of opining on specific causation. He was asked whether he ruled out other causes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cQ. How do we get our hands around the issue well, geez, maybe, this particular plaintiff is a smoker or has a dog at home, or maybe on a particular day someone brought something in from the outside? Is there any way in this particular case to rule out those other causes or factor those out in any reasonable way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cA. Not \u2014 not totally, because there\u2019s \u2014 again, without knowing more details about the \u2014 how the building was maintained in terms of \u2014 I don\u2019t have a lot of information about those potential confounding factors. * * * And windows were probably closed and I imagine they had central air and so forth. * * * But I don\u2019t believe in this workplace they had animals running around. People weren\u2019t allowed to smoke indoors. So you have to make the same \u2014 all that being said, you know, they \u2014 they find that they\u2019re doing well at home but they\u2019re not doing well at work. And, you know, you \u2014 you have other confounding variables that have to be worked out, which I\u2019m not privy to in terms of their dissatisfaction with work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">{\u00b6 77} Yet Dr. Bernstein did have each employee\u2019s medical history and record available to him and did not address any of the <em>known </em>variables, such as smoking, pet ownership, depression, or anxiety. Although appellants argue that appellees only speculated as to these additional variables, the variables are manifestly admitted to in the employees\u2019 depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>{\u00b6 78} After a detailed examination of his deposition testimony, we must conclude that it is reliable on the issue of general causation \u2014 that in Dr. Bernstein\u2019s opinion, and due to his knowledge and scholarly and clinical experience, mold is capable of causing certain symptoms and maladies. Therefore, to that extent, the trial court erred in barring his opinion. Although \u201cknowledge connotes more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation,\u201d a court exceeds its gatekeeping function when it holds an expert to a \u201ccertainty\u201d standard, or requires a \u201cdirect nexus\u201d between a cause and its alleged effects, instead of reliable evidence supportive of causation. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. \u201cBut, in order to qualify as \u2018scientific knowledge,\u2019 an inference or assertion must be derived by the scientific method. Proposed testimony must be supported by appropriate validation \u2014 i.e., \u2018good grounds,\u2019 based on what is known. In short, the requirement that an expert\u2019s testimony pertain to \u2018scientific knowledge\u2019 establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability.\u201d Id. Here, Dr. Bernstein\u2019s invalid differential diagnosis renders his testimony scientifically unreliable on the issue of whether these individual plaintiffs\u2019 illnesses were caused by mold exposure, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in barring his testimony on the issue of specific causation. \u201cBut nothing in * * * <em>Daubert </em>* * * requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert. A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner </em>(1997) 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 79} Although the court\u2019s decision was well researched and articulate, we must conclude that the decision to bar Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony on the issue of general causation improperly entered the jury\u2019s province and weighed the evidence. The reliability requirement should not be used to exclude evidence of \u201cquestionable reliability.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 614, 687 N.E.2d 735. Each of these issues may be effectively explored upon cross-examination. Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is therefore well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">II. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 80} The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees by relying upon Dr. Bernstein\u2019s omitted testimony in order to conclude that appellants could not advance a material fact relevant to causation. It stated that because Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony was barred, \u201cPlaintiffs failed to establish proximate causation between any negligence on Defendants\u2019 part and their personal injuries. * * * Plaintiffs cannot show that they suffered injuries proximately caused by Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>{\u00b6 81} An appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212. Pursuant to Civ.R. 56, a trial court is required to construe the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, to determine whether any genuine issues of material fact exist, and to determine whether reasonable minds could differ as to whether judgment should be entered against the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56(C). An appellate court, reviewing a grant of summary judgment, also examines the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Engel v. Corrigan </em>(1983), 12 Ohio App.3d 34, 12 OBR 121, 465 N.E.2d 932, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">{\u00b6 82} In order to overcome summary judgment, a nonmoving party must advance specific, provable facts and not mere allegations; evidence of a possible inference is not sufficient. <em>Jackson v. Alert Fire &amp; Safety Equip., Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 48, 52, 567 N.E.2d 1027. Throughout a summary-judgment review, the strength of inferences from the evidence should be tested to \u201cdetermine whether they are sufficient to justify but one conclusion, which conclusion is adverse to the moving party.\u201d <em>Durham v. Major Magic\u2019s All Star Pizza Revue, Inc., </em>6th Dist. No. L-04-1192, 2005-Ohio-1029, 2005 WL 567078, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 83} First, Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony is relevant and reliable on the issue of general causation: the proposition that mold causes certain symptoms. Thus, appellants have advanced a genuine issue of fact regarding general causation. Second, appellants have advanced genuine issues of material fact on the issue of specific causation, even discarding Dr. Bernstein\u2019s conclusions (or lack thereof) regarding particular employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">{\u00b6 84} Construing all inferences from the air-sampling reports and the employees\u2019 depositions in their favor, we hold that this evidence is sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact regarding specific causation. Air sampling is typically used to prove specific causation in mold cases. Kanemoto, 26 U.Haw. L.Rev. at 129-130. Establishing specific causation requires, in part, that particular plaintiffs prove that they were exposed to the substance capable of causing harm. The air-sampling reports and the employees\u2019 testimony regarding their exposures to mold in the Buckeye Building create issues of fact because the inference from this evidence is that they were exposed to mold.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 85} All of the employees testified in their depositions about their symptoms and illnesses. All of the employees correlated (albeit unscientifically) the onset of their symptoms to their exposure to the conditions in the Buckeye Building. As to the specific conditions in the building, the Hygienetics report contains a chart that shows the levels of each of five types of mold and compares those levels to both the indoor air samples and the outdoor air samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>{\u00b6 86} The report relevantly concluded, (1) \u201cAll indoor bacterial air samples ranged from 1.5 to 13 times higher than the outdoor comparative reference sample\u201d; (2) <em>\u201cActinomycetes </em>and <em>Bacillus </em>were detected in [Foley\u2019s] and the Hygienetics\u2019 bacterial air samples. * * * No <em>Actinomycetes </em>were detected in Hygienetics\u2019 outdoor reference air sample, and indoor <em>Bacillus </em>ranged from 1 to 3 times higher than the outdoor level\u201d; (3) <em>\u201cStachybotrys chartarum </em>and <em>Aspergillus versicolor </em>were detected in [Foley\u2019s] and the Hygienetics\u2019 fungal air samples; * * * no <em>Stachybotrys chartarum </em>and <em>Aspergillus versicolor </em>were detected in Hygienetics\u2019 outdoor reference air sample\u201d; (4) \u201cElevated levels of yeasts were detected [indoors] * * * and were not detected in the outdoor sample. Additionally, <em>Bacillus </em>and gram-negative bacteria were detected on this wipe sample and in the air sample collected in this room. Gram-negative bacteria were not detected in the outdoor sample\u201d; (5) it is likely that \u201cindoor airborne bacterial and fungal organisms were re-circulated and re-distributed back into the office environment by the HVAC system\u201d; and (6) it is likely that <em>\u201cStachybo-trys chartarum, aspergillus versicolor </em>and other toxin-producing fungi existed indoors at higher levels than detected during the Hygienetics survey while the building was occupied.\u201d We also find the report reliable because it contrasted its indoor air sampling with outdoor samples and with Foley\u2019s sampling results.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">{\u00b6 87} While no conclusion can yet be made as to whether this evidence demonstrates that the levels are significant enough to cause illness, not to mention illness in these particular individuals, the reported difference between indoor and outdoor air quality is significant enough to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether it <em>could </em>cause injury and whether it <em>did in fact </em>cause <em>these particular plaintiffs\u2019 </em>injuries. As in our previous discussion, we emphasize that an expert\u2019s reliable differential diagnosis supportive of specific causation must (1) not rely solely upon temporal causation and (2) must rule out and eliminate alternative potential causes until the most likely cause is isolated. It need not, however, \u201crule in\u201d specific types of mold or, if scientifically unachievable, quantify a dose-threshold relationship, i.e., the specific levels of the mold necessary to cause injury. <em>Cutlip, </em>supra, 2003-Ohio-1862.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 88} The inferences from this evidence, construed in appellants\u2019 favor, are sufficient to create issues of material fact and preclude summary judgment; also, appellants may yet obtain a relevant and reliable expert opinion on the issue of specific causation. Appellees, through expert testimony or otherwise, may counter this evidence by noting that the Foley air samples were taken some time after the employees began manifesting illnesses and that the Hygienetics air samples were taken some time after the building was vacated and by noting that the Foley air samples were not compared against outdoor air samples for baseline analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>{\u00b6 89} Reversing summary judgment on the basis of this improper evidentiary ruling is proper because it affects the substantial rights of the adverse party. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 159, 164-165, 17 O.O.3d 98, 407 N.E.2d 490. In its grant of summary judgment, the trial court explicitly relied on the fact that the plaintiffs had no expert witness to establish causation in order to conclude that they could not advance a genuine issue of fact. The prejudice to appellants is clear. The second assignment of error is therefore well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">III. Infliction of Emotional Distress Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 90} Because we reverse the grant of summary judgment on appellants\u2019 personal-injury claims, the grant of summary judgment on the claims for emotional distress is also reversed. Appellants are correct in that appellees did not move for judgment on the claims for emotional distress. \u201cA claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is an independent action.\u201d <em>Meyers v. Hot Bagels Factory, Inc. </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 82, 92, 721 N.E.2d 1068, citing <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 6 OBR 421, 453 N.E.2d 666. A claim for emotional distress will lie where one who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes serious emotional distress to another. Id. at syllabus. It is not necessary for a plaintiff to prove bodily injury in order to maintain his or her claim. Id. Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is also well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 91} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed with respect to prohibiting Dr. Bernstein from testifying to specific causation and reversed with respect to his testifying on the issue of general causation. The grant of summary judgment is also reversed. We remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this decision and judgment entry. Appellees are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Ottawa County.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-10\">Singer, P.J., and Parish, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-14\">.

Although <em>Beard </em>was decided after the trial court entered its decisions on the motion and summary judgment, it was decided while this case was pending on appeal. It is well settled that decisions of the Ohio Supreme Court apply retroactively to cases pending on appeal, unless an exception applies. \"In the absence of a specific provision in a decision declaring its application to be prospective only, * * * the decision shall be applied retrospectively as well: * * * The general rule is that a decision of the court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision is retrospective in its operation, and the effect is not that the former was bad law, but that it never was the law.\" <em>State ex rel.
