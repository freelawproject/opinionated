Scheidel, appeals from his conviction on two counts of rape, one count of attempted rape, and two counts of kidnapping. Upon review, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">{\u00b6 2} Scheidel was indicted on five counts: two counts of rape, both felonies of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2907.02; one count of attempted rape, a felony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2907.02 and 2923.02; and two counts of kidnapping, both felonies of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2905.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">{\u00b6 3} The charges arose from an investigation by the Ashtabula County Department of Jobs and Family Services. Scheidel had allegedly molested his stepdaughter, M.M., on two separate occasions. She was eight and nine years old, respectively, during the incidents in question. The first incident occurred in October 2001, and the second incident occurred in November 2001. The indictment contained a specification relating to the victim\u2019s age because she was younger than 13 years of age at the time of the incidents. One who \u201cpurposely compels the victim to submit by force or threat of force\u201d under such circumstance will receive a sentence of life in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">{\u00b6 4} Scheidel was convicted by a jury on all five counts and received the following sentence on June 5, 2003: two life terms in prison for the two rape charges, eight years in prison for the attempted rape charge, and ten years in prison for each of the kidnapping charges, all sentences to be served concurrently. It is from this judgment that Scheidel timely filed his notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>{\u00b6 5} All of Scheidel\u2019s three assignments of error relate to alleged misconduct by the prosecutor, which he claims prevented him from having a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 6} His first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cSteven Scheidel was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial by the Prosecutor\u2019s failure to provide defense counsel evidence of prior inconsistent statements made by the alleged victim prior to being interviewed by children\u2019s services, evidence that was exculpatory and material to guilt or punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">{\u00b6 8} The disclosure of exculpatory evidence is controlled by the case of <em>Brady v. Maryland.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Brady, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A <em>Brady </em>violation occurs when the following three components are present: \u201c[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, the trial court must determine whether the favorable evidence was improperly suppressed, meaning that the evidence was material and likely to produce a different result: \u201c[i]n determining whether the prosecution improperly suppressed evidence favorable to an accused, such evidence shall be deemed material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">{\u00b6 9} The fact of the allegedly improper suppression of evidence did not come to light until Scheidel\u2019s attorney was reviewing the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) eight days after he had filed a notice of appeal to this court. In the PSI, which the trial court ordered to be made part of the record herein (but kept under seal), there was a reference to a certain interview between M.M. and Deputy Lazanis of the Ashtabula County Sheriffs Department on February 2, 2002. During that interview, M.M. told Deputy Lazanis that Scheidel \u201cdid not put anything in her,\u201d meaning that he did not penetrate her vagina. The deputy\u2019s notes in the PSI stated that, based on his interview with M.M., no penetration of M.M. appeared to have occurred. An additional item of evidence that Scheidel argues should have been disclosed to him consisted of a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>by M.M. to the deputy that Scheidel had taken off his shirt during one of the incidents, evidence inconsistent with a statement to a social worker three days later that Scheidel had had his shirt on during the incident. Scheidel argues that these statements by M.M. are exculpatory evidence that should have been turned over to him prior to trial and that he could have used these inconsistent statements to impeach both M.M. and another witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 10} The state of Ohio counters by arguing that the record does not reflect exactly what discovery materials were provided during discovery; that, in general, police reports and witness statements are not discoverable, unless they are exculpatory; and that the materials in question are merely notes recorded by the deputy sheriff, which do not become a statement of a witness until and unless approved by the witness. Thus, argues the state of Ohio, the deputy\u2019s notes are not the \u201cstatement\u201d of M.M., and while they could have been used to impeach the deputy, he was not called as a witness. Support for the state\u2019s position is found in Evid.R. 613, dealing with impeachment of a witness with a prior inconsistent statement and <em>State v. Linder:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cAlthough the term \u2018statement\u2019 is not defined in Evid.R. 613, for purposes of criminal law generally and Crim.R. 16 specifically, it includes: (a) a written statement actually signed, or otherwise adopted or approved, by a witness or party; (b) a mechanical recording of the witness\u2019s words or transcription thereof; or (c) a substantially verbatim recital of such statement in a continuous narrative form. * * * We see no reason to use a different definition of the term when it is used in Evid.R. 613. A summary of a witness\u2019s oral conversation becomes a witness\u2019s statement only if she has reviewed and signed, or otherwise adopted it, or if it is a nearly verbatim account as opposed to being merely the investigator\u2019s own selections, interpretations, or interpolations.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 12} Thus, there appears to be a basis for saying that Deputy Lazanis\u2019s notes do not constitute the statement of M.M. unless and until they are approved by her. The court in <em>Linder </em>expanded on this notion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cAppellant failed to show that the summary was anything more than Officer Love\u2019s characterization of Harness\u2019s prior oral statements. There was no indication that the summary was reviewed, signed or otherwise adopted by Harness as her own. Neither was the summary demonstrated to be a verbatim recital of Harness\u2019s narrative. * * * Therefore, the trial court did not err in preventing counsel from impeaching Harness with the summary because it was not a prior inconsistent statement of Harness for purposes of Evid.R. 613.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>{\u00b6 14} If, then, the \u201cstatement\u201d of M.M. to Deputy Lazanis was not her statement after all and, therefore, could not have been her prior inconsistent statement, then there was no <em>Brady </em>violation, because there was nothing exculpatory for the prosecution to suppress. The subject matter of the so-called exculpatory evidence was merely the handwritten notes of the deputy investigator. The notes do not purport to be a verbatim transcription, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that they were approved by M.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 15} We believe, however, that there is an important distinction to be made between <em>Linder </em>and the instant case, and that distinction has to do with the age of M.M. M.M. was nine years old when she was interviewed by Deputy Lazanis. Nine-year-olds are not in the business of reviewing, adopting, or approving witness statements. Nothing in the record indicates whether Deputy Lazanis asked M.M. for her approval of her statement following the interview, but, in the absence of a separate adjudication in probate court to determine her ability to approve such a statement, we can only speculate as to whether she would have approved her stateme\u00f1t to the deputy. If the existence of her statement had been disclosed prior to trial, it would have been a simple matter for the trial court to conduct an in camera interview of M.M. to determine whether she had made such a statement and whether she approved it. Had such an in camera interview taken place and had M.M. approved her statement before the trial court, then counsel for Scheidel would have been able to impeach her with regard to her prior inconsistent statement. For this reason, we believe that a <em>Brady </em>violation did take place, because the statement of M.M. was not disclosed by the prosecution, it was favorable to the defendant, and it was material because there is a reasonable probability that it would have produced a different outcome. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 16} The state of Ohio argues that any inconsistency between the deputy\u2019s notes from his interview with M.M. and her trial testimony would have been understandable in the eyes of the jury and easily explained away on redirect. After all, she also had told the deputy that she was afraid of Scheidel, that she was intimidated by the male deputy in the threatening environment of a police station, that she was confused during the interview with the deputy, and that she did much better when asked leading questions by the female social worker. However, we look upon the subject matter of M.M.\u2019s statement to the deputy to be just the kind of exculpatory evidence that creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused: \u201csuppression by the- prosecutor of certain exculpatory evidence violates due process only where that evidence creates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>reasonable doubt as to the <em>guilt </em>of the accused.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> M.M.\u2019s statement to the deputy amounts to a prior inconsistent statement and could have been used to impeach her testimony in accordance with Evid.R. 613 had it been disclosed to defense counsel. This kind of evidence clearly falls within the <em>Brady </em>rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 17} Scheidel\u2019s first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 18} The second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court erred, to the prejudice of Mr. Scheidel, in permitting the prosecution to present four (4) photographs into evidence that were not previously disclosed to defense counsel in discovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">{\u00b6 20} The state presented the testimony of Nurse Gorsuch, who had conducted a sexual-abuse examination of M.M. on March 5, 2002. Gorsuch had conducted the examinations as part of her employment with Tod Children\u2019s Hospital at the Tri-County Advocacy Center. During her testimony, she referred to a Tri-County Advocacy Center report and to four photographs taken by her of M.M.\u2019s genital area on March 5, 2002. She testified that two of the four photographs showed signs of sexual abuse. Defense counsel objected to the introduction of the photographs on the ground that they had not been provided to him during discovery. When the issue was raised with the trial court prior to Nurse Gorsuch\u2019s testimony, the state of Ohio responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cMs. Tarighati: Your Honor, we have four photographs that we intend to introduce into evidence. We provided that information to the defendant in discovery and we allowed, upon motion of the defendant, the Court shall order the attorney to permit the defendant to inspect and copy. There was never a request made to copy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIf defense counsel had \u2014 we showed him the photographs yesterday morning. I mean, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re required to do anything more than that. He never offered to pay for the costs of copying or anything like that and hasn\u2019t made a big deal about it until this morning or until this morning. We did show him the photographs yesterday. He has not indicated he has an expert who is going to testify that the photographs don\u2019t show what our witness is going to say that they show.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">{\u00b623} Following this colloquy, the trial court quoted Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(c) as follows: \u201c \u2018Documents and Tangible Objects.\u2019 It does say, \u2018Upon motion, the Court shall order the prosecuting attorney to permit the defendant to inspect and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>copy or photograph books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, et cetera.\u2019 So, I mean, I think that takes care of the photographs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 24} The record indicates that defense counsel made no attempt to object to Gorsuch\u2019s testifying at trial, and it indicates that defense counsel did not object to the admission of her report into evidence. Further, during the oral argument of this case, defense counsel conceded that there was mention of the photographs in the Tri-County Advocacy Center Report, that he timely received a copy of the report during discovery, and that had he diligently pursued the matter of the four photographs, he could have obtained copies of the photographs well in advance of the trial. Defense counsel would have to demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in admitting the four photographs into evidence and permitting Gorsuch to testify concerning them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Considering that the accuracy and authenticity of the photographs were established by Gorsuch\u2019s testimony, and considering that defense counsel could have obtained copies of the photographs in advance of trial once he noticed their existence in the Tri-County Advocacy Center Report, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in admitting those photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 25} During cross-examination of Gorsuch by defense counsel, she was asked to review emergency-room records from Memorial Hospital of Geneva. These records had been obtained by defense counsel and related to an emergency room visit by M.M. on February 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 26} Gorsuch testified during cross-examination that the emergency-room records reflected that M.M.\u2019s chief complaint, stated with the help of her mother who brought her to the emergency room, was \u201calleged sexual assault three months ago times two\u201d and that an excerpt of the nurse\u2019s notes state, \u201cPer chart, father told her to undress. He then undressed and laid on top of her. She felt him put something inside of her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 27} We decline to measure the damning effect of Gorsuch\u2019s testimony concerning M.M.\u2019s emergency-room visit, but observe that this testimony was based upon records that defense counsel had obtained during discovery. Therefore, even if defense counsel had taken steps to obtain copies of the four photographs during discovery, steps he could have taken once their existence was disclosed to him, the benefit to his client is questionable in light of the damning nature of the testimony elicited from Gorsuch concerning the emergency-room visit of M.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">{\u00b6 28} The second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">{\u00b6 29} Scheidel\u2019s third assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201cAppellant was denied a fair trial by reason of improper comments by the prosecuting attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">{\u00b6 31} In this assignment of error, Scheidel points to various comments made by the prosecuting attorney in closing argument. The thrust of his argument here is that the prosecutor was interjecting her personal beliefs or opinions as to the credibility of a witness or as to the guilt of the accused. He cites as examples of prosecutor misconduct the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[Prosecutor:] And, ladies and gentlemen, in this great land of ours, every guilty man has a right to a trial and, you know what, [Scheidel\u2019s] had his trial. This guilty man has had his trial\u201d; and later:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[M.M.\u2019s] been telling the truth from the very beginning and she told you the truth when she testified. * * * And ladies and gentlemen, when you\u2019re thinking about, do I believe her or not? Ask yourselves. Would I be comfortable leaving my daughter or my granddaughter alone with this defendant for five minutes?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 34} These examples from the prosecutor\u2019s final argument are merely instances of the prosecutor\u2019s trying to secure a conviction. \u201cA prosecutor is encouraged to advocate strongly and even vehemently for a conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the alleged remark was improper and, if so, whether it prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201cit is not improper for a prosecutor to comment upon the evidence in [her] closing argument and to state the appropriate conclusions to be drawn therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finally, \u201ca prosecutor may comment <em>fairly </em>on a witness\u2019 credibility based upon his or her in-court testimony.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In our judgment, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not improper and did not deprive Scheidel of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 36} Scheidel\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">{\u00b6 37} The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">{\u00b6 38} In view of the facts that the prosecutor failed to disclose the existence of M.M.\u2019s statement to defense counsel, which statement could have been used for impeachment as a prior inconsistent statement, that the statement was favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to Scheidel, and that it was material because there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome, we remand this matter for a new trial. This <em>Brady </em>violation prevented Scheidel from getting a fair trial. The violation can be rectified only with a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-5\">O\u2019Toole, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b182-6\">Rice, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-15\">.

I believe there was no <em>Brady </em>violation and accordingly dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 40} The report in question was taken on February 3, 2002, at 2:50 p.m. In the report, Deputy Lazanis notes that M.M. had disclosed that appellant had assaulted her twice. However, he further indicates M.M. was very quiet during the interview. Lazanis reported that M.M. was afraid of appellant and wished he was \u201cstill in jail.\u201d Lazanis further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cFrom talking with [M.M.], it doesn\u2019t sound like penatration [sic] was made, but again she was very afraid and seemed to be bothered by me being male.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">{\u00b6 42} Less than two hours after Lazanis wrote the report, M.M. was taken to the emergency room at Geneva Memorial Hospital. During her visit, the attending emergency room nurse indicated in her report that appellant had instructed M.M. to undress. \u201c[Appellant] then undressed and laid on top of her. [M.M.] felt him put something inside of her.\u201d This evidence was elicited during cross-examination by defense counsel in an attempt to impeach Gorsuch, the pediatric nurse practitioner who had performed the sexual-abuse examination on M.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">{\u00b6 43} On March 5, 2002, M.M. was examined by Gorsuch. Subsequent to her examination, Gorsuch noted certain vaginal scarring, which she concluded, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, was consistent with sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">{\u00b6 44} Moreover, James Knight testified that he was visiting appellant in October or November 2001. The men were watching movies when appellant ordered all the children, three boys and M.M., to go to their rooms. Knight testified that appellant eventually left the room to \u201ccheck on the kids.\u201d According to Knight, when the movie ended, appellant had not returned. Knight went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to find appellant to make sure everything was okay. Knight knocked on M.M.\u2019s room door, walked in, and observed \u201c[M.M.] laying on the bed sideways, you know, cross ways across the bed with her clothes off and her hands over her face crying. I found [appellant] standing in front of her with his pants down to his ankles.\u201d According to Knight, appellant \u201cslammed the door and told [him] to get the \u2018F\u2019 out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 45} While not dispositive proof of appellant\u2019s guilt on the charges on which he was ultimately convicted, Knight\u2019s testimony provides strong corroborative evidence that he committed the crimes for which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 46} In my view, the state should have disclosed Lazanis\u2019s report, as it was evidence favorable to the accused and indicative of a prior inconsistent statement of the victim. See <em>State ex rel. Rasul-Bey v. Onunwor, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 119, 121, 2002-Ohio-67, 760 N.E.2d 421 (noting that records such as routine offense and incident reports are always subject to disclosure upon request by a criminal defendant); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Carpenter v. Tubbs Jones </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 579, 580, 651 N.E.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{1147} However, Lazanis\u2019s report indicates that M.M. was quiet and had exhibited visible discomfort while speaking with him about the incidents due to (1) her fear of appellant and (2) Lazanis\u2019s gender. A mere one hour and 25 minutes after Lazanis had written his report, M.M. told an emergency room nurse that appellant, while lying naked on top of her, \u201cput something inside of her.\u201d This evidence, in conjunction with Gorsuch\u2019s and Knight\u2019s testimony, indicates that the evidence as a whole militated heavily in favor of the conviction irrespective of Lazanis\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">{\u00b6 48} The majority aptly notes that a <em>Brady </em>violation occurs when evidence favorable to the accused is suppressed by the state and there is a reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. For the foregoing reasons, I do not believe that the suppressed report, had it been given to the defense, would have changed the outcome of the trial under review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
