On or about January 3, 2003, appellee applied to ODJFS for the Medicaid Home and Community Waiver Program (\u201cOHC\u201d) to provide him with in-home assistance and support. ODJFS asked him to reapply, and he did so on May 16, 2003. Appellee\u2019s application was denied, and he requested a state hearing. A hearing was held on September 30, 2003. Thereafter, on October 8, 2003, the state hearing decision ordered ODJFS to reassess appellee. Carestar, which provides home-service assessments for ODJFS, recommended that appellee be denied in-home assistance. After review, ODJFS denied appellee\u2019s request, and notice of the denial was sent to appellee on December 16, 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A hearing was held on the denial of services on September 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 3} On September 8, 2004, the state hearing decision found that appellee did not require the level of care necessary to qualify for the OHC. Appellee requested an administrative appeal of the decision denying his application for OHC services. A designee of the director of ODJFS reviewed the matter and affirmed the decision and findings contained in the decision. Appellee appealed this matter to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 5101.35 and 119.12. The trial court reversed the order of ODJFS, finding that the order was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The trial court further found that appellee did qualify for OHC services. It is from this decision that ODJFS appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, ODJFS raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">First Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">The common pleas court erred in applying an incorrect legal standard to its review of ODJFS\u2019 administrative appeal decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Second Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">The common pleas court improperly construed the administrative rules pertaining to the Ohio Medicaid home and community-based waiver program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">Third Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">The trial court erred when it found this case was a refiled case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">Fourth Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">The trial court erred by concluding that the due process issue was moot since the court improperly found the Appellee eligible for the OHC waiver. Since legal questions are reviewed de novo, this Court should decide the question of whether the Appellee\u2019s due process rights during the reassessment, denial of eligibility and second state hearing and administrative appeal were violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">{\u00b6 5} Before we can reach the merits of ODJFS\u2019s arguments, we must address appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, in which appellee contends that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal. Appellee argues that ODJFS may not appeal to this court, because the trial court\u2019s decision was based solely upon its evidentiary findings, and did not involve a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 119.12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">The court may affirm the order of the agency complained of in the appeal if it finds, upon consideration of the entire record and such additional evidence as the court has admitted, that the order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. In the absence of such a finding, it may reverse, vacate, or modify the order or make such other ruling as is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. The court shall award compensation for fees in accordance with section 2335.39 of the Revised Code to a prevailing party, other than an agency, in an appeal filed pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">The judgment of the court shall be final and conclusive unless reversed, vacated, or modified on appeal. Such appeals may be taken either by the party or the agency, shall proceed as in the case of appeals in civil actions, and shall be pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code. <em>Such appeal by the agency shall be taken on questions of law relating to the constitutionality, construction, or interpretation of statutes and rules of the agency, and in such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>appeal the court may also review and determine the correctness of the judgment of the court of common pleas that the order of the agency is not supported by any reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the entire record.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Miller v. Dept. of Indus. Relations </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 226, 17 OBR 466, 479 N.E.2d 254, the Supreme Court of Ohio stated that the clear language of R.C. 119.12 allows an agency the right to appeal only questions of law that pertain to state statutes and agency rules or regulations. Only after the appeal is perfected on those grounds can the court of appeals have jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s decision on the particular question of law and whether that decision is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 8} That an appeal raises a question of law is not sufficient; the question must relate to the constitutionality, construction, or interpretation of a statute or rule. <em>Enertech Elec., Inc. v. West Geauga Bd. of Edn. </em>(Sept. 3, 1996), Franklin App. No. 96APE03-370, 1996 WL 506825. See, also, <em>Ramey v. Ohio State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners </em>(Aug. 3, 1995), Franklin App. No. 94APE10-1512, 1995 WL 458957.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Mentor Marinas, Inc. v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1964), 1 Ohio App.2d 219, 30 O.O.2d 252, 204 N.E.2d 404, this court noted that any judicial decision involves application of the law to the facts. However, the mere application of the law to the facts does not constitute \u201cinterpretation\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 119.12. <em>Enertech, </em>supra, citing <em>Mentor. </em>There must be a genuine question presented and a specific finding by the trial court as to the meaning of the statute or rule. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Enertech, </em>this court was presented with the issue of whether the trial court ruled on a question of law relating to the interpretation or construction of R.C. 9.31. The trial court found that the West Geauga Board of Education had based its decision on factors outside of R.C. 9.31 and that the board\u2019s concerns were not the key issues in the statutory test and that R.C. 9.31 does not entrust such discretion to the board. By so holding, this court found that the trial court was interpreting R.C. 9.31, and therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision involved a question of law relating to the interpretation of R.C. 9.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">{\u00b6 11} As in <em>Enertech, </em>the constitutionality of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06 was not at issue in the trial court; therefore, the issue before us is whether the trial court ruled on a question of law relating to the interpretation or construction of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06. It is ODJFS\u2019s position that the trial court misinterpreted Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06, the rule pertaining to the intermediate level of care, which is required for the OHC. Specifically, ODJFS contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>trial court confused the \u201cprotective level of care\u201d with the \u201cintermediate level of care\u201d and thereby improperly interpreted the administrative rules at issue here. ODJFS further contends that the trial court applied an incorrect standard of review because the trial court applied a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard rather than the proper standard of review, which is whether ODJFS\u2019s decision was based on reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 12} While the trial court did not specifically state that it was interpreting the administrative rules, the trial court was indeed engaged in interpreting the rules because the trial court determined what evidence satisfied the criteria of the rules and interpreted what the criteria were and how they were defined. ODJFS does not take issue with the evidence presented or with the factual findings of the trial court; rather, ODJFS contends that the court confused Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06 with 5101:3-3-08 when it found appellee eligible for OHC services.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 13} We hold that because the trial court\u2019s decision involved a question of law relating to the interpretation of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06 and 5101:3-3-08, ODJFS could properly appeal to this court. Accordingly, we deny appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 14} Having held that this court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we now turn to the merits of the ODJFS\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">{\u00b6 15} In an administrative appeal pursuant to R.C. 119.12, the trial court reviews an order to determine whether it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 482 N.E.2d 1248. In applying this standard, the court must \u201cgive due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts.\u201d <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 16} Reliable, probative, and substantial evidence has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">(1) \u201cReliable\u201d evidence is dependable; that is, it can be confidently trusted. In order to be reliable, there must be a reasonable probability that the evidence is true. (2) \u201cProbative\u201d evidence is evidence that tends to prove the issue in question; it must be relevant in determining the issue. (3) \u201cSubstantial\u201d evidence is evidence with some weight; it must have importance and value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">(Footnotes omitted.) <em>Our Place, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 570, 571, 589 N.E.2d 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">{\u00b6 17} On appeal to this court, the standard of review is more limited. Unlike the court of common pleas, a court of appeals does not determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>weight of the evidence. <em>Rossford Exempted Village School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 705, 707, 590 N.E.2d 1240. In reviewing the court of common pleas\u2019 determination that the commission\u2019s order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, this court\u2019s role is limited to determining whether the court of common pleas abused its discretion. <em>Roy v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 675, 680, 610 N.E.2d 562. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. However, on the question of whether the commission\u2019s order was in accordance with the law, this court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 343, 587 N.E.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 18} Because ODJFS\u2019s third assignment of error has implications regarding appellant\u2019s other assignments of error, we will, address it first.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 19} In its third assignment of error, ODJFS argues that the trial court erred in designating this case as a refiled case. Appellee argues that if the case designation was made in error, it constitutes harmless error, and therefore, we should overrule ODJFS\u2019s third assignment of error. We disagree. While in some instances wrongfully designating a case as refiled may constitute harmless error, in this instance, the designation determines the content of the record that is before both us and the trial court, and thereby directly affects appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 20} Loc.R. 31 governs the assignment of cases in the General Division of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Loc.R. 31.01 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">If a case is dismissed and subsequently refiled, the refiled complaint shall contain the following designation under the case number: \u201cTHIS IS A REFILED CASE.\u201d The Trial Judge to whom the case was previously assigned shall be reassigned to the refiled case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">{\u00b6 21} While appellee designated this case as a refiled case, it clearly is not a refiled case, but rather is an administrative appeal of the second administrative decision regarding appellee\u2019s request for services. Appellee had appealed the first decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, the trial court entered judgment, and the appeal of that judgment was pending in this court at the time appellee filed the \u201crefiled case.\u201d Thus, Loc.R. 31.01 clearly was not applicable, and the trial court indeed erred when it ruled that this matter should be designated as a refiled case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>{\u00b6 22} We agree with the trial court\u2019s assertion that there was no prejudice or risk of \u201cjudge shopping\u201d in allowing the case to proceed under the previous case number or the previously assigned trial judge. The significance of our holding, however, is that the only issues and evidence properly before this court, and the trial court, are those regarding the second assessment of appellee, and the resulting hearings and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 24} In its second assignment of error, ODJFS argues that the trial court improperly construed the administrative rules pertaining to the OHC. The trial court found that the administrative appeal decision of ODJFS was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Thus, the trial court concluded, in contrast to ODJFS, that appellee satisfied the criteria for an intermediate level of care, and therefore, qualifies for OHC services.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 25} Under the current Ohio home-care program, eligible consumers may receive services at home as an alternative to a nursing-home or hospital care. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-12-02. The ODJFS-administered OHC is a home- and community-based program serving individuals who meet the criteria set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-12-04 and 5101:3-12-01(00). Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-12-01(HH). These programs are called the Ohio home-care waiver and the transitions waiver. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 26} As is relevant to this appeal, a consumer can receive services if he or she is enrolled in one of the ODJFS-administered home-care benefits packages. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-12-04. According to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-12-04(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">To be eligible for services under an ODJFS-administered waiver benefit package, the following criteria must be met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">(1) At the time of enrollment on the Ohio home care waiver:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">(a) The consumer regardless of age, must have a skilled level of care in accordance with rule 5101:3-3-05 of the Administrative Code, have a chronic, unstable medical condition that requires the skills of a registered nurse to detect and evaluate the consumer\u2019s need for possible treatment or for instituting nursing procedures, and in the absence of the ODJFS-administered HCBS waiver, would require long term hospitalization or NF placement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">(b) The consumer, if under the age of sixty, must have an intermediate level of care in accordance with rule 5101:3-3-06 of the Administrative Code, and in the absence of an ODJFS-administered HCBS waiver would require NF placement[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>{\u00b6 27} According to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06(C)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">An individual may be determined to require an intermediate level of care (ILOC) only if both of the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">(1) The individual\u2019s physical and mental condition and resulting service needs have been evaluated and compared to all of the possible levels of care (in accordance with rule 5101:3-3-15 of the Administrative Code) and it has been determined that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">(a) The individual requires services beyond the minimum required for a protective level of care (set forth in rule 5101:3-3-08 of the Administrative Code); but,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">(b) The individual\u2019s condition and/or corresponding service needs do not meet the minimum criteria for a skilled level of care set forth in rule 5101:3-3-05 of the Administrative Code; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">(c) The individual\u2019s condition and/or service needs do not meet the criteria for an ICF-MR/DD LOC set forth in rule 5101:3-3-07 of the Administrative Code;

therefore, appellee must satisfy the requirements of Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06(1) and 5101:3-3-06(2)(a) for a determination that he requires an intermediate level of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>{\u00b6 29} To require the protective level of care discussed in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06(1), Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-08(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">An individual may be determined to require protective care, only if both of the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">(1) The individual\u2019s physical and mental condition and resulting service needs have been evaluated and compared to all of the possible levels of care, and it has been determined in accordance with rule 5101:3-3-15 of the Administrative Code that the individual\u2019s condition and/or corresponding service needs do not meet the criteria for skilled care, intermediate care, or for an ICF-MR level of care set forth in rules 5101:3-3-05 to 5101:3-3-07 of the Administrative Code; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">(2) The individual requires either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(a) Both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(i) Supervision of one ADL or supervision of self-administration of medication;

If he requires a protective level of care, then the next step is to determine whether he requires services at the intermediate level of care pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">{\u00b6 31} An activity of daily living (\u201cADL\u201d), as used in both Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06 and 5101:3-3-08, is defined as a personal or self-care skill performed, with or without the use of assistive devices, on a regular basis that enables the individual to meet basic life needs for food, hygiene, and appearance.

For the purposes of this rule, the term \u201cIADL\u201d may refer to any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">(a) Shopping. \u201cShopping\u201d is the ability to prepare a shopping list and purchase groceries, clothing, and household items;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">(b) Meal preparation. \u201cMeal preparation\u201d is the ability to plan nutritional meals and cook any type of food;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">(c) Environmental management. \u201cEnvironmental management\u201d is the ability to maintain the living arrangement in a manner that ensures the health and safety of the individual. Environmental management includes all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">(i) House cleaning. \u201cHouse cleaning\u201d is the ability to make beds, clean the bathroom, sweep and mop floors, dust, clean and store dishes, pick up clutter, and take out trash;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">(ii) Heavy chores. \u201cHeavy chores\u201d means the ability to move heavy furniture and appliances for cleaning, turn mattresses, and wash windows and walls; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-16\">(iii) Yardwork and/or maintenance. \u201cYardwork and/or maintenance\u201d is the ability to care for the lawn, rake leaves, shovel snow, complete minor home repairs, and paint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(d) Personal laundry. \u201cPersonal laundry\u201d is the ability to wash and dry clothing and household items by machine or by hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">(e) Accessing community services. \u201cAccessing community services\u201d is the ability to interface with the community.

With respect to grooming, the evidence demonstrates that appel-lee needs assistance in cutting his nails and nose hairs. ODJFS adamantly refutes that these are types of activities contemplated by Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06. However, we find that even if cutting nails and nose hairs are the type of activity contemplated by Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06, this provides evidence of requiring hands-on assistance with only one ADL instead of two. Pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06, hands-on assistance with two ADLs is required to qualify for the OHC waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">{\u00b6 34} There is no evidence that appellee requires hands-on assistance with mobility, bathing, toileting, dressing, or eating. In fact, appellee does not even argue, or direct us to any evidence in the record to demonstrate, that he needs hands-on assistance with a second ADL.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">{\u00b6 35} The intake specialist for Carestar completed a checklist about appellee. The intake specialist\u2019s supervisor testified about the responses on the checklist at the September 1, 2004 hearing. The intake specialist noted that appellee is independent with mobility, toileting, and eating. While she noted that appellee needs supervision with bathing, grooming, and dressing, there is no indication that he needs hands-on assistance with these activities. The intake specialist also noted that appellee needs assistance with IADLs such as meal preparation, house cleaning, accessing the community, and transportation. In conclusion, the intake specialist stated that appellee does not need an intermediate level of care, and therefore, she recommended that the OHC services be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">{\u00b6 36} Maxine Skuba, appellee\u2019s weekly caregiver, testified that although she is concerned about appellee\u2019s vegetable intake, he is capable of doing his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>grocery shopping. Skuba further testified that while appellee is \u201cnot very capable of cooking for himself,\u201d he is \u201cproficient at using the microwave\u201d and \u201cwill follow the instructions * * * on the frozen item.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 37} There is no evidence to indicate a need for hands-on assistance with a second ADL, even assuming that needing assistance with cutting nails and nose hairs constitutes an ADL pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-3-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 38} The activities discussed by the trial court, while they do constitute IADLs as defined by the statute, and do satisfy the criteria for the protective level of care, do not constitute ADLs, which are required for the intermediate level of care. Thus, it appears that the trial court used the criteria for determining the protective level of care, IADLs, to determine whether or not appellee qualified for the intermediate level of care. Such interpretation mandates a finding that not only did the trial court abuse its discretion, but its decision is not in accordance with the law. Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">{\u00b6 39} In its fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that since the trial court erred by finding that appellee was eligible for the OHC services, the trial court likewise erred when it concluded that appellee\u2019s due-process claims were moot. Even though the trial court did not rule on the due-process issues, but rather found them to be moot, appellant urges this court to decide whether there was a due-process violation. We decline, however, to rule on this issue, and instead remand the matter to the trial court for adjudication in accordance with our disposition of appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">{\u00b6 40} Because we have sustained appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">{\u00b6 41} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error, and overrule appellant\u2019s first and fourth assignments of error as moot. Accordingly, the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby reversed, and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Motion to dismiss denied; judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-11\">Klatt, P.J., and French, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\">. Appellee\u2019s medical conditions include Asperger's syndrome, anxiety disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Schizoaffective disorder, depression, and nonverbal learning disorder. At the time he filed for services, appellee was 53 years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\">. There is some confusion regarding whether or not notice was properly sent in September and December 2003; however, such is not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-16\">. Appellee has not asserted that he requires skilled care; therefore, our opinion will focus on the portions of the code related to persons who need care at an intermediate level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
