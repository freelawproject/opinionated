Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, United Holy Church of America, Inc., Northwestern District (\u201cUHCA\u201d), appeals the trial court\u2019s decision that dismissed its claims against defendant-appellee, Kingdom Life Ministries (\u201cKingdom\u201d), for failure to supplement discovery responses. Kingdom has not responded on appeal. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On March 8, 2004, UHCA commenced this action. On October 29, 2004, Kingdom filed a motion to compel UHCA to respond to discovery propounded upon it on June 9, 2004. Attached thereto was undated correspondence from defense counsel to UHCA\u2019s counsel concerning the outstanding discovery. In the motion to compel, defense counsel represented that she sent the letter \u201con or about October 6, 2004.\u201d On December 1, 2004, the trial court granted Kingdom\u2019s motion to compel. Therein, the trial court ordered UHCA to \u201ccomply with all outstanding discovery requests on or before 12/15/04 or sanctions including the possibility of dismissal may be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">{\u00b6 3} On December 14, 2004, UHCA served its responses to the outstanding discovery. UHCA generally answered the discovery without objection but reserved the right to produce supplemental information as it became available. There is no indication of any correspondence or contact among the parties concerning UHCA\u2019s responses or any objection by Kingdom to them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>11, 2005, Kingdom filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(c). Despite UHCA\u2019s opposition, the trial court dismissed the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 4} UHCA\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI. The trial court erred and abused its discretion when it dismissed appellant\u2019s verified complaint with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">{\u00b6 6} We review a trial court\u2019s order granting discovery sanctions under the abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">{\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 37(B)(2) provides \u201cIf any party * * * fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, * * * the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others * * * [a]n order * * * dismissing the action * * However, dismissal on the merits is a harsh remedy that should be imposed only when the actions of the defaulting party create a presumption of willfulness or bad faith. <em>Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Watson Rice &amp; Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 83230 and 83633, 2004-Ohio-6413, 2004 WL 2755806, \u00b6 19, citing <em>Toney v. Berkemer </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 455, 458-459, 6 OBR 496, 453 N.E.2d 700. Alternative available sanctions should be considered first. Id., citing <em>Furcello v. Klammer </em>(1980), 67 Ohio App.2d 156, 159, 21 O.O.3d 454, 426 N.E.2d 187; accord <em>Coleman v. Cleveland School Dist., </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 81674 and 81811, 2003-Ohio-880, 2003 WL 549981, quoting <em>Sazima v. Chalko, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 155, 712 N.E.2d 729 (\u201cA dismissal on the merits is a harsh remedy requiring the due process guarantee of prior notice. \u2018The purpose of notice is to give the party who is in jeopardy of having his or her action or claim dismissed one last chance to comply with the order or to explain the default\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">{\u00b6 8} Here, UHCA attempted to comply with the trial court\u2019s order by responding to discovery by December 15. Although not complete, UHCA\u2019s discovery responses do not establish a willfulness or bad faith under the circumstances before us. UHCA made few objections and represented that it would provide supplemental responses. Although 'Kingdom may have disagreed, UHCA believed that it had complied with the trial court\u2019s order. \u201c[Ojnce plaintiffs counsel has responded to the notice given pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(1) by complying with the trial court\u2019s outstanding order, the trial court may not thereafter dismiss the action or claim on the basis of noncompliance with that order.\u201d <em>Sazima v. Chalko </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 151, 157, 712 N.E.2d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Kingdom did not file any subsequent motions to compel or otherwise contact or advise opposing counsel of any discovery dispute. There is no further order notifying UHCA that the trial court would consider dismissal if it did not provide supplemental responses. Nonetheless, the trial court dismissed the action with prejudice and there is no indication that the trial court considered any alternative sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 10} Further, Civ.R. 37(E) imposes the following conditions during discovery: \u201cBefore filing a motion authorized by this rule, the party shall make a reasonable effort to resolve the matter through discussion with the attorney, unrepresented party, or person from whom discovery is sought. The motion shall be accompanied by a statement reciting the efforts made to resolve the matter in accordance with this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 11} While we do not countenance dilatory or evasive discovery responses, the sanction of dismissal with prejudice in this case was too harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 12} UHCA\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 13} The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b827-10\">Dyke, A.J., and Cooney, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-16\">.
