Because we conclude that the trial court properly vacated the arbitration decision and award, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Dr. Abmed Mattar, sought review of his termination of employment by appellee, Community Memorial Hospital (\u201cCMH\u201d), located in Defiance County, Ohio. In May 2001, Mattar was employed under a physician-employment agreement to provide patient services at a clinic operated by CMH in Harlan, Indiana. CMH terminated Mattar \u201cfor cause\u201d on June 11, 2003, specifically stating that the doctor had violated the agreement because of his \u201c(1) * * * waiver of patient co-payments and/or deductibles in violation of Hospital policy and federal law\u201d and \u201c(2) * * * direction to licensed nursing staff to perform duties outside of their scope of practice in performing radiological studies in violation of Hospital policy, and State and Federal law.\u201d Despite the termination \u201cfor cause,\u201d CMH offered appellant a 180-day severance payment, which appellant rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant appealed his termination pursuant to the arbitration clause in the agreement, which directed the parties to the Toledo Bar Association\u2019s alternative-dispute-resolution program. An arbitrator chosen through this program conducted a hearing on October 17, 2003, in Harlan, Indiana. After multiple time extensions, the arbitrator issued his decision on March 8, 2004. The arbitrator essentially found that appellant had, in fact, breached the agreement by violating federal law when he offered to accept or accepted insurance-only payments for services and by violating CMH policies regarding the collection of bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 4} Nevertheless, the arbitrator determined that these violations were not the sole reason for Mattar\u2019s discharge. The arbitrator found that CMH had also terminated Mattar\u2019s employment for economic reasons \u2014 i.e., to reduce money losses due to Mattar\u2019s practice. The arbitrator concluded that, absent the hospital\u2019s financial considerations, CMH would not have discharged Mattar for the agreement violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">{\u00b6 5} The arbitrator found that even though Mattar had breached the agreement, he was terminated \u201cwithout cause.\u201d Under the \u201cwithout cause\u201d terms of the agreement, the arbitrator awarded appellant 180 days of severance pay, but reduced it to 120 days because of appellant\u2019s violations. The arbitrator stated that since other staff employees had been only temporarily suspended for their actions pertaining to the violations, CMH should have imposed the same 60-day suspension without pay sanction against Mattar.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">{\u00b6 6} Appellee then applied to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas to have the arbitration award vacated or modified. Appellee first argued that it was not bound by the decision, because the arbitrator had lost jurisdiction by the delay in issuing his decision. The court found that the arbitrator had not lost jurisdiction, because there was no specific time limit for issuing the decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Appellee also argued that the arbitrator had exceeded the scope of his authority in his interpretation of the contract and the fashioning of a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant opposed the application, arguing that the common pleas court had no jurisdiction because the arbitration was conducted in Indiana. Appellant alternatively argued that the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award were within the scope of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">{\u00b6 8} The court overruled appellant\u2019s challenge to its jurisdiction and ultimately vacated the arbitration award. The court determined that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority by going beyond the essence of the contract language. The court stated that the contract terms clearly permitted the immediate termination of Mattar should he violate CMH policies, including billing and charging procedures. In addition, the court stated that even if this had not been the sole reason for Mattar\u2019s discharge, nothing in the contract imposed such an additional restriction on CMH\u2019s ability to terminate the agreement. Therefore, the court found that the arbitrator had improperly added terms to the agreement that were not contemplated by the parties and were not within the \u201cessence of the contract.\u201d Having vacated the award, the court then denied appellee\u2019s application to modify the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant now appeals from that judgment, arguing the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">{\u00b6 10} <em>\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIt was error for the common pleas court to rule that the arbitrator\u2019s consideration of factual and legal defenses to the claimed breach of contract exceeded the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">{\u00b6 12} <em>\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIt was error for the trial court to consider challenges to the authority of the arbitrator when the Appellee was estopped from making such challenges and caused the error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">{\u00b6 14} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in ruling that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority by allegedly adding terms that modified the contract beyond the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">{\u00b6 15} Ohio law favors and encourages arbitration. <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation v. Mahoning Cty. TMR Edn. Assn. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 80, 84, 22 OBR 95, 488 N.E.2d 872. Consequently, arbitration awards are generally presumed valid. See <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Findlay </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 129, 131, 551 N.E.2d 186. The scope of a judicial review of binding-arbitration proceedings is limited. See <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Local Union No. 200, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of Am. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 516, 522, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[T]he arbitrator is the final judge of both law and facts, and * * * an award will not be set aside except upon a clear showing of fraud, misconduct or some other irregularity rendering the award unjust, inequitable, or unconscionable.\u201d Id. Likewise, absent any evidence of material mistake or extensive impropriety, an appellate court cannot extend its review to the substantive merits of the award but is limited to a review of the trial court\u2019s order. <em>Lynch v. Halcomb </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 223, 224, 16 OBR 238, 475 N.E.2d 181; <em>Stanquist v. Horst </em>(May 20, 1994), 11th Dist. No. 93-A-1804, 1994 WL 228180; <em>Hacienda Mexican Restaurant v. Zadd </em>(Dec. 10, 1993), 11th Dist. No. 92-L-108, 1993 WL 548066.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2711.10 sets forth the perimeters of the trial court\u2019s review. A trial court may vacate an arbitration award only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(A) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(B) There was evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrators, or any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(C) The arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(D) The arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">{\u00b6 22} To determine whether an arbitrator has exceeded his scope of authority, a trial court must determine whether the arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining v. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emps. Assn., Local 11, AFSCME, AFL-CIO </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 177, 572 N.E.2d 71. \u201cAn arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from a collective bargaining agreement when there is a rational nexus between the agreement and the award, and where the award is not arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful.\u201d <em>Findlay City School Dist., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 132, 551 N.E.2d 186, citing <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd., </em>22 Ohio St.3d 80, 22 OBR 95, 488 N.E.2d 872, paragraph one of the syllabus. Once this has been established, a reviewing court can vacate the award pursuant to R.C. 2711.10(D) only if the award does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>not rationally flow from the terms of the agreement. <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd., 22 </em>Ohio St.3d at 84, 22 OBR 95, 488 N.E.2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, although the arbitrator determined that Mattar had, in fact, committed violations that constituted a breach of his agreement with CMH, the arbitrator then found that Mattar\u2019s discharge was \u201cwithout cause.\u201d Our careful review of the agreement shows that termination of employment for the violations committed by Mattar were at the discretion of CMH. Nothing in the agreement specifically provides for a suspension or requires that the violations be the sole cause for termination. Although nondoctor staff members may have been only suspended, there is nothing in the record to show that doctors and staff were covered by the same contract terms. Moreover, even presuming that economic considerations contributed to Mattar\u2019s discharge, the two violations found by the arbitrator were enough to justify his termination under the agreement. We agree with the trial court that the arbitrator imposed an additional requirement that was not a term of the contract, and his decision and award were not based upon the essence of the contract language. Therefore, the trial court properly vacated the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">{\u00b6 25} In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in considering challenges to the arbitrator\u2019s authority because appellee failed to object to the admission of information upon which the arbitrator relied. Appellant appears to be arguing that because appellee permitted testimony that was irrelevant to whether he breached the agreement, appellee could not challenge the legal conclusions issued by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">{\u00b6 26} A party who fails to object to the scope of the issues to be determined by an arbitration waives the right to object to the scope of the arbitration in an appeal of the arbitration decision to the common pleas court. See <em>Fostoria v. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 194, 2005-Ohio-4558, 833 N.E.2d 720, at \u00b6 18. Nevertheless, when evidence is admitted that is irrelevant to the ultimate issue, a waiver of objection to such evidence is also irrelevant and nonprejudicial. See, for example, <em>Cleveland Thermal Energy Corp. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 80312, 2002-Ohio-3904, 2002 WL 1767400; <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sams </em>(June 9, 1989), 6th Dist. No. E-88-27, 1989 WL 61722.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">{\u00b6 27} In this case, the trial court did not find that the arbitrator\u2019s decision included issues beyond the scope of the arbitration. Rather, the court properly determined that the arbitrator exceeded his authority because the decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>award did not draw their essence from the contract language. In light of our disposition of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, the \u201ceconomic reasons\u201d defense evidence simply became irrelevant to the ultimate issue, i.e., whether, under the terms of the agreement, CMH was permitted to terminate Mattar\u2019s employment based upon violations of the agreement. Even if appellee had waived any objections to the evidence submitted regarding appellant\u2019s defenses, the arbitrator was still bound to consider only relevant facts and applicable law when interpreting the agreement and fashioning a remedy. Once the arbitrator found that appellant had, in fact, committed violations that were \u201cjust cause\u201d for termination under the agreement, absent proof of constitutionally protected rights or class discrimination, any other reason offered becomes irrelevant. No constitutionally protected right exists against termination for \u201ceconomic reasons.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that appellant\u2019s argument as to appellee\u2019s waiver of any objections to the admission of appellant\u2019s defenses or other claims is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">{\u00b6 29} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AlZ\">Pietrykowski and Skow, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
