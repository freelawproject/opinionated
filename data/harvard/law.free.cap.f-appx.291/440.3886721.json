Weisel denying petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jianyi Lu, </em>No. A97 356 432 (B.I.A. Jun. 19, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A97 356 432 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Mar. 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-24\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. In making his adverse credibility determination, the IJ relied on inconsistencies in the record and implausibilities in Lu\u2019s testimony. Specifically, the IJ found that while Lu testified that Chinese officials accused him of being Christian and detained him because of his religion, he claimed in his asylum application that he was detained because he protested his employer\u2019s failure to pay him. In a preREAL ID Act case, to form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, a discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09. <em>But see Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2008) (holding that the REAL ID Act of 2005 abrogated this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Secaida-Rosales). </em>Here, this inconsistency is substantial because the reason for Lu\u2019s detention goes to the heart of his claim, and an inconsistency about this matter casts doubt on whether he was detained at all. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The IJ also noted that parts of Lu\u2019s testimony were implausible. We have held that while \u201cbald\u201d speculation is an impermissible basis for an adverse credibility finding, \u201c[t]he speculation that inheres in inference is not \u2018bald\u2019 if the inference is made available to the factfinder by record facts, or even a single fact, viewed in the light of common sense and ordinary experience.\u201d <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007). We recently held that \u201cwhen an adverse credibility finding is based partly or entirely on implausibility, [the Court will] review the entire record, not whether each unusual implausible feature of the account can be explained or rationalized.\u201d <em>Ying Li v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, </em>529 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.2008). Here, the IJ found implausible Lu\u2019s claim that he worked as an unpaid volunteer from October 2001 until January 2003. The IJ found his explanation that he would eventually be paid by his employer to be \u201cpatently ridiculous.\u201d In considering this testimony in \u201clight of common sense and ordinary experience,\u201d the IJ did not err in finding this testimony implausible. <em>Siewe, </em>480 F.3d at 168-69; <em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63 (2d Cir.2007). Further, the IJ found implausible that Lu would go to such lengths to practice Christianity in China, flee to the United States because of religious persecution, and then decide not to attend church because he was too busy with work. Indeed, considering the great lengths that Lu claimed to have gone to in order to teach the Gospel in the face of persecution by Chinese authorities, it was also proper for the IJ to find this testimony implausible. <em>See Ying Li, </em>529 F.3d at 82. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Lu\u2019s application for asylum was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Mauzur, </em>494 F.3d at 289. Further, because the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of Lu\u2019s asylum claim, we decline to review the BIA\u2019s nexus finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Finally, inasmuch as Lu based his claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, and the IJ found that this claim lacked credibility, his withholding of removal and CAT claims necessarily fail. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
