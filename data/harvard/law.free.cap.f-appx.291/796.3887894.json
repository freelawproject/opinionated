We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">Substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the examining psychiatrist\u2019s report in favor of the testimony of the non-examining psychologist. <em>See Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Additionally, the ALJ gave clear and convincing reasons for finding that Garcia was not a credible witness. <em>See Morgan v. Cornm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>In pressing her disability claim, Garcia relies on the report of Dr. Narvaiz, who indicated on a check-the-box form \u2014 without providing any details or analysis in the space available \u2014 that Garcia\u2019s ability to \u201cdeal with work stresses\u201d was \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor to none,\u201d or perhaps somewhere in between. We find this report of Garcia\u2019s alleged disability to be inconclusive at best because the doctor checked multiple boxes when the- question called for one answer. <em>See Morgan, </em>169 F.8d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Even if we accept that Dr. Narvaiz\u2019s report could show that Garcia is disabled, the ALJ properly pointed to the fact that Dr. Jasinski, the non-examining psychologist, had a greater record before him when he testified that he did not believe Garcia was disabled. The information available to Dr. Jasinski \u2014 and unavailable to Dr. Narvaiz \u2014 included the opinion of another non-treating physician that Dr. Narvaiz\u2019s report was internally inconsistent, and a series of outpatient treatment records for Garcia from mental health professionals at a clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Moreover, the ALJ gave several clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Garcia\u2019s testimony of her limitations. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 959-60 (9th Cir.2002). Garcia\u2019s statements during the hearing were inconsistent with her statements to treating and examining physicians. Garcia did not consistently seek treatment for her symptoms, nor did she consistently follow treatment regimens. Garcia\u2019s reports of \u201csevere and chronic pain\u201d could not be corroborated by any of her physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b821-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
