The district court adopted an advisory Guidelines range of 70-87 months, granted \u201ca slight downward departure\u201d to adjust for the government\u2019s delay in pursuing federal charges against Cardona-Manco during the period he remained in state custody following his violation of state parole, and ultimately imposed a sentence principally of 62 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-22\">Cardona-Manco argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain why it rejected Cardona-Maneo\u2019s contention that lower \u201cfast track\u201d sentences imposed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>other jurisdictions demonstrate that a s\u00e9ntenee below the Guidelines range would be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to fulfill the goals of sentencing, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). We review a district court\u2019s sentencing determination under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Cutler, </em>520 F.3d 136, 156 (2d Cir.2008). As relevant here, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, ... or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Cardona-Manco challenges the adequacy of the district court\u2019s statement of reasons, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the first time on appeal. We thus review this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 211 (2d Cir.2007). \u201cTo establish plain error, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affeet[s] substantial rights,\u201d and (4) that \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Nucci, </em>364 F.3d 419, 421 (2d Cir.2004) (quotation marks and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">To the extent Cardona-Manco argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing adequately to address arguments bearing on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or the parsimony clause, we find none here. Although the court did not specifically discuss Cardona-Manco\u2019s \u201cfast track\u201d jurisdiction arguments, \u201cwe do not insist that the district court address every argument the defendant has made or discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor individually\u201d in order to demonstrate proper consideration of the relevant factors and obligations. <em>See Villafueiie, </em>502 F.3d at 210; <em>United States v. Ministro-Tapia, </em>470 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[Ajbsent record proof showing otherwise, we assume the district court\u2019s awareness of and compliance with [the] statutory sentencing obligation\u201d set forth in the parsimony clause.); <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.), cert <em>denied, </em>549 U.S. 882, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006) (\u201c[W]e will not conclude that a district judge shirked her obligation to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors simply because she did not discuss each one individually or did not expressly parse or address every argument relating to those factors that the defendant advanced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Here, the district court acknowledged reviewing the parties\u2019 pre-sentencing submissions which addressed whether and to what extent the existence of lower sentences in \u201cfast-track\u201d jurisdictions should bear on Cardona-Manco\u2019s case, and heard oral argument on the matter. Before imposing sentence, the court stated that it had \u201cconsidered under Section 3553 all of the mitigating and enhancing factors that have either been revealed in the pre-sentence report or in the remarks of counsel and of the defendant\u201d and added that it was \u201ctrying to factor in all of the circumstances under \u00a7 3553(a) and how much is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>too much and how much is enough punishment and the like.\u201d In light of these statements, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court did not properly consider the statutory factors or the parsimony clause\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">A district court\u2019s statement of reasons for imposing its chosen sentence \u201cserves the important goals of (1) informing the defendant of the reasons for his sentence, (2) permitting meaningful appellate review, (3) enabling the public to learn why the defendant received a particular sentence, and (4) guiding probation officers and prison officials\u201d in crafting a program which meets the defendant\u2019s needs. <em>Villafueite, </em>502 F.3d at 210. Section 3553(c) does not require the district court to issue \u201ca full opinion in every case.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends on the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">We conclude that the district court did not plainly err in failing to provide a more detailed statement of reasons in this case. When imposing the 62 month sentence\u2014 an effective bottom-of-the-Guidelines term \u2014 the court explained that it was \u201ctrying to factor in all of the circumstances under \u00a7 3553 and how much is too much and how much is enough punishment and the like\u201d and that this is a \u201cdifficult decision[ ] for a Court which is why we begin ... with the Guidelines.\u201d The record as a whole makes clear that the judge listened to each argument and considered supporting evidence. The judge then explained that \u201cgiven all the mitigating circumstances in [Cardona-Manco\u2019s] life, I believe that a sentence at the low end of the Guideline [range] is appropriate.\u201d The court\u2019s statements thus demonstrate that \u201cthe judge rest[ed] his decision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3553(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case\u201d and that the court found this case to be largely typical, putting aside the issue of adjusting for delay. <em>See id.; see also Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d at 211-12. While \u201cthe judge might have said more ... the context and the record make clear that this, or similar, reasoning, [underlay] the judge\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469. Accordingly, we find that the court did not plainly err in failing to explain the decision more extensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">.
