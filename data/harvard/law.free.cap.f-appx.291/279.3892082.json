Gai\u2019vin, Coleman, FL, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b304-7\">Before EDMONDSON, Chief Judge, MARCUS and WILSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b304-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Defendant Willie Garvin appeals the denial of a motion protesting the 188-month sentence imposed after he pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Because no reversible error has been shown, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Garvin initially pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In exchange for his plea, the government agreed to recommend a three-level reduction in base offense. Garvin was advised that he could be sentenced to a term of up to ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">At that time, the government knew that Garvin had been convicted of two prior criminal acts that qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d for sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government relied on this information to calculate a ten-year maximum sentence for Garvin\u2019s plea agreement. But when the government received Garvin\u2019s PSI, it identified a third predicate offense which qualified Garvin as an armed career criminal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), an armed career criminal must serve a mandatory minimum of fifteen years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">At sentencing, the government informed the court of Garvin\u2019s third predicate offense and the resulting sentence enhancement. After consultation with his lawyer, and in the light of the new penalty, Garvin entered a new guilty plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court determined the applicable guideline range to be 188 to 235 months; it sentenced Gai\u2019vin to 188 months and five years of supervised release \u2014 the \u201clow end\u201d of the range. Garvin neither objected at sentencing nor directly appealed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-18\">Eleven months later, Garvin filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; it was denied. He then applied for a Certificate of Appealability, which we denied. Later, Garvin filed, and was denied, a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-19\">Garvin then filed a <em>pro se nunc pro tunc </em>motion claiming his \u201cactual innocence\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>an \u201cillegal sentence enhancement.\u201d Defendant did not claim innocence of the crimes for which he was convicted, but rather that two convictions did not qualify for armed career criminal enhancement because they failed to meet the definition of a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After reviewing the record, but without providing substantive explanation, the court denied Defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On appeal, Defendant reiterates the substance of his previous motions. He maintains, as best we can tell, that his enhanced sentence should be remanded to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The government argues that Defendant\u2019s motion was not properly before the district court; as a consequence, we do not have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear Defendant\u2019s appeal. According to the government, the district court lacked jurisdiction for at least two reasons. First, if Defendant\u2019s motion were construed as a section 2255 motion, it would amount to a fourth successive (non-certified) motion; the district court would lack jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>cross-referencing </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (as amended). Second, even if the court construed Defendant\u2019s motion as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 motion filed pursuant to the section 2255 \u201csavings clause,\u201d Defendant\u2019s motion substantively fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The ground on which the district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion is unclear. Although we urge district courts to explain their reasoning, <em>see Clay v. Equifax, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 952, 957-58 (11th Cir.1985), we may affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Bircoll v. Miami-Dade County, </em>480 F.3d 1072,1088 n. 21 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The record fully supports our inability to hear Defendant\u2019s appeal based on either ground. As the government noted, Defendant\u2019s section 2255 motion to vacate his sentence was denied on the merits in 2003. We denied a COA in 2003, and we again denied Defendant the ability to file a successive motion after the 2004 denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion (construed as a section 2255 motion to vacate). On appeal, Defendant asserts the same substantive argument: that his prior convictions improperly qualified him for an enhanced sentence. But without our certification, Defendant\u2019s successive section 2255 motion cannot be presented properly to the district court or appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to hear Defendant\u2019s motion even if it were construed as a section 2241 motion pursuant to the \u201csavings clause.\u201d The record does not indicate that Defendant argued even the threshold savings clause issue: that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). Thus, Defendant\u2019s motion does not qualify as a section 2241 petition under the section 2255 savings clause; neither the district court nor this court has jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\">.
