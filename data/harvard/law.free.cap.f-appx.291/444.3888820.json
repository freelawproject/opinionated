Mulligan denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and finding that Chen had not proved his date of entry into the United States by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re Zumeng Chen, </em>No. A 98 403 369 (B.I.A. Nov. 6, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A 98 403 369 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Jan. 12, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">As an initial matter, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or its finding of neither changed nor extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Notwithstanding that provision, this Court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Here, we are without jurisdiction to review Chen\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application where he contests only \u201cthe correctness of the [IJ\u2019s] factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) and (D). <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). We dismiss the petition for review to that extent. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">However, section 1158(a)(3) applies only to asylum requests and does not divest this Court of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a) to review final orders of removal that deny other relief, such as withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Joaquin-Porras v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 172, 180-81 (2d Cir. 2006). Chen has not challenged the denial of his CAT claim on appeal, and we consider that issue waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). We therefore review only Chen\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s credibility finding without rejecting any portion of it but emphasizing certain aspects of the IJ\u2019s reasoning, this Court reviews both decisions. <em>Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 262 (2d Cir.2007). Here, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and emphasized the IJ\u2019s findings as to Chen\u2019s demeanor, but did not reject the IJ\u2019s further reliance on \u201cminor discrepancies\u201d in Chen\u2019s testimony. Thus, we review both the IJ and BIA rulings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). We accord particular deference to an IJ\u2019s findings regarding a petitioner\u2019s demeanor while testifying. <em>See, e.g., Shu Wen Sun, </em>510 F.3d at 381 (citing <em>Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005)). We recognize that a fact-finder who assesses testimony together with witness demeanor is in the best position to discern \u201cwhether apparent problems in the witness\u2019s testimony suggest a lack of credibility or, rather, can be attributed to an innocent cause such as difficulty understanding the question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, that fact-finder may assess \u201cwhether a witness who hesitated in a response was nevertheless attempting truthfully to recount what he recalled of key events or struggling to remember the lines of a carefully crafted \u2018script.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overmled on other grounds, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007). Evasiveness is \u201cone of the many outward signs a fact-finder may consider in evaluating demean- or and in making an assessment of credibility.\u201d <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006) (holding also that \u201cfd]emeanor is virtually always evaluated subjectively and intuitively, and an IJ therefore is accorded great deference on this score\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In this case, the IJ rejected Chen\u2019s claims based entirely on an adverse credibility finding, which in turn rested principally on the IJ\u2019s assessment of Chen\u2019s demeanor while testifying. The IJ found that it had \u201cno hesitancy in determining that [Chen] has not been credible to the Court.\u201d The IJ described Chen\u2019s demean- or as \u201cextremely hesitant.\u201d The IJ said further that he gave \u201cvery short, simple responses to questioning, with no appreciable detail; his testimony conveyed the impression that much of it was memorized; his testimony conveyed the clear impression that when he went \u2018off script\u2019 he had difficulty responding to questions; there were frequent long delays before providing answers to questions; he was very hesitant and evasive in his responses.\u201d There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>fore, the IJ concluded, Chen \u201cis seriously lacking in credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The IJ also cited several other problematic issues relating to Chen\u2019s testimony, which the BIA characterized- as \u201cminor discrepancies\u201d but did not reject. For example, the IJ found it \u201cpuzzling\u201d that Chen said he did not have the phone number of an individual who had submitted a supporting affidavit, when the number was printed on the affidavit itself. The IJ also noted that Chen admitted lying to the government upon his initial contact in the United States, and that he submitted a false change of address form.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding met the substantial evidence standard. It is true that the IJ, in his ruling, did not reference specific examples of Chen\u2019s unconvincing demeanor. However, the types of observations that the IJ made <em>(e.g., </em>hesitant answers, delays before answering) are not easily reflected in a record. Furthermore, the transcript of the hearing before the IJ largely supports the IJ\u2019s observation that Chen\u2019s responses lacked \u201cappreciable detail,\u201d and that he seemed to have much greater difficulty answering questions that were not posed by his own counsel (for example, in response to the government counsel\u2019s questions about his documents, Chen simply repeated that he had lost every document about which she inquired). Finally, the testimonial discrepancies cited by the IJ provide further support for an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
