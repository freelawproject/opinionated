Assa\u2019ad-Faltas claimed she completed the residency program in 1993, but the University refused to issue a certificate of completion. She also contended that in 2007, the University unfairly denied her renewed request for a certificate of completion and her unsolicited offer to teach Arabic and Middle Eastern studies. She sought a change of venue and a preliminary injunction. The magistrate judge recommended denying relief, and the district court adopted that recommendation and dismissed the action. Assa\u2019ad-Faltas timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-24\">As the district court correctly concluded, Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s claim regarding the University\u2019s refusal to give her a certificate of completion for the residency program was previously challenged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Assa\u2019ad-Faltas without success. <em>See Assa\u2019ad-Faltas v. Univ. of S.C., </em>No. 96-2159(L), 1998 WL 792209 (4th Cir. Nov.16, 1998) (unpublished), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 922, 120 S.Ct. 285, 145 L.Ed.2d 239 (1999). Thus, this claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <em>See Meekins v. United Transp. Union, </em>946 F.2d 1054, 1057 (4th Cir.1991). This is so even though the pri- or action was dismissed with prejudice based on Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s failure to comply with discovery and her abusive demeanor during a deposition, rather than on the merits of her claims. <em>See Hells Canyon Pres. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>403 F.3d 683, 686 (9th Cir.2005) (holding, in res judicata context, that \u201c \u2018final judgment on the merits\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018dismissal with prejudice\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, the claim is barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530(5) (2005); <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 266-69, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). The district court properly denied Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s request for injunctive relief in light of the lack of merit of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Assa\u2019ad-Faltas contends that she was injured anew by the University\u2019s 2007 denial of her request for the certificate of completion. However, the statute of limitations may not be evaded by simply renewing a request for relief after the limitations period has expired. Further, although the University\u2019s denial of Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s unsolicited offer to teach Arabic and Middle Eastern studies occurred within the limitations period and has not been previously litigated, the University was under no obligation to accept, or even to consider, Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s offer. In the absence of a duty, no liability can attach to the University\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Finally, the court properly denied Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s request for change of venue because she has not shown, and the record does not reflect, any conflict of interest or extrajudicial bias on the part of any judge who has participated in this case. <em>See In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826-27 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We deny Assa\u2019ad-Faltas\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
