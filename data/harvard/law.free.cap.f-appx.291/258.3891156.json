After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part Martinez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">Martinez and her sons, natives and citizens of Venezuela, arrived in Miami, Florida on November 11, 2004 as non-immigrant visitors authorized to stay until August 21, 2005. In January 2007, Martinez filed an asylum application claiming she was persecuted in Venezuela based on her political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The Department of Homeland Security charged Martinez and her sons with removability for remaining in the United States beyond the authorized period, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">Following a hearing at which Martinez testified and conceded removability, the IJ denied all requested relief. The IJ concluded that Martinez\u2019s asylum application was untimely. Further, the IJ found Martinez\u2019s testimony was not credible, gave no weight to a letter from her Venezuelan neighbor because it was too vague and general, and concluded that Martinez was ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">The BIA dismissed Martinez\u2019s appeal, noting she had argued only that she suffered past persecution and had a well-founded fear of future persecution and had not challenged either the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding or the untimeliness of her asylum application. The BIA concluded that Martinez\u2019s failure to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>these bases for the IJ\u2019s denial of the application meant there was no error in the IJ\u2019s decision. Martinez filed this petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">To the extent Martinez challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim because Martinez did not exhaust it in her appeal to the BIA. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). Likewise, we lack jurisdiction to review Martinez\u2019s newly-raised claim that her due process rights were violated by the IJ\u2019s alleged bias. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1251. Thus, we dismiss Martinez\u2019s petition as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">As to Martinez\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the 2006 United States Country Report on Venezuela indicates that some protestors against the Venezuelan government have been harmed by security forces during demonstrations, the only evidence that Martinez participated in these protests came from her discredited testimony. A letter from her neighbor stated in conclusory fashion that the neighbor had \u201cpersonally witnessed the persecution and multiple threats\u201d Martinez was subjected to \u201cby persons unknown, forcing [Martinez] to change houses with all her family.\u201d The letter did not provide any details of the persecution or threats or identify who made the threats or the reasons for them. The neighbor\u2019s letter and the 2006 Country Report do not compel a conclusion that Martinez personally suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution should she return to Venezuela or that she is entitled to CAT relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-12\">. An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if she can show that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. The alien bears the burden to show either that she suffered past persecution or that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1) \u2014 (2). To be eligible for CAT relief, an alien must prove that she more likely than not would be tortured if returned to the country in question. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-13\">. On appeal, Martinez does not challenge the denial of her asylum petition as untimely. Therefore, we do not address this claim further. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1286 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">. We review only the BIA's decision except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA issued its own opinion upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the untimeliness of Martinez\u2019s asylum application and rejecting the rest of her appeal. Thus, we review only the BIA's decision. We review legal issues <em>de novo. Mohammed </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA's factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283. Under the substantial evidence test, \"we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
