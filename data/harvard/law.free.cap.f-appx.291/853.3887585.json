R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b878-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Martin Chavez-Cuevas appeals from the district court\u2019s decision, following a limited remand under <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1084-85 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), that it would not have imposed a different sentence had it known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">Chavez-Cuevas contends that the district court erred by adding one criminal history point for a drunk driving conviction he never sustained. This contention fails because the prior conviction was proven by a preponderance of the evidence, using sufficiently reliable information. <em>See United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 894-95 (9th Cir.1998). Moreover, any error is harmless because even if Chavez-Cuevas received one less criminal history point his advisory sentencing range would be the same. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1279-80 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">We also conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Chavez-Cuevas was responsible for 34.33 kilograms of methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Kilby, </em>443 F.3d 1135, 1140-41 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-16\">Chavez-Cuevas\u2019s contention that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by giving him three criminal history points for committing the instant offense while under a criminal justice sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), and less than two years following his release from confinement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e), is not properly before this court. <em>See United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir.2006); <em>cf. United States v. Thornton, </em>511 F.3d 1221, 1227 (9th Cir.2008) (recognizing that the appellant\u2019s sentencing issues were properly before the court on appeal from an <em>Ameline </em>remand only because the appellant raised the issues in his initial appeal to this court).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b878-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
