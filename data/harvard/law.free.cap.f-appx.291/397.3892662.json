We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">On appeal, Smalls claims that the District Court erred both procedurally and substantively. Smalls alleges that the District Court erred procedurally by impermissibly relying on considerations of generally escalating gun-related violence in New Haven, Connecticut instead of the requisite defendant-specific section 3553(a) factors. He further alleges that his consecutive term of imprisonment of 46 months is substantively unreasonable. Smalls did not raise these issues before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for both substantive and procedural reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-22\">The procedural inquiry focuses primarily on the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with its statutory obligations to consider the factors detailed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), while the substantive inquiry assesses the length of the sentence imposed in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeU\"><em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-23\">The District Court did not err procedurally when it imposed a consecutive term of imprisonment of 46 months. The totality of the record reveals that the District Court adequately considered all of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and policy statements. Moreover, the court did not improperly rely on facts and circumstances outside the scope of \u00a7 3553(a) when it made a passing reference to current gun-related violence in the city of New Haven, Connecticut. The court specifically stated that \u201cthere has to be an understanding among people who are on supervised release that violation of them conditions of release is going to incur sanctions from this [cjourt.\u201d To that end, the District Court reasonably exercised its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>in imposing a consecutive sentence instead of the concurrent sentence requested by-Smalls. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (\u201cAny term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of probation or supervised release shall be ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Moreover, the District Court\u2019s comments were entirely appropriate in light of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) because they reflected the court\u2019s assessment of the need for the sentence to provide general deterrence to those on supervised release from violating the conditions of their supervised release. The record also demonstrates that the District Court fully understood its authority to depart from the Guidelines and to impose a non-Guidelines sentence. In this respect, the District Court \u201cset forth enough to satisfy [this Court] that [it] ha[d] considered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Similarly, the District Court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence with a term of incarceration of 46 months to run consecutive to a term of imprisonment of 8 years. The court was aware that in Smalls\u2019s criminal history category of V, a Grade A violation yielded an advisory Guidelines range of 46-57 months. The court properly identified the nature of Smalls\u2019s violation of his supervised release \u2014 to wit, associating with a known felon and commission of a state crime. The court also considered and rejected Smalls\u2019s arguments for a concurrent sentence. Finally, the District Court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence reflected its consideration of Smalls\u2019s state sentence and the need generally to deter individuals from violating the conditions of them supervised release. Accordingly, a term of imprisonment of 46 months, to run consecutive to a 8-year term of imprisonment, was substantively reasonable under the circumstances presented. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>443 F.3d 35, 47-48 (2d Cir.2006) (\u00a7 3538(e) \u201crequir[es] consideration of the enumerated subsections of \u00a7 3553(a), without forbidding consideration of other pertinent factors ... [or] consideration of the seriousness of the releasee\u2019s violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Smalls\u2019s sentencing challenges were unpreserved in the District Court. We review an unpreserved sentencing challenge for plain error, reversing only if there (1) is an error (2) that is plain, (3) which affected the substantial rights of the defendant, and (4) which seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>424 F.3d 239, 243-49 (2d Cir.2005) (discussing plain error standard in the context of an unpreserved challenge to sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of supervised release). For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the District Court committed no procedural or substantive error, much less plain error, in sentencing Smalls. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
