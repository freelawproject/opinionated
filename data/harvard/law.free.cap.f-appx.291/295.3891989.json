On appeal, Rivera: (1) acknowledges that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), does not require the government to allege prior convictions in the indictment or prove them before a jury, but nonetheless argues that the government should have presented the predicate offenses used to enhance his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), to a jury; and (2) argues that the government failed to prove the required three prior convictions for sentencing under the ACCA because it offered no evidence of the prior convictions. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-22\">We review preserved claims of constitutional error <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir. 2008). Normally, we review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a serious drug offense within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1153 (11th Cir.2005), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Rivera, however, did not object to the sufficiency of the evidence to classify him as an armed career <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>offender before the district court, so we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir. 2005). Plain error requires the defendant to show: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">First, we find no merit to Rivera\u2019s contention that the district court erred in using prior convictions \u2014 not listed in the indictment \u2014 to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held the government need not allege in its indictment or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions in order for the district court to use those convictions to enhance a sentence. <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1188 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). We have upheld the continued viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, prior precedent bars any argument that the district court erred in sentencing a defendant based on convictions not listed in the indictment. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We also reject Rivera\u2019s argument that the district court otherwise erred in relying on his prior convictions. A person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and who has three previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d a \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d or both, is an armed career criminal and subject to imprisonment for a period of not less than 15 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d includes, \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Cocaine is listed as a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(6); 812(c). Under Florida law, possession of cocaine with an intent to sell or deliver the cocaine is a second degree felony punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.03(2)(a)(4); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(e). Failure to object to the facts in the PSI is an admission of those facts. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Here, Rivera\u2019s PSI contained at least three qualifying convictions, and Rivera admitted the underlying facts of the convictions by not objecting to them. <em>See id. </em>Rivera also admitted at sentencing that he qualified for the ACCA enhancement. Therefore, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, by enhancing Rivera\u2019s sentence under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
