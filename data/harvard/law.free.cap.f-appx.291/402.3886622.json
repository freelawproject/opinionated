Hargett contends that the state court\u2019s use of a blackboard to shield the identity of a testifying undercover officer (\u201cthe undercover\u201d) violated his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), a federal court may grant habeas corpus relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the adjudication was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The U.S. Supreme Court recently reiterated \u201cthat clearly established Federal law in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u201d <em>Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 127 S.Ct. 649, 653, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">In <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>the Supreme Court set forth a four-part test for determining whether the closure of a courtroom violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial: \u201c[1] the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, [2] the closure must be no broader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>than necessary to protect that interest, [3] the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and [4] it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d 467 U.S. 39, 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984). The parties do not dispute that this test governs Hargett\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Hargett contends that the state court\u2019s decision to \u201csequester\u201d his family behind a chalkboard during the undercover\u2019s testimony violated <em>Waller </em>because it was (a) broader than necessary and (b) not supported by adequate findings. Assuming <em>argtiendo </em>that the use of a chalkboard in this fashion constitutes a <em>form </em>of courtroom closure, instead of an <em>alternative </em>to closure, <em>but see Ayala v. Speckard, </em>131 F.3d 62, 71 (2d Cir.1997) (describing as an \u201calternative\u201d to closure the \u201cplac[ement] of a screen between the witness and the coui'troom spectators\u201d), the state court\u2019s decision does not run afoul of the four-part test set forth in <em>Waller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The first <em>Waller </em>requirement is easily met in light of the state\u2019s \u201coverriding interest,\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48, in protecting an undercover officer and preserving his effectiveness. <em>See Rodriguez v. Miller, </em>537 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cIt is clear that the State has an \u2018overriding interest\u2019 in protecting the identity of its undercover officers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We conclude that the second requirement \u2014 that the closure be no broader than necessary \u2014 was also met: The court\u2019s interposition of the blackboard (1) was limited to the time when the undercover was testifying; (2) screened only certain individuals, not the public-at-large; and (3) enabled Hargett\u2019s family to hear the testimony from within the courtroom. <em>See id. </em>(approving of a \u201cclosure [that] was to last only for the duration of the [u]ndercover\u2019s testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Turning to the third requirement \u2014 that the trial court consider alternatives \u2014 we note that the state court considered and, at first, agreed to have Hargett\u2019s family members sit in the back of the courtroom while the undercover, in a hat and coat, testified. That alternative appeared reasonable to the state court at first, but it was later rejected when the court learned that Hargett\u2019s father and brother had both sold drugs while living in the same house as the family members Hargett sought to have admitted to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Finally, the state court made adequate findings to support the closure, in conformity with the fourth <em>Waller </em>requirement. At a hearing held by the state court to determine whether the courtroom should be closed during the undercover\u2019s testimony, the undercover testified that (1) he worked in the arrest area on a weekly basis, had other investigations pending in that area, and intended to return there in an undercover capacity in the future; (2) he took precautions to protect his identity \u2014 including not testifying in open court, not wearing a uniform, and using rear entrances to the courthouse \u2014 whenever he appeared in court; (3) he had been threatened a dozen times that \u201cif I find out you\u2019re a cop[,] I\u2019ll kill you or have you killed;\u201d and (4) on prior occasions where he had been identified as a police officer, the undercover operations had to be terminated. With respect to Hargett\u2019s family and friends being in the courtroom, the undercover testified that he had specific concerns about them because \u201cthey still live in the area that I currently work.\u201d Taken together, this evidence provides an adequate basis for the state court\u2019s decision to seat Hargett\u2019s family behind a blackboard during the undercover\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The state court\u2019s decision to interpose the blackboard between the undercover agent and members of Hargett\u2019s family was therefore neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of <em>Waller, </em>and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>for that reason, Hargett is not entitled to habeas relief under the standard set forth in AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
