Wyt-tenbach appealed to the Southern District of Texas but neither disputed that he failed to fulfill the credit counseling requirements nor contended that the bankruptcy court\u2019s reliance on 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(h) was in error. Instead, Wytten-bach challenged the bankruptcy court\u2019s order only on the grounds that he filed his chapter 7 petition as a \u201cman,\u201d not a \u201ctrust\u201d \u2014 grounds upon which the bankruptcy court did not rely. In his current brief, Wyttenbach does not assert that the lower court\u2019s reliance on 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(h) was improper; he again argues only that the lower courts misidentified him as a \u201ctrust\u201d rather than a \u201cman.\u201d We conclude that the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b987-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
