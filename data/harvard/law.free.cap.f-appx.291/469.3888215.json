We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">Abuhouran filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d), certain of its employees, the New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicle Services (\u201cNJDMV\u201d) and the State of New Jersey. NJDMV and the State of New Jersey (\u201cthe state defendants\u201d) moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The SSA and its employees moved to dismiss or in the alternative, for summary judgment. The District Court granted the motions, and Abuhouran timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a District Court\u2019s dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. Merle v. U.S., </em>351 F.3d 92, 94 (3d Cir.2003). We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we apply the same standard that the District Court should have applied. <em>MBIA Ins. Corp. v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>426 F.3d 204, 209 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-17\">Abuhouran alleges that she is a naturalized citizen residing in New Jersey. On January 12, 2006, she allegedly went to NJDMV to renew her driver\u2019s license, which had expired eight years earlier. NJDMV refused to renew her license because the information it contained allegedly did not match the information provided by SSA. Abuhouran says that she then visited the SSA office in Jersey City, New Jersey, and requested that her records be corrected and a new card issued. Abuhouran attempted to prove her identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>using her certificate of naturalization, an expired driver\u2019s license and an expired passport. SSA sent Abuhouran a letter confirming her request for a new Social Security card reflecting the correct information; however, Linda McMahon, Deputy Commissioner of SSA, sent an another letter shortly thereafter stating that SSA could not issue a Social Security card because the identity and age information that Abuhouran provided did not match the data maintained by \u201cthe [unspecified] agency\u201d that maintains those records. On June 6, 2006, Abuhouran received her renewed passport and subsequently submitted it to SSA in an effort to prove her identity. SSA officials allegedly referred to her as \u201cyou people,\u201d a veiled reference to all Arabs, telling her \u201cyou know what you\u2019ve done,\u201d in reference to the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and then calling a security guard to escort her out. Am. Compl. If 42. A supervisor allegedly advised Abuhouran that she would receive a new Social Security card reflecting the correct information, but apparently no action was taken until Abuhouran filed this lawsuit. Abuhouran states that she then sought to have her driver\u2019s license renewed, but NJDMV again informed her that her identification information did not match the data provided by SSA. In September 2006, SSA met with Abuhouran and corrected her information in a matter of minutes. Abuhouran alleges that defendants\u2019 failure to correct her identifying information led to the denial of her driver\u2019s license, denial of employment, denial of medical treatment and denial of the right to travel or attend events requiring \u201cproper\u201d identification, and that defendants discriminated against her based on her Jordanian ethnicity. Abuhouran asserts claims under the Privacy Act, the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We first address the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the federal defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The federal defendants presented undisputed evidence that Abuhouran or an individual with her same social security number had applied for numerous social security cards over the past few decades, and that these applications contained different birth dates and inconsistent gender identifications. <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. Op., at 5 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Privacy Act creates a civil remedy for a federal agency\u2019s failure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6M\">to maintain any record concerning any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications, character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual that may be made on the basis of such record....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aeg\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. A plaintiff seeking damages must demonstrate that the agency\u2019s actions were \u201cintentional or willful.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4). The District Court determined that SSA had issued Abuhouran a new Social Security card, which rendered moot her claim for injunctive relief under the Privacy Act. Abuhouran also seeks damages; therefore, she must adduce facts sufficient to show that the defendants <em>intentionally </em>or <em>willfully </em>refused to correct her identification data. \u201cAn agency acts in an intentional or willful manner \u2018either by committing the act without grounds for believing it to be lawful, or by flagrantly disregarding others\u2019 rights under the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deters v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>85 F.3d 655, 660 (D.C.Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Although Abuhouran alleges that unspecified SSA employees referred to her as \u201cyou people\u201d and told her, \u201cyou know what you\u2019ve done,\u201d she fails to allege who made those remarks, which precludes an analysis of any defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>intent. Abuhouran also has failed to rebut the record evidence that SSA acted in accordance with SSA policy, especially in light of the numerous applications for social security cards by her or a person with her social security number, containing inconsistent information. Abuhouran failed to proffer evidence \u2014 in the form of affidavits or otherwise \u2014 that SSA employees intentionally or willfully refused to correct her information and issue a new card. Therefore, summary judgment was proper on the Privacy Act claim. <em>See Orsatti v. N.J. State Police, </em>71 F.3d 480, 484 (3d Cir.1995) (\u201c[A] plaintiff cannot resist a properly supported motion for summary judgment by merely restating the allegations of his complaint.... \u201d); <em>Reinbold v. Evers, </em>187 F.3d 348, 362 (4th Cir.1999) (summary judgment proper on Privacy Act claim where plaintiff failed to \u201cbring forward <em>any </em>evidence that the [agency] acted in a manner which was \u2018intentional or willful.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The District Court also properly granted summary judgment on Abuhouran\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim. <em>Bivens </em>provides a cause of action against federal officials who have committed constitutional violations. The District Court correctly concluded that a <em>Bivens </em>action is improper when the claims asserted are \u201cencompassed within the remedial scheme of the Privacy Act.\u201d <em>See Chung v. U.S. Dep\u2019t Justice, </em>333 F.3d 273, 274 (D.C.Cir.2003). Because the Privacy Act provides a remedy, Abuhouran\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Abuhouran\u2019s final claim against the federal defendants was brought under the FTCA. The FTCA provides a cause of action against the United States for \u201cnon-constitutional torts based on the \u2018negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1).\u201d <em>Couden v. Duffy, </em>446 F.3d 483, 498 n. 10 (3d Cir.2006). The United States is the only proper defendant in an action brought under the FTCA. <em>Woods v. United States, </em>720 F.2d 1451, 1452 n. 1 (9th Cir.1983); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). District Courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, however, over claims based on the performance of a discretionary function. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680. This so-called \u201cdiscretionary function exception\u201d shields the United States from liability based on government officials\u2019 conduct involving judgment or choice, so long as the judgment \u201cis the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.\u201d <em>Berkovitz v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The District Court correctly determined that Abuhouran could not sue the SSA or federal officials under the FTCA, and that she had failed to name the United States. It further denied Abuhouran leave to amend her complaint to name the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">We review a District Court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Winer Family Trust v. Queen, </em>503 F.3d 319, 331 (3d Cir.2007). Although leave to amend should be \u201cfreely given when justice so requires,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), a District Court may deny leave to amend where it would cause undue delay or prejudice, or where amendment would be futile. <em>Winer Family Trust, </em>503 F.3d at 330-331.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The District Court ruled that Abuhouran\u2019s belated effort to add the United States as a defendant in a second amended complaint would be futile because the conduct that she challenged is a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d and, therefore, the District Court would lack jurisdiction over such a claim against the United States. We exercise plenary review over the applicability of the discretionary function exception. <em>Gotha v. U.S., </em>115 F.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir. 1997). The District Court was correct in ruling that the challenged conduct satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the first prong of the discretionary function exception test, namely, whether the challenged conduct involves federal officials\u2019 judgment or choice. SSA\u2019s Program Operations Manual System (\u201cPOMS\u201d) requires SSA employees to be certain that the person applying for a social security card is the person he or she claims to be, and SSA employees may require additional evidence if they doubt the identity of the applicant. POMS RM 00203.200(A), (E)(1); POMS RM 00203.020(1). In light of the checkered history associated with Abuhouran\u2019s social security number, SSA employees were entitled to require additional proof of identity from Abuhouran if they so chose. Accordingly, the District Court correctly concluded that the challenged conduct involved federal employees\u2019 judgment or choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The discretionary function exception, however, does not apply to every discretionary decision made by a federal employee. <em>Gotha, </em>115 F.3d at 179. The exception applies only to those judgments that involve social, economic or political policy decisions that Congress meant to shield from judicial \u201csecond-guessing\u201d through tort actions. <em>Berkovitz, </em>486 U.S. at 536-537, 108 S.Ct. 1954. Although the District Court failed to consider the second prong of the discretionary function exception, the error does not affect its conclusion that amendment would be futile. The decision to accept or reject certain evidence of identity lies squarely within SSA officials\u2019 policy judgment regarding the standards required to verify identity in this country. These are the kind of judgments involving public policy decisions that Congress sought to shield. <em>Compare Gotha, </em>115 F.3d at 181 (Navy\u2019s failure to provide a proper stairway, railing and lighting at a Navy facility was not subject to the discretionary function exception because it involved a \u201cmundane, administrative, garden-variety, housekeeping problem\u201d far removed from the Navy\u2019s mission) with <em>Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. U.S.A., </em>919 F.2d 888, 892 (3d Cir.1990) (government\u2019s decision to use war ships containing asbestos fell within discretionary function exception because it involved questions of resource allocation and effective utilization of the nation\u2019s naval fleet). Therefore, the discretionary function exception applies, amendment would have been futile, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Abuhouran leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The District Court also properly granted the state defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. State actors cannot be sued under the Privacy Act, <em>Bivens, </em>or the FTCA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551; <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 391 n. 4, 91 S.Ct. 1999; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). As Abuhouran\u2019s allegations do not state a claim for a violation of due process or of equal protection, it would have been futile for the District Court to grant her leave to amend to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Abuhouran does not allege the denial of a protected liberty or property interest, nor does the denial of a driver\u2019s license implicate the right to interstate travel. <em>Cf. Miller v. Reed, </em>176 F.3d 1202, 1206 (9th Cir.1999) (right to drive not a fundamental right that implicates the right to interstate travel). Nor does she allege any racial discrimination by the <em>state </em>defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">In sum, the District Court properly dismissed the claims against the state defendants, granted summary judgment to SSA and its employees on Abuhouran\u2019s claims under the Privacy Act, <em>Bivens, </em>and the FTCA, and denied Abuhouran leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>amend. Accordingly, we will affirm the orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and her motion to amend are denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellees\u2019 motion to file briefs and supplemental appendix under seal is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\">. Abuhouran alleges that the defendants who violated her right to equal protection were \"federal employees.\u201d Am. Compl., H 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-21\">. To the extent that appellant asserts that the District Court abused its discretion in failing to construe a letter as a motion for appointment of counsel, we note that the District Court docket does not show receipt of such a letter. In any event, appointment of counsel would not have been warranted under <em>Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155-56 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
