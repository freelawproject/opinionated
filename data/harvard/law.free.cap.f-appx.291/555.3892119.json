The district court sentenced Vasquez to a within-guidelines sentence of 57 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. On appeal, he challenges only his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-20\">Vasquez argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not assign sufficient reasons to support the sentence it imposed. By not objecting to the district court\u2019s failure to give specific reasons for its sentence, Vasquez has relegated that claim to plain error review. <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record must merely show that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for its sentencing decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Vasquez\u2019s sole objection to the presentence report (PSR) pertained to the calculation of his criminal history score, and he acknowledged at sentencing that his argument was without merit. At sentencing, Vasquez requested a below-guidelines sentence based on his minor role in his prior drug-trafficking-conspiracy convictions and the fact that those prior convictions unduly increased his sentencing range in this case. He also asked the district court to consider the fact that he illegally entered this country looking for new horizons. After hearing Vasquez\u2019s request for leniency, the district court adopted the PSR\u2019s findings and recommendation and imposed the sentence. The district court indicated in its written statement of reasons that it found no reason to depart from the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In light of the statement found sufficient by the Court in <em>Rita </em>and the scant argument Vasquez advanced in support of a below-guidelines sentence, Vasquez has not shown that the explanation given by the district court was clear or obvious error which affected the outcome of the proceedings, and he has therefore not demonstrated plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Vasquez also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. This court reviews a sentencing decision for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which is the equivalent of abuse-of-discretion review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court \u201cwill give great deference to that sentence\u201d and \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, a discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range, as occurred here, is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2466-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">Vasquez argues that the sentence should nevertheless be vacated and the case summarily remanded on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decisions in <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which, he urges, \u201chave drastically altered the legal landscape of federal sentencing.\u201d The argument is not well-taken. Neither case overturned <em>Rita. </em>To the contrary, <em>Gall </em>reiterated that appellate courts may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the pertinent guideline range. 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">Vasquez contends that <em>Kimbrough </em>applies because the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the discretion to disagree with the policy behind prior-felony enhancement mandated under the Guidelines, in light of this court\u2019s precedent in <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006). Even prior to <em>Kimbrough, </em>this court\u2019s precedent offered district courts the opportunity to impose a sentence outside the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 557 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The district court\u2019s comments at sentencing do not indicate that it would have been inclined not to apply the 16-level enhancement because of Vasquez\u2019s individual circumstances but believed it lacked the authority to do so. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
