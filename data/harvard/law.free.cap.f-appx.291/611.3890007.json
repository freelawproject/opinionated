He received an aggregate sentence of 90 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Ibarra now appeals, challenging only his convictions on the non-conspiracy counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Ibarra argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions because there was no evidence that he knew that the two aliens at issue in Counts <em>2 </em>and 3 of the indictment were in this country illegally. Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, <em>United States v. Serna-Villarreal, </em>352 F.3d 225, 234 (5th Cir.2003), the evidence presented at the trial showed that a driver under Ibarra\u2019s direction was transporting a load of illegal aliens. That load included the two aliens named in Counts 2 and 3 of Ibarra\u2019s indictment. Despite the lack of any interpersonal contact between Ibarra and the two aliens at issue here and the fact that the two aliens were unaware of Ibarra\u2019s existence, the circumstantial evidence supports the legal conclusion that Ibarra knew that the aliens being transported by Ibarra\u2019s driver were illegal aliens. <em>See United States v. Romero-Cruz, </em>201 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2000). Because a rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence established Ibarra\u2019s guilty knowledge, there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions on Counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. <em>See Serna-Villarreal, </em>352 F.3d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Ibarra also argues that the district court abused its discretion when it allowed one of Ibarra\u2019s codefendants to make a blanket invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. He contends that the district court did not make a sufficient inquiry into the validity and the scope of the privilege. In light of the facts that the codefendant was charged in each of the counts on which Ibarra was being tried, that the codefendant was awaiting sentencing in his own case, and that Ibarra has not indicated what material and relevant testimony was excluded, there was no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Boyett, </em>923 F.2d 378, 379-80 (5th Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>625 F.2d 693, 701 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Melchor Moreno, </em>536 F.2d 1042, 1050 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
