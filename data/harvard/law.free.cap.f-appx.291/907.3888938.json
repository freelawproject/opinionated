Brown, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a final order disposing of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). We take jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, DENY Mr. Brown\u2019s request for a COA, and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">On May 18, 2000, Mr. Brown was sentenced in Oklahoma state court to life in prison for shooting with intent to kill. He filed a timely appeal with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which affirmed both his conviction and sentence on April 16, 2001. He then had ninety days to pursue a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(d), Sup. Ct. R. 13, which he did not do. Accordingly, his judgment and sentence became final for limitations purposes on July 15, 2001, and his one-year habeas filing period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) expired one year later. <em>See Habteselassie v. Novak, </em>209 F.3d 1208, 1209 (10th Cm. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">On February 13, 2007, Mr. Brown filed a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in federal district court, attacking his state-court conviction. After the magistrate judge ordered Mr. Brown and the respondents to address the timeliness of the petition, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed the petition as time-barred. Mr. Brown now seeks a COA from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This standard requires Mr. Brown to show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). When, as here, the district court\u2019s ruling is based on procedural grounds, the petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right, and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478,120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">Because Mr. Brown did not file his \u00a7 2254 petition until February 2007, more than four years after the limitations period had run,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his petition is time-barred unless it meets the high standard we have established for equitable tolling. Equitable tolling of the one-year limitations period is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>permitted \u201conly in rare and exceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000) (quotations omitted), and \u201conly ... when an inmate diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000). To the extent Mr. Brown argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling because of ineffectiveness of counsel at trial, we disagree. Even if we assume that Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel was ineffective, that does not excuse Mr. Brown\u2019s extended delay in seeking federal post-conviction relief in this case. We agree with the magistrate judge and district court that Mr. Brown has not alleged the required \u201cspecificity [regarding] the steps he took to diligently pursue his federal claims.\u201d <em>Yang v. Archuleta, </em>525 F.3d 925, 930 (10th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Mr. Brown further asserts his actual innocence as an equitable basis for avoiding the limitations period altogether. Although we have recognized actual innocence as equitable grounds for not applying the \u00a7 2244(d) limitations period, <em>see Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998), the demonstration of actual innocence merely provides a gateway to allow federal habeas review of a procedurally defaulted claim. <em>Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 405, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). It is not itself a basis upon which habeas relief may be granted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Moreover, a petitioner \u201casserting innocence as a gateway to defaulted claims must establish that, in light of new evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>House v. Bell, </em>547 U.S. 518, 536-537, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (quotations omitted); <em>Phillips v. Ferguson, </em>182 F.3d 769, 774 (10th Cir.1999) (quotations omitted). Mr. Brown\u2019s introduction of new evidence about his whereabouts on the morning of the crime would not cause a rational juror to doubt Mr. Brown\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Equitable tolling of the one-year limitations period is therefore inappropriate based on Mr. Brown\u2019s claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">After carefully reviewing Mr. Brown\u2019s brief, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and the record on appeal, we conclude that reasonable jurists could not debate whether the district court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>correct to dismiss Mr. Brown\u2019s petition as time-barred. We therefore DENY Mr. Brown\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-10\">. Before the one-year limitation period expired, Mr. Brown filed two motions in state court: a motion for a suspended sentence and a motion for a sentence modification. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>first motion was denied approximately two months after it was filed, and Mr. Brown successfully moved to strike the second motion approximately one month after it was filed. Thus, even if these motions are properly considered motions for post-conviction relief sufficient to toll the limitations period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), Mr. Brown\u2019s habeas petition is still untimely because it was filed more than three years after the second state-court motion was stricken. We also note that Mr. Brown\u2019s two additional applications for post-conviction relief were filed after the one-year period under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) had run and therefore could not have rendered his petition timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b933-10\">. This new evidence is the testimony of Ms. Sandra Shepherd, who stated that Mr. Brown was at her home, ten blocks from the crime scene, at approximately 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the shooting. The State\u2019s witness testified that Mr. Brown was at <em>his </em>home, eighteen blocks from the crime scene, at 6:00 a.m. that same morning. Regardless of where Mr. Brown was at 6:00 a.m., he acknowledges that the crime occurred at about 5:00 a.m. and he would have actually been in closer proximity to the crime scene were he at the home of Ms. Shepherd. Additionally, he provides no new evidence to refute the testimony of two separate witnesses who heard him admit to shooting someone at the scene of the crime on the morning of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
