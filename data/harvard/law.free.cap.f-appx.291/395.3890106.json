We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">On a prior appeal, we remanded to the District Court solely for reconsideration of a four-level leadership enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, which increased the adjusted offense level with respect to Count Four. <em>See United States v. Alvarado, </em>134 Fed.Appx. 461 (2d Cir.2005). On remand, the District Court clarified that the enhancement was imposed solely with respect to the narcotics conspiracy, and not with respect to a separate assault conspiracy. The Court therefore reimposed the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Alvarado challenges the leadership enhancement as insufficiently supported by the evidence. We reject that claim. The enhancement was adequately supported by the testimony of Edward Maggiore. The District Court\u2019s finding that the narcotics conspiracy included at least five participants is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Although the sentence of sixty years and five months is severe, we cannot say that it is unreasonable, especially in light of the fact that Alvarado was subject to mandatory minimum consecutive sentences of five and twenty-five years with respect to Counts Two and Three, respectively, and a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence with respect to Count Four. However, as the Government acknowledges, the Guidelines sentence on Count Four, which exceeded the mandatory minimum, was largely determined by the amount of crack cocaine distributed by the narcotics conspiracy, and a remand of the sentence on Count Four is appropriate in view of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>See United States v. Regalado, </em>518 F.3d 143 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Accordingly, the sentences on Counts One, Two, and Three are affirmed, and the sentence on Count Four is remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
