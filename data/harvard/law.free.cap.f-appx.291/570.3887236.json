The district court dismissed Hewitt\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim because he did not demonstrate that the prison regulations that he challenged impinged unreasonably on his right to exercise his religion. The district court denied Hewitt\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Hewitt is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Hewitt does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, in light of his failure to challenge the reasons for the district court\u2019s certification decision, Hewitt\u2019s claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Hewitt has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal would not be taken in good faith was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Hewitt\u2019s request for IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202, n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Hewitt is cautioned that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Hewitt is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
