The matter is before this court on Orozco\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing no appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d unless the movant first obtains a COA). Because Orozco has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-21\">Orozco pleaded guilty to distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Although the written plea agreement contained a waiver of Orozco\u2019s right to directly appeal or collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, he filed a direct appeal with this court. <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>219 Fed.Appx. 777, 777 (10th Cir.2007). The Government filed a motion seeking enforcement of the waiver. <em>Id. </em>This court concluded Orozco (1) sought to raise issues that fell within the scope of the appeal waiver and (2) knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement and waiver. Because enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice, the court granted the Government\u2019s motion and dismissed Orozco\u2019s appeal. <em>Id.; United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1327 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-22\">Orozco filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion on February 1, 2008, asserting multiple ineffective assistance of counsel claims, including allegations his counsel was ineffective for failing to \u201cperfect\u201d a direct appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and a claim his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government moved to dismiss Orozco\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion based on the following waiver provision in the plea agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with this prosecution, conviction and sentence. The defendant is aware that Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 affords a defendant the right to appeal the conviction and sentence imposed. By entering into this agreement, the defendant knowingly ... waives any right to challenge a sentence or otherwise attempt to modify or change his sentence or manner in which it was determined in any collateral attack, including, but not limited to, a motion brought under Title 28, U.S.C. \u00a7 2255....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The district court enforced the waiver of Orozco\u2019s right to collaterally attack his sentence or the manner in which it was determined and dismissed Orozco\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">To be entitled to a COA, Orozco must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Orozco has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Orozco need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Having undertaken a review of Orozco\u2019s application for a COA and appellate filings, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El, </em>this court concludes he is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Orozco\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not reasonably subject to debate and the issues he seeks to raise on appeal are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, this court denies Orozco\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. His request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-17\">. We are puzzled by this claim in light of the fact that Orozco\u2019s counsel filed both a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>notice of appeal and an appellate brief arguing for a reduction in Orozco\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>219 Fed.Appx. 777 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
