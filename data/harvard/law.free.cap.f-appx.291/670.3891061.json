McNeill formerly was employed as the assistant chief of the CPD and was even appointed interim chief while the City advertised and filled the vacancy. In this action against the Defendants-Appellees, she alleges, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) she was not selected for the chief of police position because of her sex and in retaliation for her earlier successful sexual harassment and retaliation suit filed against the City, (2) she was retaliated against when she was allegedly demoted and eventually fired after filing her failure-to-promote charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, (3) her Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process rights were violated when she was fired, and (4) she suffered from intentionally inflicted emotional distress. The Defendants-Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment; McNeill objected and requested that she be granted a Rule 56(f) continuance to conduct additional discovery. The court denied McNeill\u2019s request for a continuance and granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants-Appellees, dismissing each of McNeill\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">We have reviewed the record on appeal and the law applicable thereto as set forth in the appellate briefs of the parties and the rulings of the district court. As a result of our review, we are convinced that the district court\u2019s grant of the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment was proper, essentially for the reasons carefully explained at length by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">First, with respect to her failure-to-promote claims, McNeill has not shown that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 stated legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her non-selection, <em>viz., </em>that the City wanted to hue an outsider for the chief of police position, was pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fact, McNeill herself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>bolstered the legitimacy of the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 reason for not promoting her when she acknowledged in her deposition that, in recent years, the CPD had experienced substantial internal problems because corruption was rampant within the CPD\u2019s ranks. Second, with respect to her retaliation claims, McNeill has failed, <em>inter alia, </em>to (1) demonstrate a sufficient causal connection between her protected activity and the alleged materially adverse employment actions she suffered, and (2) rebut adequately the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 proffered non-discriminatory reasons for the materially adverse employment actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Most notably, McNeill makes no attempt to (1) discredit the DefendantsAppellees\u2019 justification for modifying her work schedule, <em>viz., </em>to provide more police coverage because the City was short on manpower at the time, or (2) address the proffered reasons for her termination, which reasons include her failure to perform her duties and her refusal to work cooperatively with Chief Winn and others. Third, as McNeill has not established that she had a property interest in her employment with the City, her substantive and procedural due process claims must fail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrary to her unsupported and conclusional assertion that she was a civil service employee under Mississippi statutory law and thus had a protected interest in her employment, the record reveals that she was an at-will employee and therefore terminable with or without cause. Finally, there plainly is no evidentiary basis to support her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">We are also convinced that the district court did not err in refusing to grant McNeill a Rule 56(f) continuance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record reflects that the court granted her sufficient time to conduct adequate discovery. Moreover, McNeill made only vague assertions as to why additional discovery was needed and how that discovery would have enabled her to establish a genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal of this action with prejudice is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
