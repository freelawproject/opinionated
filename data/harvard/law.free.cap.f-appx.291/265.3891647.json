He received a 60-month sentence, which he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-25\">Ochoa was a paid informant. He told task force agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives that two men, Tony Fernandez and Juan Carlos Rosa, were going to rob an ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>mored truck at a Home Depot store in Pinecrest, Florida. Ochoa informed the agents that the would-be robbers wanted him to be their get-away driver. He gave the agents Fernandez and Rosa\u2019s phone numbers so that their conversations with Ochoa could be recorded. The agents also video taped a street corner meeting that Ochoa had with Rosa and another man named Carlos Chartrand. After the meeting, Ochoa told the agents that he had observed two Glock pistols in the black bag that Chartrand was carrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">After speaking with Ochoa and listening to phone conversations that Ochoa had with Rosa, the agents believed that Rosa and Fernandez were preparing to go forward with the robbery without Ochoa. They stationed surveillance teams at two Home Depot parking lots. One of the surveillance teams saw Chartrand approaching, and he was carrying the same black bag that he had during the street corner meeting with Ochoa. An agent approached Chartrand and asked to see the contents of his bag. Chartrand was carrying a compact DVD player and some DVDs but no firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Agents later arrested Rosa for solicitation of an armed robbery. Based on information provided by Rosa and inconsistencies in Ochoa\u2019s story, the agents concluded that they did not have cause to charge Rosa with attempted robbery. Instead, Ochoa was arrested and charged with providing false information to federal law enforcement officers. Count One of Ochoa\u2019s indictment alleged that he had falsely informed officers that a person was going to commit an armed robbery. Count two charged him with falsely informing officers that he had observed two firearms inside of a bag carried by another person. After a jury trial, Ochoa was acquitted on the first count and convicted on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">It is undisputed that United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.1(c)(3) (Nov. 2006) applies to Ochoa\u2019s offense of conviction. However, Ochoa contends for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by applying the cross-reference contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3) and calculating Ochoa\u2019s guideline range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2 for obstruction of justice. He argues that under the plain language of \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3), the cross-reference can apply only if the conduct alleged in Count Two of his indictment (the count of conviction) establishes the elements of another offense. He relies on the \u201cspecifically covered\u201d language of \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3) (invoking the cross-reference when \u201cthe conduct set forth in the count of conviction establishes an offense specifically covered by another guideline\u201d). He asserts that he was not convicted of conduct that is specifically covered under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2. Even under Ochoa\u2019s narrow construction of the \u201cspecifically covered\u201d language in \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3), the district court still did not plainly err in applying the cross-reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Section 2Bl.l(e)(3) provides that when a defendant is convicted (like Ochoa was) under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, another guideline will apply under some circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">If (A) neither subdivision (1) nor (2) of this subsection applies; (B) the defendant was convicted under a statute proscribing false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations generally <em>(e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, ...); and (C) the conduct set forth in the count of conviction establishes an offense specifically covered by another guideline in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct), apply that other guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Section 2B1.1 was amended in 2001, and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 was deleted by consolidation with it. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 App. C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>amend. 617 (Nov.2002). The amendment created the \u201cspecifically covered\u201d cross-reference in \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">The amendment includes a new cross reference (subsection (c)(3)) that is more generally applicable and intended to apply whenever a broadly applicable fraud statute is used to reach conduct that is addressed more specifically in another Chapter Two guideline. Prior to this amendment, the fraud guideline contained an application note that instructed the user to move to another, more appropriate Chapter Two guideline, under specified circumstances. Although this note was not a cross reference, but rather a reminder of the principles enunciated in \u00a7 1B1.2, it operated like a cross reference in the sense that it required use of a different guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The application note that had accompanied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 and that had \u201coperated like a cross reference,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 App. C, amend. 617 (Nov.2002), referred to an offense \u201cmore aptly covered by another guideline\u201d rather than \u201cspecifically covered\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, or a similarly general statute, although the offense is also covered by a more specific statute.... Where the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction ... establishes an offense more aptly covered by another guideline, apply that guideline rather than \u00a7 2F1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 cmt. n. 14 (Nov.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">After the consolidation of \u00a7 2F1.1 with \u00a7 2B1.1, the background comments explained that the cross-reference provision in the amended guideline should reconcile the nature of the offender\u2019s conduct with the offense of conviction, which may be general and, therefore, \u201csomewhat arbitrary\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">Because federal fraud statutes often are broadly written, a single pattern of offense conduct usually can be prosecuted under several code sections, as a result of which the offense of conviction may be somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, most fraud statutes cover a broad range of conduct with extreme variation in severity. The specific offense characteristics and cross references contained in this guideline are designed with these considerations in mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. background (Nov. 2002); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. background (Nov.2006) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">Under the \u201cspecifically covered\u201d amended version of \u00a7 2B1.1, the application notes continue to refer to \u201cconduct that is more aptly covered by another guideline\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">Subsection (c)(3) provides a cross reference to another guideline in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) in cases in which the defendant is convicted of a general fraud statute, and the count of conviction establishes an offense involving fraudulent conduct that is more aptly covered by another guideline. Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, or a similarly general statute, although the offense involves fraudulent conduct that is also covered by a more specific statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(c)(3) cmt. n. 15 (Nov. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3), the district court adopted the recommendation in the presentence investigation report and calculated Ochoa\u2019s base offense level under the obstruction of justice guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2. Ochoa contends that the conduct alleged in Count Two of his indictment did not establish a violation of any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the obstruction of justice offenses that are \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by \u00a7 2J1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u201c[W]e review objections to sentencing calculation issues raised for the first time on appeal for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201cThis standard requires that there be error, that the error be plain, and that the error affect a substantial right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf these three conditions are met, then we may exercise our discretion to notice the forfeited error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">We have explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">As the name suggests, any plain error must be \u201cplain.\u201d At a minimum, courts of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b) permitting plain error review unless the error is clear under current law. As we have repeatedly recognized, an error cannot meet the \u201cplain\u201d requirement of the plain error rule if it is not clear under current law. From that principle flows the law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\"><em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn the absence of any controlling precedent, there is no plain error in this case.\u201d). Even if there were error here, it would not be plain because it would not be clear under current law. The explicit language of the cross-reference provision contained in \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3) does not itself resolve the issue that Ochoa has raised, and there is no controlling precedent from the Supreme Court or from this Court directly resolving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Ochoa relies on a decision from the Second Circuit concluding that when the \u201cmore aptly covered\u201d language in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 cmt. n. 14 (Nov.1998) was changed to the \u201cspecifically covered\u201d language in the amended version of \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3), the amendment narrowed the application of the cross-reference. <em>United States v. Genao, </em>343 F.3d 578, 584 (2d Cir.2003). The Second Circuit held that \u201c \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3) is applicable only if the elements of another offense are established by conduct set forth in the count of conviction (and proven by at least a preponderance of the evidence).\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Bah, </em>439 F.3d 423, 427 (8th Cir.2006) (applying that rule from <em>Genao). Genao </em>is not a decision from the Supreme Court or this Court; therefore, it cannot establish that the district court plainly erred by applying the cross-reference in \u00a7 2B1.1(c)(3). <em>See Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1322; <em>see also Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
