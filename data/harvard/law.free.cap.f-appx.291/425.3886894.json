Sentenced to concurrent terms of 57 months\u2019 incarceration, five years of supervised release, $85,082.09 in restitution, and a $1,600 special assessment, Zafar challenges his conviction on grounds that the district court erred (1) at trial in limiting the testimony of defendant\u2019s computer expert, and (2) at sentence in (a) applying a two-level enhancement to Zafar\u2019s Guidelines calculation for \u201cmass-marketing\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), (b) calculating loss pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l) by reference to defendant\u2019s trading gains, and (c) awarding restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l) without consideration of victims\u2019 contributory negligence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">1. <em>Trial Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">To the extent Zafar submits that the district court erred in limiting the testimony of his computer expert, Patrick O\u2019Leary, he carries a heavy burden because, in this area, we accord trial judges considerable deference, and we will not reverse their rulings absent abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>528 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Lombardozzi, </em>491 F.3d 61, 77 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that rulings regarding expert testimony will be set aside only if \u201cmanifestly erroneous\u201d). We identify no such abuse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The district court precluded O\u2019Leary from testifying about his ability to access Zafar\u2019s computer network from outside his home because no evidence was adduced showing that the configuration of the network accessed by O\u2019Leary was identical to the one Zafar used at the time of the charged crimes. The district court\u2019s conclusion that, without that \u201ccritical missing link,\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s testimony was irrelevant fell well within its discretion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 403; <em>see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 595, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (noting that, in conducting Rule 403 assessment, trial judge \u201cexercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Similarly, the district court reasonably precluded O\u2019Leary from demonstrating how certain stock-selection software worked in the absence of evidence indicating that defendant had, in fact, used the software for stock trading at the time of the charged crimes. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786. The mere presence of the software on Zafar\u2019s computer and defendant\u2019s post-arrest acknowledgment of general use did not compel a different conclusion. As the district court observed, defense counsel\u2019s own proffer of this evidence indicated that its purpose was not to show the jury how the software worked but to insinuate what had happened with respect to the relevant stock trades, a subject on which O\u2019Leary was not a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">Accordingly, we conclude that no trial error warrants reversal of Zafar\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">2. <em>Sentencing Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we review sentences for \u201creasonableness,\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 262, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201ca deferential standard limited to identifying abuse of discretion,\u201d which proceeds in two steps: procedural and substantive. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 170 (2d Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). On this appeal, our focus is procedural because Zafar claims that the district court erred in calculating his Guidelines sentencing range and statutory restitution obligation. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Guang, </em>511 F.3d 110, 126 (2d Cir.2007). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings on these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>matters for clear error and its interpretations of law, including the Guidelines, <em>de novo. See United States v. Fuller, </em>426 F.3d 556, 562 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">a. <em>Mass-Marketing Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Zafar submits that the district court erred in employing a \u201cmass-marketing\u201d enhancement in calculating his Guidelines, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), because his internet activities did not amount to \u201csolicitation,\u201d <em>id. </em>cmt. 4(A) (defining mass-marketing as \u201ca plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (i) purchase goods or services; (ii) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or (iii) invest for financial profit\u201d). Zafar asserts that to engage in solicitation a defendant must offer to sell something himself. This construction is flawed in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">First, as the quoted commentary indicates, solicitations can reach beyond proffered sales to include inducements to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or financial investments. Even as to sales, nothing in the commentary requires the solicitor himself to be the seller of the proffered good or service for his pitch to constitute a solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Second, the common meaning of the word \u201csolicit\u201d is not limited to sales. Nor does it require that the solicitor be importuning something for himself directly. Rather, the word sweeps broadly to reach any conduct that petitions, urges, entices, or moves another to action, <em>see </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1427 (8th ed.1999); Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary Unabridged 2169 (3d ed.1986). <em>See generally United States v. Reaves, </em>253 F.3d 1201, 1204 (10th Cir.2001) (noting broad common meaning of solicit in declining to construe the term narrowly in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) (addressing use of computer to \u201csolicit\u201d minor\u2019s participation in sexually explicit conduct)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Third, defendant\u2019s conduct comfortably fits within this broad definition of solicitation because his internet messages did more than report materially false information about the stocks he schemed to pump and dump. One message specifically urged readers to \u201cbuy buy buy\u201d the touted stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Fourth, the fact that Zafar was urging the purchase of touted stock in the open market rather than offering it for sale himself does not absolve him of solicitation. Indeed, the \u201cpump\u201d component of his fraud scheme depended on Zafar\u2019s ability to induce a large number of persons to invest in particular publicly traded stocks. Fraud is, after all, a crime of extraordinary variety. <em>See United States v. Altman, </em>48 F.3d 96, 101-02 (2d Cir.1995). Thus, in focusing on \u201cmass-marketing\u201d as an aggravating factor for fraud, there is no reason for us to construe \u201csolicitation\u201d narrowly to apply to a defendant\u2019s efforts to induce a large number of persons to purchase from him directly but not to his efforts to induce a large number of persons to make market purchases from which the defendant may unlawfully profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Finally, the broad construction employed by the district court is consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), which references \u201cmass-marketing\u201d to indicate that, even when the exact number of fraud victims \u2014 the Guideline\u2019s primary concern\u2014 cannot be determined with certainty, evidence of marketing to a large number of potential victims is properly viewed as an aggravating factor in assessing the seriousness of the charged fraud. Consistent with this purpose, the district court correctly concluded that defendant\u2019s use of the internet to reach countless persons with materially misleading information about stocks that he then urged them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cbuy buy buy\u201d constituted mass-marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Accordingly, we identify no procedural error in this aspect of the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">b. <em>Loss Calculation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Nor do we identify procedural error in the district court\u2019s reliance on evidence of the gains realized by Zafar and a confederate in order to calculate loss pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, a factor that serves, in part, to identify the seriousness of a particular fraud. Mindful that loss cannot always be decided precisely and that a district court need only make a reasonable estimate of this Guidelines factor, <em>see United States v. Ebbers, </em>458 F.3d 110, 126 (2d Cir.2006), the commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 specifically approves the use of a defendant\u2019s gains as an alternate measure of loss, albeit \u201conly if there is a loss but it reasonably cannot be determined.\u201d See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. 3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Zafar submits that loss could have been determined in his case by looking to the injuries sustained by three individuals who, in response to a government mass mailing, identified themselves as victims of the charged scheme. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that these injuries failed accurately to reflect the true loss caused by defendant given \u201call manner of reasons\u201d why victims might not have come forward in response to the government mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">To the extent Zafar cites <em>United States v. Rutkoske, </em>506 F.3d 170, 179 (2d Cir. 2007), a case decided after his sentencing, to fault the district court for not considering whether factors other than the charged fraud might have contributed to victims\u2019 losses, we note that <em>Rutkoske\u2019s </em>reasoning applies to loss calculations based on actual victim losses, not to cases such as this one where loss cannot be determined and a court is compelled to look to defendant\u2019s gains to make a \u00a7 2B1.1 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">In any event, we can confidently conclude that Zafar was not prejudiced by the district court\u2019s use of gams to calculate loss because, as the district court noted, the estimated $900,000 gain placed Zafar at the very top end of the $400,000 to $1,000,000 range specified in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). Thus, even if this gains calculation was off the loss mark by as much as 50 percent, this would make no difference to Zafar\u2019s Guidelines calculation. Hence, we identify no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">c. <em>Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Zafar asserts that the district court erred in requiring him to make full restitution to victims without considering whether them own negligence contributed to their losses. Specifically, he points to one victim who, as the result of a negligent keystroke in a computer trade, purchased 54,000 shares of the fraudulently manipulated stock when he had intended to purchase only 5,400 shares. The argument merits little discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">The plain language of the Restitution Act mandates restitution in cases involving securities fraud, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)(A)(ii); <em>United States v. Dupes, </em>513 F.3d 338, 345 (2d Cir.2008), \u201cto each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). The Act defines a \u201cvictim\u201d as a \u201cperson directly and proximately harmed as a result of\u2019 the offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Nothing in the detailed provisions of the statute contemplates that a defendant guilty of criminal fraud can escape mandatory restitution by requiring district courts to conduct mini-trials on the possible contributory negligence of the very persons victimized by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">. Not insignificantly, the district court did allow O'Leary to offer a more general expert opinion that did not require this link, <em>i.e., </em>O'Leary testified, in general, to how access to another person\u2019s computer might be obtained from a remote location, thereby casting doubt on the government\u2019s theory that Zafar was responsible for market misinformation on the internet traceable to his computer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
