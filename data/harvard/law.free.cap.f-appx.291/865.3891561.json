We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-24\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Helal is not eligible for withholding of removal because the evidence he presented did not compel a finding of past persecution, <em>see Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1014-18 (9th Cir. 2003), and he did not \u201cdemonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.\u201d <em>Al-Harbi, </em>242 F.3d at 888 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Helal also did not demonstrate that he is eligible for protection under CAT because he did not establish that it is more likely than not he would be tortured if removed to Israel. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b889-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate lor publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
