He also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a continuance, and motions for relief from judgment under Rule 60(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, permanent injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Post Confirmation Trust and former employees of Fleming<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their requests for attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">\n<em>Willfulness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Berry failed to raise a triable issue of material fact that any copyright infringement by defendants was committed \u201cwillfully\u201d for purposes of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(c)(2). The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Fleming\u2019s former employees reasonably believed that they were acting within the scope of their agreement with Berry when they attempted to revert to the licensed version of Berry\u2019s Freight Control System (FCS). <em>See Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., </em>263 F.3d 942, 959 (9th Cir.2001). Because the district court correctly concluded that the employees did not know that their creation and use of the dual database system constituted copyright infringement, their conduct did not amount to willful infringement. <em>See Peer Int\u2019l Corp. v. Pausa Records, Inc., </em>909 F.2d 1332, 1335 n. 3 (9th Cir.1990). The district court did not err in holding that any copying by Guidance Software, Inc., or Michael Gurzi was done to preserve evidence for litigation, and is therefore \u201cfair use\u201d under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. <em>See Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Wollersheim, </em>971 F.2d 364, 367 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">\n<em>Copyright Infringement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Azs\">Berry failed to raise a triable issue of material fact that defendants\u2019 creation and use of the Excel spreadsheets infringed his copyrighted works. Berry\u2019s declarations and expert reports failed to carry his burden to identify with specificity the elements of his FCS which were protectable and copied in the Excel spreadsheets. <em>See Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., </em>35 F.3d 1435, 1443 (9th Cir.1994). Moreover, defendants\u2019 expert demonstrated that there were none. The data in FCS are not protectable, and therefore their importation into the Excel spreadsheets is not copyright infringement. <em>See Feist Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., </em>499 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>U.S. 340, 347-48, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991). While the \u201c \u2018inverse ratio rule\u2019 \u201d requires \u201ca lower standard of proof of substantial similarity when a high degree of access is shown,\u201d it does not displace a plaintiffs burden under the extrinsic test to identify protectable, copied elements of his or her work. <em>See Three Boys Music Corp. v. Bolton, </em>212 F.3d 477, 485 (9th Cir.2000) (discussing the plaintiffs initial burden under the extrinsic test). Berry\u2019s End User License Agreement with Fleming is irrelevant to whether any of his works is protected under federal copyright law. <em>See Apple Computer, </em>35 F.3d at 1442.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\n<em>Trade Secret Misappropriation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Berry failed to raise a triable issue of material fact on his trade secret misappropriation claim. Berry failed either to identify any trade secret that had been misappropriated or to adduce evidence that any of his programs derived \u201cindependent economic value ... from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from [their] disclosure or use\u201d under Hawaii Revised Statute \u00a7 482B-2. <em>See Teller v. Teller, </em>99 Hawai\u2019i 101, 53 P.3d 240, 247-48 (2002); <em>MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., </em>991 F.2d 511, 522 (9th Cir.1993). Because there was no evidentiary foundation for the trade secret misappropriation claim, the district court did not err in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing defendant on this claim. <em>See </em>Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 482B-5(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">\n<em>Rule 56(f)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berry\u2019s request for a continuance to conduct further discovery under Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Berry did not carry his burden of showing \u201cwhat specific facts [he] hoped to discover\u201d that would have supported his claims against any of the parties. <em>See Cont\u2019l Mar. of San Francisco, Inc. v. Pac. Coast Metal Trades Dist. Council, Metal Trades Dep\u2019t, </em>817 F.2d 1391,1395 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">\n<em>Rule 60(b)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berry\u2019s motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Berry failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that any of the district court\u2019s rulings resulted from Christensen\u2019s misrepresentation because the district court held that Berry\u2019s infringement claim was limited to conduct that occurred after the March 6, 2003 jury verdict. <em>See Casey v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1254, 1260 (9th Cir.2004). The question whether Christensen was president before March 2003 was not relevant to Berry\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Nor was Berry prevented from fully and fairly presenting his case. Where an alleged fraud is \u201cdiscoverable by due diligence before or during the proceedings,\u201d relief from judgment is inappropriate. <em>See id. </em>Here, Berry had evidence of the true date Christensen became president prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">\n<em>Permanent Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berry\u2019s request for a permanent injunction. The district court applied the test from <em>MAI Systems, </em>and denied injunctive relief because Berry failed to show any threat of continuing violations. <em>See </em>991 F.2d at 520. Although the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., </em>547 U.S. 388, 391-93, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006), the district court\u2019s ruling is also correct under the four-factor test set forth in that decision. Berry failed to show any threat of continuing infringement, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>monetary damages would adequately compensate any past injury. <em>See id. </em>at 392, 126 S.Ct. 1837.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">\n<em>Berry\u2019s Remaining Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Any arguments related to Berry\u2019s claims for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), violations of the Sherman Act, conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, and contributory infringement were made in passing, and are not supported by any meaningful legal argument. Accordingly, they are waived. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 997 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berry\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. \u201c[AJttorney\u2019s fees are to be awarded to prevailing parties only as a matter of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 534, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994). Contrary to Berry\u2019s argument, the district court did not automatically deny his fee request because his ultimate recovery was less than he asked for; the district court recognized that it \u201cmay\u201d consider the degree of success obtained, did so, and denied the fee request. While a .district court <em>may </em>award fees where recovery is small, <em>Wall Data Inc. v. L.A. County Sheriffs Dep't, </em>447 F.3d 769, 787 (9th Cir.2006), a district court does not abuse its discretion by not awarding them in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Regarding the cross-appeal, the district court did not apply the wrong legal test in determining that Berry was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d on his copyright infringement claim. While Berry might not have achieved the results he sought at the outset of the litigation, he was \u201cawarded some relief by the court\u201d on the single direct copyright infringement claim in his complaint. <em>See Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 603, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). Cross-appellants have not identified a case where the defendants were awarded attorneys\u2019 fees as the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for prevailing on sub-issues of a copyright infringement claim. <em>Florentine Art Studio, Inc. v. Vedet K Corp., </em>891 F.Supp. 532, 541 (C.D.Cal.1995), on which cross-appellants rely, is limited to situations \u201cwhere plaintiffs pressed on with their lawsuits despite lacking any facially legitimate claims that would have justified continuing the action.\u201d <em>Berkla v. Corel Corp., </em>302 F.3d 909, 924 n. 15 (9th Cir.2002). By contrast, Berry did not lack a legitimate claim; Fleming and its employees were ultimately held liable for copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b818-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
