He argues that, in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the district court committed procedural error in sentencing him when it refused to consider important factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) regarding his health and need for psychological treatment. He argues that the district court relied on case law of this court that likely has not survived <em>Gall </em>and that such case law had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the district court concerning the appropriate weight to give to his mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">A review of the record indicates that the district court did not refuse to consider Catalano\u2019s health conditions in sentencing him. Immediately before and after pronouncing Catalano\u2019s sentence, the district court explicitly stated that it took into account his health issues. There is no indication in the record of any chilling effect concerning the weight accorded Catalano\u2019s mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
