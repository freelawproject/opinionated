May 30, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 718 305 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-25\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions-or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Matter of J-Y-C- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ drew an adverse inference as to Zhang\u2019s credibility after observing his demeanor, noting that Zhang \u201cprovided testimony that was affected in a monotone voice and a downward stare.\u201d We accord particular deference to such assessments of an applicant\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The agency also found suspect Zhang\u2019s omission from his asylum application any description of either the specific mistreatment he endured while detained or his responsibilities on behalf of the Falun Gong movement. Although we have held that an applicant need not include every detail of his claim in his asylum application, <em>see Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir.2006), the agency did not err in relying on Zhang\u2019s omission of this information. Viewed cumulatively with the other discrepancies the agency noted, these omissions provide proper support for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Moreover, the agency found that Zhang testified inconsistently regarding the Falun Gong activity he was engaged in when a policeman spotted him, and his relationship to the individual who introduced him to Falun Gong. While Zhang argues that these inconsistencies were too minor to merit consideration, in this post-REAL ID Act case, the agency was entitled to base its credibility determination on inconsistencies without regard to whether they go to \u201cthe heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(iii). In any event, contrary to Zhang\u2019s contention, the inconsistencies the agency identified were not insignificant; they call into question the entirety of Zhang\u2019s claim that he was involved in Falun Gong. Because Zhang was properly deemed not credible, the agency did not err in finding that his failure to produce certain corroborative evidence rendered him unable to rehabilitate his testimony. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Even if the agency\u2019s remaining findings were in error, remand would not be required because we can \u201cconfidently predict\u201d that the agency would adhere to its decision on remand. <em>See id. </em>at 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Finally, because the only evidence of a threat to Zhang\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for withhold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ing of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">. Because Zhang failed to raise his illegal departure and family planning claims either before the BIA or this Court, we deem those claims abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
