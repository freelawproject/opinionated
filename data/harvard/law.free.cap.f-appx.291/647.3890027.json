(\u201cHolcim\u201d) petitions for review of the final decision of the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirming an administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision. The ALJ ordered Holcim to pay death benefits and attorney\u2019s fees to the mistress of its decedent employee because she qualified as a \u201cdependent\u201d under \u00a7 9(d) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(d). We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">Bernard Reed and Martha Reed, both Louisiana residents, were married on January 8, 1987, and lived together as husband and wife until December 1994. At that time, Mr. Reed left his wife and their shared domicile. After Mr. Reed moved out, Mrs. Reed filed for spousal support in 1995 and obtained a judgment in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans against Mr. Reed awarding Mrs. Reed alimony. Later, in 2003, Mrs. Reed obtained a judgment against Mr. Reed for back support because he had failed to make $2,265 in alimony payments. Yet, Mr. and Mrs. Reed never divorced, and neither spouse ever instituted divorce proceedings. Beginning in 2001, Mr. Reed lived with another woman, Sherrie McLaurin, in a house belonging to McLaurin\u2019s sister. They were not married and there was no legal or familial relationship between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">On September 12, 2003, Mr. Reed drowned while loading a barge on the Industrial Canal in the course of his employment with Holcim. The LHWCA provides for the payment of compensation when an employee is injured or killed while engaged in maritime employment on the navigable waters of the United States. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902, 903, 908, 909. Section 9 of the LHWCA, codified at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 909, provides the statutory criteria for awarding compensation to survivors of an employee who dies from a work-related injury. A total of 66 2/3 percent of the deceased employee\u2019s average weekly wage may be paid to survivors. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 909(b), (c). A widow, with no child of the deceased, is entitled to 50 percent of the total average weekly wage. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(b). The remainder, 16 2/3 percent, may be awarded to \u201cany [ ] persons who satisfy the definition of the term \u2018dependent\u2019 in section 152 of Title 26 [of the United States Code], but are not otherwise eligible under [\u00a7 9 of the LHWCA].\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Title 26 United States Code \u00a7 152, part of the Internal Revenue Code, provides extensive criteria for determining whether a person may qualify as a taxpayer\u2019s dependent. Under this provision, an adult who bears no legal or familial relationship to the taxpayer may be considered the taxpayer\u2019s dependent if she satisfies two requirements. First, the taxpayer must provide over half of the individual\u2019s support during the taxable year. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a) (2003) (amended in 2004 and 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the individual must have \u201cas [her] principal place of abode the home of the taxpayer and [be] a member of the taxpayer\u2019s household.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a)(9). \u201cAn individual is not a member of the taxpayer\u2019s household if at any time during the taxable year of the taxpayer, the relationship between such individual and the taxpayer is in violation of local law.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">After Mr. Reed\u2019s death, both Mrs. Reed and McLaurin claimed to be Mr. Reed\u2019s \u201cwidow\u201d and sought death benefits from his employer, Holcim, under the LHWCA. Holcim requested an informal conference to determine who was entitled to benefits. A claims examiner from the Department of Labor recommended that Holcim pay benefits to Mrs. Reed and not McLaurin. McLaurin then applied for a formal hearing, asserting that she was entitled to benefits either as Mr. Reed\u2019s widow or dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">At the hearing, McLaurin testified that, at the time of his death, Mr. Reed had been living with McLaurin for about two years. McLaurin and Mr. Reed filed separate income tax returns and Mr. Reed never declared McLaurin as a dependent, but McLaurin testified that her earnings for the year 2002 totaled $1,772, whereas Mr. Reed\u2019s income was approximately $32,000. Mr. Reed apparently paid for all of their household expenses, including rent and utilities, and automobile purchase payments. McLaurin did not have a full-time job while she lived with Mr. Reed, and testified that she relied on his support.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">On March 16, 2005, the ALJ awarded the widow\u2019s benefits (ie., 50 percent of Mr. Reed\u2019s average weekly wage) to Mrs. Reed. The ALJ also determined that McLaurin qualified as Mr. Reed\u2019s dependent and awarded McLaurin the remaining 16 2/3 percent of Mr. Reed\u2019s average weekly wage. The ALJ also awarded both Mrs. Reed and McLaurin attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Holcim appealed only the ALJ\u2019s award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>benefits and attorney\u2019s fees to McLaurin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 19, 2006, the BRB affirmed the awards. Holcim then filed this petition. Respondent Director, Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d), filed a brief in support of McLaurin.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">\u201cThis Court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review of the BRB\u2019s rulings of law, owing them no deference because the BRB is not a policy-making agency.\u201d <em>Avondale Indus., Inc. v. Alario, </em>355 F.3d 848, 851 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Pool Co. v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 173, 177 (5th Cir.2001)). But this court does afford <em>Skidmore </em>deference to the OWCP\u2019s interpretations of the LHWCA; under <em>Skidmore, </em>the amount of deference owed \u201cwill depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)). With respect to issues of fact, \u201cwe examine \u2018whether the BRB properly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pool Co., </em>274 F.3d at 178 (quoting <em>James J. Flanagan Stevedores, Inc. v. Gallagher, </em>219 F.3d 426, 429 (5th Cir. 2000)). Substantial evidence means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Holcim offers several arguments for why the BRB erred when it affirmed the ALJ\u2019s award of death benefits to McLaurin. Because we agree that McLaurin failed to establish that she continued to qualify as a dependent after Mr. Reed\u2019s death, which is a necessary condition for receipt of benefits under the LHWCA, we need not consider Holcim\u2019s alternative arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">As discussed above, the total amount payable to a deceased employee\u2019s survivors under the LHWCA is 66 2/3 percent of his average weekly wage. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 909(b), (c). It is undisputed for purposes of Holcim\u2019s petition that Mrs. Reed, as the widow of the deceased employee, is entitled to receive 50 percent of Mr. Reed\u2019s average weekly wage. The underlying issue raised by Holcim\u2019s petition is whether McLaurin is entitled to receive the remaining 16 2/3 percent of Mr. Reed\u2019s average weekly wage. Section 9(d) of the LHWCA entitles \u201cany [ ] persons who satisfy the definition of the term \u2018dependent\u2019 in section 152 of Title 26 of the United States Code\u201d to receive that portion of the deceased employee\u2019s average weekly wage <em>(i.e., </em>16 2/3 percent) \u201cduring such dependency.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 9(f) of the LHWCA pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>vides that \u201cdependency shall be determined as of the time of the injury.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(f). In other words, based on the plain language of the statute, to receive death benefits as a dependent under the LHWCA, an individual must satisfy two conditions: (1) qualify as a dependent under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 at the time of the employee\u2019s death; and (2) remain as a dependent after the employee\u2019s death. <em>See also Standard Dredging Corp. v. Henderson, </em>150 F.2d 78, 81 (5th Cir.1945) (\u201cAnd if they were dependent at Nathan\u2019s death, which is the time when dependence is to be determined, the further question arises how long such a dependency will continue, for death benefits to dependent parents continue only \u2018during such dependency.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Here, in awarding death benefits to McLaurin, the ALJ found that McLaurin qualified as Mr. Reed\u2019s dependent at the time of his death. Likewise, in reviewing the ALJ\u2019s award, the BRB concluded that McLaurin qualified as Mr. Reed\u2019s dependent at the time of his death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, neither the ALJ nor the BRB made any finding as to whether McLaurin continued to qualify as a dependent of Mr. Reed after his death. Rather, the written decisions of both the ALJ and the BRB are completely silent on this issue. Accordingly, the award must be vacated and the matter remanded for a determination whether the dependency found to exist at death has continued beyond that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Our decision is compelled by <em>Henderson, </em>which, though time-worn, has never been overruled, distinguished, or otherwise limited in any manner. In <em>Henderson, </em>this court, interpreting the same LHWCA provision at issue here, reversed an award of death benefits to a deceased employee\u2019s parents because the record failed to support the \u201cnecessary ... case of dependence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. First, the court determined that it was unclear from the record whether the parents actually depended on the decedent at the time of his death. <em>Id. </em>at 81. Second, and more significantly for our case, the court found that the ALJ erred by failing to inquire into \u201chow long [the parents\u2019] dependency will continue, for death benefits to dependent parents continue only \u2018during such dependency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Citing earlier versions of both \u00a7 9(b) and \u00a7 9(d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court explained that \u201cdependency is twice made the condition of an award, and in both cases the payments end with the dependency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">Subsection (f) declares that all questions of dependency shall be determined as of the time of the injury, but this refers to the dependency which generates the original right to an award. It does not annul the quoted provisions which cause payments to cease by cessation of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>pendency. <em>The latter could not possibly be determined at the time of the injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKs\"><em>Id. </em>at 81-82 (emphasis added). Thus, the court concluded that \u201cregularity requires that the award follow the statute in awarding compensation \u2018during such dependency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82. Because the record in <em>Henderson </em>included no findings as to \u201cwhether or not the dependency found to exist at death continued beyond the time of the award,\u201d the court held that \u201cthe award ought to be set aside, but without prejudice to a further hearing and the making of such findings and such an award as may appear proper.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The OWCP concedes in its brief that \u00a7 9(d) has a prospective element, in that it entitles a dependent to continued compensation only \u201cduring such dependency.\u201d It also concedes that, under <em>Henderson, </em>\u201ca claimant must remain dependent to continue receiving compensation.\u201d Moreover, the OWCP does not dispute that the ALJ made no findings regarding McLaurin\u2019s earnings after Mr. Reed\u2019s death or, more generally, whether McLaurin continued to remain dependent on Mr. Reed after his death. The OWCP nevertheless contends that Holcim\u2019s only recourse to challenge McLaurin\u2019s continued dependency on the death benefits is to file a petition to modify the ALJ\u2019s order under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, which permits modification of compensation under the LHWCA based on \u201ca change in conditions.\u201d Its argument is essentially that the ALJ was only required to conclude that McLaurin depended on Mr. Reed at the time of his death in order to properly award her benefits under \u00a7 9(d). While ordinarily, as discussed above, the OWCP\u2019s interpretation of the LHWCA is entitled to some level of deference under <em>Skidmore, </em>we need not accord any deference to a litigation position that is \u201cwholly unsupported by regulations, rulings, or administrative practice.\u201d <em>Total Marine Servs., Inc. v. Dir. OWCP, </em>87 F.3d 774, 777 n. 2 (5th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Smiley v. Citibank (S.D.), N .A., </em>517 U.S. 735, 741, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the OWCP provides no such support for its construction of the statute; rather, it summarily concludes that, despite the prospective element of \u00a7 9(d), the proper method for contesting a death benefits award that featured no finding of continued dependency is through an <em>ex post </em>petition to modify under \u00a7 22 of the LHWCA. Tellingly, the OWCP does not even argue in its brief for <em>Skidmore-ievel </em>deference to its interpretation. In sum, we refuse to countenance the OWCP\u2019s wholly unsupported position on this issue, particularly when it is so clearly contradicted by this court\u2019s holding in <em>Henderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Accordingly, we remand to the ALJ for factfinding and a determination in the first instance as to whether the award of benefits to McLaurin comports with \u00a7 9(d)\u2019s plain requirement that a claimant collect benefits only \u201cduring such dependency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except trader the limited circumstances set forth in 5ti-i Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-5\">. This provision also specifically authorizes compensation to dependent grandchildren, brothers, sisters, parents and grandparents of the deceased worker. No such individual has made a claim for compensation in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\">. We look to the 2003 version of the Internal Revenue Code because \u201d[a]ll questions of dependency shall be determined as of the time of the injury,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(0, meaning in this case Mr. Reed\u2019s death in September 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-12\">. The BRB subsequently reversed Mrs. Reed's attorney's fee award. That determination is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\">. Holcim never disputed that Mrs. Reed was entitled to the 50 percent as Mr. Reed's widow, and thus that award was not appealed to the BRB and is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. Section 9(d) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">If there be no surviving wife or husband or child, or if the amount payable to a surviving wife or husband and to children shall be less in the aggregate than 66 2/3 per centum of the average wages of the deceased; then for the support of grandchildren or brothers and sisters, if dependent upon the deceased at the time of the injury, and <em>any other persons who satisfy the definition of the term \"dependent\" in section 152 of Title 26, but are not otherwise eligible under this section, 20 </em>per centum of such wages for the support of each such person <em>during such dependency </em>and for the support of each parent, or grandparent, of the deceased if dependent upon him at the time of the injury, 25 per centum of such wages during such dependency. <em>But in no case shall the aggregate amount payable under this subsection exceed the difference between </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>66 </em>2/3 <em>per centum of such wages and the amount payable as hereinbefore provided to widow or widower and for the support of surviving child or children.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">. Holcim also challenges this aspect of the BRB's decision. More specifically, Holcim contends that McLaurin did not qualify as a dependent at the time of Mr. Reed's death because, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(b)(5), their adulterous relationship was \"in violation of local law.\u201d Holcim also argues that the ALJ's finding that McLaurin qualified as Mr. Reed\u2019s dependent at the time of his death was not supported by sufficient evidence and that the ALJ erroneously concluded that McLaurin was a member of Mr. Reed\u2019s household at the time of his death. For the purposes of our limited ruling here, we need not resolve these issues, and instead assume, without deciding, that McLaurin in fact qualified as Mr. Reed\u2019s dependent at the time of his death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b675-13\">. The then-applicable version of \u00a7 9(b) is materially different from the current version of that provision, but the version of \u00a7 9(d), for purposes of this petition, is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
