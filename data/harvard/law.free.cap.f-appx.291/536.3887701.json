Kirlew claims the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence recovered from the car he was driving prior to his arrest, asserting that police lacked probable cause to search the locked trunk. Kirlew also contends the district court violated his constitutional right to present a defense by denying his request to call a witness to provide exculpatory testimony. Finally, Kirlew claims his 156-month sentence was unreasonable, as the district court erroneously imposed an upward variance from the sentencing guidelines range based on factors that were already taken into consideration. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In denying Kirlew\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court concluded that \u201ca search incident to arrest in this case would be justified, but even if that argument were not sufficient, I think the abandonment theory ... and inevitable discovery, I think there are three powerful arguments ... any one of which would be sufficient.\u201d Kirlew contends the search of his vehicle was not incident to his arrest because the car was outside the area of his immediate control at the time police placed him under arrest. Kirlew asserts that even if this exception applied, only the passenger compartment could have been searched, as the police lacked probable cause to open the trunk of the car. On appeal, we review legal conclusions underlying the denial of a motion to suppress de novo, and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 429 (4th Cir.2006). The evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the Government, the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">While Kirlew contends the police lacked probable cause to search the trunk, he fails to address the preliminary issue of whether he maintained any privacy interest in the car after jumping out of the vehicle and leaving it in the middle of a public street. The Fourth Amendment protects property for which an individual maintains a \u201csubjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.\u201d <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 33, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001). A person who voluntarily abandons his property \u201closes any reasonable expectation of privacy in the property and is consequently precluded from seeking to suppress evidence seized from the property.\u201d <em>United States v. Leshuk, </em>65 F.3d 1105, 1111 (4th Cir.1995). In determining whether property has been abandoned, we must consider \u201c \u2018not whether all formal property rights have been relinquished, but whether the complaining party retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in the [property] alleged to be abandoned.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Haynie, </em>637 F.2d 227, 237 (4th Cir.1980)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">After being pursued by police during a dangerous high-speed chase, Kirlew jumped out of the still-moving vehicle and fled on foot, as the car drifted down the road into oncoming traffic before coming to a stop on the median. During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Kirlew contended . these actions did not qualify as abandonment because he intended to flee from the police, not to relinquish all rights to the vehicle. However, abandonment may be found where a fleeing defendant \u201crelinquishes an object to make his flight easier.\u201d <em>United States v. Basinski, </em>226 F.3d 829, 837 (7th Cir.2000). Furthermore, the fact that Kirlew vacated his car in an effort to evade capture by the police does not make his abandonment of the vehicle involuntary. <em>See United States v. Flynn, </em>309 F.3d 736, 738 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">While Kirlew maintained he had a privacy interest in the contents of the car,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy in his automobile is less than in other property, particularly when the vehicle is left in the street or another public area. <em>See United States v. Beilina, </em>665 F.2d 1335, 1340-41 (4th Cir.1981). In this case, the vehicle was found resting on the median of the street, over 100 yards from where Kirlew jumped out. When the detective opened the unlocked driver\u2019s side door, he noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the car was still in drive and the engine was still running. Accordingly, we find that Kirlew\u2019s actions indicate an absence of any reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the vehicle. <em>See United States v. Tate, </em>821 F.2d 1328, 1330 (8th Cir.1987) (citing <em>United States v. Walton, </em>538 F.2d 1348, 1354 (8th Cir.1976)); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>441 F.2d 749, 751 (5th Cir.1971). Because Kirlew abandoned his vehicle, the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Kirlew next contends the district court erred by excluding Edward Orenge as a witness, thereby violating Kirlew\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel and to present a defense. According to Kirlew\u2019s proffer, Orenge would have testified that Melanie Fetters, Kirlew\u2019s girlfriend, purchased two weapons from him during the relevant time period. Kirlew contends this testimony would have rebutted Kristian Coffey\u2019s statement that she saw Brandi Cockrell go into a gun store and, using a receipt and identification belonging to Fetters,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> return with a firearm that she gave to Kirlew. Kirlew claims this evidence was material because it would cast doubt on whether Coffey saw Kirlew in possession of the specific firearm charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">A district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Iskander, </em>407 F.3d 232, 236 (4th Cir.2005). The relevant inquiry is whether the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion was arbitrary or irrational. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a), evidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error review. <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Despite Kirlew\u2019s claims, the district court correctly held that Orenge\u2019s testimony had little relevance to the case, as the testimony failed to address whether Kirlew exercised dominion or control over the 9 millimeter handgun charged in the indictment. While Kirlew asserts that Coffey may have seen him in possession of a different firearm than the one charged in the indictment, this issue was adequately addressed during Coffey\u2019s testimony, as Coffey conceded she did not remember any specific features of the gun, only that it was \u201csmall\u201d and \u201cblack.\u201d Because Coffey could not state with any degree of certainty that Kirlew had possessed the same firearm charged in the indictment, further testimony about the possibility of a second firearm would have been of little consequence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401 (defining \u201crelevant evidence\u201d); <em>United States v. Prince-Oyibo, </em>320 F.3d 494, 501 (4th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Furthermore, Orenge\u2019s testimony would have opened the door to additional inquiries regarding other firearms purchased or possessed by Fetters. However, the district court had previously granted Kirlew\u2019s request to exclude evidence regarding another firearm that was recovered by police during a search of Fetters\u2019 residence. By excluding Orenge\u2019s testimony, the district court maintained a consistent position in regard to evidence of firearms that were not identified in the indictment. Had Kirlew been allowed to \u201copen the door\u201d on this matter, the Government might have been permitted to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence in order to explain or refute Orenge\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281, 329-30 (4th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court properly exercised its discretion by preventing the introduction of irrelevant and possibly prejudicial evidence. Even as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>suming the district court erred in excluding Orenge\u2019s testimony, Kirlew has failed to demonstrate this ruling prejudiced his defense, as his claim that Fetters purchased two firearms does little to address the strength of the Government\u2019s independent evidence demonstrating that he was in possession of the handgun charged in the indictment. Therefore, Kirlew\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Kirlew\u2019s final claim is that his 156-month sentence is unreasonable. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. First, it must calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range. It must then consider the resulting range in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008) and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.\u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). This court \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">If there are no procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While this court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, we may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we must give deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify imposing a variant sentence and to its determination regarding the extent of any variance. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74. \u201cEven if we would have reached a different sentencing result on our own, this fact alone is \u2018insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Kirlew does not claim his sentence was procedurally unreasonable; rather, he asserts his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to identify any factors justifying the considerable upward variance imposed. However, Kirlew has failed to demonstrate the district court abused its discretion in determining the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a 156-month sentence and justified a 41-month deviation from the Guidelines range, as the court identified valid reasons for the divergence. <em>See Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473-74. While Kirlew contends the district court improperly \u201cre-counted\u201d his criminal history and the nature of the offense, \u00a7 3553(a)(1) directs the court to consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d The district court noted that Kirlew\u2019s possession of body armor and a handgun indicated he was \u201cexpecting to potentially be involved in a shootout,\u201d and that the \u201cdangerous\u201d nature of the offense constituted an aggravating factor. Furthermore, the district court properly accounted for Kirlew\u2019s lengthy criminal history, noting he had \u201calmost a lifetime career of criminal activity\u201d and that his juvenile record \u201cliterally had to [be] [brought] out in a cart.\u201d The district court also found that Kirlew had exhibited a \u201cpropensity\u201d for illegal activity and that there was a likelihood of future dangerous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ness, as Kirlew committed the subject offenses only two months after being released from prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Kirlew contends the district court erred by considering his lack of remorse because he pled not guilty to the charges. However, the district court\u2019s consideration of this factor was appropriate in light of Kirlew\u2019s allocution at sentencing, in which he demonstrated a complete lack of contrition, downplayed his criminal history, and failed to accept the dangerous nature of his actions, claiming that his crime was simply \u201cone possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\u201d Following Kirlew\u2019s statements, the district court was well within its discretion to impose a higher sentence in order to properly reflect the seriousness of the offense and promote respect for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Finally, while Kirlew claims there was little consideration given to his need for mental health treatment, the district court clearly evaluated this matter at sentencing, as the court required Kirlew to receive mental health counseling and recommended that he be designated to a facility where he could obtain \u201cextensive mental health treatment.\u201d <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006) (district court\u2019s explanation for sentence should indicate consideration of arguments raised by both parties). Therefore, Kirlew has failed to demonstrate his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Kirlew\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\">. While Kirlew was driving the car in question, he was not the owner of the vehicle. <em>See Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d at 546 (in making abandonment determination, \u201cit is still relevant to consider a defendant\u2019s property interest\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">.
