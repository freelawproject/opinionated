Shortly after 9 p.m., they observed a black 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe without a registration sticker, in violation of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1332(b). After the officers ordered the vehicle to stop, Officer Williams approached the driver side while Officer Younger approached the front passenger side where Broadus was sitting. Younger noticed that Broadus was continuously leaning to his left and pressing his elbow against his left side when Younger opened the passenger door to illuminate the inside of the car. According to Younger, Broadus acted nervously and repeatedly stated, \u201c[everything's cool, it\u2019s all cool.\u201d SuppApp. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Broadus tried to step out of the car, but was told by Officer Younger to \u201crelax.\u201d SuppApp. at 19. Younger directed Broadus to put down a box of Chinese food he was holding and to keep his hands in view. When Broadus leaned down to put the food on the floor of the car, Younger touched Broadus\u2019 chest and felt his heart \u201cpounding hard.\u201d SuppApp. at 20. The left part of Broadus\u2019 body was turned away from Younger, and his left elbow and hand remained pressed to his left side.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">\u201cFearing [Broadus] might be concealing a firearm,\u201d Officer Younger conducted a safety frisk by reaching into the vehicle and touching Broadus\u2019 left waist and hip area. SuppApp. at 20. Younger felt the handle of a handgun, and so alerted Officer Williams through the use of a code word. Williams then drew his gun as Younger handcuffed Broadus inside the car for safety reasons. Younger then recovered a loaded Ruger .357 Magnum revolver from Broadus\u2019 waistband. Broadus told Younger that he did not have a permit to carry the gun, but asked Younger to \u201cgive [him] a break\u201d because he was taking the gun to a relative who owned a bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SuppApp. at 23. Broadus was then placed under arrest, and was later charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Broadus pled not guilty, and his appointed counsel filed a motion to suppress evidence on June 2, 2004. The District Court denied the motion after holding a hearing, finding that Officer Younger\u2019s pat-down of Broadus for weapons was reasonable under <em>Temj v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Prior to closing arguments at the end of a two-day trial, Broadus\u2019 counsel informed the District Court that he was not requesting an innocent possession jury charge because \u201c[i]t would be inconsistent with\u201d the defense theory that Broadus did not possess the gun.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SuppApp. at 113-14. Broadus\u2019 counsel changed his mind after the government\u2019s rebuttal argument which referred to Broadus\u2019 comment that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>taking the gun to his cousin, but the District Court denied the request for an innocent possession instruction. The Court also denied the jurors\u2019 request during their deliberations for a written copy of the knowing possession charge, instead rereading those instructions orally. Broadus\u2019 counsel again renewed his admittedly \u201cvery belated request\u201d for an innocent possession charge, which the Court again denied. Supp.App. at 154. The jury found Broadus guilty of the \u00a7 922(g) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Broadus filed timely post-verdict motions, which were denied, and he was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release. Broadus timely appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">A. <em>Terry Weapons Frisk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We review the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying factual findings and we exercise plenary review over the Court\u2019s application of the law to those facts. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 336 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d under the Fourth Amendment is that \u201cwarrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable.... \u201d <em>Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 133, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990). However, the Supreme Court has recognized a number of exceptions to this rule; the one relevant to this case is the <em>Terry </em>\u201cstop and frisk.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ubiles, </em>224 F.3d 213, 217 (3d Cir.2000). In <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, the Supreme Court held that a police officer may conduct a reasonable search for weapons for his/her own protection without violating the Fourth Amendment \u201cwhere [s/he] has reason to believe that [s/he] is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual.... The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent [person] in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that [his/her] safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d To make a showing of reasonable suspicion, \u201c[t]he officer must be able to articulate more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019....\u201d <em>Ubiles, </em>224 F.3d at 217 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Reviewing courts must make the reasonable-suspicion determination based on the totality of circumstances. <em>See United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Athough Broadus\u2019 nervousness was not alone enough to support the inference that he was concealing a weapon, <em>see United States v. McKoy, </em>428 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir.2005), the circumstances in this case are closer to our decision in <em>United States v. Moorefield, </em>111 F.3d 10, 11-12, 14 (3d Cir.1997), where we reversed the district court\u2019s suppression of the firearm seized from the defendant, who was a passenger in a car subject to a lawful traffic stop. We held that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfurtive hand movements and refusal to obey the officers\u2019 orders,\u201d specifically the order to remain in the car with his hands in view, as well as the fact that the defendant leaned back and appeared to shove something toward his waist, constituted suspicious behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 14. Indeed, \u201cMoorefield\u2019s behavior embodied the kind of specific, articulable facts that <em>Terry </em>contemplates and, therefore, warranted a pat-down search for weapons.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">We dispose of this case similarly. Pursuant to a lawful traffic stop, Officer Younger \u201clawfully ordered [Broadus] to remain in the car with his hands in [view].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. The pat-down for weapons was also lawful because Officer Younger \u201cpointed to \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\u2019 reasonably warranted the pat-down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868). Broadus acted nervously, his heart was pounding, he attempted to get out of the car, and he repeatedly stated that \u201ceverything\u2019s cool.\u201d Supp.App. at 19. Although nervousness standing alone does not justify a <em>Terry </em>frisk, \u201csuch behavior may be considered as a factor in the totality of circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>188 F.3d 860, 865 (7th Cir.1999). The totality of the circumstances also included Broadus continually moving his left arm and hand to his left side, almost preventing Younger from seeing his left hand even though Younger had asked him to keep his hands in view. Furthermore, the traffic stop took place in a high crime neighborhood, which is a relevant, although not by itself sufficient, factor in the <em>Terry </em>analysis. <em>See Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000). Because an \u201cofficer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger,\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, Officer Younger\u2019s pat-down search of Broadus was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">B. <em>Innocent Possession Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnD\">We review the District Court\u2019s refusal to give certain jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gov\u2019t of V.I. v. Isaac, </em>50 F.3d 1175, 1180 (3d Cir.1995). \u201cAs a general proposition, \u2018a defendant is entitled to an instruction as to any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in his favor,\u2019 \u201d even when the defenses are contradictory. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988)). However, the District Court\u2019s failure to instruct on innocent possession \u201cwill be upheld if there was no basis in the evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found that defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Although the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has adopted the innocent possession defense to a felon-in-possession charge, <em>see United States v. Mason,, </em>233 F.3d 619 (D.C.Cir.2001), this court has not done so. In any event, even if we followed <em>Mason, </em>Broadus cannot establish that he fits within that holding. In <em>Mason, </em>the court held that a narrow innocent possession defense may apply where \u201c(1) the firearm was attained innocently and held with no illicit purpose and (2) possession of the firearm was transitory....\u201d 233 F.3d at 624. In order to satisfy the second element, \u201c \u2018a defendant\u2019s actions must demonstrate both that he had the intent to turn the weapon over to the police and that he was pursuing such an intent with immediacy and through a reasonable course of conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Only when both of these requirements are met is possession \u201c \u2018excused and justified as stemming from an affirmative effort to aid and enhance social policy underlying law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">As the District Court noted, Broadus primarily relies on his statement to Officer Younger that the gun was his cousin\u2019s and he was returning it to him at the bar as sufficient evidence to entitle him to an innocent possession jury instruction. Under <em>Mason, </em>the innocent possession defense applies only to a defendant whose actions show that s/he intended to return the firearm to the police, not to another citizen; here, nothing in the record shows that Broadus intended to turn the gun over to the police or \u201c \u2018that he was pursuing such an intent with immediacy and through a reasonable course of conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Hendricks, </em>319 F.3d 993, 1007-08 (7th Cir.2003). Broadus had the opportunity to promptly notify Officer Younger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the weapon when Younger approached the car, but he failed to do so. In fact, the evidence indicates that Broadus tried to prevent Younger from finding the gun by constantly leaning to his left and pressing his elbow against his left side. Thus, \u201c[without any evidentiary support that [Broadus] took appropriate action to turn the weapon over to the police, the [District [C]ourt properly refused [Broadus\u2019] request to give the \u2018innocent possession\u2019 instruction.\u201d <em>Hendricks, </em>319 F.3d at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">. The gun was lawfully owned by Broadus\u2019 cousin, Fred Broadus, who had a valid license for it. At trial, Fred Broadus testified that he was a bar owner who on the night in question was having a party at his bar and unintentionally left his gun in the car when he was dropped off at the bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\">. The original indictment charged Broadus with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). A second superseding indictment contained the same \u00a7 922(g) charge and added additional factors relating to sentencing enhancements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-14\">. The defense theory at trial was that Broadus should not have been arrested because the gun was found between the vehicle's center console and the passenger seat rather than in Broadus' waistband.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
