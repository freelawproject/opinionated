Aug. 3, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-22\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Islam\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). It is beyond dispute that Islam\u2019s April 2007 motion to reopen was filed well beyond ninety days after October 26, 2005, when the IJ\u2019s June 29, 2005 order granting voluntary departure converted into a final order of removal. The BIA also properly found that Islam did not meet an exception to the time and numerical limitations applicable to such motions because he \u201cfailed to show changed country conditions or circumstances in Bangladesh that are material to his claim.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In this regard, the BIA found that \u201cthe 2005 Country Report does not indicate that conditions for members of the Jatiya Party have worsened since June 29, 2005.\u201d Indeed, while the 2005 Country Report indicates that Jatiya Party chairman Hossain Muhammed Ershad was arrested on politically motivated charges, it also indicates that the Bangladesh National Party (\u201cBNP\u201d) formed a four-party coalition with the Jatiya party. The 2005 Country Report contained no other relevant information regarding the treatment of Jatiya party members.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Nor did the BIA err in finding that the news articles Islam submitted did not indicate that conditions had worsened for members of the Jatiya Party, or for Islam in particular.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this respect, the BIA observed that \u201c[m]ost of the problems evidenced in the articles involve conflict between the BNP and the [Awami League], not persecution of members of the Jatiya Party.\u201d Absent any argument from Islam as to how the BIA erred in analyzing these articles, we find no abuse of discretion in its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Furthermore, Islam argues he was denied due process because the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen \u201cresulted in the premature termination of his application for asylum.\u201d This argument is without merit. To establish a violation of due process, Islam must show that he was denied \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d or an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir.2007). Here, Islam had an opportunity to present his application for asylum before an IJ, but chose to withdraw that application and accept voluntary departure. Upon failing to comply with the voluntary departure order, the IJ\u2019s removal order became final and Islam was required to file a motion to reopen to seek any new relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)\u00ae. He did so, and the BIA properly denied that motion. As such, Islam can show no due process violation. <em>Cf. Burger, </em>498 F.3d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. The government argues that Islam has waived any challenge to the BIA's finding regarding changed country conditions. We conclude that he has not done so. <em>Cf. Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, 426 </em>F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\">. Indeed, as the BIA found, some of the articles predated the IJ's June 2005 order and thus were not new or previously unavailable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
