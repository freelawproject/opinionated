Whitaker contends that his former employer, Electronic Data, retaliated against him for asserting his rights under the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601, <em>et seq., </em>interfered with his rights under the FMLA, and discriminated against him. in violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 344.040.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-23\">After carefully reviewing the record, the applicable law, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we are convinced that the district court did not err. The opinion issued by the district court correctly sets forth the law governing the issues raised in this case. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment for the reasons set forth in the thorough opinion of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
