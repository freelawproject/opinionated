Stringer appeals her 48-month sentence for conspiracy, exportation, and theft charges. First, because the record does not indicate that the district court believed that it lacked the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>depart downward, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Stringer\u2019s request for a downward departure. Second, because Stringer has cited no authority for her assertion, made for the first time on appeal, that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2 is unconstitutional, the district court did not commit plain error in failing to so hold. Third, because Stringer was an equal partner with her codefendant, the district court did not clearly err in denying her request for a mitigating-role reduction. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">According to the presentence investigation report (PSI), Stringer pled guilty to Counts 1, 13, and 14 of a 21-count superseding indictment, under which she faced 18 counts. Count 1 charged conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, Count 13 charged exportation of stolen property, in violation of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778(b)(2), and Count 14 charged theft of government property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 641, 2. Her son, Leonard Schenk, was indicted on all 21 counts, which included additional counts related to his solicitation to commit murder of a government witness. The counts arose out of a conspiracy in which: (1) Schenk, a staff sergeant in the Air Force Reserves, would steal various pieces of military equipment, including night vision goggles containing components constituting \u201cdefense articles\u201d under the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2751; and (2) Stringer would travel to the base to pick up the equipment from Schenk, sell it over the internet using her PayPal, eBay, bank, and email accounts, mail it to customers in New Zealand, Germany, and Belgium, and receive payments, sharing in the proceeds of the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The presentence investigation report (PSI) assigned a base offense level of 26, which was reduced by 3 levels, yielding a total offense level of 23. With a criminal history category of I, Stringer\u2019s guideline range was 46 to 57 months of imprisonment. Stringer requested a mitigating-role reduction, arguing that, while she allowed her accounts to be used, helped place a few orders, and shipped several packages, her overall role was not significant. Stringer also argued that, based on the nature of the stolen items and the fact that they were sold to individuals in countries friendly to the United States, she was eligible for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2, and she suggested that an offense level of 14, applicable for certain types of firearms, would be more appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">At sentencing, when asked whether she had anything else to argue, Stringer\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cnot as to objectionfs],\u201d but he noted that \u00a7 2M5.2 assumed that the conduct was harmful and provided for a downward departure in the unusual case where the conduct posed no risk of harm to a security or foreign policy interest of the United States. R4 at 3. He asserted that Stringer was a civilian who was unaware of the nature of the equipment stolen, and who suffered from health and emotional problems. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Accordingly, counsel argued that an offense level of 26 was \u201cprobably unwarranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Stringer stated that she never knew that Schenk was \u201cstealing stuff\u2019 or doing anything illegal, or that the equipment that she mailed could hurt anyone, and she never \u201cdid anything bad,\u201d which the district court stated was inconsistent with a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. Stringer replied that she mailed \u201cstuff\u2019 for Schenk, and allowed him to use her bank account and her name to set up a PayPal account, for which she took responsibility. <em>Id. </em>The government introduced evidence, including emails by Stringer, in which she discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>with Schenk and customers the specifics of sales. It contended that Stringer\u2019s claims that she was an ignorant participant were belied by the facts, asserting that she was, in fact, an equal partner in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The court stated that her emails countered her claims of ignorance. The court found the PSI to be accurate and imposed 48 months of imprisonment. It found that Stringer was a full participant, who knew that the equipment was stolen from the Air Force, the equipment was critical to the security of the armed forces, and its sale on eBay, in which she fully participated, put those forces in jeopardy. The parties affirmed that they had no objections to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact or conclusions of law as to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On appeal, Stringer argues that the district court erred by not granting her request for a downward departure under application note 1 of \u00a7 2M5.2. The government asserts that the district court believed that it had the authority to grant a downward departure, and, thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure unless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked authority to grant the departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006). A statement by the district court that it does or does not have authority to depart is not required; \u201cwhen nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume the sentencing court understood it had the authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). Section 2M5.2, the guideline provision concerning exportation of military equipment that was used to determine Stringer\u2019s sentence, provides for a base offense level of 26, and application note 1 explains that this level \u201cassumes that the offense conduct was harmful or had the potential to be harmful to a security or foreign policy interest of the United States,\u201d and suggests that \u201c[i]n the unusual case where the offense conduct posed no such risk, a downward departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2 &amp; comment, (n.l). There is no indication in the record that the district court believed that it lacked authority to grant Stringer\u2019s request for a downward departure under 2M5.2. Thus, we conclude that the district court believed that it had the authority to depait and, accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of the departure request. <em>See Dudley, </em>463 F.3d at 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Stringer also argues, for the first time on appeal, that application note 1 to \u00a7 2M5.2 unconstitutionally shifts the burden of proof to the defendant because the base offense level for the provision assumes that the conduct was harmful to the interests of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">We review constitutional objections not raised before the district court only for plain error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Under this standard, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1019. If these three conditions are met, we may notice the error only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWhen neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Because Stringer cites no authority\u2014 and our search reveals none \u2014 for her contention that \u00a7 2M5.2 impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant, she has failed to demonstrate any error that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>was obvious or clear under current law. <em>See Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. Accordingly, she has not demonstrated plain error, and we reject her constitutional challenge to \u00a7 2M5.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Finally, Stringer asserts that she should have been granted a mitigating-role reduction because Schenk stole the equipment, found people who could assemble it, and \u201cset up the internet websites,\u201d while she only shipped a few of the items to Australia and New Zealand, allowed her name and bank accounts to be used for payment, and undertook \u201csome brief internet correspondence with a customer.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">A court\u2019s finding regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). Because Stringer clearly requested a mitigating-role reduction in her objections to the PSI, we review the district court\u2019s denial for clear error, rather than plain error, as requested by the government. \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant may receive a four-level or two-level reduction in his base offense level where his role in the offense was minimal or minor, respectively. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court\u2019s ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense should be informed by \u201cthe defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which she has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, her role as compared to that of other participants in her relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cIn making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings ... [and, s]o long as the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any <em>disputed </em>factual issues, a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The record indicates that Stringer had full knowledge and was an equal partner with Schenk in the conspiracy. She traveled to the base to receive the equipment from Schenk, used her email, PayPal, eBay, and bank accounts to conduct the transactions, and personally corresponded with and shipped the equipment to individuals in foreign countries. In light of her intimate and complete knowledge of, and participation in, the criminal scheme, the district court did not clearly err in denying her mitigating-role request.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we find no error on the part of the sentencing court and AFFIRM Stringer\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"APz\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
