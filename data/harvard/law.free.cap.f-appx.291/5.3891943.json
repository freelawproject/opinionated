Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Jamel Abidi, a native and citizen of Tunisia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny the petition in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-19\">(1) Abidi claims that the Immigration Judge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> erred when he determined that Abidi had not filed a timely application for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). We disagree. The record demonstrates that Abidi\u2019s filing was not within the required one-year period and that the lateness was not excused by changed or extraordinary circumstances. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 656-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-20\">(2) Abidi also attacks the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Again, we disagree. On this record, the IJ could properly determine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Abidi did not show that any harm he suffered was because of his membership in a protected group.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The IJ could also properly determine that Abidi did not show that he actually suffered persecution at the hands of the Tunisian government or at the hands of a group that the government could not or would not control. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-21\">(3) We lack jurisdiction over Abidi\u2019s CAT claim because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies by raising it before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">(4) We reject Abidi\u2019s claim that the BIA erroneously denied his motion to reopen. That motion was filed more than ninety days after the entry of the removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). We recognize that tolling of the ninety-day period is possible, but here, even with tolling, the motion came too late \u2014 it was more than ninety days after he knew, or should have known, of the alleged error by his former counsel. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (meeting with new counsel starts time); <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.2003) (same); <em>see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1194-97 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (receipt of information from agency starts time).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">(5) Finally, we reject Abidi\u2019s claim that the BIA erroneously denied his motion for reconsideration. A motion for reconsideration requires the moving party to identify legal or factual errors in the BIA\u2019s prior decision based upon the record before it at the time it made that decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Plasencia-Ayala v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 738, 745 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Ma v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 553, 558 (9th Cir. 2004). It is not a vehicle for introducing new evidence. But that is how Abidi sought to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Petition No. 04-71145 DISMISSED as to CAT and otherwise DENIED.
