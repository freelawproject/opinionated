Aug. 31, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A78 853 791 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Oct. 5, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">As an initial matter, although Liang challenges the denial of relief in \u201casylum-only\u201d proceedings, as opposed to an actual removal order, this Court nonetheless has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2006). When, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">I. Denial of Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>er, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found that Liang\u2019s testimony regarding her plans to learn Falun Gong was evasive and non-responsive. We afford such assessments of demeanor particular deference. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, although Liang testified that the police have been coming to her home every three to six months to look for her since she left China, that assertion is omitted from her affidavit and from her father\u2019s letter, as the IJ observed. Those omissions are substantial, because if that testimony were true, it would have substantiated Liang\u2019s alleged well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s findings support the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The IJ also properly based the credibility determination on a finding that portions of Liang\u2019s testimony were implausible. An IJ may rely partly or entirely on implausibilities in an applicant\u2019s account to determine that the manner in which her testimony \u201changs together with other evidence\u201d is not credible. <em>Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 82-83 (2d Cir.2008) <em>(quoting Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-07 (2d Cir.2006)). The IJ cited several implausible features of Liang\u2019s testimony: (1) although she was aware that the Chinese government had cracked down on Falun Gong, she did not consider it important when she decided to distribute flyers for her friend; (2) Liang\u2019s friend would have put her \u201cin harm\u2019s way just to propagandize about the benefits of Falun Gong without telling [her] that it\u2019s literally a risk to [her] life to do so\u201d; (3) while she distributed flyers on three separate occasions, no one expressed any concern about being given illicit material; and (4) while the practice of Falun Gong was very important to her, she had not made any efforts to learn the practice in the United States. Viewing Liang\u2019s story as a whole, we are not compelled to conclude that the IJ erred in finding her narrative implausible. <em>See Ying Li, </em>529 F.3d at 82-83; <em>Liang Chen, </em>454 F.3d at 106-07. Accordingly, the IJ properly denied Liang\u2019s application for asylum. Moreover, the adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes success on the claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief, where all three claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">II. Motion to Remand Based on 2 U.S.Born Children</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 157 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The BIA properly denied Liang\u2019s motion to remand, because Liang\u2019s evidence did not establish that she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on the birth of her second child. Liang submitted a document titled the Fujian Province Family Planning Committee\u2019s Administrative Decision, which states that Chinese nationals who have not established foreign permanent or long-term residence abroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>would be \u201csanctioned\u201d upon return to China if they had \u201cengagefd] in reproductive behavior abroad which violate[s] the local family planning policy in their resident area\u201d; however, as the BIA observed, the document does not specify what kinds of sanctions would be imposed on those persons. Liang also argues that the BIA ignored evidence, such as a portion of the Fujian Province Government\u2019s Family Policy Practice Manual. However, we will presume that the BIA considered the evidence submitted with a motion. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Liang further argues that remand is required pursuant to this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir.2006), and <em>Tian Ming Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>473 F.3d 48 (2d Cir.2007). As the Government argues, however, we will not remand a case for the BIA to consider evidence that was not in the record before it. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir.2007). Here, only one of the three <em>\u201cShou Yung Guo </em>documents\u201d \u2014 the Fujian Province Administrative Decision \u2014 is in the record, and the BIA properly evaluated that document with the other record evidence to conclude that Liang failed to establish a well-founded fear of forced sterilization upon return to China. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Matter of T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 169 (BIA 2007). Liang\u2019s reliance on <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>and <em>Tian Ming Lin </em>is thus misplaced. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni, </em>494 F.3d at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
