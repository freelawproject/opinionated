His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Simpson v. State, </em>119 S.W.3d 262 (Tex.Crim.App.2003), <em>cert denied, </em>542 U.S. 905, 124 S.Ct. 2837, 159 L.Ed.2d 270 (2004). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied his application for state habeas relief. <em>Ex parte Simpson, </em>136 S.W.3d 660 (Tex.Crim.App.2004) . Simpson filed a petition for federal habeas relief in June 2005, presenting 39 claims for relief. The district court denied relief in March 2007. It granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) for Simpson\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing on his claim that he is mentally retarded and ineligible for the death penalty, but denied a COA for Simpson\u2019s other claims, including Simpson\u2019s claim that he is mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We hold that the district court erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Simpson\u2019s mental retardation claim. <em>See Hall v. Quarterman, </em>534 F.3d 365 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Accordingly, we REMAND the case to the district court to allow the district court to conduct a evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether Simpson is mentally retarded, and thereafter to reconsider its denial of relief as to Simpson\u2019s mental retardation claim, with respect to which we express no opinion. Upon entry of judgment on remand, the district court is instructed to return the case to this court for further proceedings, including consideration of Simpson\u2019s request for expansion of the COA. If any party or parties aggrieved by the district court\u2019s rulings on remand wish appellate review of same, such party or parties must file a notice of appeal and/or request for certificate of appealability, as appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">This case is REMANDED to the district court for this limited purpose as stated above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
