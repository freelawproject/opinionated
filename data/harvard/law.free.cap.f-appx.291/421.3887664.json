Aug. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>31, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen because it found that she failed to present new and material evidence supporting her family planning claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA appropriately noted that the 2003 administrative documents that Zheng submitted predated her August 2005 hearing before an immigration judge and, thus, were previously available. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d). The BIA also reasonably found that the newspaper articles Zheng submitted were not material to her claim because they involved enforcement efforts in another province. <em>See Matter of J-H-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec 196 (B.I.A 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Additionally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to credit Zheng\u2019s affidavit, her mother\u2019s statement, or the village notice she submitted based on the IJ\u2019s prior, unchallenged adverse credibility determination concerning her religious persecution claim. We have found that the BIA may reasonably decline to accord probative weight to documents submitted with a motion to reopen where the IJ made an adverse credibility determination after the movant\u2019s asylum hearing. <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 146-47 (2d Cir.2007). Because Zheng did not seek review of the BIA\u2019s prior order upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, the BIA reasonably relied on that determination in declining to credit the evidence she submitted with her motion to reopen. <em>See id.; Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] single false document or a single instance of false testimony may (if attributable to the petitioner) infect the balance of the alien\u2019s uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">We need not address Zheng\u2019s argument that the BIA applied an inappropriately stringent standard because it required her to establish statutory eligibility for asylum versus <em>piima facie </em>eligibility for relief because the BIA\u2019s findings concerning the materiality and availability of the evidence Zheng submitted, in light of the IJ\u2019s prior adverse credibility determination, independently support the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>105-06,108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (holding that \u201c[tjhere are at least three independent grounds on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen\u201d: failure to present \u201cpreviously unavailable, material evidence,\u201d failure to reasonably explain the failure to apply for asylum initially, and failure to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for the underlying relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\">. In her brief, Zheng waives any claim based on religious persecution, as well as any claim based on her \"successive\u201d asylum application. <em>See, e.g., Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">. Zheng's reliance on our holding in <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148 (2d Cir.2006), is misplaced. In that case, we held that the BIA erred in rejecting the petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding where the IJ had rejected the petitioner's claims regarding past persecution but believed that he was a Christian. <em>Id. </em>at 152\u2014 54. In such circumstances, we found error in the BIA\u2019s decision where it failed to consider evidence regarding the mistreatment of Christians in petitioner\u2019s country \u2014 evidence that did not depend on petitioner\u2019s credibility for its probative force. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
