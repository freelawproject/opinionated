Plaintiff Dawn Bertsch Porter (\u201cPorter\u201d) brought an action against Eli Lilly contending that it was responsible for the suicide of her husband, Leland \u201cLee\u201d Porter, because Eli Lilly failed to adequately warn of the potential risks between the drug Prozac and suicide. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Eley v. Baptist Hosp. Worth County, Inc., </em>199 Fed.Appx. 757, 758 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly granted Eli Lilly\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on Porter\u2019s failure to produce evidence of proximate cause. <em>See Powell v. Harsco Carp., </em>209 Ga.App. 348, 433 S.E.2d 608, 610 (1993). Under Georgia law, Porter was required to prove that, but for the alleged inadequate warning, Dr. Wolfberg, decedent\u2019s physician, would not have prescribed Prozac to decedent. <em>See Wheat v. Sofamor, S.N.C., </em>46 F.Supp.2d 1351, 1363 (N.D.Ga.1999). Dr. Wolfberg unequivocally testified that even if he had read the warning that Porter asserts should have been given, he still would have prescribed Prozac to the decedent. Thus, we agree with the district court that Porter cannot prove that Prozac was the proximate cause of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">Because there is no merit to any of the arguments Porter makes in this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Eli Lilly.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
