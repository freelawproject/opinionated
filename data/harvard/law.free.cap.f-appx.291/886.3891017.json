R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Appellant Rafael Antonio Herrera, a <em>pro se </em>litigant and federal inmate, appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>denial of his motion brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 to modify his sentence of life imprisonment based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">I. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">In 1992, Mr. Herrera pled guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine (powder) and/or cocaine base (crack), both Schedule II controlled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). After Mr. Herrera pled guilty, a federal probation officer prepared a presentence report in conjunction with the 1992 Guidelines to determine his sentence. Based on Mr. Herrera\u2019s participation in a conspiracy to distribute 13.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, .25 kilograms of cocaine powder, and one pound of marijuana, his base offense level was assessed at 40. The probation officer then enhanced his base offense level two levels for his possession of a firearm during the offense, four levels for his role in the offense, and two levels for obstruction of justice, for a total offense level of 48. Mr. Herrera\u2019s total offense level of 48, combined with his criminal history category of II, resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Evidence was submitted at a sentencing hearing held on February 22 and 23, 1993, and March 9, 1993, after which the district court found Mr. Herrera responsible for a drug quantity consisting of 13.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, .25 kilograms of cocaine powder, and one pound of marijuana and sentenced Mr. Herrera to life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>16 F.3d 418, 1994 WL 36766, at *1 (10th Cir. Feb.8, 1994) (unpublished op.). We affirmed Mr. Herrera\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal, <em>id. </em>at *2, and the Supreme Court denied Mr. Herrera\u2019s writ of certiorari. <em>See Herrera v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 1148, 114 S.Ct. 2177, 128 L.Ed.2d 897 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Thereafter, Mr. Herrera filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied on grounds he failed to make a substantial showing of his denial of a constitutional right. This court dismissed his appeal on the same grounds, <em>see United States v. Herrera, </em>149 F.3d 1192, 1998 WL 321217, at *2 (10th Cir. June 5, 1998) (unpublished op.), and also denied Mr. Herrera\u2019s petition for rehearing. The Supreme Court subsequently denied Mr. Herrera\u2019s writ of certiorari. <em>See Herrera v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 1139, 119 S.Ct. 1797,143 L.Ed.2d 1024 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Thereafter, Mr. Herrera filed three petitions for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, which this court denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Undeterred, in June 2005, Mr. Herrera filed a motion under \u00a7 3582, rais<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ing argument relating to <em>Apprendi, Blakely, and Booker, </em>which the district court denied. This court dismissed Mr. Herrera\u2019s appeal as untimely. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>178 Fed.Appx. 830 (10th Cir.2006) (unpublished op.).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In 2006, Mr. Herrera filed a \u201cWrit of Audita Querela\u201d under the All Writs Act, again arguing his life sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker. </em>After the district court denied Mr. Herrera\u2019s writ on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction, this court construed his pleadings as an implied application for authorization to file another \u00a7 2255 motion, and denied the motion, holding <em>\u201cBooker, Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>\u201d did \u201cnot apply retroactively to final criminal judgments such as his.\u201d <em>Herrera, </em>216 Fed.Appx. at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">On January 25, 2008, Mr. Herrera filed the instant motion to modify his life term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e), which modified the Drug Quantity Table contained therein downward two levels for crack cocaine and became effective on November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (Nov. 1, 2007); U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706. On February 12, 2008, 2008 WL 410074, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>denied Mr. Herrera\u2019s motion, finding the issue concerning Amendment 706 was premature because he filed for relief before the prescribed effective date of its retroactivity which was to occur on March 3, 2008. Alternatively, the district court determined Mr. Herrera did not qualify for a reduction in his sentence because the drug quantity of 13.5 kilograms of crack cocaine attributable to him still exceeded the revised quantity amount of 4.5 kilograms for crack cocaine, so that an offense level reduction of two levels would still not change his Guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (Drug Quantity Table) (Nov. 1, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Mr. Herrera now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify his life term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), claiming the district court erred in finding his motion premature and by failing to apply Amendment 706 retroactively to his sentence. Mr. Herrera also argues he should be resentenced under <em>Booker </em>for the purpose of applying the Guidelines to his sentence in an advisory manner and redetermining the drug quantity used to assess his base offense level, which he claims the district court improperly found by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">As background, Amendment 706 modified \u201cthe drug quantity thresholds\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) and the Drug Quantity Table, \u201cso as to assign, for crack cocaine offenses, base offense levels corresponding to guideline ranges that include the statutory mandatory minimum penalties.\u201d U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706 (Reason for Amend.). As a result, \u201c[ejrack cocaine offenses for quantities above and below the mandatory minimum threshold quantities ... [were] adjusted downward by two levels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the current highest offense level of 38 would require a quantity of 4.5 kilograms or more of cocaine, rather than the 1.5 kilograms or more previously required for offense level 38. <em>See id. </em>However, we note that the 1992 Guidelines and Drug Quantity Table under which Mr. Herrera was sentenced provided an even higher offense level of 40 for 5 kilograms to 15 kilograms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>of cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (Drug Quantity Table) (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">While the drug quantities changed as a result of Amendment 706, it was not explicitly listed as an amendment which had retroactive application to prior sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a) and (c) (Nov. 1, 2007). However, on December 11, 2007, the United States Sentencing Commission voted to make Amendment 706 retroactive, which it did through promulgation of Amendments 712 and 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a) and (c), Amends. 712 and 713 (March 3, 2008 Supp.). Specifically, Amendment 713 changed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 \u2014 the policy statement for amended Guidelines ranges, by explicitly listing Amendment 706 as one of the amendments deemed retroactive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(c), Amend. 713 (March 3, 2008 Supp.). With regard to Amendment 712, it included, in part, certain exclusions to the reduction of sentences by amendment, by providing, in part: \u201cA reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... an amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), Amend. 712 (March 3, 2008 Supp.). As the district court pointed out, March 3, 2008, was the effective date of Amendments 712 and 713 for the purpose of retroactive application of Amendment 706 and the revised Drug Quantity Table under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) and (c), Amends. 712 and 713 (March 3, 2008 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">With this in mind, \u201c[w]e review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute or the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Dorrough, </em>84 F.3d 1309, 1311 (10th Cir.1996). When a \u201cmotion for sentence reduction is not a direct appeal or a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the viability of [the] motion depends entirely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 540 (quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). Section 3582(e) allows the court to modify a sentence in only three limited circumstances, including: (1) on motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons if special circumstances exist; (2) if otherwise expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; or (3) if the sentencing range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41. Mr. Herrera\u2019s motion is premised on the last circumstance \u2014 a reduction of the sentencing range applicable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">We begin with the issue of whether Mr. Herrera\u2019s motion was filed prematurely. Clearly, Mr. Herrera filed his \u00a7 3582 motion five weeks prior to when retroactive application of the revised Drug Quantity Table became effective. Thus, as the district court indicated when it issued its February 2008 order addressing Mr. Herrera\u2019s motion, the March 3, 2008 effective date of retroactive application of the revised Drag Quantity Table had not yet occurred. However, at this juncture, the revised Drug Quantity Table has effectively become retroactive with respect to drug quantity-based sentences, like Mr. Herrera\u2019s, which were imposed prior to its promulgation. For the purpose of judicial economy and because the parties and district court addressed the merits of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Herrera\u2019s motion, we will address Mr. Herrera\u2019s appeal on the merits, thereby dispensing with the necessity of Mr. Herrera filing a \u00a7 3582 motion on the same grounds, the government having to file a duplicate response, and the district court having to issue another decision on the merits of his Amendment 706 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Proceeding to the merits of Mr. Herrera\u2019s appeal, it is clear the retroactive application of a two-level reduction to his base offense level, as prescribed by Amendment 706, would result in a total offense level of 46, which, together with his criminal history category of II, would still result in a life sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) and Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table) (Nov. 1, 2007). As a result, \u201ca reduction\u201d in Mr. Herrera\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cis not consistent with\u201d the policy statement in \u00a7 IB 1.10 \u201cand therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d because a two-level reduction in the offense level under Amendment 706, as listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), Amend. 712 (March 3, 2008 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We also reject Mr. Herrera\u2019s claim he is entitled to resentencing under <em>Booker </em>for the purpose of applying the Guidelines in an advisory manner or redetermining his base drug offense level. This court has held \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions may not be employed to present <em>Booker </em>claims, as \u201c\u00a7 3582(c)(2) only expressly allows a reduction where the Sentencing Commission, not the Supreme Court, has lowered the [sentencing] range.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1007 &amp; n. 2 (10th Cir.2006). Furthermore, with respect to his base drug offense level, the policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-9\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court ... shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and <em>shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) (Nov. 1, 2007). Thus, under \u00a7 3582, we may consider only whether Mr. Herrera is entitled to a two-level offense reduction under Amendment 706, and not whether any other reduction of his sentence is warranted under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Moreover, Mr. Herrera\u2019s request for us to redetermine his base offense level and the drug quantity attributable to him is a collateral attack on the substance of, or proceedings that determined, his original sentence. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Salais, </em>337 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir. 2003). Section 3582 only gives district courts the authority \u201cto modify a sentence based on events occurring <em>after </em>the original sentence was imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>For the reasons provided, Mr. Herrera\u2019s arguments are meritless, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion. Furthermore, it is evident Mr. Herrera has filed numerous other actions and appeals in reliance on <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker </em>which have been repeatedly adjudicated and deemed meritless. \u201cThe right of access to the courts is neither absolute nor unconditional, and there is no constitutional right of access to the courts to prosecute an action that is frivolous or malicious.\u201d <em>Winslow v. Hunter (In re Winslow), </em>17 F.3d 314, 315 (10th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). We therefore caution Mr. Herrera further filings in reliance on these cases or on matters we deem meritless may result in summary disposition of his future appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Mr. Herrera\u2019s motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\">. <em>See </em>10th Cir. Docket No. 00-6322, 9/26/00 and 7/10/01 entries; 10th Cir. Docket No. 03-6117, 4/22/03 and 6/20/03 entries; 10th Cir. Docket No. 05-6092, 3/21/05 and 4/29/05 entries; Ape. Br. at 5-6. <em>See also United States v. Herrera, </em>216 Fed.Appx. 809, 810 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished op.) (noting three \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>motions had previously been filed by Mr. Herrera and denied by this court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. Specifically, if we lower Mr. Herrera\u2019s base offense level by two levels to 38 and then add the eight levels of enhancements for his (1) possession of a firearm during the offense, (2) role in the offense, and (3) obstruction of justice, the total offense level is 46, which, together with his criminal history category of II, results in a Guidelines range of life imprisonment under the 1992, 2007, or 2008 versions of the Guidelines. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(2) (Drug Quantity Table) and Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table) (1992) <em>-with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(1) (Drug Quantity Table) and Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table) (Nov. 1, 2007) <em>and </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (Drug Quantity Table) (May 1, 2008 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">. In addition to the issues presented and addressed, Mr. Herrera makes additional arguments in support of his appeal which are cursory and incoherent. While we construe his <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, <em>see Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), we have held perfunctory or cursory references to issues, which are unaccompanied by some effort at developed argument, are inadequate to warrant consideration. <em>See United States v. Almaraz, </em>306 F.3d 1031, 1041 (10th Cir.2002). Under the circumstances presented, Mr. Herrera's arguments are frivolous and we will not expend further judicial resources considering them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
