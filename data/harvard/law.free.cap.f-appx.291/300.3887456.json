Harris challenges the application of an aggravating role enhancement, the sufficiency of the explanation for his sentence, and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">Harris\u2019s roommate provided law enforcement with photographs that he had recorded on his cellular telephone that depicted Harris videotaping 15 and 16 year old boys engaging in sexual acts. Officers obtained a search warrant for Harris\u2019s residence. When they executed the warrant, the officers found Harris trying to destroy cameras that were concealed in a smoke detector and an air conditioning vent in his bathroom. Officers discovered a computer in Harris\u2019s bedroom that contained four videos made by Harris of minors engaging in sexual activities. The videos matched the cellular phone data recorded by Harris\u2019s roommate. The computer also contained an instant message session between Harris and codefendant Salvador Aguirre in which Harris told Aguirre that he was watching two minor males having sex and Aguirre asked Harris to photograph the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">Officers executed a search warrant on Aguirre\u2019s residence. Aguirre admitted that he had participated in the instant message session and he had received child pornography from Harris. Officers discovered a camera bag that belonged to codefendant Leonard Parks, Jr. Inside the bag, the officers found a phone drive containing several videos and photographs of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in Harris\u2019s bedroom. Seven minors, two of whom were Harris\u2019s godchildren and subject to Harris\u2019s power of attorney, were depicted in the videos and photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Officers also learned that, on one occasion, Harris called Parks and invited him to come over and observe two minor males engage in sexual activities. Harris videotaped Parks having sex with one of the minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Harris admitted videotaping minors engaged in sexual acts. The minors told law enforcement that Harris befriended them, spent money on them, and then photographed and videotaped them while they were naked and engaged in sexual acts. Harris pleaded guilty to counts one and three of his indictment, which charged him with inducing and conspiring to induce a minor to engage in sexual conduct to produce a visual depiction of the conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">To account for the exploitation of seven minors, Harris\u2019s sentence was calculated as though the exploitation of each minor had been charged in a separate count of conviction. United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2G2.1(d) (Nov.2004). Harris\u2019s acts against each minor was represented by a separate group. Groups 2 and 3 had base offense levels of 32 that were increased by two levels for Harris\u2019s role as an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal acts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c). The presentence investigation report listed the offense level applicable to each of the seven groups, then calculated the combined offense level by selecting the highest adjusted offense level of 40, which represented Group 2, and increasing it by 5 levels to reflect the 6.5 units assigned for the offense levels applicable to each group. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3Dl.l(a)(3), 3D1.4. The report decreased the base offense level by 3 levels for Harris\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b), for an adjusted offense level of 42. With a criminal history category of II and a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 30 years for each charge, the report provided a sentencing range between 360 and 720 months of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Harris objected to the application of the enhancement and argued that he was not an organizer under section 3Bl.l(c) because he did not instruct Parks to come to his house to participate in sexual activity or advise Parks to have sex. Harris testified at the sentencing hearing that a minor asked Harris to invite Parks to join them, Parks came to Harris\u2019s house to observe two minors have sex, and only after Parks sat on the bed and began to have sex with one of the minors did Harris decide to videotape the activity. Harris admitted on cross-examination that he called Parks, told Parks about the minors, and Parks would not have come to Harris\u2019s house but for Harris\u2019s call. Harris denied that he called Parks to orchestrate sexual activities to videotape. Harris also testified that he did not plan the sexual activities that he had videotaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The district court found that Harris was \u201cinvolved with minor kids\u201d whom he allowed to have sex in his home, Harris \u201cinvited ... [ojther individuals\u201d to his home \u201cfor the purpose of having sex,\u201d and Harris \u201crecord[ed] [those] sessions.\u201d The court concluded \u201c[t]hat clearly is an organization that is organizing with respect to\u201d inducing minors to engage in sexual activities to produce a visual depiction of that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Harris compared himself to an addict and asked the district court to consider in mitigation his physical infirmities and his relationship with his father and mother. Hams argued that the purposes of sentencing could be satisfied with a below-guidelines sentence between 15 years and 320 months of imprisonment. The district court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the statements of all parties, the presentence report ..., and the statutory factors\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>selected a sentence that was \u201csufficiently punitive to deter [Harris] from future criminal conduct.\u201d The court sentenced Hams to concurrent terms of 360 months of imprisonment and to supervised release for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The upward adjustment of a guidelines offense level \u201cdue to [a defendant\u2019s] status as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006). We review the reasonableness of a criminal sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Harris raises three challenges to his sentence. All fail. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">\n<em>A. The District Comi Did Not Clearly Err by Applying the Aggravating Role Enhancement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Harris argues that the district court erred by applying the enhancement for his role as an organizer in the criminal activities. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Harris argues that the district court erroneously characterized the minors as \u201cparticipants\u201d in the criminal \u201corganization.\u201d Harris also argues that the facts did not establish that he exerted control or influence over Parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">A court must apply a two level aggravating role enhancement to the sentence of a defendant who serves as an organizer or leader in any criminal activity involving less than five other participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). A participant is a person \u201ccriminally responsible for the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 1. Status as a participant is judged by \u201cthe nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, ... the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, [and] the nature and scope of the illegal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">The facts supported application of the enhancement. Harris pleaded guilty to buying young boys presents, inviting them into his home, creating an atmosphere conducive to sexual conduct, and videotaping that conduct. Harris knew of Parks\u2019s penchant for the boys\u2019 conduct because he had provided to Parks videotaped material depicting two minors engaged in sexual activities. Harris admitted at sentencing that he invited Parks to observe two minors have sex, and that, but for his invitation, Parks would not have come to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">\n<em>B. The District Court Provided a Sufficient Explanation for Harris\u2019s Sentence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">Harris argues that the district court did not provide a sufficient explanation to justify his sentence, but we disagree. The district court complied with section 3553(c) by explaining the reasons for Harris\u2019s sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). The court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the statements of all parties, the presentence report ..., and the statutory factors\u201d and concluded that the sentence was necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>to punish Harris and \u201cdeter [him] from future criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>C. Harris\u2019s Sentence Is Reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range. Although Harris argues that the district court did not consider his family background or the absence of violence related to his crimes, the court stated that it had considered those facts in mitigation. The court correctly calculated the advisory guideline range and explained that a sentence of 360 months of imprisonment served the statutory purposes of deterrence and adequate punishment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Harris\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Harris\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
