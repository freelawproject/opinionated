Futch also appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting Roberts\u2019 request for a voluntary dismissal of her bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">Roberts filed a Chapter 13 voluntary bankruptcy petition in the district court, and the deadline for creditors to file a proof of claim against her bankruptcy estate was March 1, 2006. Futch filed a proof of claim after the deadline, and Roberts objected to it as untimely. After a hearing on the matter, the bankruptcy court disallowed Futch\u2019s proof of claim on July 24, 2006. Futch appealed to the district court, which entered an order denying his appeal on January 29, 2007. Futch appealed the district court\u2019s order to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-19\">Roberts then filed a request for the voluntary dismissal of her Chapter 13 case, which the bankruptcy court granted on June 28, 2007. Futch also appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of dismissal, and he argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the proceedings while his first appeal concerning the disallowance of his proof of claim was pending in this Court. We granted Futch leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and consolidated his appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-20\">Futch contends that the bankruptcy court erred by disallowing his proof of claim and that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant Robert\u2019s request for a voluntary dismissal while his first appeal was pending. We will address Futch\u2019s second contention first.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-3\">\u201cAs the second court of review of a bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment, this Court examines independently the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court and employs the same standards of review as the district court.\u201d <em>In re Issac Leaseco, Inc., </em>389 F.3d 1205, 1209 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). Where the district court \u201cmade no factual findings in its function as an appellate court, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d In re Int\u2019l Admin. Servs., Inc., </em>408 F.3d 689, 698 (11th Cir.2005). We review only for clear error the bankruptcy court\u2019s factfindings, and we review <em>de novo </em>all questions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">\u201cThe filing of a notice of appeal generally \u2018confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Mosley, </em>494 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 402, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982)). However, it does not \u201cprevent the [district] court from entertaining motions on matters collateral to those at issue on appeal.\u201d <em>Mahone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">As the former Fifth Circuit has stated, \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy should not halt merely because interlocutory orders are appealed.\u201d <em>Mavity v. Assoc. Disc. Corp., </em>320 F.2d 133, 136 (5th Cir.1963).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, \u201ca case should continue to be adjudicated on the merits by [the bankruptcy court] unless the order appealed from was of such a nature as to render further proceedings useless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute governing \u201cconversion or dismissal\u201d of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case provides: \u201cOn request of the debtor at any time, if the case has not been converted under [11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706, 1112, or 1208], the court shall dismiss a case under this chapter.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Here, the matter on which the bankruptcy court ruled\u2014Roberts\u2019 motion to voluntarily dismiss her Chapter 13 bankruptcy case\u2014was not the subject of Futch\u2019s pending appeal. Instead, Futch\u2019s pending appeal concerned the timeliness of the filing of his proof of claim, a collateral matter that would not \u201crender further proceedings useless.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Futch\u2019s first appeal divested the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to consider issues pertaining to his proof of claim, <em>see Mosley, </em>494 <em>F.3d </em>at 1328, but not issues relating to Roberts\u2019 right to have her bankruptcy petition dismissed upon her request, <em>see Mavity, </em>320 F.2d at 136. We affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting Roberts\u2019 request for the voluntary dismissal of her Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Because the bankruptcy court dismissed Roberts\u2019 bankruptcy petition, we must decide whether that dismissal rendered moot Futch\u2019s first appeal, which concerned the district court\u2019s exclusion of his proof of claim as untimely filed. \u201cA case becomes moot \u2018when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atlanta Gas Light Co. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>140 F.3d 1392, 1401 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1951, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969)). \u201cCentral to a finding of mootness is a determination by an appellate court that it cannot grant effective judicial relief.\u201d <em>In re Club </em>Assocs., 956 F.2d 1065, 1069 (11th Cir.1992). More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>over, [djismissal of a moot case is required because mootness is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, </em>315 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe rule that federal courts may not decide cases that have become moot derives from Article III\u2019s case and controversy requirement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Here, the Chapter 13 proceedings in which Futch sought to file a proof of claim have been dismissed. As a result, we are unable to grant any effective relief with respect to the bankruptcy court\u2019s order disallowing Futch\u2019s proof of claim as untimely. We conclude that the dismissal of Roberts\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case rendered moot Futch\u2019s appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order disallowing his proof of claim and dismiss that appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">.
