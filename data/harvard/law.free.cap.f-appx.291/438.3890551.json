We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">The district court concluded based on Turner\u2019s criminal history that he should be sentenced as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the advisory Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Turner does not challenge his career-offender status or the district court\u2019s advisory Guidelines calculation. Instead, he argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable and that the circumstances of his ease merited a departure below the advisory range. As an initial matter, Turner argues that we should review all career-offender sentences \u201cwith the same degree of case-specific care that district courts are expected to employ ... in the first place.\u201d This argument is without merit as the Supreme Court has instructed that our review of all sentences on appeal is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">Turner contends that his within-Guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to balance properly the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, he asserts that the district court failed to account for his mitigating family circumstances and for the disparity between his sentence and the lesser sentences of his co-defendants. The district court found that no unwarranted disparity existed between Turner and his co-defendants, concluding that Turner was not similarly situated to them because of his lengthy criminal history with three pri- or felony drug offenses \u2014 the aim of career-offender provision \u2014 and because Turner was not a drug addict, in contrast to some of his co-defendants. These findings were not clearly erroneous. Further, the record shows that the district court carefully balanced the various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Turner\u2019s mitigating circumstances, and concluded that a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate. Giving due deference to the district court\u2019s reasoned judgment, we cannot conclude this sentence was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
