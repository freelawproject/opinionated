Jan. 25, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">We find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen. It is undisputed that Lin\u2019s motion was time and number barred. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Lin failed to demonstrate that conditions in China have changed such that she met an exception to the time and numerical limitations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In contrast to the circumstances presented in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>where the BIA ignored certain pieces of evidence, 463 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir.2006), the BIA explicitly considered all of the documents Lin submitted in support of her argument that conditions in China had changed. Those documents, however, merely established the birth of her children, not changed country conditions. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">Much of Lin\u2019s brief to this Court discusses the documents we examined in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d at 115. It is unclear whether Lin faults the BIA for failing to consider those docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ments or simply asks that we take judicial notice of them and remand on that basis. In either case, her ai'gument is unavailing. Lin did not submit the <em>Guo </em>documents with her motion to reopen or offer an explanation as to why she could not have done so. Moreover, she did not request that the BIA take administrative notice of those documents. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (providing that the BIA may take \u201cadministrative notice of commonly known facts such as current events or the contents of official documents\u201d); <em>see also Chhetry v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>490 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir.2007). In such circumstances, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s decision not to take notice of extra-record evidence. Nor will we remand to the BIA on the basis of such evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 263-65 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
