Ilestin asserts she established refugee status as defined by the INA because her testimony showed she was persecuted by Lavalas supporters due to her own and her then-boyfriend\u2019s political opinions. Thus, she asserts she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Haiti. Further, Ilestin contends she met the burden required for withholding of removal under the INA by establishing through her credible, sufficiently detailed testimony, that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted if returned to Haiti.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we deny Ilestin\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">To the extent the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will affirm the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">I. CREDIBILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As a threshold matter, the BIA \u201cmust make clean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). When the agency does not make an adverse credibility determination, we consider the petitioner\u2019s testimony to be credible. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir. 2007). If any alien provides credible testimony, it may be sufficient, without corroboration, to establish her eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). However, \u201c[wjhere the immigration judge determines that the applicant should provide evidence which corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant demonstrates that the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(B). \u201cNo court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence ... unless the court finds ... that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Here, the IJ did not make an adverse credibility determination, and Ilestin\u2019s testimony is therefore considered credible. <em>See Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257. Further, the BIA and IJ did not err in concluding that corroborating evidence was available in the testimony of Ilestin\u2019s ex-husband, Archelus. Ilestin testified Archelus was present in Miami at the time of her hearing. However, Archelus did not testify at the hearing, nor did he provide an affidavit, letter, or any statement corroborating Ilestin\u2019s claims she was persecuted on account of either his or her own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>political opinion. Ilestin explained his absence as being due only to the fact they were separated. The IJ and BIA noted this fact, and found Archelus could have come forward to corroborate Ilestin\u2019s own testimony they were both attacked due to their political opinions. Further, Archelus\u2019s absence was especially notable because Ilestin asserted the primary basis of her persecution was Archelus\u2019s political views and activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">II. ASYLUM</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASX\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). An asylum applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). This requires showing that an applicant\u2019s fear of persecution \u201cis subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">If the alien establishes past persecution, there is a presumption that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country unless the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant would no longer be threatened upon removal, or that the alien could reasonably relocate within the country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\u201cAn imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quotation omitted). \u201cAn asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of imputed political opinion if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\n<em>A. Past Persecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Ilestin failed to prove she was persecuted on account of the imputation of Archelus\u2019s political opinion to her is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence. As to the first incident, in which she was slapped unconscious, Ilestin testified the five men who showed up at her house and proceeded to beat Archelus slapped her only after she attempted to intervene in the attack. While that attack may have resulted in her being knocked unconscious, Ilestin provided no testimony or corroborative evidence demonstrating she was slapped for any reason other than to stop her from interfering in their attack on Archelus. Further, Ilestin provided no evidence establishing that Archelus him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>self was attacked on account of an enumerated ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">As to the second incident, in which Ilestin was raped and stabbed, Ilestin testified that a man approached her while she was selling goods as a vendor. Other than asking her if she was the mother of Archelus\u2019s children, the man made no reference to Archelus, his political opinions, or those of Ilestin. Ilestin testified when this man and another individual arrived at her house, they began \u201ctalking a lot and also making a lot of noise.\u201d One of the men then proceeded to rape her, and the other ultimately stabbed her in her thigh. Despite the horrific nature of this attack, Ilestin offered no testimony showing these men made any reference to her own or Archelus\u2019s political opinion. Again, she provided no corroborative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Accordingly, because Uestin\u2019s testimony alone failed to establish a nexus between the attacks she suffered and any protected ground, and because it was reasonable for the IJ and BIA to expect corroborative evidence when Archelus was available by being present in Miami, substantial evidence supports the finding Ilestin did not establish past persecution on account of a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>B. Well-Founded Fear</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">While Ilestin asserts she was entitled to a rebuttable presumption of having a well-founded fear of future persecution, as discussed above, Ilestin did not establish she was persecuted on account of a protected ground, and thus, no such presumption applies. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). Moreover, substantial evidence supports the determination of the IJ and BIA that Ilestin did not satisfy her burden of establishing a well-founded fear of future persecution. While Ilestin has arguably satisfied the subjective component, establishing she genuinely fears persecution, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that she failed to establish a well-founded fear because the record shows she did not satisfy the objective component of demonstrating that she has a good reason to fear future persecution. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284, 1289. Ilestin failed to establish she would be singled out for persecution based on Archelus\u2019s political opinion, as Archelus now resides in the United States, and in any event, she provided no evidence establishing Archelus\u2019s political opinion was imputed to her. Further, Ilestin did not establish a well-founded fear based on her own political opinion, as she offered no testimony she was personally politically active, and her children have continued to live in Haiti without any difficulty. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Moreover, while Ilestin stated she would be arrested and killed if returned to Haiti, the Country Reports she submitted show the Haitian police are addressing corruption in their ranks, and are targeting the pro-Lavalas criminal gangs. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Ilestin\u2019s asylum claim, as substantial record evidence supports that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">III. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that if returned to his country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). If a petitioner is unable to meet the standard of proof for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Thus, because Ilestin was unable to meet her burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum, it follows she is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>unable to meet the higher burden of qualifying for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. Although Ilestin applied for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and appealed the IJ\u2019s denial of that claim to the BIA, she failed to address that issue in her initial brief on appeal, and it is therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (stating \u2019\u2019[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-11\">. When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \"Insofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ's decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Here, we review both the BIA's decision and the IJ's decision, as the BIA\u2019s determination was based on the same reasoning as the IJ's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
