In its brief, the government presented approximately five pages of explication as to why we have no jurisdiction at this time. Stone did not file a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">As the appellant, Stone has the obligation to show jurisdiction. Moreover, the government is correct that, for the reasons it gives, the order designated in the notice of appeal is not a final, appealable order. As the government explains, \u201cStone appears to have filed the appeal based on a misunderstanding of the difference between the effectiveness of a writ [of garnishment] and the final disposition order in a garnishment action.... Because all issues in the garnishment action have not been resolved, the order on appeal is not a final order, and there is no appellate jurisdiction under section 1291.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">Stone is not put in jeopardy by the dismissal of the appeal. As the government helpfully points out, \u201cThe order appealed was entered as a procedural matter to dismiss those garnishees that did not hold any funds.... Stone may appeal this order, if he chooses, after a final disposition order is entered in the district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">The appeal is DISMISSED for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
