We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>1. Honduras</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">To qualify for asylum and withholding of removal, the source of the applicant\u2019s alleged persecution must be the government or a group the government is unwilling or unable to control. <em>See Mashiri v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 1112, 1122-23 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir.1998). The only evidence Chang provided that the Honduran government was unable or unwilling to control his persecutors, local Taiwanese officials, was his testimony that the Taiwanese government provided police cars and equipment to the Honduran police and the two organizations had \u201cvery cordial relations, just like brothers.\u201d This evidence does not compel the conclusion that the Honduran government was unwilling or unable to control Chang\u2019s persecutors. <em>See Korablina, </em>158 F.3d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">2. China</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi), asylum may not be granted to an applicant who \u201cwas firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States.\u201d The IJ found that Chang\u2019s Honduran citizenship constituted firm resettlement in Honduras, thereby cutting off Chang\u2019s claim for asylum. Chang did not exhaust his resettlement claim and is therefore barred by the doctrine of firm resettlement from asserting a claim for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Although firm resettlement is not a bar to withholding of removal, <em>see Siong v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 1030, 1041 (9th Cir.2004), we do not have jurisdiction to review Chang\u2019s petition for withholding of removal because he failed to exhaust it, <em>see Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b854-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
