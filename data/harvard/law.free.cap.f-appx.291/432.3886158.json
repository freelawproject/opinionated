DeFonzo denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yu Xian Chen, </em>No. A96 017 981 (B.I.A. Dec. 31, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A96 017 981 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Apr. 21, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, as it was properly based on the following omissions: (1) while Chen testified that she was arrested and beaten in October 2002, she denied that she was ever arrested at both her airport and credible fear interviews; and (2) Chen failed to mention that she had been forced to submit to an abortion at her airport interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Under the guidelines that we set forth in <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004), we find that the records of Chen\u2019s airport and credible fear interviews are sufficiently reliable to support an adverse credibility determination. First, the records of those interviews are in question and answer format, and appear to be verbatim accounts of the exchanges between Chen and the immigration officers. <em>See id. </em>at 180. Moreover, Mandarin interpreters were provided at both interviews, and nothing in the records suggest that Chen did not understand the questions asked of her. Additionally, the questions that were posed to Chen appear designed to elicit the details of an asylum claim, and Chen\u2019s responses evince a willingness to answer the government\u2019s questions. Contrary to Chen\u2019s argument, the omissions identified by the agency go to the heart of her claim, as her alleged forced abortion and arrest provide the very bases for her assertion that she was persecuted in China. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, they provide proper support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Moreover, as the IJ found, Chen\u2019s failure \u201cto provide consistent and coherent testimony regarding her claimed opposition to family planning policy in China [was] further evidence of a lack of credibility.\u201d Particular deference is given to such assessments of an applicant\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">While the IJ\u2019s decision is not without error,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> remand would be futile in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>because we can confidently predict in view of the substantial omissions identified by the IJ, that the agency would reach the same conclusion absent the IJ\u2019s flawed finding. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Chen\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, where all three claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> The IJ erroneously found that while Chen stated at her credible fear interview that the government took away the store that she and her husband operated as punishment for attempling to have a second child, she testified that it had been taken from them because she had an argument with government authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ties. However, the record of Chen's credible fear interview indicates that she stated, \"Our business was closed because I argued with some of the officials.\u201d Because this finding is not supported by the record, it does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
