For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-24\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, we recount only those facts essential to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-25\">A native and citizen of Jamaica, Jones was admitted as a lawful permanent resident on May 19, 1983. Since coming to the United States, Jones has been convicted of three crimes. On December 11, 1986, she was convicted of criminal possession of marijuana in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law (N.Y.PL) \u00a7 221.30. On August 25, 1993, she was convicted of theft of services, in violation of NYPL \u00a7 165.15. Finally, on June 8, 2005, she was convicted of petit larceny, in violation of NYPL \u00a7 155.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-26\">On February 13, 2006, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) placed Jones in removal proceedings based upon her 1986 drag conviction; two weeks later, ICE issued an additional charge of removability based upon Jones\u2019s theft of services and larceny convictions. Jones conceded her convictions and applied for two forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>of relief: (1) cancellation of removal and (2) relief under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In a hearing before the IJ, Jones admitted that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal based upon the application of the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d to her 1986 conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Jones faced difficulties with her former \u00a7 212(c) application. Because \u00a7 212(c) was repealed in 1996, that form of relief would not reach her 2005 petit larceny conviction, meaning that she would still be removable on the basis of that conviction even if her former \u00a7 212(c) application were granted. As a result, Jones filed a late notice of appeal in state court in an attempt to overturn her 2005 conviction so that a successful former \u00a7 212(c) application could provide her with relief from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Jones sought and received continuances from the IJ while awaiting the state court\u2019s decision on her notice of appeal. As no action was taken by the state court after several continuances, the IJ denied Jones\u2019s request for a further continuance on July 26, 2006, noting that the case could be reopened if Jones\u2019s state court appeal was ultimately successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In the absence of state court action on her 2005 conviction, Jones conceded that her former \u00a7 212(c) application was, at least for the moment, futile. Accordingly, the IJ noted in her decision that Jones had \u201cnot sought a hearing concerning eligibility for relief under [former] [s]ection 212(c) of the Act\u201d and had thus \u201cat least <em>temporarily </em>abandoned the application in light of her current predicament.\u201d (IJ Dec. at 5-6 n. 1) (emphasis in original). The IJ also denied Jones\u2019s application for cancellation of removal, noting that \u201cboth of the parties agreed that the respondent is subject to the stop-time rule under Section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act because the respondent\u2019s first conviction was only two years after the respondent acquired her lawful permanent residence.\u201d (IJ Dec. at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Subsequently, the state court denied Jones\u2019s notice of appeal on her 2005 conviction, thus rendering her former \u00a7 212(c) application futile. With that avenue of relief closed, Jones attempted to resuscitate her cancellation of removal application in her appeal to the BIA, arguing for the first time that application of the stop-time rule to her 1986 conviction was impermissibly retroactive because the rule was enacted in 1996. In affirming the IJ, the BIA rejected Jones\u2019s retroactivity argument as untimely, noting that Jones had \u201cconceded that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal at the hearing, and therefore did not raise her current argument in a timely manner.\u201d (BIA Dee. at 1). Furthermore, the BIA noted that under its precedent, \u201can offense is deemed to end an alien\u2019s continuous residence as of the date of its commission, even if the offense was committed prior to the enactment of [the stop-time rule].\u201d (BIA Dec. at 2) <em>(citing Matter of Jurado, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 29, 32 (BIA 2006); <em>Matter of Robles, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 22, 27-28 (BIA 2006)). Jones timely filed this petition for review, again asserting that the application of the stop-time rale to her petition for cancellation of removal was impermissibly retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Both cancellation of removal and the stop-time rale were created with the 1996 enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). In particular, cancellation of removal is a form of discretionary relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>available to aliens who meet a series of eligibility requirements, including seven years of continuous presence in the United States. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240A(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). In turn, the stop-time rule terminates an alien\u2019s accrual of time towards this seven-year requirement upon the commission of certain crimes. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240A(d)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). Consequently, an alien who commits a qualifying offense within seven years of being admitted to the United States cannot satisfy the continuous presence requirement and is ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Therefore, if the stop-time rule were to apply to Jones with her 1986 drug offense, she would be rendered ineligible for cancellation of removal. As noted above, Jones initially conceded the rule\u2019s applicability before the IJ; however, once her state court efforts to overturn her 2005 petit larceny conviction failed (thus rendering her former \u00a7 212(c) application futile), she put forth the present retroactivity argument to the BIA in an attempt to breathe new life into her cancellation of removal application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We now turn to the substance of Jones\u2019s retroactivity argument. In <em>Landgraf v. U.S.I. Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994), the Supreme Court set forth a two-step test to determine whether it is permissible to apply a statute retroactively. The first step asks us to \u201cascertain whether Congress has directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively.\u201d <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 316, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) <em>(citing Martin v. Hadix, </em>527 U.S. 343, 352, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 144 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999)). If the statute is not sufficiently clear, we proceed to the second step, which asks us to \u201cdetermine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 266, 114 S.Ct. 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">With regard to the first step of the <em>Landgraf </em>analysis \u2014 whether Congress has clearly specified that the stop-time rule should be applied retroactively to a petition for cancellation of removal \u2014 we note that \u201c[t]he standard for finding such unambiguous direction is a demanding one,\u201d involving statutory language \u201cso clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 316-17, 121 S.Ct. 2271 <em>(citing Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 328 n. 4, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997)). Our review of the statute and its legislative history convinces us that Congress has not clearly directed whether the stop-time rule should apply in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">We turn therefore to the second step of <em>Landgraf, </em>which asks us to \u201cdetermine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\u201d 511 U.S. at 266, 114 S.Ct. 1483. Moreover, this determination \u201cshould be informed and guided by \u2018familiar considerations of fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martin, </em>527 U.S. at 358, 119 S.Ct. 1998 <em>(quoting Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 270,114 S.Ct. 1483).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Jones attempts to analogize her request for cancellation of removal to the availability of \u00a7 212(e) relief as determined in <em>St. Cyr. </em>She argues that when she pled guilty to drug possession in 1986, she did so in reliance upon her ability to seek discretionary relief from deportation, an interest she claims was impaired when IIRIRA created the stop-time rule ten years later. This argument fails because neither the stop-time rule nor cancellation of removal itself was \u201cin existence, or even pending enactment, at the time the respondent committed [her] offense more than a decade earlier\u201d; accordingly, it is \u201cdifficult to understand how [Jones] might have relied on the future availability of such relief [cancellation of removal] as undergirding a retroactivity claim.\u201d <em>Robles, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Rather, any reliance interest that Jones had in discretionary relief at the time of her 1986 guilty plea involved \u00a7 212(c)\u2014 which was the form of relief available at that time \u2014 and not cancellation of removal. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>St. Cyr </em>ensured that this interest would be undiminished by IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c). Because of <em>St. Cyr, </em>aliens who could apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief before IIRIRA\u2019s enactment can still apply for former \u00a7 212(c) relief after IIRIRA\u2019s enactment, as Jones did in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">As IIRIRA\u2019s enactment of the stop-time rule did not impair rights that Jones possessed when she acted, increase her liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to already-completed transactions, we hold that the stop-time rule did not have an impermissible retroactive effect upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">. As will be discussed below, the \"stop-time rule\u201d renders an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal upon the commission of certain crimes within seven years of the alien's admission to the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">. Though the inconsistency of Jones's positions before the IJ and the BIA raise the specter of judicial estoppel, we note that this \u201cis an extreme remedy, to be used only when the inconsistent positions are tantamount to a knowing misrepresentation to or even fraud on the court.\u201d <em>Krystal Cadillac-Oldsmobile GMC Truck, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>337 F.3d 314, 319-20 (3d Cir.2003) (citation omitted). We do not think that Jones\u2019s attempts to find an alternative avenue of relief in the face of removal are properly characterized as a \"knowing misrepresentation\u201d or \"fraud on the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. As noted earlier, the reason that former \u00a7 212(c) is of no help to Jones now is that her attempts to overturn her 2005 state court conviction for petit larceny (which former \u00a7 212(c) does not reach) fell through.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
