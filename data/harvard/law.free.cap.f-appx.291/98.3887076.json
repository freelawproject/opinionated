Cooper argues that the district court erred in allowing the use of DNA evidence at trial where the government failed to comply with discovery obligations as set forth in Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the joint discovery statement and local rules. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-21\">The record shows that the government disclosed the DNA materials as soon as the materials were received, which was six days before the trial began and eight days before the government\u2019s DNA expert testified. Cooper has not shown how the lateness of the disclosure prejudiced his defense to the extent that he was \u201cprevented from receiving his constitutionally guaranteed fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, 588 </em>F.2d 1242, 1247 (9th Cir.1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Miller, </em>529 F.2d 1125, 1128 (9th Cir.1976)). As a result, we do not have \u201ca definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment,\u201d <em>United States v. Benavidez-Benavidez, </em>217 F.3d 720, 723 (9th Cir.2000), when it decided to admit the DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b122-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
