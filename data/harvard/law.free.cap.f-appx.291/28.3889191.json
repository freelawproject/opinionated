The district court granted a Certificate of Appealability with respect to one issue. We decline to expand the Certificate of Appealability to the other issues Thomas raises. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Shackleford v. Hubbard, </em>234 F.3d 1072, 1077 (9th Cir.2000). Under AEDPA, we will only grant a petition for writ of habeas corpus if the state court\u2019s ruling was contrary to, or an unreasonable determination of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We affirm the denial of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Thomas argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him when the trial court admitted the transcript of a witness\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing. Thomas contends that the admission of the transcript was improper because the witness was not unavailable. To show that a witness is unavailable, the government must first make a good faith effort to secure the witness\u2019s attendance at trial. <em>Barber v. Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 724-25, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968). However, \u201c[t]he law does not require the doing of a futile act.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 74, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). \u201c \u2018The lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness ... is a question of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 189 n. 22, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (Harlan, J. concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The Nevada Supreme Court determined that the prosecution made a good faith effort to obtain the witness. Under the circumstances of this case, the determination that the witness was unavailable\u2014 an elderly, dying man, living with his son in Texas, who had previously expressed that he would not comply with a subpoena, that he would go to jail before he would testify and refused to return to Nevada\u2014 was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">The state court\u2019s conclusion that Thomas had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing also was not contrary to o\u00edan unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 73, 100 S.Ct. 2531 (requiring there to have been an adequate opportunity for cross-examination before a transcript will be admitted in lieu of live testimony). At the preliminary hearing, Thomas\u2019s counsel asked several questions regarding identification. Counsel claims that he was missing certain records that he wanted to use in his cross-examination, but \u201cno inquiry into [the] \u2018effectiveness\u2019 \u201d of a cross-examination is required. <em>Id. </em>at 73 n. 12, 100 S.Ct. 2531. There was an opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary healing and Thomas\u2019s counsel took advantage of it. According to the Nevada Supreme Court, \u201ccounsel was able to cross-examine the witness extensively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
