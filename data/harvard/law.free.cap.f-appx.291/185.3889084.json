McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b209-28\">Jesus Manuel Lechuga-Carrillo, a native and citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>one-count information charging him with a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2), reentry of a removed alien previously convicted of a felony. He was sentenced to six months in prison, below the advisory range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He timely appealed his sentence. His counsel, James Baiamonte, filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and moved to withdraw as counsel. <em>See Anders v. </em>California 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo did not file a response. The government declined to submit a brief. Because we find that neither Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo nor his counsel raises any non-frivolous issues on appeal, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">I. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Under <em>Anders, </em>a court-appointed defense counsel who believes that any appeal would be \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d may request permission to withdraw, upon submission of a brief to the client and the court indicating \u201canything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. If we conclude, after a full examination of the record before us, that the appeal is frivolous, we may grant the motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief notes one possible basis for appeal. Counsel suggests that although Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo received a below-Guidelines sentence, he \u201ccould argue that his sentence was unreasonable and that the district judge did not adequately consider the statutory concerns other than the advisory guidelines expressed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing and the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) adopted by the court establish that the court\u2019s sentence was procedurally proper. The court fully considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and understood the advisory nature of the guidelines, as demonstrated by its conclusion that a below-Guidelines sentence was warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">After <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we review the substantive reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions, whether inside or outside the Guidelines, under a \u201cdeferential abuse-ofdiseretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 806 (10th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 591). A district court may, in its discretion, conclude that a non-Guidelines sentence best serves the purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a), on the condition that it \u201cprovide[s] reasoning sufficient to support the chosen variance.\u201d <em>Smart, </em>518 F.3d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">In this ease, nothing suggests that Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. At sentencing, the district court accepted the Guidelines calculation in Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo\u2019s PSR, which correctly determined that Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo\u2019s total adjusted offense level was ten. That offense level reflected a base level of eight, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), a four-point enhancement because Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo had previously been deported following a felony conviction, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D), and a two-point adjustment for Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo\u2019s criminal history category was II, owing to his prior felony conviction in Alabama for posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>sion of a forged instrument and a warrant that remained outstanding at the time of his arrest. Accordingly, Mr. LechugaCarrillo\u2019s Guidelines range was eight to fourteen months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The district court sentenced Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo to only six months\u2019 imprisonment. In so doing, it adopted a finding made in the PSR. that Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo\u2019s criminal history category was overrepresented by his outstanding warrant, which resulted from his failure to pay a court-ordered fine in connection with a prior felony conviction. This warrant, however, was quashed when the district attorney was informed that the defendant had been deported following the initial conviction. Had the warrant not been issued, Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo would not have been under a criminal justice sentence when he illegally reentered the United States, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(m), and would therefore not have received two points on his criminal history score, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1. As a result, the PSR recommended and the district court concluded that a criminal history category of I was more reflective of Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo\u2019s criminal history. This suggested a Guidelines range of six to twelve months. Mr. Lechuga-Carrillo was sentenced at the bottom of this range.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Given that the district court provided reasoning sufficient to support its downward departure in this case, we see no plausible grounds for arguing that imposing an already below-Guidelines sentence was beyond the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Finding no non-frivolous arguments on appeal, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. The appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b209-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ue consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and lOthCir.
