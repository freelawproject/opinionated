Stockton, </em>219. Fed.Appx. 660 (9th Cir. 2007). The district court conducted a second sentencing hearing, at which it took testimony from a clinical psychologist regarding the psychologist\u2019s examination of the appellant, and re-sentenced appellant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">Counsel for the appellant has filed an opening brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) and represents that no non-frivolous issues are presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">A review of the record and the opening brief indicates that the questions raised in this appeal are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">Accordingly, appellee\u2019s unopposed motion for summary affirmance is granted. Counsel Terence M. Ryan, Esq.\u2019s motion to be relieved as counsel for the appellant is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-19\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b69-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
