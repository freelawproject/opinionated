Burnett appeals from his conviction for public lewdness on federal property, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 668dd and 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.83, following a jury trial before a magistrate judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the magistrate judge\u2019s instruction to the jury \u2014 that the requirement that the lewd conduct would offend or alarm means that the \u201cconduct would offend or alarm the observer of the conduct or anyone else who was likely to observe the conduct\u201d\u2014 was over-broad in that it used an objective rather than a subjective test, even though the actual observer of Burnett\u2019s conduct was an undercover operative who was present at the refuge to observe precisely such conduct. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-20\">We review the legal correctness of a jury instruction <em>de novo. United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir. 2000). We review alleged errors in a jury instruction to determine whether the court\u2019s charge, considered as a whole, sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues involved and were not misled. <em>United States v. Shores, </em>966 F.2d 1383, 1386 (11th Cir.1992) (internal quotations omitted). If the instructions accurately reflect the law, we give the trial judge wide discretion in determining the style and wording of the instructions. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 846 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-21\">Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to administer the National Wildlife Refuge System \u201cfor the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 668dd(a)(l)-(2). Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary promulgated regulations governing the National Wildlife Refuge System, one of which prohibits visitors from performing \u201c[a]ny act of indecency or disorderly conduct as defined by State or local laws ... on any national wildlife refuge.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.83. Burnett was convicted of public lewdness while on the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge in Decatur, Alabama, in violation of this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-22\">The Alabama Code states that an individual commits the offense of public lewdness if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>(1) He exposes his anus or genitals in a public place and <em>is reckless about whether another may be present </em>who will be offended or alarmed by this act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">(2) He does any lewd act in a public place <em>which he knows is likely to be observed by others </em>who would be affronted or alarmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-130(a)(l), (2) (1975) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We find no merit to Burnett\u2019s challenge to the jury instruction. The language used by the magistrate judge in the instruction \u2014 including \u201canyone else who was likely to observe the conduct\u201d \u2014 adequately denoted the meaning of the Alabama law on public lewdness, <em>see id., </em>so as not to mislead the jury. <em>See Shores, </em>966 F.2d at 1386. Indeed, the jury heard the undercover operative who observed Burnett\u2019s conduct testify about the incident. The officer said that while he was conducting observation at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, Burnett stopped approximately a foot and a half from him, had a brief, \u201cgeneral conversation\u201d with him, and then grew silent for approximately 10 seconds before unzipping his pants, exposing his penis, masturbating, and asking the officer to perform oral sex on him. The officer further testified that the incident was \u201cupsetting.\u201d Thus, under either the magistrate\u2019s wording, or that of the Alabama statute, the trial testimony established the offense of public lewdness.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Moreover, while Burnett argues that the commentary to Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-68 suggests that only a subjective test should be applied to indecent exposure and other offenses in chapter 6, that commentary expressly differentiates the crime of indecent exposure from that of public lewdness, as the offense of public lewdness is itself contained in chapter 12, concerning \u201cOffenses Against Public Health and Morals.\u201d <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-130 (1975). For these reasons, the magistrate judge did not err in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-17\">. Burnett consented at his arraignment to trial before a magistrate judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). Although he moved to withdraw that consent, the district court denied his motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
