We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">Gonzalez\u2019s trial concluded on November 1, 1994, when a jury found him guilty. On January 11, 1996, Judge Knapp sentenced Gonzalez principally to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. On April 4, 1997, we affirmed Gonzalez\u2019s conviction but vacated and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>110 F.3d 936 (2d Cir. 1997). On October 15, 1999, following the remand, but prior to resentencing, Gonzalez filed a post-conviction motion with Judge Knapp claiming that his trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective because of a <em>per se </em>conflict of interest. Gonzalez alternatively styled his motion as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, or a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 2255. On September 25, 2003, after an evidentiary hearing, Judge Knapp denied the motion in a written decision, alternatively as untimely and on the merits. The case was then reassigned to then-Chief Judge Mukasey. Gonzalez filed a motion seeking Judge Mukasey\u2019s recusal and seeking to vacate Judge Knapp\u2019s September 25, 2003 opinion and order. On March 22, 2006, Judge Mukasey denied Gonzalez\u2019s motions in a written decision and order. Judge Mukasey found that jurisdiction existed under Section 2241 for Judge Knapp\u2019s September 25, 2003 opinion and order. On August 30, 2006, Judge Mukasey reached the sole issue presented by our earlier mandate and resentenced Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">Gonzalez first challenges the merits of Judge Knapp\u2019s decision to deny his new trial motion. We need not reach these arguments, because Judge Knapp correctly ruled that the Rule 33 motion was untimely. Gonzalez\u2019s Rule 33 motion, filed more than five years after the jury verdict, far exceeded the seven-day time limit for motions for a new trial on any ground other than newly discovered evidence set forth in Rule 33. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 33(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Although Gonzalez styled his motion in the alternative as a Section 2241 petition or a Section 2255 motion, his motion could not have been so adjudicated. We addressed this same issue in <em>Stantini v. United States, </em>where the defendant, \u201c[wjhile in custody following his conviction but before he was sentenced ... filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 and what was styled a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255 (the \u201cInitial Motion\u201d), both seeking a new trial.\u201d 140 F.3d 424, 425 (2d Cir. 1998). In <em>Stantini, </em>we addressed whether, though styled as a Section 2255 motion and adjudicated as such, the motion was in fact made under Section 2255. We held that it was not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">Applying the statutory language of \u00a7 2255 to this case, it becomes immediately clear that the Initial Motion was not a motion made pursuant to \u00a7 2255. The statute explicitly states that \u201c[a] prisoner in custody <em>under sentence of a co\u00ed\u00edrt </em>\u201d may bring such a motion, for the purpose of vacating, setting aside, or correcting <em>\u201cthe sentence.\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (emphasis added). Simply, as [the defendant] was not in custody under a sentence at the time he filed the Initial Motion and at the time that motion was decided, it is not properly considered a \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 426 (emphasis in original). Because Gonzalez made the motion while awaiting resentencing, and hence not while \u201cunder sentence of a court,\u201d the motion was not made under Section 2255. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, because the motion named the United States rather than Gonzalez\u2019s custodian as the respondent, was brought in the Southern District even though he was held in the Eastern District, and challenged the validity of his conviction rather than the execution of his sentence, it was not a petition brought under Section 2241. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 437,124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004) (\u201cWhenever a \u00a7 2241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge his present physical custody within the United States, he should name his warden as respondent and file the petition in the district of confinement.\u201d); <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>106 F.3d 472, 474 (2d Cir.1997) (noting that unless the savings clause of Section 2255 is invoked, Section 2241 allows one to bring only a \u201cchallenge to the <em>execution </em>of a sentence,\u201d not to challenge the conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In sum, the motion was brought under Rule 33 and it was untimely. The September 25, 2003 judgment on the merits of the Rule 33 motion, therefore, must be vacated. Because Judge Mukasey, in his March 22, 2006 decision and order, found that jurisdiction existed under Section 2241 and denied the motion to vacate the September 25, 2003 judgment, we vacate this aspect of the March 22, 2006 decision and order. We take no view on the merits of the Rule 33 motion, and Gonzalez may raise his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, without prejudice, in a future Section 2255 motion. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (noting that \u201cin most cases a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance\u201d); <em>see also Gelb v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>798 F.2d 38, 45 (2d Cir.1986) (\u201c[I]f an appeal is taken and the appellate court affirms on one ground and disregards the other, there is no collateral estoppel as to the unreviewed ground.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Gonzalez next challenges the district court\u2019s decision to impose a consecutive sentence. On December 7, 2000, Gonzalez was found guilty of a prison assault with a dangerous weapon. At the time of sentencing for the assault conviction, Gonzalez was in prison pursuant to the 1994 conviction now under consideration, but because his sentence for the 1994 offense had been vacated, he was not then under a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>for the 1994 conviction. On January 22, 2002, Judge Cote, the district judge who adjudicated the prison assault case, sentenced Gonzalez to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively to his sentence for the 1994 conviction. As Judge Mukasey recognized, however, this was error, because at the time of sentencing for the prison assault, Gonzalez was not yet under a sentence for the 1994 conviction. <em>See United States v. Donoso, </em>521 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\u201c[Section] 3584(a) does not authorize a district court to direct that a defendant\u2019s federal sentence run consecutively to a not-yet-imposed ... sentence.\u201d). Judge Mukasey, nonetheless, decided to give effect to Judge Cote\u2019s conclusion that the sentences should run consecutively. This was, in fact, the <em>only </em>reason Judge Mukasey gave for imposing a consecutive sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">The Court: Judge Cote I think made it clear that she thought that any sentence imposed in her case should be consecutive to the sentence imposed here. And just as I am not going to undo Judge Knapp\u2019s determination [that the evidence was insufficient to show that Gonzalez shot at the police officer], I\u2019m not going to undo hers neither [sic]. [Gonzalez\u2019s Counsel]: I want to point out that I think even the government realizes that she didn\u2019t have the authority to do that at the time because\u2014 The Court: That\u2019s correct. She did not have the authority to do it simply because no sentence had been imposed .... The point is that the only occasion for this is a series of misadventures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Thus, Judge Mukasey, in sole reliance on Judge Cote\u2019s errant decision, sentenced Gonzalez to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to the 150 months\u2019 imprisonment imposed by Judge Cote. This was error, if only because Judge Cote\u2019s decision was in error. Further, we \u201cquestion whether it was appropriate for Judge [Mukasey] to have hewed so closely to the [consecutive] sentence imposed on [Gonzalez, by Judge Cote] without making his own assessment of an appropriate sentence and exercising the sound judgment for which he is held in such high regard.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>524 F.3d 209, 216 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">We have carefully considered the remainder of Gonzalez\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court on the the term of imprisonment, the terms of supervised release and the special assessment, but we VACATE the decision to impose the sentence consecutively to his prior sentence and REMAND for further consideration of whether to make this sentence consecutive to, or concurrent with, the assault sentence. We VACATE the March 22, 2006 order of the district court with respect to the Rule 33 motion, VACATE the September 25, 2003 judgment, and DISMISS the Rule 33 motion as untimely.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
