He now appeals, contending that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because his advisory Guidelines range was based in part on facts found by the judge based on a preponderance of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Barrett\u2019s probation officer assigned a base offense level of 14. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(6)(A) (2007). Four levels were added because Barrett possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Six levels were added because the offense involved an assault on a law enforcement officer. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l). Three levels were subtracted based on Barrett\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. Barrett\u2019s total offense level was 21, his criminal history category was VI, and his advisory Guidelines range was 77-96 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">At sentencing, Barrett objected to the factual description of the offense in the presentence report (PSR) and to the enhancements for assault and using the firearm in connection with another felony. The district court heard testimony from Officer Joseph Sellers of the Sanford Police Department. Sellers testified that when he reached to pat down the right side of Barrett\u2019s body following a traffic stop, Barrett pulled out a firearm. The men struggled and fell to the ground. During the altercation, Barrett said to Sellers, \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Barrett fled the scene after Sellers pulled out his own weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">On the basis of this testimony, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the enhancements applied, and the court adopted the PSR. Barrett now contends that the enhancements were erroneously applied because the facts supporting them were neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We have held that a district court does not violate the Sixth Amendment by making such factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence as long as the factfinding does not enhance the sentence beyond the maximum term specified in the statute of conviction. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). <em>See also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Barrett\u2019s sentence does not exceed the ten-year statutory maximum to which he was subject. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Barrett\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (stating standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
