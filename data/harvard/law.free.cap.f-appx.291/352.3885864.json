Xiong Zheng, </em>Nos. A29 796 243 and A77 308 729 (B.I.A. Aug. 31, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-26\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-27\">As an initial matter, for substantially the reasons set forth in the BIA\u2019s decision, and pursuant to our recent decision in <em>Brito v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 160 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Cir.2008), we conclude that the BIA did not err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction over Guan\u2019s adjustment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Nevertheless, we hold that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. Once the BIA determined that Guan\u2019s case \u201cd[id] not fall within the narrow exception that would permit an Immigration Judge to consider an arriving alien\u2019s application for adjustment of status,\u201d it \u201cconclud[ed] that reopening [wa]s not warranted in this situation, and [Guan] must pursue an application for adjustment of status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) independent of these removal proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Sheng Gao Ni v. </em>BIA, 520 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2008), however, we rejected almost identical language by the BIA as providing an inadequate basis for denying the motion to reopen. Reasoning that \u201cwe have no doubt that petitioners sought to reopen and continue them removal proceedings and, at the same time, obtain an adjustment of status pursuant to the new regulations,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he BIA did not consider ... whether petitioners\u2019 new-found ability to file adjustment applications with the USCIS warranted a favorable exercise of its discretion to reopen and continue the proceedings and thereby lift the removal orders,\u201d we concluded that \u201cthe reason set forth by the BIA for its denial of the motions \u2014 a lack of jurisdiction over adjustment applications \u2014 was unresponsive to the relief petitioners sought and therefore did not provide a rational explanation for the denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, \u201cwe remand[ed] the[ ] cases to the BIA for reconsideration of whether</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">petitioners\u2019 motions to reopen warrant a favorable exercise of the BIA\u2019s discretion,\u201d instructing that BIA that should it \u201cdecide on remand to deny the motions, it must provide adequate reasons for doing so, thereby furnishing this Court with a meaningful opportunity to review any such denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Similarly, here, Guan has an approved labor petition, and as Guan\u2019s pending motion to remand to the USCIS demonstrates, what Guan actually seeks is to have his proceedings reopened so that his adjustment of status application may be adjudicated by whichever body retains jurisdiction to do so. The BIA, aside from its \u201crote recital of a jurisdictional statement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 129, did not provide \u201cadequate reasons\u201d for denying the motion to reopen to give this Court \u201ca meaningful opportunity to review\u201d its denial, <em>id. </em>at 131. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED. The BIA\u2019s decision is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot, and the pending motion to remand is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. We note that the cases are currently pending before the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">. Because we remand for reconsideration of the motion to reopen, we need not consider at this time the unrelated arguments raised in the petition for review. <em>See Sheng Gao Ni, </em>520 F.3d at 131 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
