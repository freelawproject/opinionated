No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, <em>as amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 105-139, 11 Stat. 2644, and denying his motion to adjust status pursuant to an approved visa petition. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, <em>see I.N.S. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 315, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying as untimely Barberena-Hernandez\u2019s motion to reopen because the motion was filed at least seven years after the deadline for relief under NACARA, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.43(e)(1) (requiring motions to reopen to apply for NACARA relief be filed by September 11, 1998), and nine years after the deadline relevant for adjustment of status, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (requiring motions to reopen be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision or by September 30, 1996). Barberena-Hernandez has failed to demonstrate that equitable tolling is appropriate in his ease. <em>Cf. Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (recognizing equitable tolling where an alien is prevented from timely filing a motion to reopen due to his counsel\u2019s deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.13(d)(5)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Because he did not exhaust the argument before the BIA, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Barberena\u2019s contention that he was eligible for equitable tolling on the basis of his receipt of employment authorization. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b881-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
