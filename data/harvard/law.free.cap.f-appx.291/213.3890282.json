R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">Defendant-Appellant Martin Gonzalez-Ochoa pleaded guilty to illegal reentry of a removed alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) and was sentenced to twenty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. His attorney filed a timely notice of appeal, followed by a brief and motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). After reviewing the record, we agree that there are no meritorious appellate issues. Accordingly, we GRANT the motion to withdraw and DISMISS Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b238-19\">In April 2007, a New Mexico border patrol agent spotted Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa in the desert near Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Upon being confronted, Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa admitted that he was a citizen of Mexico and did not have legal authority to enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa later pleaded guilty to a one-count information that charged him with reentry of a removed alien under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). At the plea colloquy, Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa acknowledged that a copy of the information had been read to him in Spanish. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>court fully explained the implications of a guilty plea, listing the constitutional rights that Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa would be waiving and explaining that he could be incarcerated for as long as twenty years. Before pleading guilty, Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa stated that he understood his rights and that he was not under the influence of medicine, drugs, or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that determined Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s total offense level to be IB. Specifically, the PSR set the base offense level at 8, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2; added eight levels because Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa had previously been deported after committing an aggravated felony, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3El.l(b). At sentencing, however, Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s attorney successfully argued that Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s prior felony conviction did not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d and thus warranted only a four-level upward adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D), rather than an eight-level upward adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). With the resulting offense level of 12, the maximum downward adjustment under \u00a7 3El.l(a) for accepting responsibility was two levels. Thus, Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s total offense level was set at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">With Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s criminal history at Level V, the advisory Guidelines recommended a sentence of 21-27 months. The district court sentenced him to twenty-one months. Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa then instructed his attorney to file notice of appeal to challenge his sentence. His attorney filed the appeal, along with an accompanying Anders brief, and provided a copy to Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa. He did not file a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The district court found that Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s plea was made freely, voluntarily and intelligently. The record contains nothing that contradicts this finding, and there is no indication that Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa wishes to challenge the plea itself. Therefore, the only issue for consideration on appeal is the length of Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">To begin, the district court properly calculated the advisory Guidelines range. As noted above, Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s base offense level was 8. The district court considered adding eight levels for Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s reentry after being deported for an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d but instead added only four levels for reentry after being deported for \u201cany other felony.\u201d The court also decreased the level by two for acceptance of responsibility. These adjustments created an offense level of 10, a level that Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s attorney, the government, and the district court all agreed was appropriate during the sentencing hearing. We, too, find no error in this calculation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>There is also nothing in the record to support the argument that the court failed to consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or that Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of those factors. The PSR includes a detailed description of Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s personal and family history, and the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, the district court sentenced Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa to twenty-one months \u2014 \u2022 the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range \u2014 and nothing in the record is sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to this within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Haley, </em>529 F.3d 1308, 1311 (10th Cir.2008). Therefore, after an independent review, we find no basis for Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa to challenge his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that no meritorious appellate issues exist. Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we DISMISS Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\">. Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa had previously been deported in September 2002, after he served a sentence for second-degree commercial burglary in California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">. In the government\u2019s response to Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa's sentencing memorandum, the \u25a0government calculates the offense level as 9, adding a one-level downward departure for \"participation in the government\u2019s fast-track program.\u201d Nothing in the record, however, suggests that Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa participated in a fast-track program. In addition, the record gives no indication that the government formally moved for a departure for early disposition, as is required under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. Finally, early disposition agreements require the defendant to waive his right to appeal. <em>United States v. Morales-Chaires, </em>430 F.3d 1124, 1127 (10th Cir.2005). Clearly, Mr. Gonzalez-Ochoa made no such waiver. For all of these reasons, the district court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>not err in failing to depart downward an additional level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
