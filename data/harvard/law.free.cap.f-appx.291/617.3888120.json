Stringer (\u201cStringer\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s final judgment of dismissal, arguing that (1) the magistrate and district court judges should have been disqualified; (2) the Defendants-Appellees violated the American with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq.; </em>(3) the district court erred in dismissing the complaint as frivolous; and (4) the magistrate judge failed to conduct an omnibus hearing. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-19\">\n<em>I. Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-20\">Stringer brought this suit against several defendants under the ADA and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. The crux of the complaint relates to Stringer\u2019s attempt to obtain more food stamps and grants for utility bills. Stringer alleged that certain defendants conspired to violate his civil rights and other defendants failed to write policies and procedures to prevent the conspiracy among defendants. Stringer requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u201c[i]ssue a Preliminary Injunction or a Temporary Restraining Order directing the defendants to pay the gas bill as they are already supposed to do!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Stringer moved to recuse the magistrate and district court judges. Stringer stated several reasons for the recusal, including that neither judge \u201cwould be fair to any white person.\u201d The magistrate judge entered an order denying the motion seeking her recusal. The district court judge did not enter an order expressly addressing the motion seeking his recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Stringer sought leave to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis. </em>The magistrate judge granted the motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and recommended that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous. The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) and entered a final judgment dismissing the action as frivolous. Stringer filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment, and the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. Stringer now appeals the judgment and orders denying the motions for recusal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">A. Motions to Recuse</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Stringer filed motions to recuse both the district court judge and the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455. Both judges denied the motions to recuse, although the district court judge\u2019s denial was implicit in the final judgment dismissing the action. <em>See Norman v. Apache Corp., </em>19 F.3d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Webber v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 335, 337 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished) (\u201cThe denial of the recusal motion was implicit in the entry of final judgment dismissing the complaint.\u201d) (citation omitted). We review denials of motions to recuse for abuse of disci\u2019etion. <em>Andrade v. Chojnacki, </em>338 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Under \u00a7 455, a federal judge \u201cshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). A judge must also disqualify himself under various circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 455(b). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 455(b). Under \u00a7 144, a judge must reassign a case when a party \u201cmakes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 144; <em>see Davis v. Bd. of Sch. Comm\u2019rs, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1051 (5th Cir.1975) (\u201c[T]he judge must pass on the legal sufficiency of the affidavit, but may not pass on the truth of the matters alleged.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">The facts stated in Stringer\u2019s affidavits are not legally sufficient to support a l\u2019ecusal motion under either recusal statute. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motions to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">B. Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997). We find that Stringer\u2019s claims are legally frivolous, and the district court did not abuse its discretion. Stringei\u2019\u2019s remaining assignments of eiTor are without merit. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-17\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s final judgment, including the denial of String<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>er\u2019s motions for recusal. Stringer also filed a motion for appointment of counsel, which is DENIED. This appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-10\">. Stringer's notice of appeal does not mention the orders denying the motions for recusal, but we will review those orders as sufficiently related to the final judgment. <em>See Trust Co. of </em>La. v. <em>N.N.P. Inc., </em>104 F.3d 1478, 1485 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[A]n appeal from a final judgment sufficiently preserves all prior orders intertwined with the final judgment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
