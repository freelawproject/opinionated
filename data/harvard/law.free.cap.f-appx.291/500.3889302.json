Hall\u2019s plea agreement reads: \u201cDefendant waives any right to appeal from any sentence within or below the advisory guidelines range resulting from an adjusted offense level of 35.\u201d (SJA 137, emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>original). The district court conducted Hall\u2019s plea hearing in compliance with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 and specifically reviewed Hall\u2019s above waiver. Hall was sentenced to 135 months of imprisonment, based on an offense level of 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Hall appeals, alleging that the district court erred by failing to give him a sentence reduction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5C1.2 (2006). The Government responds that Hall has waived his right to contest his sentence. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We review de novo whether a defendant has effectively waived his right to appeal. <em>United, States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo the right to appeal. <em>United, States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1146 (4th Cir.1995). Our review of the plea hearing reveals that Hall knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his instant sentence. <em>Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d at 1146. The district court fully questioned Hall regarding his waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy at his plea hearing, <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir. 1991), and based on an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, we find the waiver enforceable. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Accordingly, because Hall has waived his right to contest his 135-month sentence on appeal and he raises no issues falling outside the scope of that waiver, we dismiss. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
