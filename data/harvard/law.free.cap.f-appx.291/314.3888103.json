On appeal, Lamonds argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial during his trial, after the government improperly commented on his post-arrest silence; and (2) his total sentence was unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial based on a comment on a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>United States v. Dodd, </em>111 F.3d 867, 869 (11th Cir.1997). We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">First, we find no merit to Lamonds\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial after two of the government\u2019s questions during direct examination and its statements during closing argument amounted to a comment on his constitutional right to remain silent. \u201cA defendant is entitled to a grant of mistrial only upon a showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1352 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cImproper statements prejudice the defendant when there is a reasonable probability that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s offending remarks, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1252 (11th Cir.2005) (alterations and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">A prosecutor\u2019s \u201cuse for impeachment purposes of [a defendant\u2019s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, violate[s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). A <em>Doyle </em>violation occurs when \u201cthe statement was manifestly intended or was of such character that a jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of an accused to testify.\u201d <em>Chastain, </em>198 F.3d at 1351. \u201cThe question is not whether the jury possibly or even probably would view the remark in this manner, but whether the jury necessarily would have done so.\u201d <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>66 F.3d 1146, 1163 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation and emphasis omitted). The remark must be considered in context to determine the prosecutor\u2019s motive and the impact upon the jury. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Dodd, </em>111 F.3d at 869, we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial because the prosecutor\u2019s comments about what the defendant did not say could reasonably have been interpreted as referring to an inconsistency between the defendant\u2019s theory of defense and his post-arrest statement. <em>Id. </em>at 869-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">At Lamonds\u2019s trial, the prosecutor argued in his opening statement that Lamonds had made some comments when he was getting his fingerprints taken, including the admission, \u201cin effect,\u201d that \u201cI\u2019m screwed, I knew better than to be doing this stuff.\u201d Lamonds\u2019s counsel, in his opening statement, in turn argued that these comments could be interpreted as meaning that Lamonds had made a \u201cbad mistake\u201d in getting involved with two drug-dealers, even though he did not have anything to do with the drugs. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Michael Clear subsequently testified at the trial to the comments that Lamonds had made. After this testimony, the government asked Agent Clear, \u201cNow, did he say anything about being sorry he came down to Panama City on spring break or summer break?\u201d Clear replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The government asked, \u201cDid he say anything about not being involved in what was going on in the motel room?\u201d Clear replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecutor reiterated the substance of these questions and answers in the closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In the context of Lamonds\u2019s trial, the prosecutor\u2019s comments are reasonably interpreted to be in reference to an inconsistency between Lamonds\u2019s post-arrest statements and his theory of defense. <em>See Dodd, </em>111 F.3d at 869-70. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not prohibited comments on Lamonds\u2019s right to remain silent. Moreover, even if we were to conclude that a <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred, Lamonds has not showed any resulting substantial prejudice, since there was clear testimony about Lamonds\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy from two cooperating witnesses. <em>See Chastain, </em>198 F.3d at 1352; <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1252. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Lamonds\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">We also reject Lamonds\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not proeedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">As the record shows, the district court correctly calculated the guideline ranges, heard the arguments of the parties, and said that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guideline range. The district court also explained that it was varying below the guidelines range in recognition of Lamonds\u2019s limited participation in the offense and the sentencing disparity with his co-conspirator, while taking into account Lamonds\u2019s status as a career offender and the statutory sentencing goals of deterrence and protection of the public. Although the district court did not discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors individually, \u201cthe district court need only acknowledge that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (internal quotation and punctuation omitted); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). Thus, Lamonds has not shown that the district court committed any procedural error in imposing his sentence. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Nor has Lamonds shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. As noted above, the district court considered Lamonds\u2019s arguments regarding the sentencing disparity with his co-conspirator and his limited participation in the offense, and then varied downward 120 months from the low end of the guideline range because of those factors. In light of the needs for deterrence and protection of the public cited by the district court and Lamonds\u2019s criminal history, Lamonds has not demonstrated that his below-guidelines sentence was unreasonable. This is especially true given that reasonableness review is deferential, and there is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Lamonds\u2019s 300-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
