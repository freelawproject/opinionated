Because Romero already had at least two felony convictions for crimes of violence, the district court found that he qualified as a career offender, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and sentenced him to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. Romero filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed attorney has moved to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Romero did not respond to our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(B), and so we confine our review to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief, <em>see United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-22\">Counsel first considers whether Romero could argue that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Counsel, though, is unable to articulate any conceivable disagreement with the court\u2019s ruling, and nor are we. A defendant convicted of committing a crime of violence or controlled substance offense qualifies as a career offender if he was at least 18 years old at the time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>already had two or more felony convictions for such crimes. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a); <em>United States v. Rice, </em>520 F.3d 811, 820 (7th Cir. 2008). Romero is 36, and his felony convictions for threatening to murder a magistrate judge and threatening to harm a corrections supervisor are crimes of violence, <em>see United States v. Ladwig, </em>432 F.3d 1001, 1005 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that a threat to harm another person is a crime of violence); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include any offense having as an element the \u201cthreatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d), which Romero did not dispute at sentencing. Thus, any argument that Romero is not a career offender would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Counsel next contemplates challenging the reasonableness of Romero\u2019s 96-month prison sentence but concludes that any such argument would be frivolous. We agree. A sentence within a correctly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>516 F.3d 553, 556 (7th Cir.2008). In assessing reasonableness, we ask whether the district court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>518 F.3d 494, 496 (7th Cir.2008). Here, the district court properly calculated a guidelines range of 77 to 96 months and imposed a term within that range after taking into account the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), including Romero\u2019s criminal history, mental illnesses, and the danger he presents to others. Counsel cannot identify any basis for concluding that Romero\u2019s sentence might be the exception to <em>Rita\u2019s </em>presumption of reasonableness, nor can we.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">To the extent that counsel has assessed whether Romero was adequately represented in the district court, any potential claim about his lawyer\u2019s performance would be better pursued in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because the claim would turn on matters not in the record, <em>see, e.g., Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>469 F.3d 1074, 1075 n. 1 (7th Cir.2006), and because Romero is still represented by the same lawyer, <em>see United States v. Rezin, </em>322 F.3d 443, 445 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">For the above reasons, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
