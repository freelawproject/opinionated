Lamb denying Lin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re Lin, </em>Nos. A 98 694 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>306/307 (B.I.A. July 11, 2007), <em>affg </em>Nos. A 98 694 306/307 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 2, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400-02 (2d Cir.2005). When the BIA adopts the conclusions of the IJ and upholds the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, but does so for reasons that differ at least in part from the reasons cited in the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA, provided that the BIA\u2019s supplemental findings do not extend beyond the scope of its review under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv). <em>See Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>446 F.3d 289, 293, 296 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Petitioner\u2019s claim for relief rests on three assertions: (I) that she practices Falun Gong and as a result suffered persecution in China, (ii) that the Chinese government forced her to have an abortion, and (iii) that because she has two children she would be subject to forced sterilization if she returns to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The IJ\u2019s decision detailed specific flaws in petitioner\u2019s testimony and other evidence, including inconsistencies about the timeline of events, about her parents\u2019 knowledge of the alleged Falun Gong activities of a woman who shared their house with petitioner, and about the Chinese authorities\u2019 alleged harassment of petitioner but not petitioner\u2019s parents for harboring a Falun Gong practitioner. In light of these flaws, a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to conclude that petitioner\u2019s Falun Gong claim was based on credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The IJ also found that petitioner\u2019s claim to have been forced to undergo an abortion while in China was not credible. The IJ reasoned that because petitioner\u2019s Falun Gong testimony was not credible, \u201ctherefore [the IJ does not] have any basis to believe her abortion story either.\u201d The IJ immediately went on to note that petitioner had failed to provide credible \u201cother evidence\u201d to corroborate her claim. The IJ pointed out that the principal piece of corroboration offered \u2014 a \u201cFamily-Planning Operation Certificate\u201d from China\u2014 was unauthenticated. Moreover, the certificate did not show that the \u201cabortion\u201d was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">As our Court noted in <em>Sieive v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160 (2d Cir.2007), we have \u201cfrequently\u201d held that \u201can IJ\u2019s application of the maxim <em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus </em>[false in one thing, false in everything] may at times be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170. Because \u201c[i]n the immigration context, corroborating evidence is often limited, and the petitioner\u2019s credibility is almost always crucial, ... a single instance of false testimony may (if attributable to the petitioner) infect the balance of the alien\u2019s uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201c[a]n IJ may, either expressly or impliedly, rely on <em>falsus in uno </em>to discredit evidence that does not benefit from corroboration or authentication independent of the petitioner\u2019s <em>own </em>credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not believe that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that petitioner\u2019s abortion claim remained credible despite petitioner\u2019s lack of credibility in advancing her Falun Gong claim and the lack of corroborating evidence for the abortion claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>We therefore agree with the IJ\u2019s determination on this point.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The IJ also held that petitioner\u2019s having two children was insufficient grounds for granting her political asylum. The BIA affirmed that holding, and we concur. To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must show that he or she has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). To establish asylum eligibility based on future persecution, an applicant must \u201cpresent credible testimony that he subjectively fears persecution and establish that his fear is objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 178. Here, petitioner alleges that she would be subject to persecution in China on account of her currently having more than one child. However, the sole evidence that she provides in support of this assertion is her allegation that the Chinese government forced her to have an abortion. Because the IJ and BIA found that petitioner\u2019s abortion claim was not credible and their finding satisfied the substantial-evidence standard, petitioner has not carried her burden of demonstrating either past persecution or an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Moreover, because petitioner\u2019s claim under the Convention Against Torture rests upon her assertion that she was forced to have an abortion in China, that assertion\u2019s lack of credibility vitiates the Convention claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Petitioner also applied for withholding of removal, which the IJ denied. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Because an applicant who seeks withholding of removal faces an even greater burden than an applicant who seeks asylum, we have held that \u201can applicant who cannot establish his eligibility for asylum is necessarily unable to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Since petitioner has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, <em>a fortiori </em>she has also failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\">. Because Hong Rong Lin\u2019s application was completely derivative of the application of his wife, Zhao Ting Lin, this order refers only to Zhao Ting Lin (\"Lin\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-22\">. Petitioners expressly waive any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of Hong Rong Lin's motion to remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">. A terse and ambiguous footnote in the BIA opinion stated that the IJ's determination here was \u201charmless error.\u201d The BIA's grounds for reaching that conclusion are difficult to discern, but we need not resolve that question because, as the BIA itself acknowledged, the sum of the reasons mentioned by the IJ are sufficient to enable a reasonable adjudicator to conclude that petitioner's abortion claim was not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
