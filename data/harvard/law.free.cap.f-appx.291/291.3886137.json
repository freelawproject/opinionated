He entered the United States on a date unknown to the Government, and on December 10, 2002, submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not the Department of Homeland Security, an application for asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-21\">A Notice to Appear issued on September 8, 2003, charging Petitioner with removability as being an alien inadmissible by law on several grounds. On February 11, 2004, Petitioner, through counsel, admitted that he was removable as alleged in the Notice to Appear, and eleven days later an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) heard his application, denied it, and ordered him removed. Petitioner appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), and on June 8, 2006, it adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. On April 19, 2007, Petitioner, through substitute counsel, moved the BIA to reissue its June 8 decision \u2014 on the ground that he had not received the June 8 decision due to the ineffectiveness of his lawyer who failed to notify him of the decision \u2014 and to grant a stay of removal. Athough counsel asked the BIA to reissue the June 8 decision, it effectively asked the BIA to reopen Petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">On October 17, 2007, the BIA granted the motion in an order that effectively vacated the June 8 decision and reinstated Petitioner\u2019s appeal on its own motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), and then issued a final order of removal as of October 17, incorporating by reference the text of the vacated June 8 order. In the same October 17 order, the BIA denied Petitioner\u2019s request for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">On November 16, 2007, Petitioner, through current counsel, filed a petition with this court, seeking review of the BIA\u2019s October 17 decision. He argues that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen based on the ineffectiveness of his counsel in his hearing before the IJ. The Government argues that Petitioner has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s order adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Petitioner has abandoned any challenge he may have to the BIA\u2019s October 17 order because his brief does not address that order. The Government further argues that we lack jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s February 17 order denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We review \u201cquestions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). We have jurisdiction to determine the jurisdictional facts. <em>Id. </em>While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and (b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen because Petitioner did not file a timely petition for review of that order with this court. To the extent that Petitioner seeks review of the BIA\u2019s order adopting and affirming the IJ removal order, his petition is denied. To the extent that he seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">DENIED, in part; DISMISSED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
