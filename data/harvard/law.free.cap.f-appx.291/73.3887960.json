Although the plain language of Rule 4 directs us to consider only whether the \u201cjudgment or order appealed from\u201d is entered in a \u201ccivil case\u201d or \u201ccriminal case,\u201d our precedents dictate that we must engage in a more searching analysis. We have rejected the \u201cconclusory rationale\u201d that merely because a motion is made in a criminal case, the appeal must be governed by the rule for criminal cases, Rule 4(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>United States v. Braunstein, </em>281 F.3d 982, 993 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we have held that where \u201cthe order appealed from is civil in nature, the civil notice of appeal provision set out in Rule 4(a) will apply, even if the order arises from a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Ono, </em>72 F.3d 101, 102 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Plechner, </em>577 F.2d 596, 598 (9th Cir.1978) (holding that a motion by the government in a criminal case to enforce a bond forfeiture was civil, not criminal, in nature, and therefore the appeal was governed by the rule for civil cases, Rule 4(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">In this case, although the government filed its \u00a7 2044 motion within a criminal case, we conclude that the district court\u2019s \u00a7 2044 order is \u201ccivil in nature\u201d for three reasons. First, the government filed its \u00a7 2044 motion in order to enforce the restitution order entered against Luong. The enforcement of a restitution order is civil in nature. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(m)(l)(A)(i) (an order of restitution may be enforced in the manner provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>for in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613, i.e., \u201cin accordance with the practices and procedures for the enforcement of a civil judgment under Federal law or State law\u201d). Second, the enforcement of bond forfeitures under Rule 46(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are \u201ccivil case[s]\u201d under Rule 4, even though they arise in the context of criminal proceedings. <em>See United States v. Vaccaro, </em>51 F.3d 189, 191 (9th Cir.1995). Like a bond forfeiture action under Rule 46(f), a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2044 is an attempt to resolve the government\u2019s right to obtain monies pledged on behalf of the defendant. This is a civil financial issue arising from a criminal prosecution. Finally, the policy reason for applying the time frame for criminal appeals is not implicated. As we noted in <em>Braunstein, </em>\u201cthe statute of limitations to file an appeal in a criminal case is short because of the significant liberty interest at stake.\u201d 281 F.3d at 993. However, motions relating to a defendant\u2019s financial interests do not implicate analogous liberty interests. <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Truesdale, </em>211 F.3d 898, 903 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that a district court\u2019s order denying a criminal defendant the right to obtain attorneys\u2019 fees was a civil matter governed by Rule 4(a))). Therefore, we conclude that the government\u2019s appeal in Case No. 07-50161 is timely because it was an appeal in a \u201ccivil case\u201d within the meaning of Rule 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Because the government\u2019s notice of appeal was timely in Case No. 07-50161, the filing of the notice of appeal was an event of \u201cjurisdictional significance\u201d that \u201cdivest[ed] the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\u201d <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982). Therefore, the district court did not have jurisdiction to dismiss the government\u2019s notice of appeal in this case. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s dismissal of the government\u2019s notice of appeal in Case No. 07-50161.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">On the merits, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the government\u2019s \u00a7 2044 motion. Section 2044 provides that \u201c[o]n motion of the United States attorney, the court shall order any money belonging to and deposited by or on behalf of the defendant with the court for the purposes of a criminal appearance bail bond\u201d to be held and paid toward the fulfillment of \u201cany assessment, fine, restitution, or penalty imposed upon the defendant.\u201d On October 10, 2006, the district court entered a stipulated order stating that \u201cdefendant\u2019s bond should be exonerated upon his surrender to the Bureau of Prisons to begin his sentence of imprisonment.\u201d Luong surrendered to the Bureau of Prisons on November 8, 2006. Therefore, pursuant to the district court\u2019s order, Luong\u2019s bond was \u201cexonerated\u201d as of November 8, 2006. The government did not file its \u00a7 2044 motion until December 19, 2006. Thus, at the time the government made its \u00a7 2044 motion, Luong did not have any money \u201cdeposited ... with the court for the purposes of a criminal appearance bail bond.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044. Because Luong\u2019s money had already been exonerated, \u00a7 2044 was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The government contends that \u00a7 2044 remained applicable because the bond funds at issue were still in the physical possession of the district court when the government made its \u00a7 2044 motion. However, the district court clerk\u2019s delay in executing the district court\u2019s order does not have legal significance for purposes of \u00a7 2044. District court clerks have no authority to exonerate defendants\u2019 bail bonds, <em>see United States v. Felix-Meza, </em>825 F.2d 1334, 1336 (9th Cir.1987), and by the same token have no authority to retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>monies on deposit for purposes of a defendant\u2019s bail bond after the bond has been exonerated. Once the district court entered the stipulated order and discharged its mandatory obligation to exonerate the surety and release any bail, <em>see </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 46(g), there were no longer any funds \u201cdeposited by or on behalf of the defendant with the court for the purposes of a criminal appearance bail bond,\u201d and so the government\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2044 was to no avail. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of the government\u2019s \u00a7 2044 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Vacated in part and Affirmed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b98-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
