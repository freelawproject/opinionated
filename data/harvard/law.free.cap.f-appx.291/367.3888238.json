The District Court sentenced him principally to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. He challenges that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Saunders argues that the district court erred by treating his previous New York State youthful offender adjudication\u2014 which stemmed from a robbery committed when he was 17 years old \u2014 as an \u201cadult conviction\u201d under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1. Under that Guideline, Saunders was eligible for a base offense level of 24 if the charged offense (the weapon possession) was committed after Saunders had \u201csustain[ed] at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d The robbery was one of the two felony convictions on which the Probation Department relied in recommending base level of 24. The government subsequently supported that position, and the district court adopted it. An offense committed prior to the age of 18 may be counted towards the two convictions only \u201cif it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, App. Note 1. Because the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines raises a purely legal question, we review its decision <em>de novo. United States v. Matthews, </em>205 F.3d 544, 545 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In <em>United States v. Cuello, </em>357 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2004), we held that \u201cdetermining whether a New York youthful offender adjudication is \u2018classified as an adult conviction under the laws of New York for the purpose of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 requires \u2018district courtfs] to examine the substance of the prior conviction at issue; to focus on the nature of the proceedings, the sentences received, and the actual time served.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168-69 (quoting <em>United States v. Driskell, </em>277 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir.2002)). Here, those factors support the district court\u2019s determination. Saunders was convicted in an adult court of a felony crime of violence, and the probationary term he received was supervised by the Department of Probation, which monitors adult probationers.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In prior cases, we have specifically focused on whether an offender served his time in an adult prison. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pereira, </em>465 F.3d 515, 522 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cUpon consideration of all the circumstances, with particular focus on the fact that the defendant was convicted in an adult court and served his sentence in an adult facility, we find that the district court\u2019s treatment of his youthful offender adjudication as an \u2018adult conviction\u2019 for purposes of calculating the offense level under the Unlawful Reentry Guideline was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d); <em>Driskell, </em>277 F.3d at 157. The import of that factor is ambiguous in the case before us. Saunders was not originally sentenced to serve any time on the robbery adjudication, but he later violated this probation and was sentenced to a term in custody. The government has been unable to demonstrate where he served it, but has presented evidence that it was \u201clikely\u201d served at Riker\u2019s Island \u2014 an adult prison, albeit one with a separate facility for youth. Saunders, meanwhile, did not provide any evidence about where he served his sentence, despite being given the opportunity to do so. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>504 F.3d 250, 253 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). In any event, we have explicitly disclaimed the notion \u201cthat a district court must make a finding of fact on the issue of where a defendant served his youthful offender sentence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 253, and thus the district court\u2019s failure to do so here is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Saunders argues that our decision in <em>Cuello </em>was incorrect and should be revisited by this Court <em>en banc. </em>This we, as a panel, cannot do. <em>United States v. Brutus, </em>505 F.3d 80, 87 n. 5 (2d Cir.2007). Alternatively, Saunders asks us to certify to the New York Court of Appeals the question of whether New York classifies a youthful offender adjudication as an adult conviction. In light of <em>Cuello, </em>however, we cannot conclude that we lack sufficient precedents to make a determination. <em>Tinelli v. Redl, </em>199 F.3d 603, 606 n. 5 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s claims and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
