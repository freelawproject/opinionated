Randolph filed a previous application for a period of disability and/or disability insurance benefits in 2001. The prior ALJ denied his application, finding that he could perform sedentary work, and as such was not disabled. Randolph filed the present application in 2004. On appeal, Randolph argues that the ALJ erred by (1) failing to adopt the prior final determinations on his severity of impairments and residual functional capacity based on the principle of <em>res judicata; </em>(2) failing to fully consider the evidence relating to his spinal condition; and (3) improperly evaluating his subjective complaints of pain and finding him not entirely credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r, </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.... Even if the evidence preponderates against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59 (quotation omitted). In conducting this review, we may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cWith respect to the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions, however, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d Lewis v. Barnart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The Social Security Act directs that \u201c[t]he findings and decisions of the Commissioner ... after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h). However, the Act also gives the Commissioner the authority to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">make rules and regulations and to establish procedures ... which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such provisions, and shall adopt reasonable and proper rules and regulations to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and evidence and the method of taking and furnishing the same in order to establish the right to benefits hereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a). In accordance with the Act, the Commissioner\u2019s regulations direct that <em>res judicata </em>applies where the Commissioner has made a previous final decision based on the \u201csame facts and the same issue or issues.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.957(c)(1), 416.1457(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">While we have not ruled on the application of <em>res judicata </em>to subsequent unadjudicated periods or what constitutes the same \u201cissue or issues,\u201d the Commissioner has issued Acquiescence Rulings in response to such determinations from other circuits. Generally, the Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits agree that in order for a claimant \u201cto overcome the presumption of continuing nondisability arising from the first administrative law judge\u2019s findings of nondisability, [he or she] must prove \u2018changed circumstances\u2019 indicating a greater disability.\u201d <em>Chavez v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 691, 693 (9th Cir.1988); <em>see also Lively v. Secretary, </em>820 F.2d 1391, 1392 (4th Cir. 1987); <em>Drummond v. Comm\u2019r., </em>126 F.3d 837, 842 (6th Cir.1997). However, the Commissioner disagrees with the presumption of nondisability and issued Acquiescence Rulings after each of the above opinions explaining that the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA\u2019s) policy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">if a determination or decision on a disability claim has become final, the Agency may apply administrative <em>res judicata </em>with respect to a subsequent disability claim ... if the same parties, facts and issues are involved in both the prior and subsequent claims. However, if the subsequent claim involves deciding whether the claimant is disabled during a period that was not adjudicated in the final determination or decision on the prior claim, SSA considers the issue of disability with respect to the unadjudicated period to be a new issue that prevents the application of administrative <em>res judicata. </em>Thus, when adjudicating a subsequent disability claim involving an unadjudicated period, SSA considers the facts and issues <em>de novo </em>in determining disability with respect to the unadjudicated period. SSA does not adopt findings from the final determination or decision on the prior disability claim in determining whether the claimant is disabled with respect to the unadjudicated period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">Acquiescence Ruling (AR) 97-4(9); <em>see also </em>AR 94-2(4); AR 98-4(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Even if we do not follow SSA policy, we conclude that the ALJ did not err. Because the facts support a determination that Randolph had improved and should no longer be limited only to sedentary work, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Randolph\u2019s circumstances changed enough to warrant a departure from the prior ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The ALJ must \u201ccarefully weigh evidence, giving individualized consideration to each claim that comes before him.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1401 (11th Cir.1996). The ALJ has a duty to make clear the weight accorded to each item of evidence and the reasons for his decision in order to enable a reviewing court to determine whether the decision was based on substantial evidence. <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir. 1981). However, \u201cthere is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(quoting Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1995)). <em>Id. </em>The ALJ\u2019s decision need not be a \u201cbroad rejection which does not enable this Court to conclude that the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical conditions as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, an ALJ can rely on a non-examining physician\u2019s report in denying disability insurance benefits where the non-examining physician\u2019s report does not contradict information in the examining physician\u2019s reports. <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 584-85 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">The claimant bears the burden of proving that he has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cAn impairment or combination of impairments is not severe if it does not significantly limit [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(a), while a severe impairment causes more than \u201ca minimal limitation on a claimant\u2019s ability to function,\u201d <em>Davis v. Shalala, </em>985 F.2d 528, 532 (11th Cir.1993). A claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC) is \u201cbased upon all the relevant evidence, of a claimant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite his impairments.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cLight work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds\u201d as well as \u201ca good deal of walking or standing, or ... sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The record demonstrates that the ALJ carefully considered Randolph\u2019s medical condition as a whole, and substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings that Randolph\u2019s back impairment was not severe and that Randolph was capable of performing light work. The record also indicates that the ALJ did not solely rely on the opinion of the state agency physicians but considered the record in its entirety. Thus, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in assigning more weight to the expert opinions of the non-examining state agency physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">In order to establish disability based on testimony of pain, a claimant must show the following: \u201c(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). Additionally, \u201ccredibility determinations are the province of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005). An ALJ must articulate \u201cexplicit and adequate reasons\u201d in order to discredit subjective testimony, and failure to do so \u201crequires, as a matter of law, that the testimony be accepted as true.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225. However, we not require the ALJ to \u201cspecifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision,\u201d so long as the decision is sufficient to allow us to conclude that the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">We conclude from the record that the ALJ properly considered Randolph\u2019s subjective complaints of pain and medical conditions and articulated reasons for discrediting Randolph\u2019s subjective testimony. Substantial evidence on the record supports the ALJ\u2019s findings that Randolph\u2019s statements concerning the intensity, duration, and limiting effects of the symptoms were not entirely credible, and thus, Randolph did not satisfy the three-part test for establishing disability based on testimony of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the denial of disability and supplemental security income benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
