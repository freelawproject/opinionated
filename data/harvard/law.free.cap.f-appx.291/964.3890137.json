The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the limited issue of whether Webster\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective because, during Webster\u2019s trial, he did not fully examine, enhance, and present a surveillance video of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">On appeal, Webster argues, first, that, by failing to investigate the surveillance video and photographic stills from the video, his counsel failed to investigate Webster\u2019s \u201cone plausible line of defense that could scientifically prove his innocence\u201d and was, therefore, ineffective. He argues that: (1) geometric measurements reveal that it was physically impossible for him to have been the individual on the video; (2) the jury considered the video and the photographic stills during its deliberations; and (3) no reasonable attorney would have failed to conduct an investigation. Webster stresses that he and his attorney discussed the physical differences between himself and the individual on the video, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>his counsel did not investigate these differences and, therefore, had little to present to the jury. Using \u201cphotogrammetry,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he argues that there are differences between his own body, particularly in arm length, and the body of the individual in the video and the stills. He argues that, if his counsel had presented the facts related to the photogrammetry at trial, the charges against him would have been dismissed. Webster, second, argues that the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his habeas petition without an evidentiary hearing was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, </em>while the court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Mixed questions of law and fact, including ineffective assistance of counsel claims, also are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Where a claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal courts shall not grant habeas relief unless the adjudication of the claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-7\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-8\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">When a convicted defendant claims that his counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective, the defendant must show that (1) his counsel was deficient, i.e., made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cUnless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction ... resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">\u201cFor performance to be deficient, it must be established that, in light of all the circumstances, counsel\u2019s performance was outside the wide range of professional competence.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1243 (11th Cir.2001). Reviewing courts must be highly deferential and utilize the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201c[Bjecause counsel\u2019s conduct is presumed reasonable, for a petitioner to show that the conduct was unreasonable, a petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315. A reasonable probability of a different result at trial is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, and the defendant must do more than show that the error had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. at 2067-68. When an individual challenges a state court\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>decision, \u201cit is not enough to convince a federal habeas court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>that, in its independent judgment, the state-court decision applied <em>Strickland, </em>incorrectly .... he must show that the [state court] applied <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>585 U.S. 685, 699, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1852, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. Webster was positively identified by an eyewitness who also identified Webster\u2019s vehicle in addition to the surveillance video. Moreover, Webster has not shown that additional investigation by his attorney with respect to the video would have resulted in exonerating clarification of the video. The district court did not err in denying his claim for habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>Kelley v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr, </em>377 F.3d 1317, 1333 (11th Cir.2004). The applicable federal habeas statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-8\">[i]f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-9\">(A) the claim relies on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-10\">(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-11\">(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-12\">(B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). The U.S. Supreme Court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-14\">[f]or state courts to have their rightful opportunity to adjudicate federal rights, the prisoner must be diligent in developing the record and presenting, if possible, all claims of constitutional error. If the prisoner fails to do so, himself or herself contributing to the absence of a full and fair adjudication in state court, \u00a7 2254(e)(2) prohibits an evidentiary hearing to develop the relevant claims in federal court, unless the statute\u2019s other stringent requirements are met. Federal courts sitting in habeas are not an alternative forum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made insufficient effort to pursue in state proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-15\"><em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 437, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 1491, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">Because Webster did not develop his claim fully in state court, and his claim did not rely on a new rule of constitutional law, nor a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Webster\u2019s petition without an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-11\">.
