We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">In 2002, Syrop pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud arising from a \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme in which he willfully filed false documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission and disseminated false press releases in order to bolster a chosen stock\u2019s value. The scheme resulted in investor losses totaling almost seven million dollars. Nonetheless, because of his substantial cooperation with the Government, the district court sentenced Syrop only to five years\u2019 probation. Two conditions placed on Syrop were that he not \u201cengag[e] in any employment related directly or indirectly to investments or securities business opportunities,\u201d DE 1 at 11, and that he \u201canswer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10. In November 2007, Syrop\u2019s probation officer, Ron Manganiello, filed a notice with the district court that Syrop had violated these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Syrop\u2019s primary employment during his probation was with Broadvision Group, an internet advertising company owned by John Grandinetti. Syrop consistently maintained that his only function was web marketing \u2014 specifically, selling banner advertisements. Manganiello received notice from several people that Syrop engaged in other sales activities. First, Brett Friedman sent a letter stating that he \u201cmet with Randy Syrop on approximately 5 occasions regarding investing in Tube Media corporation.\u201d DE 16 at 2 (exh. 1). At one meeting, according to Friedman, Syrop and Grandinetti presented a sales pitch for the stock, \u201centicing [Friedman and two others] to buy stock in the company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Friedman lost $160,000. <em>Id. </em>Second, Daniel Drapacz wrote that Syrop called him offering an investment opportunity in \u201cPyramid Records/TUBE Media Corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (exh. 2). Syrop offered $50,000 in public shares, and $48,000 in restricted shares held in Syrop\u2019s mother\u2019s name. <em>Id. </em>Drapacz purchased the stoekthe public shares over the Internet, and the private shares from Syrop\u2019s mother. <em>Id. </em>According to Drapacz, Syrop also solicited the 2004 sale of one-third of Broad-vision to Drapacz and his cousin, Harry Bruner, for $650,000. <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 12-18 (sales contract between Grandinetti and Bruner). When Bruner became dissatisfied with Broadvision\u2019s performance and threatened to contact the authorities, Syrop threatened him. <em>Id. </em>at 3 (exh. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Based on these allegations, Manganiello filed a notice with the district court that Syrop had violated his probation conditions by engaging in employment related to investments and securities, and by lying to Manganiello by not telling him about those activities. A magistrate judge held a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(b)(1)(a) preliminary hearing in which Manganiello testified about the Friedman and Drapacz statements. <em>See generally </em>DE 23 (Transcript of Pretrial Detention &amp; Preliminary Hearing). Syrop presented rebuttal evidence, including a sales contract between Bruner and Grandinetti, and a civil complaint by Bruner against Grandinetti, which showed that Grandinetti, not Syrop, was responsible for the Broadvision sale. DE 16 at 12-18 (contract between Grandinetti and Bruner; Syrop not men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>tioned); <em>id. </em>at 5-11 (civil complaint byBruner against Grandinetti; Syrop not mentioned).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">The magistrate judge noted \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the evidence \u2014 specifically, that the contract and civil complaint contradicted Drapacz\u2019s allegation that Syrop was involved in the Broadvision sale \u2014 but found \u201csufficient probable cause\u201d to conclude that Syrop violated his probation conditions by engaging in investment-related employment and lying to his probation officer about that activity. DE 18 at 6. The magistrate judge referred the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing with live witnesses to resolve the inconsistency and adopt or reject the recommendation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The district court held an evidentiary hearing in which similar evidence was presented, with the exception that Drapacz and Friedman testified live, rather than having their statements read. <em>See generally </em>DE 47 (Transcript of Probation Violation Proceedings). Friedman testified that Syrop invited him to a shareholder meeting for Tube Media Corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 10. He understood Syrop to be a \u201cconsultant for the company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. After sitting through the meeting, Syrop took Friedman and another potential investor to a conference room, where Syrop presented a sales pitch for investment in The Tube. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Friedman testified that he then decided to invest in The Tube by purchasing public shares on the internet, and private shares from others through Syrop. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 24. The Tube failed, and Friedman lost over $160,000. <em>Id. </em>at 10. On cross examination, Friedman testified about the reasons for his continued investment in The Tube: Les Garland, a principal in major television networks MTV and VH1, was involved; The Tube had a television channel in millions of homes; and Friedman had made substantial gains on an earlier smaller investment in The Tube. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. Nevertheless, despite deciding that The Tube was a legitimate business based on his own due diligence, Friedman felt in retrospect that it was a \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme, and Syrop sought him out to convince him to invest in the company. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Drapacz also expounded his statement during live testimony. He testified that Syrop was fully involved in the sale of Broadvision, and that Syrop was Grandinetti\u2019s partner in Broadvision but could not own anything \u201con paper\u201d because he was on probation. <em>Id. </em>at 34. Syrop\u2019s attorney sought to discredit Drapacz on cross-examination by noting that Drapacz is a convicted felon and that the Broadvision contract and subsequent civil suit belied his accusation that Syrop sold Broadvision. <em>Id. </em>at 43-44, 48^9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Syrop presented his own witnesses, including The Tube\u2019s and Broadvision\u2019s lawyer, who testified that he had no indication that Syrop held any kind of ownership interest in Broadvision, and Syrop did not have a consulting agreement with The Tube. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">After hearing the testimony and argument, the district court found that Syrop had violated his probation conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 99-100. The district court credited both Friedman and Drapacz, noting that both testified to Syrop promoting investment in The Tube while holding himself out as a consultant. <em>Id. </em>at 100. The district court found it irrelevant that the offerings were not a part of his formal employment with Broadvision; \u201cThe idea was that he shouldn\u2019t be involved in offering securities to people because of his pri- or involvement in a pump and dump <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101. Syrop insisted that he \u201cwas just being polite in talking to people about [The Tube],\u201d and \u201cat no time did [he] care if anybody bought the stock or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. Nonetheless, the district court found that Syrop engaged in securities-related employment and lied to his probation officer about it. The court calculated the Guidelines range as three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment, but sentenced Syrop to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment because the probation violation repeated the original criminal acts. <em>Id. </em>at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">\u201c [T]his court generally reviews a district court\u2019s revocation of probation for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitsven, </em>452 F.3d 1264, 1265 (11th Cir. 2006). In reviewing a revocation proceeding, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s findings of fact are binding on this court unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Granderson, </em>969 F.2d 980, 982 (11th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">The thrust of Syrop\u2019s argument is that the condition against \u201cengaging in employment related to securities and investments\u201d did not extend to Syrop\u2019s giving advice about investments to people or investing in securities himself. According to Syrop, the Government must present direct evidence that he gained a benefit from a transaction for that transaction to constitute \u201cengaging in employment related to securities and investments.\u201d Furthermore, Syrop argues that because the advice he gave Friedman and the small role he played in the Broadvision sale to Bruner were not \u201cemployment,\u201d it was not a lie to tell his probation officer his only employment was selling banner advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">We reject Syrop\u2019s arguments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cIn a probation revocation proceeding, all that is required is that the evidence reasonably satisfy the judge that the conduct of the probationer has not been as good as required by the conditions of probation; evidence that would establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Quinn, </em>689 F.2d 1359, 1361 (11th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>United States v. Rice, </em>671 F.2d 455, 458 (11th Cir.1982)). We hold that the district court could easily conclude from the evidence presented that Syrop engaged in employment related to securities and investments at least twice. First, the district court could reasonably conclude from Drapacz\u2019s testimony that Syrop was a shadow partner in Broadvision, directly involved in the sale that, on paper, was between Grandinetti and Bruner only. Second, the district court could reasonably infer that Syrop stood to gain from Friedman\u2019s investment in The Tube, given that Syrop held himself out as a consultant and actively promoted the stock. Moreover, because the district court could conclude that Syrop was engaged in activities beyond banner-advertis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>ing sales, the court could also reasonably conclude that Syrop lied to his probation officer when he stated that his only employment was selling banner advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">We also conclude that the two-year sentence was reasonable. To review a sentence, an appellate court \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,\u201d and \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, 128 </em>S.Ct. at 597. Syrop first argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was procedurally unsound because it found that Syrop\u2019s first conviction was for a pump-and-dump scheme, when the conviction was only for causing false filings to be mailed. The relevant conduct for sentencing purposes extends far beyond the specific crime of which the defendant was convicted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2 (\u201cRelevant Conduct\u201d). The district court concluded from the Presentence Investigation Report that Syrop\u2019s relevant conduct included a pump-and-dump scheme; that finding was not clearly erroneous. Moreover, we conclude that it was reasonable for the district court to exceed the nine-month upper bound recommended by the Guidelines. Recidivist conduct touches multiple 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors: it affects \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; it suggests a greater \u201cseriousness of the offense\u201d; and it shows a greater need \u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d \u201cdeter[] criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of-the defendant.\u201d Therefore, a 24-month sentence was reasonable given the recidivist nature of Syrop\u2019s probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it revoked Syrop\u2019s probation, and the 24-month sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">. Syrop also argues that it was error for the Government to fail to call Bruner to the stand because the magistrate judge's report and recommendation stated that \u201cFriedman, Drapacz and Bruner ... need to be personally present at any final evidentiary hearing.\u201d DE 18 at 6. We reject this argument; if Syrop wanted Bruner to testify, he could have called Bruner to the stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
