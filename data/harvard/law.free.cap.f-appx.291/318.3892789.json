After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion of February 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">Additionally, we briefly address Jacox\u2019s motion to compel discovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jacox states in her appellate brief that the defendants were \u201cnever made to fully disclose ... in spite of motions to compel ... Defendants were allowed by the District Judge to decide what was relevant and what they would disclose.\u201d We read this as referring to the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to compel discovery. We review the denial of such a motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir.2006). Jacox\u2019s motion to compel did not include a certification that Jacox had in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the defendants about their responses to her requests for admission of facts prior to seeking court action as is required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(1). Courts show leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants, however, <em>pro se </em>litigants are still required to conform to procedural rules, and the court is not required to rewrite deficient pleadings. <em>GJR Investments, Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). Furthermore, her motion to compel failed to identify particular problems with the defendants\u2019 responses to her requests for admission of facts, nor does she identify any specific shortcomings in the responses in her briefs to this court. The district court did not, therefore, err in denying Jacox\u2019s motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-17\">. Although not specifically mentioned in Jacox\u2019s notice of appeal, \u2019\u2019[t]he appeal from a final judgment draws in question all prior non-final orders and rulings which produced the judgment.\u201d <em>Club Car, Inc. v. Club Car (Quebec) Import, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 775, 785 n. 5 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Barfield v. Brierton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 930 (11th Cir.1989)). Although Jacox\u2019s notice of appeal referred to the February 14, 2008 order granting summary judgment rather than the February 15 final judgment, we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
