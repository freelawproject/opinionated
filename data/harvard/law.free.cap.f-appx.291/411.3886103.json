Russelburg, which denied their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In </em>re <em>Gomez-Beleno, </em>Nos. A95 462 655/656 (B.I.A. Feb. 6, 2007), <em>affg </em>Nos. A95 462 655/656 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 4, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA affirmed and supplemented the IJ\u2019s findings that Gomez-Beleno did not establish a nexus between his fear of persecution and a protected ground, and its rejection of his CAT claim, but twice declined to reach the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Accordingly, we review the IJ\u2019s burden findings as supplemented by the BIA and assume, without deciding, Gomez-Beleno\u2019s credibility. <em>See id.; Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271; <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 125 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Youg Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir. 2004). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In order to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate that the harm she suffered or claims to fear bears a nexus to one of the protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42), 1231(b)(3)(A). In concluding that Gomez-Beleno failed to provide \u201csufficient evidence\u201d that the threats the Columbian Revolutionary Armed Forces (\u201cFARC\u201d) made against him were motivated by his political opinion, imputed or otherwise, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that such threats were \u201cacts of extortion or recruitment intended to obtain his employment services ... or information.\u201d The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that the \u201conly evidence ... related to a possible political opinion\u201d was Gomez-Beleno\u2019s testimony that when a FARC member called him a third time, he said he was not interested in assisting them \u201cbecause I did not agree with them ideals.\u201d The BIA found further support for the IJ\u2019s nexus finding in the wording of the written death threat, or sufragio,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Gomez Bele\u00f1o received. In its decision, the BIA quoted the sufragio as stating that Gomez-Beleno would be killed due to his \u201cunwillingness to collaborate <em>without </em>cause.\u201d In fact, the translation in the record indicates that the sufragio stated that Gomez-Beleno would be killed due to his \u201cunwillingness to collaborate <em>with our </em>cause.\u201d This mischaracterization of the record warrants remand. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d at 127 (\u201cAlthough the substantial evidence standard leaves fact-finding to the agency, \u2018it does not permit an appellate court to defer to unreasoned rulings, or those based on legal error, faulty analysis, or misreadings of the record.\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, its significance is plain: \u201cwithout cause\u201d may suggest that the FARC did not know the reason for Gomez-Beleno\u2019s refusal to assist them, while \u201cwith our cause\u201d implies that the FARC believed that Gomez-Beleno would not assist them because he did not support them cause. As Gomez-Beleno argues, the sufragio may well establish that the FARC changed its focus from recruiting him to punishing him \u201cfor his attitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The Government argues that because any persecution Gomez-Beleno fears stems from his refusal to be recruited by the FARC, he necessarily cannot establish a nexus to political opinion. However, in <em>Delgado v. Mukasey </em>we held that the BIA erred in failing to consider a claim of imputed political opinion because, although the petitioner\u2019s original kidnapping by the FARC was not politically motivated, her refusal to provide further technological assistance could have been perceived as a refusal to cooperate with the FARC, which, in turn, may have led the FARC to impute a political opinion to her. <em>Delgado v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 702, 707 (2d Cir. 2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, while the Government cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>rectly argues that evidence of resistance to forced recruitment alone is insufficient to establish eligibility for relief, where the applicant produces evidence that the \u201crecruiter\u201d believes that the applicant\u2019s resistance was politically motivated, he may establish the requisite nexus. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>Delgado, </em>508 F.3d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Had the BIA correctly read the sufragio as threatening Gomez-Beleno because of his \u201cunwillingness to collaborate with our cause,\u201d it may have found that the FARC perceived his refusal to collaborate as opposition to the FARC \u201ccause,\u201d and that the FARC thus imputed a political opinion to Gomez-Beleno. <em>See Delgado, </em>508 F.3d at 707. Because the agency\u2019s nexus determination rested in part on its miseharacterization of a significant part of the record, and because that determination was the sole basis for the BIA\u2019s denial of GomezBeleno\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, we cannot predict with confidence that the BIA would deny relief in the absence of its error. Thus, remand is warranted. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Dong Gao, </em>482 F.3d at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We also remand Gomez-Beleno\u2019s CAT claim to the BIA. Significantly, both parties agree that the BIA failed to consider whether the term \u201cgovernment\u201d in the regulations implementing CAT applies to the FARC as the de facto government in parts of Colombia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The regulations implementing CAT require that torture be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Gomez-Beleno argued before the BIA that while CAT protection is not ordinarily available for persons fearing torture by an armed insurgency, Colombia \u201cpresents a special and close case\u201d because the actual government has ceded de facto control over large areas of the country, removing its personnel and leaving the \u201cFARC\u2019s militants [to] become the public officials.\u201d The BIA did not address this argument, and treated Gomez-Beleno\u2019s CAT claim as though it was based on the Colombian government\u2019s acquiescence to the FARC. While it is unclear whether Gomez-Beleno\u2019s claim is viable, remand is appropriate in light of the BIA\u2019s failure to address it, particularly where both parties agree that the BIA erred in this respect. <em>See Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88, 91-92 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">. According to Gomez-Beleno, a sufragio is a type of \"greeting card, usually sent as a condolence card when someone has died, but used in Colombia to signify that someone, the recipient, will soon die.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\">. Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, our decision in <em>Delgado </em>is not in tension with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>INS v. EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The Government argues without elaboration that to the extent that <em>Delgado </em>implies that \"opposition to collaboration by itself warrants a finding that persecution was motivated by political opinion\u201d it is \"wholly contrary\u201d to <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>which held that resistance to forced recruitment does not amount to the expression of a political opinion. However, the Supreme Court in <em>Elias-Zacarias </em>expressly declined to determine whether a refusal to fight could consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>tute a political opinion of neutrality, instead finding that even if it was, the petitioner failed to show that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to conclude that the guerillas persecuted him because of such a political opinion. <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812. Accordingly, <em>Elias-Zacarias </em>is not inconsistent with this Court's observation in <em>Delgado </em>that the petitioner's testimony that she would be targeted by the FARC for \"betraying'' them by fleeing <em>\u201ccould </em>well qualify as persecution for an imputed political opinion (opposition to the FARC).\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>508 F.3d at 707 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\">. The Government argues that remand is appropriate on this limited basis. Gomez-Beleno, however, argues that in the unusual circumstances of this case, we should assume that he is credible and grant his CAT claim. However, we decline to do so and instead remand to the agency for it to make a determination in the first instance. <em>See Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
