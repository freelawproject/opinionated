Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b82-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">In 2002, a jury convicted Petitioner Richard Rangel Salazar of aggravated sexual assault on a child under fourteen years of age and more than ten years younger than Salazar, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 269, and two counts of forcible lewd and lascivious conduct on a child under fourteen years of age, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 288(b)(1). The trial court sentenced Salazar to sixty years to life imprisonment. In 2005, after the California Court of Appeal upheld his conviction and the Supreme Court of California denied review without comment, Salazar filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Parle v. Runnels, </em>505 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2007) (finding \u201c[w]here as here, the state supreme court denies review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>prisoner\u2019s habeas petition without comment, we \u2018look to the last reasoned state-court decision\u2019 \u201d). The district court denied his petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Salazar first contends that the trial court improperly admitted \u201cfresh complaint testimony\u201d from the children\u2019s caregivers, and that their testimony was inadmissible hearsay. The California Court of Appeal held that even if it were error to admit the testimony, it was harmless because there was ample evidence from which the jury could find Salazar guilty. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was neither contrary to nor did it involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 863 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402-04, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). Furthermore, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it is clear that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of Salazar\u2019s crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Salazar also claims that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because counsel did not object to the introduction of Salazar\u2019s juvenile adjudication for a prior sexual offense. The California Court of Appeal denied relief, noting that it was \u201cconvinced it is not reasonably probable that a different result would have been obtained had the challenged [juvenile adjudication] been excluded.\u201d We agree. Salazar neither demonstrated his counsel\u2019s efforts fell below an \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness,\u201d nor that there was a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s errors, the result of his trial would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Finally, although Salazar argues that the cumulative effect of the two aforementioned alleged errors resulted in a trial so fundamentally unfair as to deprive him of his right to due process, we decline to address this claim as it is an uncertified issue with no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The district court properly denied Salazar\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b82-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
