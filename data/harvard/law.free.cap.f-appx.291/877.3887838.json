Chon appeals his conviction after a jury trial on one count of possessing pseudoephedrine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2). He was acquitted of two counts of distributing pseudoephedrine. Mr. Chon seeks reversal and a remand for a new trial, contending that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it (1) abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of a government witness where a juror was familiar with the witness; and (2) did not disqualify a juror or at least inquire further into any possible bias on the part of that juror <em>sua sponte </em>once it became apparent that the juror knew the witness. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">Mr. Chon\u2019s conviction arose from a series of transactions involving a confidential informant, Elijah Wisden. IV R. at 48. Mr. Wisden assisted the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) beginning in January 2001 by identifying pseudoephedrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sellers in the Salt Lake City area, and Mr. Chon was one such seller with whom Mr. Wisden had previously dealt. <em>Id. </em>at 48-49. On April 24, 2001, Mr. Chon sold Mr. Wisden one case of pseudoephedrine pills for $2,800 from outside his Corner Market store. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 75. Mr. Wisden recorded the conversation for the DEA. <em>Id. </em>at 72. In that conversation, Mr. Wisden requested that Mr. Chon \u201cpop them out\u201d like he had before \u2014 take the pills out of any pack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>aging, making it easier to create methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 74. He also told Mr. Chon that he was planning to \u201cmake a couple pounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. The next day, Mr. Wisden bought two more cases of pseudoephedrine from Mr. Chon and, during this conversation (also recorded), Mr. Wisden stated that he wanted to buy more cases next week to make a couple more pounds and again requested that these pills be \u201cout of the packages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. On May 9, 2001, Mr. Wisden purchased more pseudoephedrine from Mr. Chon and Mr. Chon was arrested by DEA agents. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Mr. Chon was indicted on August 22, 2001 for two counts of distribution of pseudoephedrine (counts I and II) and one count of possession of pseudoephedrine (count III). I R. at 1-2. At trial, Mr. Chon\u2019s sole defense was that he did not distribute or possess pseudoephedrine \u201cknowing, or having reasonable cause to believe\u201d that the pseudoephedrine would be used to manufacture methamphetamine. <em>Id.; </em>Aplt. Br. at 3. He contended that, as a native of Korea, he did not have a sufficient proficiency in the English language to understand that Mr. Wisden would use the pseudoephedrine to manufacture methamphetamine. III R. at 14; Aplt. Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The defense relied on a linguistics expert who testified that Mr. Chon did not have proficiency in the English language sufficient to understand the unlawfulness of his conduct. VI R. at 9. To rebut the defense expert and Mr. Chon\u2019s own testimony on this point, the government called a rebuttal witness, Kevin Prusse. V R. at 77. Mr. Prusse served with Mr. Chon in the National Guard and the government had not previously disclosed him as a witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 77, 82. Shortly after he began his testimony, Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel expressed a concern to the district court that someone on the jury might know Mr. Prusse. <em>Id. </em>at 77. After the district court asked the jury whether any of them knew Mr. Prusse, a juror stated that she was his neighbor, that \u201c[w]e know each other pretty good,\u201d and that she \u201ckn[ew] he\u2019s been on a mission to Korea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">At a conference outside the hearing of the jury, Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel argued that \u201cthis witness should not be allowed to testify\u201d because it \u201ccauses too much trouble to allow a neighbor to testify\u201d and regretted that there was no alternate juror. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 80. The government remarked that it had not received a supplemental expert report containing an interview of Mr. Chon regarding his life history until the Friday before the Monday on which the trial started. <em>Id. </em>at 79-80. According to the government, it was not clear from the supplemental report that Mr. Chon had fully disclosed his experience in the National Guard as a translator and interrogator. <em>Id. </em>at 81. The initial expert report disclosed by the defendant only contained a linguistics analysis. <em>Id. </em>The government \u201chad been working on trying to find a witness for a short period of time and it took several channels through the military to find someone who personally knew Mr. Chon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>The district judge concluded that, \u201c[u]nder the circumstances, the prejudice to the government of not having the [supplemental] report until Friday afternoon, I have to allow him to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel then inquired about giving the jury a special instruction regarding the relationship and, after the government requested the initial instruction that \u201cno one witness\u2019s testimony is to be given more credibility than any other,\u201d <em>id., </em>Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel began to formulate an alternative instruction but then stated: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get too involved,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 81-82. The district court then indicated that it would attempt to find an applicable jury instruction and would be \u201chappy to give an instruction to try to mitigate this.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">After Mr. Prusse testified as to Mr. Chon\u2019s proficiency in the English language, <em>id. </em>at 82-88, the district court held a conference in chambers, <em>id. </em>at 89. After remarking that it could not find any useful special instruction, the district court asked counsel to proffer one after it instructed the jury, stating its concern that it did not \u201cwant to emphasize too much the importance of [Mr. Prusse\u2019s] testimony, particularly since the testimony was of marginal value really in the end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the district court instructed the jury, neither the government nor Mr. Chon offered any additional instruction after an inquiry by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 90. Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel stated that \u201cof course our objection to that still stands\u201d and the district judge replied, \u201cI understand that.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Mr. Chon was acquitted on counts I and II but was found guilty on count III, possession of pseudoephedrine. I R. (Verdict Form). He was sentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 36 months of supervised release. VII R. at 19-20. This appeal followed. II R. (Notice of Appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to be tried by \u201can impartial jury.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. \u201c[A]n impartial jury\u201d is \u201ca jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Brothers, </em>438 F.3d 1068, 1071 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). \u201cClearly, such a jury must be composed of members who not only are free of bias in favor of or against a particular party but are also able, in a more basic sense, to carry out their function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A district judge is permitted to disqualify a juror for good cause after the trial begins, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(b)(2)(B), and such cause includes juror illness or unavailability, and when the district judge discerns evidence indicating that the juror is no longer able to render an impartial verdict. <em>Brothers, </em>438 F.3d at 1071-72 (citing <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>303 F.3d 847, 853 (7th Cir.2002)). With these precepts in mind, we turn to Mr. Chon\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">I. <em>Admission of Mr. Prusse\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Mr. Chon first contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to be tried by an impartial jury. Aplt. Br. at 9-10. He argues that one juror personally knew Mr. Prusse, vouched for his language abilities, credibility, and religious and moral character before the entire jury, and provided information not otherwise in evidence about Mr. Prusse. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. The district court\u2019s admission of Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony, he asserts, therefore made the trial unfair. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence for an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Williams, </em>376 F.3d 1048, 1054 (10th Cir.2004). A district court commits an abuse of discretion when its decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>435 F.3d 1222, 1235 (10th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The government argues that Mr. Chon provided no basis for the exclusion of Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony. <em>See </em>Aplee. Br. at 14-16. At the sidebar conference, Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel stated that \u201cI think that causes too much trouble to allow a neighbor to testify,\u201d V R. at 78, and that \u201cI regret now that we don\u2019t have an alternate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 80. It is clear from the record that the district court was well aware of <em>some </em>objection to the testimony, and even suggested an instruction might be the remedy. A precise evidentiary objection, however, is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">On appeal, Mr. Chon only provides Fed. R.Evid. 403 as a basis upon which to cure unconstitutional juror bias by excluding evidence (although it does not appear that this rule was ever expressly invoked below). Aplt. Reply Br. at 15-16. Fed. R.Evid. 403 provides that, \u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.... \u201d Mr. Chon does not provide any case law demonstrating the use of a Rule 403 objection to exclude evidence based on a juror\u2019s familiarity with a witness. As the government points out, to the extent Mr. Chon sought a remedy for alleged juror bias, requesting additional voir dire, attempting to disqualify the juror, or moving for a mistrial would have been more direct. <em>See </em>Aplee. Br. at 16-19. Given the objection made, however, we determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">\u201cThe term \u2018unfair prejudice,\u2019 as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different than proof specific to the offense charged.\u201d <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 180, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). This is commonly an improper emotional basis for a decision. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cprobative value\u201d to be weighed against the risk of unfair prejudice particular evidence might incite may be calculated by comparing evidentiary alternatives. <em>Id. </em>at 184,117 S.Ct. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">In this case, the government explained its predicament of obtaining someone familiar with Mr. Chon\u2019s National Guard experience on short notice, so we cannot say there were any feasible evidentiary alternatives. In addition, although the district court, in the jury-instruction conference, expressed the concern that \u201cI don\u2019t want to emphasize too much the importance of [Mr. Prusse\u2019s] testimony, particularly since the testimony was of marginal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>value really in the end,\u201d V R. at 89, Mr. Chon emphasizes the importance of Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony on appeal, Aplt. Br. at 13.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the \u201cconcededly relevant evidence\u201d at issue here was highly probative (the government certainly had a right to rebut the testimony of Mr. Chon\u2019s expert) and had to be balanced with any risk of unfair prejudice on the part of the jury that could result from the admission of that evidence. <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 180, 117 S.Ct. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In this case, any danger of unfair prejudice is attenuated at best. We reject Mr. Chon\u2019s contention that the juror\u2019s responses, on them face, suggest that the juror could not be fair and impartial regarding Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony. <em>See </em>Aplt. Reply Br. at 4. The juror merely expressed that she knew Mr. Prusse \u201cpretty good,\u201d that she was his neighbor, and that she knew he did a mission to Korea. V R. at 78. The probative value of Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, \u201cwent straight to the heart of the defense theory.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 11. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting Mr. Prusse\u2019s testimony. <em>See Williams, </em>376 F.3d at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">II. <em>Juror Disqualification/Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Mr. Chon next argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury when the district court did not disqualify the juror who knew Mr. Prusse or did not at least further inquire into the extent of the juror\u2019s relationship with Mr. Prusse. Aplt. Br. at 15. The government responds by arguing that Mr. Chon has waived this issue because he never moved for a mistrial, to have the juror disqualified, or for additional examination of the juror about her relationship with Mr. Prusse. Aplee. Br. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">We agree with the government that this issue has been waived, but for a different reason.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Chon intentionally relinquished or abandoned his right to have the juror disqualified under Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(b)(2)(B) below and this fact bars our review. V R. at 80; <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>530 F.3d 1292, 1298 n. 1 (10th Cir. 2008). \u201cWaiver\u201d means the \u201c \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>530 F.3d at 1298 n. 1 (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). This is different than \u201cforfeiture\u201d (sometimes mistakenly called \u201cwaiver\u201d) which \u201cis the failure to make the timely assertion of a right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). \u201c[Wjaiver is accomplished by intent, but forfeiture comes about through neglect.\u201d <em>United States v. Carrasco-Salazar, </em>494 F.3d 1270, 1272 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). Forfeiture, as opposed to waiver, occurs \u201cwhen there is no suggestion of a knowing, voluntary failure to raise the matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Goode, </em>483 F.3d 676, 681 (10th Cir.2007). We do not review \u201cwaived\u201d rights even for plain error. <em>Jones, </em>530 F.3d at 1298 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>The record in this case reveals that Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel contemplated juror disqualification when he stated, during the sidebar conference held immediately after the juror\u2019s relationship with Mr. Prusse was revealed, that \u201cI regret now that we don\u2019t have an alternate.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> V R. at 80. Clearly, Mr. Chon understood the possibility of juror disqualification and its ramifications (a new trial, or possibly an eleven-person jury pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(b)(2)(A)) and intentionally abandoned any right he may have had to this remedy. <em>See </em>Aplt. Reply Br. at 5-6; <em>Jones, </em>530 F.3d at 1298 n. 1. The record is clear that Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel was aware of his juror-disqualification option below and declined to pursue it. Mr. Chon\u2019s counsel made a strategic decision to complete the trial with the juror in question and cannot now claim error on appeal. <em>See United States v. Bradshaw, </em>787 F.2d 1385, 1391 (10th Cir.1986). At oral argument, the government related that Mr. Chon persuaded the district court to strike certain unfavorable evidence based upon discovery violations. That evidence included the testimony by Mr. Wisden that Mr. Chon previously requested that certain bottles containing pseudoephedrine should be destroyed so they could not be traced back to Mr. Chon and testimony by the government\u2019s expert about records from the Utah National Guard tending to show that Mr. Chon had been an interrogator speaking both English and Korean. Had there been a retrial, such evidence probably would not be excluded for lack of notice. Thus, the decision not to move for a mistrial was more than mere neglect, <em>see CarrascoSalazar, </em>494 F.3d at 1272, and was a \u201cknowing, voluntary failure to raise the matter,\u201d <em>Goode, </em>483 F.3d at 681. Mr. Chon has therefore waived any right he may have had to juror disqualification and we refuse to address his argument on this point, even for plain error. <em>See id. </em>To do otherwise would cause Mr. Chon to \u201cspeculate on the result of the juror[\u2019s]\u201d relationship with Mr. Prusse, <em>United States v. Ramsey, </em>726 F.2d 601, 604 (10th Cir.1984), something we cannot allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b902-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Mr. Chon argues that we should review the district court\u2019s decision to permit Mr. Prusse to testily under the same abuse-of-discretion standard we would use for the denial of a mistrial motion.
