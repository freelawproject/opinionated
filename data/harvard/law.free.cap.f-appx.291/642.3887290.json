Prior to being deported, Barrientos was convicted of indecency with a child in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1). Equating \u201cindecency with a child\u201d under Texas law with \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the district court enhanced Barrientos\u2019 offense level by sixteen and imposed a sentence of seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">Barrientos contends that \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) proscribes conduct beyond that falling within the ordinary and contemporary meaning of \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d and therefore that his prior conviction under that statute is not a legitimate basis for a crime-of-violence enhancement under the Guidelines. Specifically, he argues that the definition of \u201cchild\u201d under \u00a7 21.11(a)\u2014 a person less than seventeen years of age \u2014 is inconsistent with the contemporary and ordinary meaning of \u201cminor\u201d because, for purposes of many states\u2019 statutory rape laws, a person\u2019s \u201cage of consent\u201d is deemed to be sixteen. <em>See generally United States v. Lopez-DeLeon, </em>513 F.3d 472 (5th Cir.2008) (discussing when children reach the age of consent under various states\u2019 statutory rape laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-18\">As Barrientos admits, we have already addressed the issue of whether a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a) constitutes sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2; in answering in the affirmative, we have stated that \u201c \u2018a child younger than 17 years[ ]\u2019 is clearly a \u2018minor.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting \u00a7 21.11(a)); <em>see also United States v. Najera-Najera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 511 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>(5th Cir.2008) (relying on <em>Zavala-Sustaita, </em>in stating \u201cunder generic-meaning analysis, a person younger than 17 years old is a \u2018child\u2019 \u201d). Because our precedent forecloses Barrientos\u2019 argument, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-14\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
