Dec. 28, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 384 819 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 3, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ accurately observed that while Lin initially testified that he practiced Falun Gong in a public yard from June 1999 until June 2003, he retracted this testimony when confronted with the fact that Chinese officials cracked down on the practice of Falun Gong beginning in July 1999. The IJ reasonably declined to credit Lin\u2019s explanation that he \u201csaid it wrong before\u201d because he \u201cwas a little bit nervous,\u201d when the IJ found that his demeanor did not indicate nervousness. As a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to credit Lin\u2019s explanation, the agency acted within its discretion in declining to do so. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that an agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so); <em>see also id. </em>at 81 n. 1 (noting that particular deference is given to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of demeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">Additionally, the IJ\u2019s determination that it was implausible that Lin distributed Falun Gong materials for five years without suffering any consequences was \u201ctethered to record evidence,\u201d where Lin testified that he distributed Falun Gong materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>in his town and neighboring towns for almost five years, that his friend who distributed with him was arrested, and that police cracked down on Falun Gong in his area. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. </em>Mukasey, 509 F.Sd 68, 66-67 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Based on the agency\u2019s reasonable inconsistency and implausibility findings, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the adverse credibility determination here. Given this conclusion, the agency\u2019s denial of Lin\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief was proper because each claim rested on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
