A73 566 992/993 (B.I.A. Aug. 7, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-21\">In its denial of Petitioners\u2019 untimely appeal, the BIA found that it lacked authority to extend the 30-day period to file an appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b); <em>Matter of Liadov, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 990, 991-93 (BIA 2006) (finding that it lacked authority to extend the filing deadline in light of governing regulations, the statute, and the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that filing deadlines be strictly applied). The BIA declined to certify Petitioners\u2019 appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(c) due to the three year-delay in Petitioners\u2019 discovery of their former attorney\u2019s misconduct in failing to file their Notice of Appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Zhong Guang Sun, v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 105 (2d Cir.2005)(finding that although the requirement that an alien file a notice of appeal to the BIA within 30 days of the IJ\u2019s decision is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d the BIA may consider an untimely appeal in \u201c \u2018unique or extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d). Because Petitioners do not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that it lacked authority to extend the filing deadline, we decline to review that determination. <em>See Yueqiug Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>and ordinarily will not be addressed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider provided additional details regarding their claim that they exercised due diligence in pursuing their appeal. However, reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider would require us to evaluate the BIA\u2019s underlying determination that Petitioners\u2019 lack of due diligence in pursuing them appeal mitigated against taking them appeal on certification, a determination that was \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>See Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517-18 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the BIA\u2019s determination regarding exercise of its sua sponte authority to consider an untimely motion to reopen or reconsider was unreviewable because it is \u201centirely discretionary\u201d); see <em>also Liadov v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1003, 1011 (8th Cir.2008) (finding that the BIA\u2019s refusal to \u201cself-certify\u201d was an \u201cunreviewable action committed to the agency\u2019s discretion\u201d); <em>Mahamat v. Gcmzales, </em>430 F.3d 1281,1284 (10th Cir.2005) (finding no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s certification decision and noting the lack of any standards to judge the BIA\u2019s exercise of discretion). Because we cannot review such discretionary determinations, we cannot review the BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider. <em>Cf. Azmond Ali, </em>448 F.3d at 517-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DISMISSED. Any pending motion for a stay of removal in these petitions are DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
