Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 985, 990 (7th Cir.2006), to find that he waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction by conceding removability and failing to object to the NTA. This court recently cited <em>Qureshi </em>in adopting the same rule. <em>Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 449-50 (5th Cir.2008). By conceding removability and failing to object to the NTA, Iwo waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction in removal proceedings. <em>See Chambers, </em>520 F.3d at 449-50. Iwo\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Iwo also contends that the BIA erred by finding his notice to appear (NTA) was not defective. He argues that the NTA was fatally defective because it was not signed by the proper authority. The NTA was consistent with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1(a), which governs who may issue a NTA. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 544, 546-47 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Iwo also argues that the IJ and BIA failed to provide adequate reasoned explanations for the decisions, that he should be entitled to equitable tolling, and that the Government deliberately deceived the court. Because Iwo failed to raise these issues before the BIA, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">Accordingly, Iwo\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
