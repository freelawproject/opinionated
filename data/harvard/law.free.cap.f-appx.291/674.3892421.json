She also assigns as error the district court\u2019s failure to consider certain affidavits. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">\n<em>I. Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Saucier obtained a Florida and Mississippi real estate license in 1994 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, Saucier was hired by Coldwell Banker JME Realty Company (\u201cJME\u201d) as a real estate sales associate at the Legacy Condominiums located in Gulf-port, Mississippi. JME was retained as the real estate broker to market and sell the Legacy units preconstruction. Saucier entered into multiple agreements with JME regarding their obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">Later, Saucier believed that JME and JME employees had been engaging in the marketing and sale of the Legacy condominiums without Mississippi licensure, in violation of Mississippi laws. Saucier resigned her position and requested payment of commissions from the sales of Legacy units. Saucier also filed a complaint with the Mississippi Real Estate Commission, which found that certain parties had violated Mississippi laws. Saucier argued that Defendants hired her to use her position to comply with Mississippi real estate law without giving her proper support and the opportunity to make sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-19\">The Defendants moved for summary judgment. After considering the mies of statutory construction, the district court determined that Saucier did not qualify as a person aggrieved. The district court stated that \u201cit is not reasonable to consider Plaintiff as a \u2018person aggrieved.\u2019 A holding of this nature would either leave those persons who actually paid the foreign agent without recourse, or would open the proverbial floodgates of litigation and leave foreign agents subject to endless lawsuits for the same conduct.\u201d The court concluded that Saucier lacked standing under \u00a7 73-35-31(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-20\">Saucier had submitted affidavits to support her claim that she qualified as a person aggrieved under Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 73-35-31(2). The district court struck the affidavits which Saucier submitted in support of her \u00a7 73-35-31(2) claims because they offered legal conclusions and interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-21\">Saucier challenges both of these rulings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-22\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-23\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s legal conclusions, including the decision whether to grant a summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>motion, de novo.\u201d <em>Texas v. United, States, </em>497 F.3d 491, 495 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Garcia v. LumaCorp, Inc., </em>429 F.3d 549, 553 (5th Cir.2005)). We also review issues of standing and statutory interpretation de novo. <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s factual findings, including those on which the court based its legal conclusions, for clear error. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\n<em>III. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Saucier contends that she is entitled to relief under the following statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">In case any person, partnership, association or corporation shall have received any sum of money, or the equivalent thereto, as commission, compensation or profit by or in consequence of his violation of any provision of this chapter, such person, partnership, association or corporation shall also be liable to a penalty of not less than the amount of the sum of money so received and not more than four (4) times the sum so received, as may be determined by the court, which penalty may be sued for and recovered by any person aggrieved and for his use and benefit, in any court of competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 73-35-31(2). Saucier argues that Defendants \u201cillegally usurped commissions to which she would have been entitled under Mississippi law,\u201d and therefore, she is a person aggrieved for purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">We find that the district court properly applied the rules of statutory construction and correctly concluded that Saucier lacked standing under \u00a7 73-35-31(2). <em>See Leary v. Stockman, </em>937 So.2d 964, 974 (Miss.Ct.App.2006) (\u201cAlthough [the plaintiff] is undoubtedly \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by the factual circumstances, that does not necessarily mean he qualifies as a \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 by [a defendant\u2019s] unlicensed real estate transaction within the context of Section 73-35-31. Rather, he was aggrieved by [a defendant\u2019s] alleged breach of contract.\u201d). We also find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to strike the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">We affirm the district court\u2019s rulings. Saucier also requested that we consider the issue of the admissibility of certain evidence in a future trial if we reverse the decision of the district court and find that Saucier has standing. Because we do not reverse the district court\u2019s finding, we need not address this issue. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
