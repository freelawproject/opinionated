A95 377 030/031 (B.I.A. Sep. 20, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. The BIA found that the Chens\u2019 motion was untimely and numerically barred. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). The Government properly argues that petitioners failed to challenge that finding before this Court. As such, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Because there are no exceptions to the time and numerical bars for motions to reconsider, the petitioners\u2019 waiver is fatal to their petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
