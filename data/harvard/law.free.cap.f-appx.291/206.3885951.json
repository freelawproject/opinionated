HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">Dennis Palmer, proceeding pro se, appeals from a jury verdict in favor of the defendants in his civil rights action. Mr. Palmer also appeals from the district court\u2019s order requiring him to pay a portion of the fees incurred in selecting a jury for his original trial, which was continued after Mr. Palmer\u2019s counsel withdrew. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b230-25\">Mr. Palmer filed a complaint alleging that his constitutional rights were violated during his temporary incarceration at the Sequoyah County Jail. When he filed his lawsuit, Mr. Palmer was represented by Corinne O\u2019Day-Hanan. The parties initially selected a jury to try the case, but then Ms. O\u2019Day-Hanan moved to withdraw from representing him. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>granted the motion, continued the trial for three months to give Mr. Palmer time to find a new attorney, and ordered Mr. Palmer to pay a portion of the costs incurred in gathering a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On January 14, 2008, Mr. Palmer, proceeding pro se, filed a motion requesting the district court to reconsider permitting Ms. O\u2019Day-Hanan to withdraw as his counsel, requesting to have the trial (which was set for February 4, 2008) continued, and seeking relief from the order to pay jury costs. The district court denied the motion. Mr. Palmer then filed three more motions asking the district court again for a continuance, for an order to have Ms. O\u2019Day-Hanan release certain files to him, and to relieve him from paying jury expenses. Those requests were also denied. Mr. Palmer next filed a motion seeking a change of venue, arguing that the district judge was biased against him and he could not get a fair trial in Oklahoma. The district court denied the motion. Mr. Palmer\u2019s case proceeded to trial and the jury ultimately entered a verdict in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Mr. Palmer filed a notice of appeal. He then filed a motion in the district court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d), which the district court granted in part and denied in part. The district court also ordered Mr. Palmer to submit certain financial documents. In response to the district court\u2019s order, Mr. Palmer submitted some of the requested documents. He argued, however, that if the judge did not grant him IFP status, then he should recuse himself from the case so that another judge could be appointed and IFP status could be granted. The district court construed this response as a motion to reconsider its IFP order and, in the alternative, as a motion to recuse from ruling on the IFP motion. The district court denied the motion to recuse and reaffirmed its IFP ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The appellees argue that Mr. Palmer has waived all arguments on appeal by failing to address them sufficiently or to support them in his opening brief. We agree. Mr. Palmer\u2019s three-page brief fails to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28 and fails to offer any substantive argument to support his contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Mr. Palmer\u2019s brief contains three sections, which he describes as: \u201cStatement of the Case,\u201d \u201cStatement of facts relevant to the Issues Presented for Review,\u201d and \u201cStatement of Issues.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 1-2. Rule 28 requires that an appellant\u2019s brief contain \u201ca statement of facts relevant to the issues submitted for review with appropriate references to the record.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(7). Mr. Palmer\u2019s statement of facts contains no record references and consists of conclusory statements. <em>See, e.g., </em>Aplt. Br. at II 2.A. (\u201cI was wrongfully made to defend myself in a court of law at a time that the court knew I was under the influence of prescribed narcotics.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Rule 28 requires also that the opening brief contain an argument section with \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Mr. Palmer\u2019s brief does not include an argument section. Instead, for his \u201cStatement of Issues,\u201d he includes a laundry list of complaints against the district court. None of these conclusory allegations is supported with citations to legal authority or the record. <em>See, e.g., </em>Aplt. Br. at H 3.F. (\u201c[The judge] further found out in trial that there was communication and meetings going on with my lawyer which fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ther violated] my rights under his act to let my lawyer go.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Although we construe pro se filings liberally, \u201cthe court cannot take on the responsibility of serving as the litigant\u2019s attorney in constructing arguments and searching the record.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir.2005). Moreover, \u201can appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status does not excuse the obligation of any litigant to comply with the fundamental requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure.\u201d <em>Ogden v. San Juan County, </em>32 F.3d 452, 455 (10th Cir.1994). Mr. Palmer\u2019s cursory list of complaints about his proceedings before the district court is inadequate to preserve appellate review. <em>See Utahns for Better Transp. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>305 F.3d 1152, 1175 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]ssues will be deemed waived if they are not adequately briefed.\u201d). We simply cannot tell from Mr. Palmer\u2019s brief (1) the facts surrounding the alleged errors, (2) the legal basis for his contentions, or (3) whether he suffered any prejudice from the alleged errors. Because Mr. Palmer has wholly failed to support any issue with argument, evidence, or citations to the record, and has failed to comply with Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, he has waived all issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
