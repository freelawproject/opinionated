The facts are known to the parties and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">1. The district court did not err in its instruction to the jury on the intent requirement for a \u201ctrue threat\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332a(a)(3). As Schipke had requested, the court\u2019s \u201ctrue threat\u201d instruction focused on her subjective intent and incorporated the definition of a \u201ctrue threat\u201d from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Virginia v. Black, </em>538 U.S. 343, 359-60, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003). Although the district court did not incorporate Schipke\u2019s entire proposed instruction, she is not entitled to an instruction using precisely the words she wants as long as the instruction is legally correct. <em>See United States v. Marks, </em>530 F.3d 799, 809 (9th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">2. The government introduced sufficient evidence at trial that Schipke threatened to use a destructive device against property leased by the United States. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332a(a)(3). Several witnesses testified that Schipke threatened to detonate a bomb at the Oracle Post Office, which is located in a building leased by the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">3. Schipke\u2019s rights under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, were not violated. Schipke has failed to show that more than seventy non-excluded days elapsed between her indictment and the start of her trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">4. The district court properly found that Schipke\u2019s conduct satisfied the motivational element of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4 because her actions were \u201ccalculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4 cmt. n. 1 (incorporating definition of \u201cfederal crime of terrorism\u201d from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">5. Finally, a review of the district court\u2019s sentencing hearing indicates that it considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Schipke has failed to show that the district court\u2019s decision to depart from an advisory guideline range of 210-262 months and impose a sentence of 48 months was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-92 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">For each of these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b131-27\"> jjjjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
