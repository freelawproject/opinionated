Gee argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to discharge his appointed attorney, William Clark, Jr. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gee\u2019s motion for new counsel. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1343 (11th Cir.1997). The record reflects no irreconcilable conflict between Gee and Clark. Although Gee had complained earlier that Clark had failed to prepare his case for trial and had pressured him to accept a guilty plea, Gee expressed, at the hearing on his motion for new counsel, concern only with Clark\u2019s failure to pursue a baseless motion to suppress. Clark represented Gee vigorously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>at trial and sentencing. In the light of the record, any alleged lack of communication between Gee and Clark was not so great that it prevented Gee from receiving an adequate defense. Gee also fails to explain how he was prejudiced by being forced to proceed with Clark as his lawyer. We affirm Gee\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
