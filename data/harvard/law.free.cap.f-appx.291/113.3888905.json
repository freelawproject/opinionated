The parties are familiar with the facts of the case, so we repeat them here only to the extent necessary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">Cervantes-Bravo\u2019s counsel did not challenge the sentence below. We therefore review for plain error. <em>United States v. Geston, </em>299 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cA \u2018plain error\u2019 must be clear and obvious, \u2018highly prejudicial\u2019 and must affect \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Siu Kuen Ma, </em>290 F.3d 1002, 1005 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-19\">We cannot say that the district court\u2019s failure to examine Cervantes-Bravo\u2019s eligibility for safety valve relief was plain error. In his plea agreement, Cervantes-Bravo agreed not to seek safety valve relief, and his counsel in fact requested a ten year sentence consistent with the mandatory minimum. Further, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>is not clear from the record whether Cervantes-Bravo\u2019s cooperation with the government was sufficient to qualify for safety valve relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). Under the circumstances, any error by the district court was not clear and obvious, and so the district court therefore did not commit plain error in failing to consider Cervantes-Bravo\u2019s eligibility for safety valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 also did not require the district court to depart from the mandatory minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 provides that a defendant should be sentenced in accordance with the purposes set forth in section 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2) \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided.\u201d The mandatory minimum provision Cervantes-Bravo was sentenced under, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), is a specific exception to the general requirement of sentencing according to the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Accordingly, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 did not require the district court to depart from the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
