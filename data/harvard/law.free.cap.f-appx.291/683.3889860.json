She argues that the district court clearly erred in enhancing her offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(B) because one of her co-conspirators brandished a weapon during the offense. She argues that she was unaware that any of her co-conspirators possessed a weapon and that it was not foreseeable to her that one of them would brandish a weapon during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Charon, </em>442 F.3d 881, 887 (5th Cir.), cert <em>denied, </em>549 U.S. 915, 127 S.Ct. 260, 166 L.Ed.2d 202 (2006). Although there was no direct evidence that Villanueva-Alvarado knew one of her co-conspirators possessed and brandished a weapon during the course of the offense, the evidence supported the distinct court\u2019s finding that the brandishing of a weapon by one of her co-conspirators was reasonably foreseeable to her. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Villanueva-Alvarado\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B). Moreover, because Villanueva-Alvarado was sentenced within the recommended guidelines range, her sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
