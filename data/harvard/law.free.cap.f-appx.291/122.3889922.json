HENRY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Sixteen plaintiffs, who were participating in an antiwar rally, brought this action against various officers with the Albuquerque Police Department (\u201cAPD\u201d), their supervisors, and the Mayor and the City of Albuquerque, alleging constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 as well as state law tort claims. The defendants-appellants in this appeal are five individual officers (\u201cthe Officers\u201d) who assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 First Amendment deprivation claim. Exercising circumscribed jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to the Officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We have outlined the historical facts preceding the March 20, 2003, antiwar protest in our recent opinion in <em>Fogarty v. Gallegos, </em>523 F.3d 1147, 1150-51 (10th Cir. 2008), and we need not repeat them in full here. As noted in <em>Fogarty, </em>\u201cthe parties vigorously dispute significant details surrounding the actions of the APD, [plaintiffs], and other protesters .... [and][w]e thus set forth a general description of events here, but discuss the district court\u2019s factual findings as we address defendants\u2019 specific contentions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">In the days leading up to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, the area of downtown Albuquerque near the University of New Mexico (\u201cUNM\u201d) campus became home to several antiwar protests. Protest leaders planned a demonstration for March 20, 2003, the day after the United States invaded Iraq, and met beforehand with the APD to discuss logistics. The protest was to take place in part on UNM property, where protests were allowed on its campus without restriction under the university\u2019s policy, but also on the city streets, where defendants claim that city and state law requires permits for large gatherings or marches. Although the protesters had not obtained a permit, APD coordinated with protest leaders and planned to close one lane of the street adjacent to the UNM bookstore, where the organizers planned to gather, if necessary. The exact nature and extent of APD\u2019s acquiescence to the protest [are] disputed by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">Around 5:00 p.m. that evening, a crowd gathered on the UNM campus to express opposition to the war. [ ] Captain John Gonzales supervised the APD response, consisting of up to 75 officers and including SWAT teams, equine units, canine units, traffic officers, and a bomb squad. Later, John Gonzales also mobilized Emergency Response Teams (\u201cERTs\u201d). Members of SWAT and ERT wore face-concealing gas masks, and ERT uniforms did not have any identifying marks such as the officers\u2019 names or badge numbers. [Plaintiffs] allege[] that officers wearing standard uniforms concealed them badge numbers with tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-13\">At the protest\u2019s peak, between 500 and 1000 individuals were present, spilling over onto Albuquerque city sidewalks fronting UNM and eventually filling the crosswalks of adjacent streets. According to APD, the protesters\u2019 occupation of the crosswalks effectively blocked all traffic on Central Avenue, the street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>running past the bookstore. To ensure the crowd\u2019s safety, APD closed the street just east of the bookstore. After the street was closed, the crowd flooded into the rest of the street. The protesters then began moving west on Central Avenue. Eventually, they encountered a police skirmish line blocking the avenue, at which point they turned around and began walking east, back toward the bookstore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1150-51 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The Officers maintained that the protestors failed to heed repeated warnings to clear the streets and disperse. Captain Gonzales ordered the use of tear gas to clear1 the street and ordered the confiscation of several protestors\u2019 drums, because the drums were hindering communication. Several protestors were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">While near the intersection of Central Avenue and Cornell Drive, Sergeant Hill and Officer Lopez tossed tear gas canisters into the crowd. Captain Gonzales, Officer Lopez, and Officer Hancock followed with a second volley. Officer Fisher or Officer Perdue used a pepperball gun to shoot pepperball projectiles at plaintiffs Camille Chavez and Michael Kisner, and Officer Perdue apparently similarly shot some unknown protestors with pepperball rounds. Plaintiffs contend that this use of force to break up the protest violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of expression and assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The plaintiffs filed suit in New Mexico state court, raising a host of claims. Certain City of Albuquerque defendants removed the suit to federal district court. As to the First Amendment claim at issue, the plaintiffs alleged that the Officers violated their rights to freedom of speech and prevented their peaceful assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In response, the Officers emphasized that their actions were not motivated as a response to the protestors\u2019 opinions, then-opposition to the war, or to the statements directed to the officers. Aplts\u2019 App. vol. II, doc. 9, at 289-90. The Officers \u201cwere motivated solely by them duty to enforce [state and city] laws.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In its order, the district court dismissed most of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Officers. The district court analyzed plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment retaliation claim against the Officers under the rubric of <em>Worrell v. Henry, </em>219 F.3d 1197 (10th Cir.2000), which holds that plaintiffs must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">(1) that the plaintiffs were \u201cengaged in constitutionally protected activity\u201d; (2) that the defendants\u2019] actions caused the plaintiff \u201cto suffer an injury that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity\u201d; and (3) that the \u201cdefendants\u2019] adverse action was substantially motivated as a response to the plaintiff[s\u2019] exercise of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">219 F.3d at 1212. The district court determined there was \u201cno question\u201d that plaintiffs satisfied prong (1) (protesting the government\u2019s decision to go to war is a constitutionally protected activity); and prong (2) (the use of tear gas, pepper spray and physical force to disperse plaintiffs and protestors \u201ccould have chilled a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to participate in the demonstration.\u201d) Aplts\u2019 App. vol. VIII, doc. 47, at 2038. Recognizing that a determination of the third <em>Worrell </em>element \u2014 the officers\u2019 motivation \u2014 lodged it in deep water, the court concluded there existed genuine issues of material fact as to the Officers\u2019 motivation, denied summary judgment and also determined the Officers were not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">The Officers timely appealed. The plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court to certify that the Officers\u2019 interlocutory</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>appeal was frivolous. The court seemed inclined to agree, noting that the Officers \u201ccontest only the sufficiency of the evidence offered ... in response to [their] factual assertions, and thus do not fall into the category of qualified immunity rulings that are immediately appealable.\u201d Aples\u2019 App. doc. 10, at 67. Because the court knew that codefendant Captain John Gonzales\u2019s appeal was also pending, it ultimately decided \u201cit would be impractical to proceed immediately to trial .... [because there are overlapping issues, evidence, and witnesses between [plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Defendant Gonzales the [Officers].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69. Thus, although the court concluded that \u201cthere appears to be no proper basis for the ... Officers to appeal the Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment,\u201d it did not certify the appeal as frivolous. <em>Id.; see Stewart v. Donges, </em>915 F.2d 572, 576 (10th Cir.1990) (noting that \u201ca finding of frivolousness enablefs] the district court to retain jurisdiction and to proceed to trial absent intervention by the court of appeals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Officers now concede that then- use of tear gas and pepperball rounds directly affected certain plaintiffs. However, they challenge the conclusion that their actions, even \u201cassuming an improper motive,\u201d directly affected those plaintiffs who did <em>not </em>witness or could not have witnessed the Officers\u2019 actions. Aplts\u2019 Br. at 28. As such, the Officers argue they are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to such plaintiffs. The appellees argue that, despite the non-presence of certain plaintiffs, the word spread; these plaintiffs knew of the Officers\u2019 aggressive actions at other places along the route, and these plaintiffs were thus chilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Of course, \u201cw[e] have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Schroeck v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 947, 950 (10th Cir.2005). But, in the matter of an interlocutory appeal raising qualified immunity, our jurisdiction is quite limited. As in <em>Fogarty,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkX\">[b]efore turning to the merits of this appeal, we must first address the extent of our jurisdiction over the issues presented. Although orders denying summary judgment are ordinarily not appealable, we have interlocutory jurisdiction over denials of qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage to the extent that they \u201cturn[ ] on an issue of law.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>472 U.S. at 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806. Under this limited jurisdiction, we may review the district court\u2019s abstract legal conclusions, such as whether the law was clearly established at the time of the alleged infraction. <em>See Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). At this stage, however, <em>we are not at liberty to review a district court\u2019s factual conclusions, such\u25a0 as the existence of a genuine issue of-material fact for a jury to decide, or that a, plaintiff\u2019s evidence is sufficient to support a particular factual inference </em>.... Those facts explicitly found by the district court, combined with those that it likely assumed, then form the universe of facts upon which we base our legal review of whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">523 F.3d at 1153 (certain citations and footnote omitted) (emphasis added); <em>Lowery v. County of Riley, </em>522 F.3d 1086, 1091 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cWe do not have jurisdiction to resolve disputed issues of fact and have therefore obseived that a defendant may not appeal the sufficiency \u2014 as opposed to the legal significance \u2014 of the plaintiffs evidence.\u201d). \u201cOur jurisdiction also extends to situations where a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>dant claims on appeal that accepting the plaintiffs version of the facts as true, he is still entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>York v. City of Las Cruces, </em>523 F.3d 1205, 1209 (10th Cir.2008). We note that, \u201c[ujsually, if the law was clearly established at the time of the relevant events, the qualified immunity defense will fail.\u201d <em>Mimics, Inc. v. Village of Angel Fire, </em>394 F.3d 836, 842 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u201cWe review the denial of a summary judgment motion raising qualified immunity questions de novo[,]\u201d <em>Medina v. Cram, </em>252 F.3d 1124, 1128 (10th Cir.2001), and \u201cconstrue the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Estate of Larsen ex rel. Sturdivan v. Mwrr, </em>511 F.3d 1255, 1258 (10th Cir.2008). And generally, \u201cin an interlocutory appeal we must accept a district court\u2019s determination that the evidence is sufficient to support a particular factual inference, and its closely related conclusion that genuine issues of fact exist for trial.\u201d <em>Fogarty, </em>523 F.3d at 1155 (citing <em>Cortez v. McCauley, </em>478 F.3d 1108, 1121 n. 16 (10th Cir.2007) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Our <em>Worrell </em>inquiry revolves around the evidence supporting (1) that plaintiffs were engaged in constitutionally protected activity; (2) whether defendants caused the plaintiffs to suffer an injury that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity, and (3) whether defendants\u2019 actions were motivated by plaintiffs\u2019 protected activity. 219 F.3d at 1212. The Officers do not challenge that the plaintiffs were engaged in constitutionally protected conduct. As to causation, the district court found that the Officers\u2019 \u201cuse of tear gas, pepper spray, and physical force to disperse [pjlaintiffs could have chilled a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to participate in the demonstration.\u201d Aplts\u2019 App. vol. VIII, doc. 47, at 2038.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">On appeal, the Officers attempt to frame their argument in terms of the district court\u2019s having erred as a matter of law in its determination that each of the plaintiffs established the Officers violated their clearly established constitutional rights. Specifically, they argue that certain plaintiffs cannot establish that the Officers\u2019 \u201cconduct <em>caused </em>them to suffer an injury ... that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to exercise his or her constitutional rights.\u201d Aplts\u2019 Br. at 32 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, the Officers contend that Officer Hill\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Officer Lopez\u2019s, and Officer Hancock\u2019s use of tear gas could not have harmed Ms. Silva-Banuelos, Ms. Trafton, or Mr. Trafton, because they were not located near the intersection of Central Avenue and Cornell Drive when the tear gas was deployed. Second, the Officers maintain that the plaintiffs did not provide evidence that demonstrated that Officer Perdue\u2019s use of pepperball rounds against an unknown protestor caused them an injury. Third, the Officers argue that the plaintiffs other than Ms. Chavez and Mr. Kisner have not established that Officer Fisher\u2019s use of pepperball rounds against Ms. Chavez and Mr. Kisner caused them to suffer any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The fatal problem with the Officers\u2019 argument is that they did not challenge the second <em>WorreU </em>element, that of causation, below. <em>See </em>Aplts\u2019 App. vol. II, doc. 9, at 288-90. Because the challenge to causation was not raised previously, the plaintiffs\u2019 response could not be evaluated, and the district court did not have the opportunity to consider the argument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u201cIn the main, ... we have consistently refused invitations to consider new issues on appeal. We have therefore repeatedly stated that a party may not lose in the district court on one theory of the case, and then prevail on appeal on a different theory.\u201d <em>Lyons v. Jefferson Bank &amp; Trust, </em>994 F.2d 716, 721 (10th Cir.1993). Nor will we consider a new theory on appeal, even if it falls under the same general category as an argument raised below. <em>Bancamerica Commercial Corp. v. Mosher Steel of Kan., Inc., </em>100 F.3d 792, 798-99 (10th Cir.), <em>amended on other grounds, </em>103 F.3d 80 (10th Cir.1996). While we have recognized exceptions to this general rule, the exceptions are rare and generally limited to cases involving questions of jurisdiction, sovereign immunity, or questions of law that we felt had to be addressed to prevent a miscarriage of justice. <em>Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., </em>928 F.2d 966, 970 (10th Cir.1991); <em>see also Lyons, </em>994 F.2d at 721 (observing that we \u201chear issues for the first time on appeal only in the most unusual circumstances\u201d). The decision to take up questions for the first time on appeal is left primarily to this court\u2019s discretion, based on the facts of the individual case before us. <em>Singleton v. Wulff </em>428 U.S. 106, 121, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">III. CONCLUSION Because the Officers failed to raise them arguments as to the sufficiency of the evidence as to causation before the district court, we must AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment and denial of qualified immunity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b147-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">. It is discouraging that the bulk of the Officers\u2019 arguments are fleshed out in their Reply Brief, giving the plaintiffs little chance to respond to specific arguments. The Officers also curiously argue that because the district court determined there was sufficient evidence of causation, that they may appeal this finding as it is a legal, not factual one. However, we are unable to review a finding of sufficiency of the evidence in the context of this appeal. <em>See Lowery, </em>522 F.3d at 1091 (noting that in this type of interlocutory appeal \u201ca defendant may not appeal the sufficiency ... of the plaintiff's evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The Officers also contend that the \"district court resolvefd] individual claims with immaterial evidence,\u201d Reply Br. at 7, and that their challenges to the materiality of the evidence are legal challenges. This argument lacks force, and we decline to address it, as the Officers did not present it in their opening brief. <em>Stump v. Gates, </em>211 F.3d 527, 533 (10th Cir.2000) (raising issue for first time in reply brief \u201crobs the appellee of the opportunity ... to present an analysis of the pertinent legal precedent that may compel a contrary result\u201d). Moreover, as in <em>Fogarty, </em>our analysis would \"necessarily disregard those facts which have no bearing on our legal conclusions as we 'examin[e] the facts presented on summary judgment in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>they amount to a violation of a clearly-established right.' \" <em>Fogarty, </em>523 F.3d at 1154 n. 7 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Walker v. City of Orem, </em>451 F.3d 1139, 1155 (10th Cir. 2006)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. The district court carefully weighed the evidence and concluded that although the Officers argued their actions were based solely upon their duty to enforce the law, the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that the Officers intended to end the protest altogether, and harbored retaliatory motives in so doing. Aplts' App. vol. VIII, doc. 47, at 2038-40. The court concluded that there existed genuine issues of material fact that a jury must resolve as to the Officers' motivation. The Officers wisely chose not to challenge this conclusion on appeal, and even couch their argument \"assuming [their] improper motive.\u201d Aplts' Br. at 28. Likely, the Officers did not challenge the district court's conclusion because our limited jurisdiction leaves us unable to review the district court\u2019s conclusion as to \"the existence of a genuine issue of material fact for a jury to decide.\u201d <em>Fogarty, </em>523 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
