We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">The state court\u2019s determination that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient was not an objectively unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Based on what was known about the photographs \u2014 i.e., that they showed scantily-clad boys in various poses \u2014 there was a risk that the pictures would be found to depict \u201csexual conduct\u201d under N.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 200.710(1), 200.700(3). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Knox, </em>32 F.3d 733, 737 (3d Cir.1994) (holding that under the federal child pornography statute, lascivious exhibition of the genitals does not contain any requirement of nudity); <em>People v. Kongs, </em>30 Cal.App.4th 1741, 1753, 37 Cal.Rptr.2d 327 (1995) (holding that under California law, \u201csexual conduct\u201d does not require a nude exhibition of the genitals). <em>But see Illinois v. Dailey, </em>196 Ill.App.3d 807, 812, 144 Ill.Dec. 12, 554 N.E.2d 1051 (1990) (holding that \u201clewd exhibition of the genitals,\u201d as used within Illinois statute, requires genitals to be unclothed). Therefore, it was reasonable for trial counsel to accept the plea agreement and not request an evidentiary hearing or conduct an investigation. By accepting the plea agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ment, the number of counts was reduced from thirteen to three, and Petitioner\u2019s sentencing exposure was reduced significantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Because Petitioner did not allege facts establishing a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the district court did not err in denying the petition or failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b144-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
