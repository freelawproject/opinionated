We have jurisdiction of Comisar\u2019s appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Comisar is currently serving a 125-month sentence imposed on April 24, 2005, following a 2003 conviction in another case, <em>see United States v. Steven Robert Comisar, </em>CR 03-10-MMM (C.D.Cal.2003), <em>affd United States v. Comisar, </em>180 Fed.Appx. 651 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-19\">In this case, the district court imposed a term of imprisonment of sixty months, to run consecutively to the undischarged term previously imposed for the 2003 conviction. The underlying facts are known to the parties and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">Comisar claims that the district court unreasonably ordered his sentence to run consecutively to his undischarged 125-month term of imprisonment for his 2003 conviction. Specifically, he argues that the district court committed error when it (1) failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons for the denial of his request for a concurrent sentence in the present case; and (2) allegedly used the underlying extortion conduct in the case at bar to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>pose an upward departure at sentencing for the 2003 conviction pursuant to section 4A1.3 of the Guidelines. Comisar claims that the consecutive sentence therefore amounts to \u201cdouble punishment\u201d because the district court had already taken the conduct into consideration when it departed upward at his 2005 sentencing for the 2003 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Where an appellant challenges the sentence imposed by the district court, we first consider \u201cwhether the district court properly calculated the applicable range under the advisory guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Warr, 530 F.3d 1152, 1158 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Barsumyan, </em>517 F.3d 1154, 1157 (9th Cir.2008)). Second, we consider \u201cchallenges to the reasonableness of the overall sentence in light of all the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d Wan* 530 F.3d at 1158 (internal quotation marks omitted). A review for reasonableness of the sentence imposed by the district court requires us to \u201cask[ ] whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d Wan; 530 F.3d at 1160 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We conclude that the district court adequately stated its reasons for the sentence imposed and its reasons for rejecting Comisar\u2019s arguments for a concurrent sentence. At Comisar\u2019s sentencing, the district court stated that it had \u201ccarefully\u201d reviewed all submissions and that it had \u201cconsidered everything that has been given to [it].\u201d The district court then recognized its \u201cobligation\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and set forth a detailed analysis of the factors enumerated in section 3553(a). The court discussed the severity of Comisar\u2019s crime, the fact that the crime was committed while Comisar was serving a prison sentence, Comisar\u2019s history of \u201cviolations,\u201d the importance of deterrence, and the goal of protecting the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Moreover, the district court repeatedly addressed the issue of whether Comisar\u2019s sentence would run concurrently with his 125-month term of imprisonment imposed for his 2003 conviction. The court clearly stated that no promise of a concurrent sentence was ever made to Comisar.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">We also reject Comisar\u2019s argument that the conduct underlying this case was part of the reason for the upward departure at the 2005 sentencing hearing for his 2003 conviction. At Comisar\u2019s sentencing hearing for his 2003 conviction, the district judge explicitly excluded the conduct underlying this case from her consideration of whether or not to depart upward: \u201cThe [c]ourt will note ... that it has not considered the information regarding the ... alleged extortion plot in determining the appropriate sentence to apply in this case. It has certainly not considered it in terms of whether or not [Comisar\u2019s] criminal history is substantially understated\u201d for purposes of an upward departure pursuant to Guidelines section 4A1.3. Comisar has failed to point to anything in the record before us indicating that the district judge improperly considered the conduct in this case when deciding to impose an upward departure in the 2003 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Finally, we reject Comisar\u2019s sentencing-manipulation claim that he was denied due process of law by the government\u2019s \u201cunnecessary delay in charging the current offense\u201d for the purpose of increasing his sentencing exposure or \u201clengthening the total term imposed on the two federal prosecutions.\u201d This Court has declined to adopt a rule that due process is violated when the government opts to continue its investigation after it has obtained sufficient evidence to indict. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>63 F.3d 1478, 1500 (9th Cir.1995) (questioning the \u201cviability of [the] sentencing manipulation ... doctrine\u201d and holding that \u201c[s]uch a rule would unnecessarily and unfairly restrict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>the discretion and judgment of investigators and prosecutors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Comisar\u2019s request for judicial notice is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b846-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
