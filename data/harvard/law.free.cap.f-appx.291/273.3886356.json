This category did not, however, take into consideration Castillo-Roman\u2019s prior convictions for armed robbery, murder, and attempted robbery, all of which occurred more than fifteen years before the instant offenses. The PSI also noted that Castillo-Roman was currently imprisoned following a racketeering conviction. The resulting guidelines range was 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">At sentencing, there were no objections to the PSI. The government recommended a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range in light of Castillo-Roman\u2019s criminal history, and Castillo-Roman requested the low end of the guidelines range. After considering the parties\u2019s arguments, the advisory guidelines range, and the sentencing factors, the court sentenced Castillo-Roman to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to the term Castillo-Roman was already serving on racketeering charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">On appeal, Castillo-Roman argues that his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly focused on Castillo-Roman\u2019s criminal history, while ignoring the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and failed to give an explanation for the sentence, which was higher than that requested by the government and Castillo-Roman. Castillo-Roman also argues that the 21-month sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">We review a final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007). The reasonableness of a final sentence is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must impose a sentence that is both proeedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180,1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be proeedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The Court also suggested that review for substantive reasonableness involves an inquiry into whether the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) support the challenged sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 600; <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). We will remand if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature of the circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The district court is not required to explicitly state that it has considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">After a thorough review of the record, we find no reversible error. The district court properly considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), along with the mitigating factors presented by Castillo-Roman, adequately explained the chosen sentence, and imposed a sentence no greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Thus, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Castillo-Roman. Accordingly, the sentence is reasonable and due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">.
