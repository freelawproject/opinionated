However, because the district court remanded the issue to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to consider this case. Therefore, we DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b677-18\">Appellants Hughes &amp; Luce LLP (\u201cH&amp;L\u201d) served as counsel for the equity security holder in the bankruptcy proceedings underlying this appeal. When H&amp;L sought attorney\u2019s fees, the bankruptcy court calculated these fees according to a \u201creasonable benefit\u201d test, finding that H&amp;L could be compensated for work that initially appeared beneficial but was proven non-beneficial in hindsight. The bankruptcy trustee appealed this calculation of H&amp;L\u2019s fees to the district court, arguing that the bankruptcy courts should have applied a \u201cmaterial benefits\u201d test, which would provide H&amp;L fees only for services that actually benefited the estate. The district court agreed with the trustee, holding that a \u201cmaterial benefits\u201d test should have been applied; thus, the district court remanded the issue to the bankruptcy court for recalculation of fees. On appeal, H&amp;L challenges the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Our standard of review is the same as the district court\u2019s, we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo; </em>however, before addressing the merits of this case, we must first examine our appellate jurisdiction. <em>See In re Pratt, </em>524 F.3d 580, 584 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\u201cUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from all \u2018final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees.\u2019 We have held that \u2018[w]hen a district court sitting as a court of appeals in bankruptcy remands a case to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings, the remand order is not final and therefore not appealable under \u00a7 158(d).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Cortez, </em>457 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, because the district court remanded the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees to the bankruptcy court, our jurisdiction over this matter depends on whether that remand requires \u201csignificant further proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We have articulated the test for \u201csignificant further proceedings\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">To determine what constitutes significant further proceedings, we distinguish between \u201cthose remands requiring the bankruptcy court to perform \u2018judicial functions\u2019 and those requiring mere \u2018ministerial functions.\u2019 \u201d If the remand requires the bankruptcy court to perform judicial functions, such as additional fact-finding, it is not a final order and therefore it is not appealable to this court. Remands that involve only ministerial proceedings, \u201csuch as the entry of an order by the bankruptcy court in accordance with the district court\u2019s decision,\u201d are considered final. In some instances, a remand for the calculation of attorney\u2019s fees may be considered a ministerial function; however, \u201ca remand requiring such a calculation is not final if it necessitates further factual development or other significant judicial activity involving the exercise of considerable discretion, or is likely to generate a new appeal or affect the issue that the disappointed party wants to raise on appeal from the order of remand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 584-85 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">In the instant case, the district court called for significant further proceedings in the bankruptcy court by \u201creversing] the fee award and remand[ing] the action to the bankruptcy court <em>for a reassessment of H&amp;L\u2019s fee application.\u201d Kaye v. Hughes &amp; Luce, LLP, </em>2007 WL 2059724 at *1 (N.D.Tex. July 13, 2007) (emphasis added). Further, the district court noted that \u201cbecause the bankruptcy court did not evaluate H&amp;L\u2019s fee application under the material benefit standard, the Court finds that that court should <em>reassess H&amp;L\u2019s fee application in the first instance using that standard.\u201d Id. </em>at *12 n. 5 (emphasis added). Thus, the district court called for a complete re-adjudication of the attorney\u2019s fees issue, and such a proceeding, which will likely require further factual development and is likely to generate a new appeal or affect the issue that the disappointed party wants to raise on appeal, will require the bankruptcy court to perform a judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">In <em>Pratt, </em>we considered a scenario similar to the one at issue here and found a remand for reconsideration of attorney\u2019s fees to require a \u201cjudicial function\u201d of the bankruptcy court and thus to constitute \u201csignificant further proceedings.\u201d <em>See Pratt, </em>524 F.3d at 585. Just as in <em>Pratt, </em>in this case we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal; accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b677-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
