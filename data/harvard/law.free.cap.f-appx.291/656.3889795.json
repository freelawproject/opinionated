AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">In February 2005, APS laid off 102 employees from its Columbus, Mississippi, plant, including Plaintiffs. This action was filed in January 2006. The November 2006 amended complaint, for 49 named Plaintiffs, and \u201cother Plaintiffs similarly situated\u201d, claimed APS violated the WARN Act by not providing advance notice of the layoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Following discovery, APS moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 WARN Act claim. APS contended dismissal was proper for several reasons, including that 60-days\u2019 notice of the layoff was not required because, under the WARN Act, the layoff was not a \u201cmass layoff\u2019 because less than one-third of APS\u2019 employees at the \u201csingle site of employment\u201d suffered an \u201cemployment loss\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Attached to APS\u2019 motion were three declarations: by APS\u2019 president, office manager, and plant manager. The office manager: confirmed the February 2005 layoffs of 102 Columbus employees, out of the 343 Columbus, Mississippi, <em>and </em>Fayette, Alabama, employees; and stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Columbus and Fayette plants perform the same function \u2014 producing military uniforms to fulfill the same government contract \u2014 and share employees. As noted, APS maintained the Columbus and Fayette plants were a \u201csingle site of employment\u201d under the WARN Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">After receiving two extensions of time, Plaintiffs filed their opposition to summary judgment. They contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Fayette plant\u2019s employees should not be counted with the Columbus plant\u2019s for purposes of determining whether a sufficient percentage of employees was laid off to constitute a \u201cmass layoff\u2019. Along that line, they maintained, but without providing supporting evidence, that the Columbus and Fayette plants were <em>not </em>a \u201csingle site of employment\u201d because, <em>inter alia, </em>they do not routinely share employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">Defendant replied, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that Plaintiffs failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on whether one-third of the employees at the relevant \u201csingle site of employment\u201d suffered an employment loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">On 24 September, a pretrial conference was held (in anticipation of a bench trial). On 3 October, however, Defendants\u2019 summary judgment was granted on the basis that Plaintiffs failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. The court noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Plaintiffs offered <em>no </em>evidence to rebut APS\u2019 assertion that no \u201cmass layoff\u2019, under WARN, had occurred. It held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the WARN Act\u2019s \u201cunexpected business circumstances\u201d exception excused APS\u2019 failure to give 60-days\u2019 notice. (It did <em>not </em>address the single-site issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>On 22 October, Plaintiffs moved for relief from, or amendment of, the judgment. For an issue not controlling for the mass-layoff issue at hand, they pointed to 48 laid-off employees who were not contacted for recall within six months of the layoff and attached declarations of nine such employees. Defendant responded on 24 October. The district court denied the motion. It noted that Plaintiffs \u201crel[ied] almost entirely upon arguments and facts which, with reasonable diligence, could have been presented to this court originally\u201d, and ruled summary judgment remained appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as did the district court. <em>E.g., Wheeler v. BL Dev. Corp., </em>415 F.3d 399, 401 (5th Cir. 2005). Such judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact <em>and </em>the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\u201cWe resolve doubts in favor of the non-moving party and make all reasonable inferences in favor of that party.\u201d <em>Dean v. City of Shreveport, </em>438 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2006). No genuine issue of material fact exists, however, if, based on the summary-judgment evidence, no reasonable juror could find for the nonmovant. <em>E.g., Jenkins v. Methodist Hosps. of Dallas, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 181, 169 L.Ed.2d 35 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">To survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must provide sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>E.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cThis Court has cautioned that conclusory allegations, speculation, and unsubstantiated assertions are inadequate to satisfy the nonmovant\u2019s burden in a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ramsey v. Henderson, </em>286 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir'. 2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (\u201cparty may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party\u2019s pleadings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">As a threshold matter, our <em>de novo </em>review is limited to the evidence that would be properly before the district court when it made its summary-judgment ruling. <em>E.g., Palasota v. Haggar Clothing Co., </em>499 F.3d 474, 489 n. 12 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Along that line, Plaintiffs do not appeal from the denial of their motion for reconsideration. Their notice of appeal stated the 3 October 2007 summary-judgment was being appealed; they did not either amend it to include the order denying reconsideration or file a new notice appealing that order; and their brief does not mention that denial. <em>See Fiess v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>392 F.3d 802, 806-07 (5th Cir.2004) (refusing to review reconsideration-denial where no intent to appeal it was shown); Fed. R.App. Peoc. 3(c)(1)(B) (stating notice must indicate which judgment is appealed), 4(a)(1)(A) (stating notice can be amended). Thus, our <em>de novo </em>review includes Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to summary judgment, but not their motion for new trial, with the requested supplemental evidence. <em>See, e.g., Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Further, the judgment can be affirmed on any basis preserved in district court. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Sawyer, </em>120 F.3d 1307, 1316 (5th Cir.1997). Here, as it did in district court, APS contends Plaintiffs failed to create a genuine issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>material fact on whether the layoffs constitute a \u201cmass layoff\u2019 (including the single-site-of-employment subissue) so that notice would be required under the WARN Act. As noted, the district court did not reach this single-site issue. Although they responded to this issue in district court, Plaintiffs do <em>not </em>brief it here, even though it is raised in APS\u2019 response brief. In other words, Plaintiffs did not respond to the issue through a reply brief. We do <em>not </em>consider them district court brief. <em>E.g., Turner v. Quarterman, </em>481 F.3d 292, 295 n. 1 (5th Cir.) (refusing to incorporate by reference district court pleadings), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 34, 168 L.Ed.2d 810 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Under the WARN Act, an employer must provide 60-days\u2019 written notice of a \u201cmass layoff\u2019. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(a). A \u201cmass layoff\u2019 is defined, in relevant part, as: \u201can employment loss at the <em>single site of employment ... </em>for \u2014 at least 33 percent of the employees\u201d. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(a)(3) (emphasis added). We assume, <em>arguendo, </em>each laid-off employee suffered an \u201cemployment loss\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Therefore, to prevail, for summary judgment purposes, on whether APS\u2019 February 2005 layoff was a \u201cmass layoff\u2019, for which notice was required, Plaintiffs had to provide specific facts creating a genuine issue of material fact on, <em>inter alia, </em>whether at least one-third of the employees at APS\u2019 \u201csingle site of employment\u201d suffered an employment loss. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(a)(3), (6); <em>see also, e.g., Ramsey, </em>286 F.3d at 269 (summary judgment burden).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Again, in moving for summary judgment, APS contended in district court (as it does now) that the February 2005 layoff was <em>not </em>a mass layoff because less than one-third of the employees at its \u201csingle site of employment\u201d suffered an employment loss. It asserted that, even if all 102 laid-off employees suffered an employment loss, those 102 do not comprise one-third of the single-site\u2019s employees because APS employs 343 employees at the relevant \u201csingle site of employment\u201d \u2014 the Columbus and Fayette plants. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.3(i)(l)-(5), (8) (describing what constitutes a \u201csingle site of employment\u201d); <em>Viator v. Delchamps, Inc., </em>109 F.3d 1124, 1127 (5th Cir.1997) (listing factors: \u201c1) the separate facilities are in \u2018reasonable geographic proximity of one another; 2) they are \u2018used for the same purpose\u2019; 3) and they \u2018share the same staff and equipment\u2019 \u201d (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.3(i)(3))). Defendants also relied upon <em>Carpenters District Council of New Orleans &amp; Vicinity v. Dillard Department Stores, Inc., </em>15 F.3d 1275 (5th Cir.1994), in which two sites, one of which was an expansion of the original site, were held to be a \u201csingle site of employment\u201d. As discussed, in support, APS relied upon its office manager\u2019s declaration stating that the two plants are within 40 miles of each other, manufacture the same uniforms to fulfill the same contract, and share management and payroll personnel; and that the Columbus plant was an expansion of Fayette\u2019s facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">In opposition to summary judgment, as the district court noted, Plaintiffs presented very little evidence. Moreover, they made no attempt to prove the elements of them claims or dispute APS\u2019 summary-judgment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">In district court, Plaintiffs <em>only asserted </em>that the employees in APS\u2019 Fayette plant should <em>not </em>be counted with the Columbus plant\u2019s employees in determining whether one-third of the employees were affected, contending, as noted, that the Columbus and Fayette plants do not constitute a \u201csingle site of employment\u201d because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>are in different States and that, although APS <em>occasionally </em>transferred employees between the two plants, those plants did not \u201cshare the same staff and equipment\u201d. <em>See Viator, </em>109 F.3d at 1127 (listing the latter as a factor). Plaintiffs did not discuss the managerial personnel APS\u2019 office manager declared were shared, and made no attempt to distinguish <em>Carpenters. </em>(Again, Plaintiffs do not even brief the single-site issue here.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">As noted, Plaintiffs were required in district court to provide specific facts in order to create a genuine issue of material fact on whether at least one-third of APS\u2019 employees at the relevant \u201csingle site of employment\u201d suffered an employment loss. Plaintiffs failed to do so because they offered no facts to create this material fact issue. They have provided no facts that, if proven, entitle them to relief against summary judgment. Restated, plaintiffs have provided no summary judgment proof in support of their assertions and arguments responding to the summary-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In sum, no evidence exists from which a reasonable juror could conclude that one-third of APS\u2019 employees at Plaintiffs\u2019 single site of employment were laid off. (Again, it is assumed that <em>all </em>laid-off employees suffered an \u201cemployment loss\u201d.) Therefore, Plaintiffs failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on whether a \u201cmass layoff\u2019 occurred so that 60-days\u2019 notice would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">As discussed, for the second prong for obtaining a summary judgment, APS must be \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). For the reasons stated above, it is entitled to such judgment. (Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 alternative bases for upholding the judgment need not be reached.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
