Defendants challenge the district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, its imposition of time limits during trial, and its interpretation of California Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(h). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">Defendants formed a corporation, PBIG Management Co., Inc. (PBIG), and five limited partnerships, and sold securities to Plaintiff in the five partnerships. Based on the district court\u2019s factual findings, which we do not find clearly erroneous, Defendants engaged in general solicitation in connection with the sale of their securities. Defendants offered to sell their securities in a public library during PBIG meetings that the district court found \u201cany interested party could attend.\u201d In addition, Defendants announced the PBIG investment opportunity and invited potential investors to attend the PBIG meetings at Pacific Bay Investment Club (PBIC) meetings. PBIC meetings were open to the public, held in a public library, and announced in a local newspaper. Had Defendants offered or sold PBIG securities at PBIC meetings, they would have violated state and federal securities laws. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.502(c) (prohibiting an issuer or any person acting on its behalf from selling unregistered securities by means of general solicitation, including, but not limited to, \u201cany seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.\u201d); Cal.Code Regs. tit. 10, \u00a7 260.102.12(j) (same).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact that these sales oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>curred at subsequent, equally accessible PBIG meetings, to which the attendees of the generally advertised PBIC meetings were invited, did not materially diminish the public nature of the offerings or of Defendants\u2019 solicitation. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Defendants engaged in general solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">As Defendants engaged in general solicitation, they cannot satisfy the elements of California Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(f)\u2019s registration exemption. <em>See </em>Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 25102(f)(4); Cal.Code Regs. tit. 10, \u00a7 260.102.12(j). Them arguments concerning the district court\u2019s determinations that they failed to establish that all investors were accredited and represented that them purchases were not for resale are beside the point. Defendants are not eligible for the statutory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">For the same reason, Defendants\u2019 contention that the district court's improper imposition of strict time limits prevented them from presenting evidence that would have established the qualifications or accreditation of each investor does not matter. Even if Defendants were given additional time to put on additional evidence of investor qualifications, and the district court found that all investors were qualified, Defendants would still have failed to satisfy the requirements for exemption under California Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(f) because they engaged in general solicitation. They therefore have not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of time limits \u201cadversely and unfairly affected their case.\u201d <em>See Hansen v. Comm\u2019r, </em>820 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Finally, we agree with the district court that California Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(h), which exempts from registration sales of common voting stock \u201cin a corporation,\u201d is inapplicable to sales of partnership interests. On its face, the exemption applies only to corporations, and the legislature\u2019s express inclusion of both corporations and partnerships in an analogous exemption in the same statute indicates that it did not intend subsection (h) to also apply to partnerships. <em>See </em>Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 25102(h), (n)(l); <em>Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (holding that where a legislature \u201cincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that [the legislature] acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d). The district court therefore properly rejected Defendants\u2019 argument that then-sales of unregistered securities in the five PBIG limited partnerships were exempt under California Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-13\">. The dissent argues that the prohibition on general solicitation under California law applies only when disclosure materials are distributed. Defendants distributed documents at its meetings disclosing the finances, history, products, sales figures, target markets, competitors, management teams, strategy, partners, and potential acquisition or IPO opportunities of the companies in which Defendants offered investments. Because we find that disclosure materials were distributed in this case, we do not decide whether the state securities laws permit individuals to engage in general solicitation in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>sale of securities in situations where federal law does not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b835-11\">WILLIAM A. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALE\">dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Plaintiff-appellee sued under federal and state securities laws for allegedly improper sale of five unregistered securities by defendants-appellants. After a bench trial, the district court ruled for the plaintiffappellee, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendants-appellants were not exempt from California registration requirements for the five securities. The district court awarded plaintiff-appellee a refund of the amount of his investment plus interest. The panel majority affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">I respectfully dissent with respect to the claimed exemption from the registration requirements of California law. The issue is whether defendants-appellants qualified for an exemption by virtue of California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(f). That section contains a number of subsections. In order to qualify for an exemption under \u00a7 25102(f), a seller must satisfy the criteria of all of these subsections. My dissent concerns two of these subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">First, the majority misunderstands and therefore misapplies subsection 25102(f)(4). Under that subsection, in order to qualify for exemption the \u201coffer and sale\u201d of a security must not be \u201caccomplished by the publication of any advertisement.\u201d The majority concludes that because the \u201cDefendants engaged in general solicitation, they cannot satisfy the elements of California Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(f)\u2019s registration exemption.\u201d Mem. at 3.1 disagree. Under a proper construction of subsection 25102(f)(4), and under any construction of the evidence presented at trial, defendants did not \u201caccomplish\u201d the sale of the securities in question \u201cby the publication of [an] advertisement.\u201d I would therefore reverse the district court\u2019s holding that defendants-appellants failed to satisfy the criteria of subsection 25102(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Second, the district court held that the defendants failed to establish, for three of the five securities, that the \u201coffer and sale\u201d of the securities satisfied the criteria of subsection 25102(f)(2). Under that subsection, all purchasers of the security must have sufficient \u201cbusiness or financial experience\u201d such that they \u201ccould be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect them own interests in connection with the transaction.\u201d The district court limited each side to eight hours in which to present its case. The majority concludes that whether defendants were given sufficient time to establish that the offer and sale of the three securities satisfied the criteria of subsection 25102(f)(2) \u201cdoes not matter.\u201d That conclusion is based on the majority\u2019s misinterpretation of subsection 25102(f)(4). I conclude that the time limitations do matter, and that the district court did not give the defendants sufficient time. I would therefore remand to the district court to take further evidence on the question whether the criteria of subsection 25102(f)(2) were satisfied for these three securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">A. Subsection 25102(f)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The district court and the panel majority conclude that, because of the nature of the advertising and solicitation done by the defendants, the sale of the five securities failed to satisfy the criteria of both federal and California law for exemption from registration. I agree with the district court and the panel majority with respect to federal law. But I disagree with respect to California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">California Corporations Code \u00a7 25102(f)(4) provides that, in order to be exempt from the registration requirements of \u00a7 25100, the \u201coffer and sale\u201d of a security must not be \u201caccomplished by the publication of any advertisement.\u201d The panel\u2019s unanimous conclusion that the district court committed no clear error in finding that the defendants engaged in general solicitation under federal law, Mem. at 2-3, does not preclude the defendants from being exempt under \u00a7 25102(f)(4). The language of \u00a7 25102(f)(4) establishes an exemption if certain investor qualifications are met and if \u201c[t]he offer and sale of the security is not accomplished by the publication of any advertisement.\u201d A \u201cgeneral solicitation\u201d \u2014 as distinct from an advertisement \u2014 does not disqualify an offeror from eligibility for the exemption under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">The majority appears to confuse the federal definition of \u201cgeneral solicitation or general advertising\u201d in 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.502(c) with similar language in the California regulation interpreting subsection 25102(f)(4). The majority\u2019s mistake is to some degree understandable \u2014 -the regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>lations use nearly identical language. But it is a mistake nonetheless, for the language is used in a very different way in California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Under federal law, the relevant exemption from federal securities laws provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF5\">Limitation on manner of offering. Except as provided in \u00a7 230.504(b)(1), neither the issuer nor any person acting on its behalf shall offer or sell the securities by any form of <em>general solicitation or general advertising, </em>including, but not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">(1) Any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over television or radio; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">(2) Any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general solicitation or general advertising. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.502(c)(l)-(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Under California law, the exemption is available if certain other conditions are met and if \u201c[t]he offer and sale of the security is not accomplished <em>by the publication of any advertisement.\u201d </em>Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 25102(f)(4) (emphasis added). The statute itself makes no reference to solicitation. The regulation interpreting subsection 25102(f)(4) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">Publication of Advertising. Section 25102(f)(4) of the Code is to be interpreted so as to facilitate the circulation of disclosure materials to offerees and purchasers, so long as such materials are not disseminated to the public.... Private placement memoranda, offering circulars and similar disclosure documents are not \u201cdisseminated to the public\u201d for the purposes of Section 25102(1) of the Code if the issuer limits such circulation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-11\">(1) to persons reasonably believed to be interested in purchasing the securities or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-12\">(2) to persons whom the issuer believes may meet the qualifications required of purchasers pursuant to such section and the rules thereunder, provided with respect to clause (1) and clause (2) that <em>neither the issuer nor any person acting on its behalf shall offer or sell the securities by any form, of general solicitation or general advertising, including, but not limited, to, the following:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-13\">(A) <em>Any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published, in, any 'newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over television or radio; and,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-14\">(B) <em>Any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited, by any general solicitation or general, advertising. </em>The preceding sentence does not create any presumption that a dissemination of materials otherwise than as described therein is a \u201cpublication of advertising,\u201d and the determination of that question shall be made without reference to that sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">Cal. Admin. Code tit. 10 \u00a7 260.102.12(j) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">The italicized portions of the state regulation are identical to the \u201cLimitation on manner of offering\u201d provision of 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.502(c). But the context in which those words are used is entirely different in the state regulation. The state regulation concerns the distribution of disclosure documents. It creates a safe harbor from the state prohibition on the \u201cpublication of any advertisement\u201d for issuers who limit the circulation of such documents to certain groups of individuals and who comply with the more rigorous federal prohibition on \u201cgeneral solicitation or general adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>tising.\u201d In other words, California law is concerned with whether an issuer offers or sells securities \u201cby any form of general solicitation or general advertising\u201d only when the issuer circulates private placement memoranda, offering circulars, and similar disclosure documents. Those documents are presumptively not \u201cadvertisements\u201d under the. language of subsection 25102(f)(4), but may be construed as such if the issuer sells the securities through general solicitation or general advertising, as defined by federal law. When the issuer does not circulate such disclosure documents, it must merely comply with the narrower requirement of subsection 25102(f)(4), which states that \u201c[t]he offer and sale of the security [must] not [be] accomplished by the publication of any advertisement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The district court found that PBIG had provided non-accredited investors with \u201cexecutive summaries\u201d and other information as required under 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 230.502(b)(2), 230.505(b). The district court did not make any findings of fact that would suggest that these materials constituted \u201cadvertisements\u201d under \u00a7 25102(f)(4), or that they were otherwise \u201cdisseminated to the public.\u201d <em>See </em>Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 25002 (\u201c \u2018Advertisement\u2019 means any written or printed communication or any communication by means of recorded telephone messages or spoken on radio, television, or similar communications media, <em>published </em>in connection with the offer or sale of a security.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 25014 (\u201c \u2018Publish\u2019 means publicly to issue or circulate by newspaper, mail, radio or television, or otherwise <em>to disseminate to the public.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Plaintiff-appellee has never argued that those materials were advertisements or that they were published.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Nothing in the record suggests that the defendants \u201caccomplished\u201d the \u201coffer and sale\u201d of their securities \u201cby the publication of any advertisement.\u201d They did not publish any advertisement for the sale of their securities or for the meetings in which they sold their securities. The defendants appeared at meetings of the Pacific Bay Investment Club (\u201cPBIC\u201d) and at those meetings announced their investment opportunities and invited potential investors to attend later meetings of the PBIG Management Company (\u201cPBIG\u201d). As the district court found, and as this panel unanimously concludes to be not clearly erroneous, such actions are sufficient to constitute \u201cgeneral solicitation\u201d under federal law. But, as just explained, they are not enough to disqualify a defendant from the exemption under California law. It is not enough that there has been \u201cgeneral solicitation.\u201d Rather, under California law, there must have been \u201cpublication\u201d of an \u201cadvertisement.\u201d There was no such advertisement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The earlier PBIC meetings were announced in the World Journal, a local Chinese community newspaper. Under the California Corporations Code, an \u201cadvertisement\u201d is \u201cany written or printed communication ... published in connection with the offer or sale of a security.\u201d Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 25002. This definition does not encompass the PBIC announcements. A PBIC public relations officer testified before the district court that prior to each PBIC meeting she simply contacted the World Journal\u2019s community events editor, and the newspaper then included, without charge, an announcement of the PBIC meeting in the paper\u2019s community events column. The officer testified that she \u201chad nothing to do with PBIG,\u201d that PBIC was not connected with PBIG, and that she \u201cnever did any advertisements for PBIG.\u201d As the district court concluded, the PBIC \u201cmeeting notices in the World Journal did not include specific references to investment opportunities offered by PBIG in any of the subject limited partnerships or their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>target portfolio companies.\u201d Therefore, the announcements were not \u201cpublished in connection with the offer or sale of a security,\u201d and were not advertisements under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">But even assuming that the PBIC announcements were advertisements in a more general sense, they did not mention any sale of securities, and there was no attempt to sell securities at PBIC meetings. To conclude that an advertisement for a PBIC meeting also \u201caccomplished\u201d the sale of securities at the later PBIG meeting is to read the California statute too broadly. Under this reading, the statute would apply if the defendants had invited potential investors at an \u201cadvertised\u201d garage sale, or in the lobby of virtually any movie theater. I therefore find no basis for the conclusion that the defendants accomplished the offer and sale of them securities \u201cby the publication of any advertisement\u201d under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Because the defendants have satisfied subsection 25102(f)(4), the remaining question is whether them investors were qualified under subsection 25102(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">B. Subsection 25102(f)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">A trial court has \u201cbroad authority\u201d to manage the trial, including the authority \u201cto impose reasonable time limits.\u201d <em>McSherry v. City of Long Beach, </em>423 F.3d 1015, 1023 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Navellier v. Sletten, </em>262 F.3d 923, 941 (9th Cir.2001). We review the exercise of that authority for abuse of discretion. <em>Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., </em>302 F.3d 1080, 1088 (9th Cm. 2002). I conclude that the district court abused its discretion not in imposing time limits per se, but rather in representing to counsel that the time limits were reasonable because the defendants would not need to prove the credentials of each individual investor, and then engaging in precisely such an individualized analysis in its findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The claims in this case involve ninety-two investors in five different investment entities. In a status conference in October 2001, defense counsel requested that the plaintiff provide a list of investors whose accreditation or qualifications were genuinely in dispute. In a pretrial conference on January 31, 2002, the trial court announced its \u201cinclination\u201d to allow each side eight hours to present witnesses and evidence. Counsel for the defendants expressed concern that eight hours would be insufficient to prove the credentials of all of the disputed investors, along with other matters they needed to prove in them defense. In response to these concerns, the court proposed a burden-shifting approach to resolving investor credentials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">[W]hat your client\u2019s state of mind is with respect to these accredited investors is the key thing. If they, in good faith, believed that they were accredited, that ends the inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">You can certainly put on, it seems to me, very simply your client\u2019s basis for believing that certain people or certain categories of people or what he relied on with respect to groups of people to come to the conclusion that they were accredited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-13\">It seems to me you\u2019ve met, at least prima facie, your burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-14\">Then it would switch back to ... plaintiff! ] to come back and say, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong as to X, Y, and Z,\u201d and maybe that would then put the burden back on you to present some more evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-15\">But ... if you offer some evidence that you had a good faith belief that these people were accredited, the plaintiff can\u2019t merely say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t believe it,\u201d and put the burden back on you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>They would have to offer some evidence that these people, in fact, were not accredited, which might put the burden back on you to come back and explain why they either were or why you had a good faith belief that they were.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac-\">Defense counsel represented to the court that \u201cwe have a lot of information about these people,\u201d but the court stated that the defendants would not need to establish credentials \u201cinvestor by investor,\u201d but instead could categorize them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-4\">[I]t would seem to me that ... the situation would be that with certain investors, you\u2019ve got this kind of statement from them, \u201cHere it is. They\u2019re each signed by them. That\u2019s what I relied on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">On these, they were investors in this prior business and I don\u2019t understand why you would be going through them one by one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Defense counsel responded that \u201cwhen the test is reasonable belief based on reasonable inquiry ..., one never knows what is enough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Prior to trial, the plaintiff stipulated to the qualifications of ten of the ninety-two investors. Based on the trial court\u2019s representations during the January 31, 2002 conference, the defendants rationally concentrated their efforts during the bench trial not on all eighty-two remaining investors, but on those investors out of the eighty-two whom the plaintiff had singled out in his case-in-chief. The plaintiff called four such investors to testify, and the defendants staged a defense with respect to those plaintiffs. The defendants also rationally made general statements about their reasonable, good faith belief as to the qualifications of all of the investors, as the court had suggested would be appropriate. Based on the court\u2019s statements at the pretrial conference, defendants believed that the court would not require individualized evidence of the credentials of the remaining seventy-eight investors. Therefore, at trial the defendants had no reason to \u201cargue how [they would be] damaged by the time limits, nor state what additional time was needed.\u201d <em>See Monotype Corp. PLC v. Int\u2019l Typeface Corp., </em>43 F.3d 443, 451 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the district court found that the four contested investors were qualified. However, the court found that eight <em>other </em>investors \u2014 investors whose credentials were not specifically discussed in plaintiffs case<em>in-chief </em>\u2014 were unqualified. The court engaged in a rigorous examination of the qualifications of these investors. For example, the court concluded that the defendants had made an insufficient showing of the sophistication of one investor because he \u201conly represented that he had a master\u2019s degree.\u201d This level of analysis demonstrates that the defendants had presented \u201csome evidence that [they] had a good faith belief\u2019 that the investor was qualified. There is no indication in the record that the plaintiff ever presented evidence to establish, \u201c \u2018You\u2019re wrong as to [that investor],\u2019 and ... then put the burden back on [the defendants] to present some more evidence.\u201d Instead, the court <em>itself </em>shifted the burden back to the defendants after the trial was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Because the defendants had extensive information about the investors, but declined to present all of that information in light of both the time limitations and the court\u2019s representations in the pretrial conference, I would conclude that the court\u2019s management of the trial \u201cadversely and unfairly affected [defendants\u2019] case.\u201d <em>See Hansen v. Comm\u2019r of I.R.S., </em>820 F.2d 1464,1467 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">I conclude that the district court abused its discretion in making representations to the defendants at the pretrial conference that it would employ a burden-shifting ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>proach to examining investor credentials, limiting trial time in accordance with such an approach, and then failing to employ that approach in its findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">I would therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand so that the defendants could have an opportunity to present a defense with respect to the credentials of the eight investors identified by the district court as unqualified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
