Dawson, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Under California law, an insurance company has a duty to defend an underlying suit when, comparing the allegations set forth in the underlying complaint and known facts extrinsic to the complaint with the policy\u2019s terms, \u201cthey reveal a possibility that a claim may be covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153, 1157 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court properly determined that the underlying complaint in this case gave rise to no potentially covered claims under the terms of National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh\u2019s (National) general commercial liability policy, National was neither under a duty to defend ABM Industries Inc. (ABM) nor to indemnify ABM for the cost of litigating and ultimately settling the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">1. A <em>de novo </em>review of the record, <em>see FDIC v. O\u2019Melveny &amp; Myers, </em>969 F.2d 744, 747 (9th Cir.1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, O\u2019Melveny &amp; Myers v. FDIC, </em>512 U.S. 79, 114 S.Ct. 2048, 129 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994), confirms that the underlying complaint did not state a claim potentially covered by the slander provision in the personal injury clause of National\u2019s policy. Under Texas law, a claim for slander must allege oral publication. The underlying complaint did not suggest oral publication to a third party, and the district court properly granted summary judgment in National\u2019s favor. <em>See Randall\u2019s Food Mkts. v. Johnson, </em>891 S.W.2d 640, 646 (Tex.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">2. Nor did the underlying complaint contain a viable claim for libel. Texas law requires as essential elements of such a claim a factual statement that harms an individual\u2019s or corporation\u2019s reputation. <em>Houseman v. Publicaciones Paso del Norte, S.A. DE C.V., </em>242 S.W.3d 518, 524 (Tex.App.2007) (quoting Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 73.001) (Vernon 2005); <em>Falk &amp; Mayfield L.L.P. v. Molzan, </em>974 S.W.2d 821, 824 (Tex.App.1998). Because the tenant estoppel certificate set forth ABM\u2019s legal opinion \u2014 not a statement of fact \u2014 and because the underlying complaint did not allege any harm to the esteem in which others held the underlying plaintiff, as opposed to how two potential lenders evaluated the risk in making the requested loan, the district court appropriately ruled in National\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">3. The district court also correctly concluded that National owed ABM no duty to defend arising out of the personal injury provisions for disparagement. Section four of the policy\u2019s personal injury clause plainly states that a claim for disparagement must implicate a good, service, or product. A legal position on the enforceability of a lease agreement, as expressed in the tenant estoppel certificate here, cannot fairly be construed to implicate a good, service, or product under the ordinary meanings of those terms. The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment in National\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">4. Finally, ABM\u2019s contention that a claim for tortious interference or business disparagement automatically falls within section four of the personal injury clause is unavailing. Under the plain language of the insurance policy, only tortious interference and disparagement claims that relate to goods, products, and services are covered. The district court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>entered summary judgment for National.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATs\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ed by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-20\">. Because we find there was no duty to defend under the policy, National\u2019s arguments that it owed ABM no duty because ABM failed to exhaust the limits of its primary insurance policy issued by Zurich American and that ABM made fraudulent misrepresentations are moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
