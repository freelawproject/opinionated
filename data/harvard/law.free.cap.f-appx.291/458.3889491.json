June 19, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Normally, we review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). In this case, however, as the Government urges, we dismiss the petition for review pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. Under this discretionary doctrine, \u201can appellate court may dismiss the appeal of a defendant who is a fugitive from justice during the pendency of his appeal.\u201d <em>Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 234, 239, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993). We recently reaffirmed the applicability of this doctrine in the immigration context, in which an alien is considered a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d when (1) the government issues him a \u201cbag-and-baggage\u201d letter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ordering him to report for deportation, and (2) the alien fails to comply. <em>Qian Gao v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 173, 176 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Ofosu v. McElroy, </em>98 F.3d 694, 700 (2d Cir.1996)). As we noted, considering petitions filed by aliens who disregard such letters \u201cwould have the perverse effect of encouraging aliens to evade lawful deportation orders in the hope that, while they remain fugitives, they may contrive through their own efforts a new basis for challenging deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178. Moreover, \u201cdisentitling a fugitive from appealing a judgment that he has fled sends a clear message to similarly situated litigants \u2014 flee the effect of a judgment and the privilege of challenging that judgment vanishes with you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">In this case, the BIA issued Rong a bag- and-baggage letter in June 1996, ordering him to report for deportation in August 1996. Rong did not comply with this notice, and instead proceeded to file four motions to reopen, including the one on review here. In response, the Government provided the BIA with a copy of the bag-and-baggage letter, and a copy of the return receipt indicating that Rong had received the letter. To date, Rong has neither denied receiving the letter nor explained his failure to comply. Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to invoke the fugitive disentitlement doctrine and dismiss Rong\u2019s petition for review. <em>See id. </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. Any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">. A bag-and-baggage letter is another term for a notice to surrender for deportation. <em>Qian Gao v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 173, 175 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
