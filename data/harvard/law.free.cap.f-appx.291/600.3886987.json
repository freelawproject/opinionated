Sheppard appeals her sentence. Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain the duty to calculate properly and consider the applicable sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), when fashioning a sentence. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). When we review a sentence, we typically consider whether the district court committed significant procedural error at sentencing and, if not, whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2022 \u2014 \u2022 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Further, the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is ultimately reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Sheppard argues that the district court erred by adjusting her offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2 based on its determination that Officer Kernell was an official victim of the offense. Our examination of the record reveals no significant procedural error and nothing unreasonable in Sheppard\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
