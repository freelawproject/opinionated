Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We dismiss Gomes\u2019s appeal because he waived his right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">We review de novo whether a defendant has waived his statutory right to appeal. <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.2000). Appeal waivers that are knowingly and voluntarily entered into are enforceable. <em>United States v. Michlin, </em>34 F.3d 896, 898 (9th Cir.1994). Gomes argues that his appeal waiver is invalid on other grounds, none of which persuade us.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">That the district court construed Gomes\u2019s motion to extend the deadline for appellate review as a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of his appeal waiver. The court\u2019s order merely extended the period of time in which Gomes could file a timely notice of appeal under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Gomes\u2019s argument that the government waived his appeal waiver by litigating his initial appeal on the merits is related to his contention with respect to the law of the case. The \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine applies where the issue in question was \u201cdecided either expressly or by necessary implication in [the] previous disposition.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Bible, </em>983 F.2d 152, 154 (9th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). The government had requested that Gomes\u2019s appeal of his original sentence be stayed in light of <em>Booker, </em>and we granted the motion on this basis. The validity of Gomes\u2019s appeal waiver was not argued by the government. Nor was the issue \u201cdecided either expressly or by necessary implication\u201d in our order vacating and remanding for re-sentencing. There is no \u201claw of the case\u201d rendering Gomes\u2019s appeal waiver invalid. The principles of collateral and equitable estoppel do not change our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b107-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
