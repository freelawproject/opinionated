(\u201cBRI\u201d), and BRI\u2019s sole owner, Joseph C. Lorenzo (together, \u201cthe defendants\u201d). The skycaps allege that the defendants violated certain minimum wage requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, they contend that the district court erred in rejecting them claims that: (1) BRI failed to give them adequate notice of its intention to use their tips towards its minimum wage obligations under the FLSA; (2) BRI required them to perform \u201cnon-tipped\u201d tasks beyond their ordinary job responsibilities without appropriate compensation; and (3) a fee they were required to collect from customers constituted impermissible tip-sharing within the meaning of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See, e.g., Natural Answers, Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., </em>529 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivJP. 56(c). On summary judgment, we \u201cview the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and oral argument, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order issued on December 17, 2007. <em>See Pellon v. Bus. Representation Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>528 F.Supp.2d 1306 (S.D.Fla.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
