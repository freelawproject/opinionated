Desroche, Louisiana prisoner # 487714, has moved for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. The district court denied Desroche IFP status on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith under \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-24\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Desroche is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Desroche argues that he lacks funds to pursue his appeal, but he fails to brief any argument regarding the district court\u2019s certification decision or, in particular, its dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Desroehe has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Accordingly, we deny his IFP motion and his motion for the appointment for counsel on appeal, and we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Desroche\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Desroehe is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
