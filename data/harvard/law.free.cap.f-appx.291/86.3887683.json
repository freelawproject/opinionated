We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The parties are familiar with the facts in this case, so we do not recount them except where necessary for this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">This court has jurisdiction over petitions for review that raise colorable constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Questions of law, including due process claims, are reviewed de novo. <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 585, 587 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Colmenar v. I.N.S., </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). This court also lacks jurisdiction to review certain orders of removal against criminal aliens. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). \u201cThe appropriate way of measuring whether the IJ and BIA had \u2018reason to believe\u2019 \u201d that a petitioner is involved in drug trafficking is to review \u201cwhether substantial evidence supports such a conclusion.\u201d <em>Alarcon-Serrano v. I.N.S., </em>220 F.3d 1116, 1119 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>I. The IJ properly found he had \u201creason to believe\u201d that Mendez was or had been involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C)(i) makes inadmissible \u201c[a]ny alien who the consular officer or the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe \u2014 (i) is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance ... or is or has been a knowing aider, abettor, assister, conspirator, or colluder with others in the illicit trafficking....\u201d Section 1182(a)(2)(C)(i) \u201cdoes not require a conviction in order for the alien to be deemed removable.\u201d <em>Lopez-Molina v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1206, 1209 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>see also Matter of Rico, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 181, 184 (B.I.A.1977) (\u201cA criminal conviction is unnecessary to establish a basis for exclusion under this provision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">A. <em>Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he had reason to believe that Mendez assisted in drug trafficking.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In this case, the government introduced several police reports showing that Mendez was arrested for selling cocaine on several occasions. Also, the government introduced the orders and transcripts from the proceedings where Mendez pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine salt for sale. The IJ also considered Mendez\u2019s California Law Enforcement Telecommunication System (\u201cCLETS\u201d) printouts showing Mendez received diversion after his 1990 arrest and the change in his plea from a violation of California Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11351 to a violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The IJ rejected Mendez\u2019s testimony denying any involvement with drugs as inconsistent with the documentary evidence and his own April 27, 1998, plea colloquy. Based on the various police reports, the judgment and sentence, and the various charging documents, the IJ concluded that he had \u201ca reason to believe\u201d that Mendez has been or is a drug trafficker.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Documentary reports such as police reports may be used as \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence for an immigration official to have \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that [an alien] knowingly participated in illicit drug trafficking.\u201d <em>Lopez-Molina, </em>368 F.3d at 1211. The BIA and the IJ are allowed to disbelieve an alien\u2019s testimony claiming lack of knowledge if their interpretation of the evidence is \u201cwithin reason on these facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Alarcon-Serrano, </em>220 F.3d at 1120. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s conclusion was properly supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">B. <em>Mendez\u2019s change of plea has no effect on the IJ\u2019s analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The fact that Mendez changed his guilty plea offense from a violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351 to a violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 32 does not have any effect on the IJ\u2019s legal findings. \u201c[I]n California one who is an accessory to a felony thereby commits a crime which is separate and distinct from the felony itself.\u201d <em>People v. Mitten, </em>37 Cal.App.3d 879, 112 Cal.Rptr. 713, 715 (1974). California codified this principle in Penal Code \u00a7 32, which defines an accessory after the fact as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">Every person who, after a felony has been committed, harbors, conceals or aids a principal in such felony, with the intent that said principal may avoid or escape from arrest, trial, conviction or punishment, having knowledge that said principal has committed such felony or has been charged with such felony or convicted thereof, is an accessory to such felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">The elements of a violation of Penal Code \u00a7 32 are: that a felony was committed, that the defendant \u201charbored, concealed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>aided a principal in that felony with the specific intent that the principal avoid or escape arrest, trial, conviction or punishment\u201d; and that \u201cdefendant did so with knowledge that the principal committed the felony.\u201d <em>People v. Magee, </em>107 Cal. App.4th 188, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 836 (2003) (quoting CALJIC No. 6.40); CALCRIM 440 (2006). That he pled guilty to being an accessory under Penal Code \u00a7 32 shows that the IJ had reason to believe Mendez was involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">II. As a result, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Mendez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">If the IJ\u2019s finding that he or she has \u201creason to believe\u201d that the petitioner is a drug trafficker is supported by substantial evidence, then Mendez is \u201can alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in [8 U.S.C.] section 1182(a)(2),\u201d and this court lacks jui\u2019isdiction to review the removal order under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>Lopez-Molina, </em>368 F.3d at 1211; <em>see also Alarcon-Serrano, </em>220 F.3d at 1119-20 (dismissing petition as unreviewable once substantial evidence supported the finding that petitioner was involved in drug trafficking). Although this court has jurisdiction to determine whether the BIA or the IJ properly entered the findings that deprive it of jurisdiction, it loses jurisdiction over the petition once it determines that Mendez is \u201can alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>see Lopez-Molina, </em>368 F.3d at 1209. Having determined that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that there is reason to believe that Mendez is or has been a drug trafficker, we lack jurisdiction to consider Mendez\u2019s petition, and the petition should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he had reason to believe that Mendez was or had been a drug trafficker. As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review Mendez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b111-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
