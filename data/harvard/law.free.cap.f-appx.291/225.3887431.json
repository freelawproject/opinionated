Upon the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court dismissed the petition because Garcon had not been brought to trial as of the date of filing and he was represented by counsel in his up-coming criminal case. Garcon now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). We note that since the filing of the instant petition, Garcon has been convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and was scheduled for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the petition. The claims Garcon sought to raise are properly brought during his criminal case and subsequent direct appeal, should he choose to file one. Therefore, the instant petition was premature and was due to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-13\">. The district court construed the habeas petition as brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 despite the fact that Garcon was a <em>federal </em>detainee at the time. Because Garcon was a federal pre-trial detainee, the petition should have been construed as brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(1); <em>Hughes v. Att\u2019y Gen. Of Fla., </em>377 F.3d 1258, 1261-1261 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
