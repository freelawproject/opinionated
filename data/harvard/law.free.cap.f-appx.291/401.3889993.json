R. \u00a7 0.14(b) (interim rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Defendant-appellant Ricardo Andrades appeals from the June 15, 2007 judgment of conviction of the District Court. Following a guilty plea, defendant was convicted of illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Defendant was sentenced principally to a term of 70 months\u2019 incarceration. On appeal, defendant challenges his sentence as both procedurally and substantively unreasonable on the grounds that (1) the District Court adopted a criminal history calculation that overstated the seriousness of his previous offenses; (2) the sentence imposed was \u201ctoo high\u201d when compared to \u201ccriminal conduct much worse than [defendant\u2019s] act of returning to the United States\u201d; and (3) the sentence violates the so-called parsimony clause of \u00a7 3553(a) in light of the existence of \u201cfast-track\u201d programs in other jurisdictions that were not available to him. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">We review sentencing decisions for reasonableness, asking \u201cwhether the sentencing judge exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion, committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">We conclude that the sentence imposed was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. The District Court considered the defendant\u2019s criminal history calculation under the Sentencing Guidelines and concluded that it \u201caccurately reflects the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d The Court also explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the seriousness of the offense and the need to avoid sentencing disparities. We find no error in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
