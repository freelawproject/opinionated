Rodriguez argues that he established that he had a well-founded fear of persecution from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) based on his membership in a particular social group and his political opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, Rodriguez maintains that he was entitled to CAT relief because there was \u201cquasi-governmental acquiescence or unwillingness to control\u201d the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">\u201cWe review only the [BIAJ\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In this case, we review only the BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>decision because the BIA wrote a separate opinion affirming, but not adopting, the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027. Therefore, the fact that evidence in the record may support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. Rather, reversal is only appropriate where the record \u201ccompels\u201d it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In this case, the factual record does not compel us to reverse the BIA\u2019s decision. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the FARC\u2019s actions towards Rodriguez were only its attempt to extort money to fund its anti-government activities and were not on account of a protected ground. In essence, the FARC detained Rodriguez twice and, each time, demanded that he make a financial contribution to them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Rodriguez did not raise any claim before the BIA relating to the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for CAT relief. Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction over the denial of his application for CAT relief because Rodriguez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to that claim. Accordingly, we will not address his claim that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-10\">. Although Rodriguez's wife and two children are also named as petitioners, their claims for asylum are based on derivative status. Accordingly, the petitioners will be collectively referred to as \"Rodriguez.\u201d Furthermore, unlike the asylum statute, the withholding of removal statute does not provide for derivative claims. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158 and 1231; <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-11\">. Rodriguez seeks to support his appeal with copies of documents not submitted to either the IJ or the BIA. Under Fed. R.App. P. 16(a), \"[t]he record on review or enforcement of an agency order consists of: (1) the order involved; (2) any findings or report on which it is based; and (3) the pleadings, evidence, and other parts of the proceedings before the agency.\u201d As such, we have held that we \"cannot find, or consider, facts not raised in the administrative forum.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004). Therefore, because the new documents Rodriguez submits on appeal were not presented to either the IJ or BIA, we will not consider them. <em>See id.; </em>Fed. R.App. P. 16(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">. We have held that persecution arising from a petitioner\u2019s refusal to cooperate with guerrillas and provide them with financial support does not establish the required nexus between the persecution and the petitioner\u2019s political opinion. <em>Sanchez v.
