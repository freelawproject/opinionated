Carlton Brown was president of SSU. Arthur L. Moncrief was SSU\u2019s vice-president for business and finance, and Stokes\u2019 direct supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Stokes filed a complaint claiming that he was wrongfully terminated from his employment in violation of the First Amendment and in violation of the Georgia Whistleblower Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-1-4. He claims that, when he objected to SSU\u2019s decision to place the police department building under a campus master key system, fearing that this would compromise the security of the department\u2019s computers, confidential files, criminal evidence, and weapons, he was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The district court, after a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge that Stokes\u2019 claims were unfounded, and that summary judgment be granted in favor of SSU, <em>et al. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">As to the First Amendment claim, considering the master key system, Stokes was not speaking as a private citizen about a matter of public concern. He was speaking out under the auspices of his official duties. \u201c[W]hen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d <em>See Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1960, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). This argument is therefore meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">As to the Georgia Whistleblower statute, Stokes\u2019 claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-l-4(e)(l) (this statute requires that suits be brought \u201cwithin one year after discovering the retaliation or within three years after the retaliation, whichever is earlier\u201d). Stokes received a letter of termination from supervisor Moncrief on April 7, 2005, stating that \u201cI am terminating your employment ... effective 5:00 p.m. on April 14, 2005.\u201d SSU President Brown determined that \u201cdismissal was an appropriate and just action\u201d and issued a final termination notice on August 10, 2005. Stokes filed suit November 14, 2006, some fifteen months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">In the interim, Stokes appealed the termination decision to the board of regents. It affirmed the decision on November 16, 2005. Stokes argues that the one-year period begins to run from this date, not April or August 2005, but November 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">SSU contends that Stokes \u201cdiscovered the retaliation\u201d on April 7, 2005, when Stokes received Moncrief s letter of termination, but at the very least, no later than August 10, 2005, when SSU President Brown affirmed Moncrief s decision to terminate Stokes. We agree. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-l-4(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Upon careful review of the record, the briefs and the arguments of counsel on appeal, finding no error, we affirm the decision of the district court, adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, and granting summary judgment in favor of SSU, <em>et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
