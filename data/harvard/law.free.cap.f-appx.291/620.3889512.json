The district court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The extensive factual background to this trademark dispute is recounted in our recent decision in <em>Robin Singh Educ. Servs. Inc. v. Excel Test Prep Inc., </em>274 Fed.Appx. 399, 400-04 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished), which addresses the underlying merits of this case. In that decision, we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiff-appellee Robin Singh\u2019s Lanham Act claims on collateral estoppel grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 403-05. Before we issued that opinion, the prevailing defendant moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees as an \u201cexceptional case\u201d under the Lanham Act at the district court. The district court denied the award. The defendant now timely appeals that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The Lanham Act permits a court to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to a prevailing party \u201cin exceptional cases.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1117(a). \u201cThe determination as to whether a case is exceptional is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Seven-Up Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>86 F.3d 1379, 1390 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cWe review a decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1117 for abuse of discretion and the district court\u2019s finding as to whether the case is exceptional for clear error.\u201d <em>Scott Fetzer Co. v. House of Vacuums Inc., </em>381 F.3d 477, 490 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cTo recover attorneys\u2019 fees, \u2018[t]he prevailing party must demonstrate the exceptional nature of the case by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., </em>280 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2002)). \u201cTo demonstrate that a case is exceptional, in turn, the defendant must show that the plaintiff brought the case in bad faith.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>280 F.3d at 527-28 &amp; n. 12; <em>Fuji Photo Film Co., Inc. v. Shinohara Shoji Kabushiki Kaisha, </em>754 F.2d 591, 601-02 (5th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>II. District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Denying Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">A district court can examine the claim\u2019s \u201cobjective merits\u201d as a factor in determining whether the plaintiff filed in \u201cbad faith.\u201d <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>280 F.3d at 527. However, \u201ca party has not acted in bad faith simply by predicating its legal claim on a controversial and unsettled legal theory.\u201d <em>Scott Fetzer, </em>381 F.3d at 490. As we have stated in a similar case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">The district court did not clearly err or abuse its discretion!;] [plaintiffs] infringement claims do not withstand careful scrutiny, but they are not so implausible as to necessitate an inference of bad faith. Likewise, [plaintiffs] dilution claims are novel and expansive but not so outlandish that they could not have been brought in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 490-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The defendant argues that several factors support a finding of \u201cbad faith\u201d in this case. First, the defendant asserts that because Robin Singh should have known its claims would be barred by collateral estoppel, its claims are baseless. The defendant also quotes the trial court\u2019s various adverse comments concerning Robin Singh\u2019s litigation as evidence of vexatiousness and bad faith. Finally, the defendant highlights the fact that Robin Singh originally filed its complaint in the Northern District of California as evidence of forum shopping and alleges Robin Singh intentionally re-started discovery after certifying to the trial that discovery was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">None of these arguments shows \u201cbad faith\u201d under a clear and convincing standard. While Robin Singh\u2019s arguments in this case attempted to distinguish this case from previous cases and ultimately failed, they were not \u201cso implausible as to necessitate an inference of bad faith.\u201d <em>Scott Fetzer, </em>381 F.3d at 490-91. Also, the trial court in its sound discretion did not view Robin Singh\u2019s case as an \u201cexceptional case\u201d despite previous adverse comments about its claims. Finally, the defendant\u2019s last two assertions of \u201cbad faith,\u201d i.e., forum shopping and dishonesty in discovery, are just allegations; whether these allegations are true is not clear. In sum, the defendant has not produced clear and convincing evidence of \u201cbad faith\u201d necessary to show the district court clearly erred in denying an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">. <em>See Test Masters Educ.

KHK Scaffolding Houston, Inc., </em>278 F.3d 523, 536 (5th Cir.2002) for the proposition that prevailing defendants need not show plaintiff's claims were pursued in \"bad faith\u201d to win attorney's fees under the Lanham Act. In <em>Waco Int'l, </em>we quoted an Eighth Circuit case, <em>Scott Fetzer Co. v. Williamson, </em>101 F.3d 549, 555 (8th Cir. 1996), for the proposition that \"[c]ourts have defined 'exceptional cases\u2019 to be those in which 'a plaintiff's case is groundless, unreasonable, vexatious, <em>or </em>pursued in bad faith.' \" 278 F.3d at 536 (emphasis added). In tension with this language, an earlier Fifth Circuit case hinged the \"exceptional case\u201d inquiry solely on whether the plaintiff filed the suit in \"bad faith.\u201d <em>See Fuji Photo, </em>754 F.2d at 601-02; <em>see also Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>280 F.3d at 527-28 &amp; n. 12 (noting that the Fifth Circuit and Eighth Circuit tests for determining \"exceptional cases\u201d are different, because in the Fifth Circuit, the prevailing defendant must prove \"bad faith.\u201d) (\"Only the Second Circuit has endorsed <em>Fuji Photo's </em>holding that to recover fees under \u00a7 1117(a), the defendant must prove the plaintiff brought the action in bad faith.\u201d). The earliest precedent, <em>Fuji Photo, </em>therefore controls this case. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>302 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.2002). The prevailing defendant must show the plaintiff brought the action in bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
