The district court enhanced Pacheco\u2019s sentence by eight levels because it determined that his second state-law conviction for possession of a controlled substance qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-26\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Pacheco contends that, in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), his second state-law conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony. Pursuant to <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 334-36 (5th Cir.2008), <em>Lopez </em>has not altered our holding in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572 (5th Cir.2005), that a second state conviction for simple possession qualifies as an aggravated felony sufficient to support the imposition of the eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
