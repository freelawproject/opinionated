Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Defendant Hiram Rivera-Velasquez appeals his conviction for illegally reentering the United States after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He challenges the validity of a plea agreement in which he waived the right to appeal his prior deportation. He contends that the prior deportation should not serve as a predicate for the illegal reentry charge, because the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) violated his right to due process by failing to inform him of the possibility of voluntary departure. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">In the 1997 plea agreement, Rivera-Velasquez unambiguously waived \u201cany and all rights to appeal, reopen, or challenge in any way the prior deportation hearing\u201d in exchange for a downward departure recommendation. This language plainly states that he waived his right to appeal the prior deportation, and it need not specifically contemplate the possibility of future prosecutions. <em>See United States v. Jeronimo, </em>398 F.3d 1149, 1154 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that the plea agreement \u201cplainly states that [defendant] waived his right to appeal his sentence on <em>any and all </em>grounds in exchange for a sentence of less than twenty years\u201d) (emphasis in original). Moreover, the plea agreement included a separate waiver that specifically addressed the 1997 conviction. Interpreting the appeals waiver as limited to the 1997 conviction, therefore, would deprive that separate waiver of any meaning. <em>See Bayview Hunters Point Cmty. Advocates v. Metro. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>366 F.3d 692, 700 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that terms should be construed to avoid rendering any other terms meaningless or superfluous).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">Further, the IJ\u2019s failure to advise Rivera-Velasquez of the possibility of voluntary departure did not deny him due process because Rivera-Velasquez\u2019s criminal history precluded any reasonable possibility that he was eligible for voluntary departure. <em>See Galeana-Mendoza v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 1054, 1057 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1183 (9th Cir.2001). In the two years prior to his deportation, he was convicted of four crimes, including a felony for assault with a deadly weapon likely to produce great bodily injury. The IJ was aware that Rivera-Velasquez had been incarcerated for 16 months on these charges. Thus, the IJ was not required to advise him of the possibility of voluntary departure. <em>See Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">As a result, the appeals waiver is valid, and Rivera-Velasquez may not challenge the prior deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b114-15\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
