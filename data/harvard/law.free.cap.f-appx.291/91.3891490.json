Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history we do not include them here, except as necessary to explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. <em>Nilsson v. City of Mesa, </em>508 F.3d 947, 951 (9th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>Disparate Treatment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">A prima facie showing of discrimination under Title VII required Hayes to show that \u201c(1) [she] belongs to a protected class, (2) [she] was qualified for the position, (3) [she] was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (4) similarly situated [ ] individuals [not in her protected class] were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., </em>292 F.3d 654, 658 (9th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">Even if we assume that Hayes made a prima facie showing of discrimination, the County articulated a legitimate nondiseriminatory reason for its action. <em>See Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.1998). As the deposition testimony of Betty Burke (\u201cBurke\u201d) indicated, Hayes\u2019s draft recommendation was based on the faulty assumption that Hayes\u2019s unit would become a separate division, thereby opening up the possibility that Hayes could become a division manager. Burke testified further that when Michael Alastuey explained that Hayes\u2019s unit would not become a division any time in the near future, thereby eliminating the possibility of Hayes becoming a division manager, she adjusted her recommendation accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">Hayes has not \u201ccome forward with [any] evidence that tends to show that the [County\u2019s] proffered motives were not the actual motives.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1222 (\u201c[EJvidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of pretense must be specific and substantial in order to create a triable issue ....\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">There is no genuine dispute of material fact with regard to Hayes\u2019s disparate treatment claim, and the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\n<em>Retaliation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Hayes also argues that the County violated Title VII by retaliating against her after she filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l) specifies that a charge of retaliation <em>shall </em>be filed within 180 or 300 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, depending on the circumstances. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 109-10, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002). Because Hayes last charge of retaliation and discrimination was filed with the EEOC on April 14, 2000, only those allegations of retaliation which allegedly occurred within 300 days prior to April 14, 2000 are actionable. <em>See id. </em>at 113, 122 S.Ct. 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">If Hayes\u2019s allegations of retaliation meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1), then, in order to make a prima facie showing of retaliation under Title VII, she must show: \u201c(1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between her activity and the employment decision.\u201d <em>Stegall v. Citadel Broad. Co., </em>350 F.3d 1061, 1065-1066 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Hayes\u2019s allegations of \u201cnumerous write-ups and a suspension\u201d are time-barred because she did not receive a written reprimand until 2001 and did not receive her first suspension until September 17, 2002. Hayes\u2019s allegation that Stephanie Denton\u2019s (\u201cDenton\u201d) firing was an act of retaliation against Hayes is also time-barred as Den-ton was not fired until July 12, 2001. Similarly, Hayes\u2019s attempt to bolster her retaliation case by including a declaration by colleague Janet Clark (\u201cClark\u201d) is unavailing. Clark was not hired until December 2001 and could not, therefore, have witnessed any alleged acts of retaliation within 300 days prior to April 14, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Hayes provided no evidence in support of her allegation that her supervisor, Sandra Norskog (\u201cNorskog\u201d) \u201cactively recruited Hayes\u2019s subordinates and encouraged them to work against her, and those that wouldn\u2019t she fired.\u201d The County produced evidence opposing this allegation in the form of Norskog\u2019s deposition testimony that she did not retaliate against Hayes. In response, Hayes produced nothing to support her allegation. Accordingly, no genuine issue of material fact exists as to this allegation. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">Finally, Hayes alleges that the County retaliated against her when they transferred her case from the County\u2019s affirmative action officer, George Cotton, to the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Hayes provided no evidence or explanation to demonstrate how transferring her case to the District Attorney\u2019s Office constituted an adverse employment action against her. <em>See Ray v. Henderson, </em>217 F.3d 1234, 1243 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">Even if Hayes had shown that the transfer of her case to the District Attorney\u2019s Office was an adverse employment action, the County provided a \u201clegitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision\u201d: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>avoidance of any apparent or actual conflict of interest between Cotton\u2019s own discrimination case and Hayes\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 1240. Hayes has not, \u201ceither \u2018directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence,\u2019 \u201d raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the County\u2019s explanation was pretextual. <em>Stegall, </em>350 F.3d at 1068 (quoting <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">There is no genuine dispute of material fact with regard to Hayes\u2019s claim for retaliation. Summary judgment in favor of the County on this claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b116-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-13\">. We agree with the district court that the evidence considered by that court in ruling on the County's motion for summary judgment was admissible because it was either authenticated by the County in accordance with <em>On v. Bank of Am., </em>285 F.3d 764, 774 (9th Cir. 2002), or authenticated by Hayes's own reliance on the evidence in her moving papers. <em>See id. </em>at 776.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-14\">. We disagree with the district court's conclusion that because \"[Hayes] failed to show that similarly situated individuals not in her protected class received non-competitive promotions,\u201d she failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination. We conclude that the relevant inquiries under the facts of Hayes\u2019s case are: whether Hayes was subjected to adverse employment action (as opposed to the district court's narrow question of whether she received a non-competitive promotion) and whether similarly situated individuals not in her protected class were treated more favorably. This difference does not, however, change the outcome of Hayes's case. <em>See Charley\u2019s Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Hawaii, Inc., </em>810 F.2d 869, 874 (9th Cir. 1987) (\"We may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record, even if the ground is not relied on by the district court.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-19\">. In her reply brief to this appeal, Hayes argues that the fact that the description underlying the relevant Schedule recommendation did not change, even though the numerical Schedule recommendation itself changed, demonstrates that the County's proffered jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tification is pretextual. Considering the language of the pertinent recommendation, we find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
