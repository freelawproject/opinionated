Nov. 29, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-22\">As an initial matter, the Government properly argues that our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s denial of Ceni\u2019s second motion to reopen. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 89-90. Accordingly, we do not consider Ceni\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s underlying adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Ceni\u2019s case <em>sua sponte, </em>because such a decision is \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) provides that an individual may file only one motion to reopen, and must do so within ninety days of the issuance of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). These limitations, however, do not apply when the motion to reopen is filed in order to apply for asylum or withholding of removal \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hear-' ing.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Here, it is undisputed that Ceni\u2019s motion was untimely and number-barred, as it was his second motion to reopen, and it was filed approximately one and a half years after the BIA issued its decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ceni\u2019s motion to reopen, because Ceni failed to meet an exception to the applicable filing requirements. While Ceni asserts that the BIA failed to consider evidence of changed country conditions in the record, he does not specify what evidence he is referring to or how the evidence he submitted shows a change in circumstances as required by the regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Indeed, as it found, the BIA had already considered the majority of the evidence that Ceni had submitted. Because the failure to offer material evidence of changed circumstances provides a proper basis for the BIA to deny a motion to reopen, <em>see INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988), we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied Ceni\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-17\">. In any event, this Court has previously considered the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ's adverse credibility determination and found that it was supported by substantial evidence. Thus, that adverse credibility determination remains the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d 1217, 1225 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
