Abrams, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jin Ru Jiang, </em>No. A99 073 425 (B.I.A. Dec. 7, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A99 073 425 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 23, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision insofar as it found that Jiang\u2019s asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). However, we may review Jiang\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of her application for withholding of removal. Because Jiang waives any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of her application for relief under CAT, we decline to review the agency\u2019s decision insofar as it denied that relief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Because the BIA assumed Jiang\u2019s credibility without rejecting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we assume, without determining, her credibility. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We conclude that the record supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jiang failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. In light of Jiang\u2019s failure to proffer any evidence demonstrating that Chinese national mothers with one child are forcibly inserted with IUDs or sterilized, the agency reasonably found her fear of persecution too speculative to be well-founded. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). Because the agency did not err in finding that Jiang failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, it reasonably denied her application for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
