Weisel, which denied her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ling Huang, </em>No. A98 893 477 (B.I.A. Nov. 28, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 893 477 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 16, 2006). We assume the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). Where the BIA adopts and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"A70\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We will, however, vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See, e.g., Cao He Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121,129 (2d Cir.2004). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on, <em>inter alia, </em>an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether such inconsistencies go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 164 (2d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse-credibility determination here is supported by substantial evidence. The agency based its credibility determination, in part,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the following inconsistencies: (1) while Huang stated that she was never baptized, her father stated in a letter that she was; (2) while Huang submitted a written statement that she \u201cformally joined [a] local folk Christian church,\u201d she testified that she did not join a \u201cformal church\u201d; and (3) while Huang initially testified that she had never seen the pastor of her church in the U.S., she later testified that she had introduced herself to the pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Huang now tries to explain these inconsistencies by arguing that (1) her father mistakenly stated that Huang was baptized because he lacked a sufficient understanding of Christian practice<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; (2) Huang\u2019s use of the term \u201cfolk Christian church\u201d implied that she attended a gathering of local Christians rather than a formal church; and (3) when Huang tried to introduce herself to her pastor, he did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>We note that certain of Huang\u2019s explanations, notably, the last, lack record support. Even without such concerns, none of these explanations compelled the agency to find Huang\u2019s testimony credible. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 167-68 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that where evidence permits two plausible interpretations, we defer to the agency\u2019s choice as between the two).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Because the noted inconsistencies, each reasonably supported by the record, provided substantial evidence for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Liang Chen v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir.2006), we need not reach petitioner\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s corroboration findings. We note simply that the REAL ID Act only expands the IJ\u2019s discretion to identify and demand reasonably available corroborative evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4) (narrowing appellate review of factfinder\u2019s determination with respect to availability of corroborating evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Huang\u2019s life or freedom or a risk of torture depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\">. In so doing, the BIA apparently identified additional record discrepancies not noted by the IJ. Because petitioner does not challenge this aspect of the BIA's decision, we assume, without deciding, that such identification was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">. To the extent Huang argues that <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90-94 (2d Cir.2006), precluded the IJ from relying on her father\u2019s lack of doctrinal knowledge, her failure to present this argument to the BIA would generally result in our declining review. <em>See Lin Zhong v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 122 (2d Cir.2007). In any event, Huang's argument is unconvincing because the IJ did not reject the father\u2019s testimony; he simply noted its inconsistency with Huang's own.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
