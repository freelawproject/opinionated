Abrams denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xia Cai, </em>No. A 97 811 591 (B.I.A. Dec. 20, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A 97 811 591 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 24, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Cai does not challenge before this Court the IJ\u2019s findings that: (1) her testimony that she only practiced the first through fourth Falun Gong exercises was inconsistent with the photograph she submitted of herself doing the fifth exercise; (2) it was implausible that her father would place her (but not her brother or sister) in harm\u2019s way by having her illegally distribute Falun Gong fliers; and (3) her testimony that she practiced Falun Gong in a park was inconsistent with her friend\u2019s testimony that he only saw her practice it at her home. Therefore, we deem any challenge to those findings waived, and they stand as valid bases for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 7, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">With respect to the findings Cai does challenge, the IJ found that Cai\u2019s demean- or indicated that she had memorized her testimony, noting that Cai appeared \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201chad a look of disbelief\u2019 in response to several questions. Because an IJ\u2019s findings regarding a petitioner\u2019s demeanor are accorded \u201cparticular deference,\u201d and because the IJ gave examples to support his finding, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109-10 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The IJ also reasonably found implausible Cai\u2019s testimony that her parents entered her into a marriage contract at sixteen promising that she would marry the village head\u2019s son although she could not legally marry until she was twenty-one. <em>Cf. Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 n. 16 (2d Cir.2006). Cai argues that the contract provided only that she would later marry the village head\u2019s son. However, when taken in the context of the other findings supporting the adverse credibility determination, the IJ did not err in finding this testimony implausible. <em>See Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.2008) (finding that this Court should review \u201cthe entire record, not whether each unusual or implausible feature of the account can be explained or rationalized\u201d). Additionally, the IJ properly found that in light of Cai\u2019s deficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>corroboration, she was unable to rehabilitate her testimony. <em>Cf. Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">To the extent that Cai challenges the IJ\u2019s remaining credibility findings, we need not consider his arguments. Even if those findings were in error, remand would be futile as it can be confidently predicted that the agency would reach the same conclusion on remand. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 338-39. Accordingly, we conclude that the IJ properly denied Cai\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal where the only evidence that she would be persecuted depended on her credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Because Cai has failed meaningfully to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief before this Court, we deem any such challenge waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. Our conclusion is not altered because the BIA found that one of the IJ\u2019s demeanor related findings was erroneous; <em>i.e., </em>his finding regarding \"meridians.\" It is sufficient that the IJ, after observing Cai's demeanor during her testimony, concluded that her demeanor reflected a lack of credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
