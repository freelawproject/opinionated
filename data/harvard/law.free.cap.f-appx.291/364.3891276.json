Goldberg, of the U.S. Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Defendant-Appellant Gustavo Rueda-Zarate appeals the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sentencing him to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, after he pled guilty to involvement in a conspiracy to distribute heroin. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of the case, its procedural history, and the scope of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">I. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Defendant argues that the 57-month sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as binding or at least presumptively reasonable and did not adequately consider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We review the sentence for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 25-26 (2d Cir. 2006), a standard \u201cakin to review for abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Defendant challenges only the procedural reasonableness of the sentence, we do not review here the actual length of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-19\">It is clear from the record that the court was \u201caware of both the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable.\u201d <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005). There is a strong presumption that judges have considered factors under section 3553(a) and related arguments absent \u201crecord evidence suggesting otherwise.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 29-30. From the face of the record, it is apparent that the court considered, at the very least, the factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and a defendant\u2019s individual characteristics), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) (the need for deterrence). That is sufficient. <em>See Fleming, </em>397 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>at 100 (\u201c[N]o specific verbal formulations should be prescribed to demonstrate the adequate discharge of the duty to \u2018consider\u2019 matters relevant to sentencing.\u201d); <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30 (holding that a district court need not address every factor nor every argument raised by a defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Although the court gave deference to the Sentencing Guidelines, it did not treat those Guidelines as binding or even presumptively reasonable but simply treated them as a \u201cstarting point and the initial benchmark,\u201d giving due consideration to the fact that the Guidelines are \u201cthe product of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594, 596; <em>see also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). A Guidelines sentence will in the ordinary case \u201creflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s objectives.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 574. It is apparent from the court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that it was willing and able to consider deviating from the Guidelines, but because nothing was especially unusual about this case, the court gave deference to the careful study that went into the Guidelines and ended where it began, with the \u201cstarting point\u201d that is the Guidelines. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Finally, we note in passing that contrary to Defendant\u2019s claim, the <em>Kimbrough </em>case is not applicable here. Although the court gave deference to the Guidelines, it did not suggest any disagreement with those Guidelines on general policy grounds, nor did Defendant argue that it should.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">II. Suppression</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Defendant initially challenged the court\u2019s decision not to suppress a variety of evidence, but he withdrew the claim immediately prior to argument. We therefore do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">We have reviewed all of Defendant-Appellant\u2019s arguments and have found each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
