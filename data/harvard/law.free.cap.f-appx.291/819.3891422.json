We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and review de novo the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See, e.g., Ryan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>528 F.3d 1194, 1198 (9th Cir.2008). \u201cThe Social Security Administration\u2019s disability determination should be upheld unless it is based on legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">Morse claims that the ALJ erred in not considering her depression. We disagree. The record does not demonstrate that Morse has a medically determinable mental impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1508; <em>Ukolov v. Barnhart, </em>420 F.3d 1002, 1005 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-18\">The ALJ did not erroneously disregard evidence from Morse\u2019s examining physicians. To the contrary, the ALJ provided \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence,\u201d <em>Ryan, </em>528 F.3d at 1198 (internal quotation marks omitted) \u2014 namely, that the opinions were at odds with the doctors\u2019 own medical findings and observations, as well as other record evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(4); <em>see, e.g., Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 603 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-19\">Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Morse\u2019s credibility was supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the disbelief.\u201d <em>Greger v. Barnhart, </em>464 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1040 (9th Cir.2007). Although the ALJ did not discuss the husband\u2019s testimony about his wife\u2019s limitations explicitly, he did reject the gravamen of his testimony \u2014 that Morse suffered from \u201csevere pain\u201d and \u201climitations in standing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>walking, sitting, [and] lifting\u201d \u2014 because it was inconsistent with the medical evidence. Contrary medical findings are a valid reason for lay testimony to be disregarded. <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 511-12 (9th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Finally, we reject Morse\u2019s argument that the ALJ erroneously found that she could fulfill the demands of her past relevant work. The ALJ appropriately employed the Dictionary of Occupational Titles in arriving at his conclusion, which was supported by substantial evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(b)(2); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see, e.g., Ryan, </em>528 F.3d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b844-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
