Robert Oberholtzer raised several challenges to his conviction and sentence. We previously ruled on all but one of these challenges. <em>See United States v. Oberholtzer, </em>221 Fed.Appx. 542 (9th Cir.2007). We deferred ruling on Oberholtzer\u2019s sentencing challenge pending resolution of <em>Claiborne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2245, 167 L.Ed.2d 1080 (2007) (mem.), and <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). For the reasons set forth below, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">This court will only set aside a sentence when it is procedurally erroneous or substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). Oberholtzer argues that the district court erroneously treated the Guidelines as mandatory instead of advisory. <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 993. We disagree. At the re-sentencing hearing, the district court initially stated: \u201cAm I going to follow [the Guidelines], or are there circumstance that are so extraordinary as to require the mitigation of the offense?\u201d Had this been all the court said, we would be forced to remand. <em>See Gall v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, defense counsel pointed out that the district court did not need to find \u201csomething extraordinary to sentence outside the guideline range,\u201d and the court agreed. The court responded: \u201cI think you may well be right. I still have to find that the circumstances are sufficiently mitigating to cause me to change the sentence.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]o the extent the sentencing judge\u2019s initial characterization was inopportune, we cannot say that it was procedural error because the court corrected itself.\u201d <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 994. Here, \u201cthe judge treated the Guidelines range as a baseline, and moved from there to tailor a sentence to the individualized offense and offender characteristics of [the defendant\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
