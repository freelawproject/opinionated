The district court denied Wiggins\u2019s motion because he was originally sentenced according to the statutory mandatory minimum, and not according to \u00a7 2D1.1 calculations. Based on our review of the record and analysis of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and Amendment 706, we discern no reversible error and therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b306-24\">In May 2003, Wiggins was indicted for possession with intent to distribute at least five grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count One); possession of ammunition by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (Count Two); and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count Three). Wiggins entered into a written a written plea agreement in which he pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>guilty to Counts One and Three, and Count Two was dismissed. Rl-22, 25. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the calculated sentence guideline range for Count One was 51 to 63 months. However, because Wiggins\u2019s offense involved five grams or more of crack cocaine, he was subject to a 60 month mandatory minimum, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(1)(B)(iii). Based on this statute, the district court sentenced Wiggins to 60 months of imprisonment for Count One. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); Rl25 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In March 2008, Wiggins filed a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, seeking a modification of his original sentence. Rl-29. He requested that the court apply a \u201cnewly calculated sentencing range,\u201d in accordance with Amendment 706, which lowered the offense levels in crack cocaine cases by two levels. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The district court denied the motion because Wiggins was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum for his offense, and thus even if Amendment 706 reduced the guideline range, this would not change his sentence. Rl-30 at 2. Wiggins filed a motion for reconsideration, in which he contended that the district court has authority to reduce his sentence to a term less than the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. Rl-31. The district court denied this motion for the same reasons that it denied Wiggins\u2019s original \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Rl-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">On appeal, Wiggins maintains that the district court has the authority to reduce his sentence, and reasserts his eligibility for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). An error of law can constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Amendment 706 allows a prisoner to seek a reduced sentence for crack cocaine offenses as long as their sentence was determined using the guideline range calculations in \u00a7 2D1.1. However, a prisoner is not eligible for a reduction if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the his applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, n. 1(A). Thus in cases \u201c[wjhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence <em>shall </em>be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (emphasis added). According to the plain language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), the district court shall use the mandatory minimum as a sentencing floor in cases falling under statutes such as 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Wiggins\u2019s assertion that the district court should have the ability to depart from a mandatory minimum sentence is without merit given the applicable statutes and law. The district court sentenced Wiggins to 60 months of imprisonment because the level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1 yielded a sentence range that was shorter than the statutorily required mandatory minimum. The district court does not have the power to ignore U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) and reduce a prisoner\u2019s sentence to a term below the mandatory minimum. Wiggins contends that the mandatory minimum actually becomes the guideline sentence and is, therefore, subject to analysis under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, just because the mandatory minimum sentence is sometimes treated as the sentencing guideline, this does not mean that the two should be treated as legally analogous. The <em>Booker </em>decision made the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>guidelines advisory and subject to evaluation according to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but the decision did not reach any issues involving statutorily required mandatory minimums. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 259, 261, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. The mandatory minimum is not advisory, and the district court in this case was not authorized to sentence Wiggins to a prison term shorter than 60 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Based on the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), the district court cannot sentence Wiggins to any less than the statutorily required 60 month mandatory minimum sentence. Because Wiggins\u2019s sentence was based on something other than an offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, he was precluded from receiving a \u00a7 3582 reduction in his sentence based on Amendment 706. The district court did not err in its interpretation and application of the law, and therefore we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
