(\u201cGould/Nikko\u201d), brought an action against NavCom Defense Electronics Inc. (\u201cNDE\u201d), for breach of contract and contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). This matter concerns the allocation of remediation costs for groundwater contamination in aquifers underlying a portion of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund site. The district court entered a judgment on behalf of the plaintiff, Gould/Nikko. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the procedural and factual history of this case, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">I. <em>Contract Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">NDE\u2019s predecessor-in-interest purchased 100% of the stock of Gould/Nikko\u2019s subsidiary, GNSDI, subject to the rights and liabilities set forth in the Assumption Agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When NDE\u2019s predecessor then merged with GNSDI to form NDE, NDE assumed GNSDI\u2019s obligation to indemnify Gould/Nikko under the Assumption Agreement. <em>See Krull v. Celotex Corp., </em>611 F.Supp. 146, 148 (N.D.Ill.1985). Nothing in the independent Purchase Agreement between NDE and Gould/Nikko rendered the Assumption Agreement\u2019s indemnification provision unenforceable against NDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Gould/Nikko\u2019s aggressive conduct during negotiations with the Task Force did not completely discharge the indemnity obligation. An act of an indemnitee which materially prejudices the rights of the indemnitor will discharge the indemnity obligation to the extent of the prejudice. <em>See Am. Cas. Co. v. Idaho First Nat\u2019l Bank., </em>328 F.2d 138, 142-43, 145 (9th Cir.1964); <em>see also Gen. Ins. Co. of Am. v. Fleeger, </em>389 F.2d 159, 161 n. 3 (5th Cir.1968) (noting that prejudicial conduct \u201cwill discharge the indemnitor to the extent that he has been damaged as a result of that act\u201d); Restatement (First) of Security \u00a7 132 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">Accordingly, the district court was not compelled to conclude, as a matter of law, that Gould/Nikko\u2019s prejudicial conduct discharged NDE\u2019s indemnity obligation in its entirety. The district court factored Gould/Nikko\u2019s improper behavior into its \u201cequitable factors\u201d analysis under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\u00ae and reduced the amount of recovery available to Gould/Nikko as a result. <em>See Cadillac Fairview/California, Inc. v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>299 F.3d 1019,1028 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that \u201ca district court may, under CERCLA, consider parties\u2019 contracts and indemnification agreements as factors affecting the equitable allocation of response costs\u201d). This approach comported with the principle that NDE\u2019s indemnity obligation should be relieved to the extent that it suffered any prejudice. The district court did not clearly err by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>finding that Gould/Nikko\u2019s prejudicial conduct reduced the percentage of clean-up costs that the plaintiff could seek from NDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">II. <em>CERCLA Contribution Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The district court acted within its authority in developing its own allocation scheme within the terms of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1) (\u201cIn resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.\u201d). This court reviews for abuse of discretion the equitable factors that a district court considers in creating a contribution allocation scheme, and for clear error the district court\u2019s allocation according to those factors. <em>Boeing Co. v. Cascade Corp., </em>207 F.3d 1177, 1187 (9th Cir.2000). We must see if there is \u201csufficient evidence from which a reasonable and rational approximation of each defendant\u2019s individual contribution to the contamination can be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1188 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The district court acknowledged bias in the expert testimony proffered by both parties. Rather than embrace the findings of either side, the district court initially allocated responsibility based on the amount of contaminants extracted from the properties for which each party was responsible. Although this may not be a completely accurate method for determining what conduct on each plot actually contributed to the contamination of the aquifers, it does give a relevant quantitative basis for estimating the proportionate responsibility of each party. <em>See Boeing Co., </em>207 F.3d at 1180, 1188 (upholding a district court\u2019s allocation based on the \u201cquantity of toxic chemicals each company put into the ground,\u201d even though the effect of each instance of dumping may have been different). Given the difficult nature of gathering information that would give a more accurate estimation of each party\u2019s exact contribution, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in initially allocating sixty-six percent of response costs to the NavCom Property. <em>See id. </em>at 1187-88. This was \u201camong the reasonable conclusions supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1188. The district court also acted within its discretion in reducing the level of contribution from sixty-six percent to sixty percent based on the contractual relationship between the parties and Gould/Nikko\u2019s aggressive conduct during negotiations with the Task Force. <em>See Cadillac Fairview, </em>299 F.3d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Finally, the district court properly refused to treat the Johnson Controls settlement as an offset to NDE\u2019s liability. CERCLA allows for offsets to contribution from settlements that are \u201cadministrative or judicially approved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(f)(2). Gould/Nikko and Johnson Controls\u2019 private settlement does not qualify as an offset within the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\">. The Assumption Agreement was silent as to choice of law. Under the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188, California law, not Delaware law, governs the agreement because it is the state most closely connected to the contract. The \u201cinternal affairs\u201d doctrine cited by NDE does not apply to contracts, like the Assumption Agreement, governing the transfer of real property between distinct corporate entities. <em>See McDermott, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>531 A.2d 206, 214-15 (Del. 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
