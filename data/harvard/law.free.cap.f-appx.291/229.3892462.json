After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In 2003, Mailplanet.com had a business plan to purchase Internet domain names that were common surnames and allow customers to use such domain names for personal email addresses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For example, Mailplanet.com registered the domain name garcia.com and offered customers an email address at that domain name, such as michael@garcia.com. Using census statistics, Mailplanet.com identified common surnames and targeted the domain names matching such surnames for purchase. One such domain name was lomonaco.com.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In December 2003, Mailplanet.com entered into a contract with Internet registrar Monikor Online Services to register lomonaco.com. In the contract, Mailplanet.com agreed to abide by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\u201cUDRP\u201d), a procedure for resolving challenges to the registration of a particular domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark held by a complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In 2004, Mailplanet.com changed its business plan and stopped offering new email accounts. For domain names, such as lomonaco.com, that had never been utilized for email accounts, Mailplanet.com employed a \u201cparking service\u201d to earn revenue from advertisers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">In August 2005, Lo Monaco Hogar, a mattress company in Spain, filed a complaint under the UDRP as to Mailplanet.com\u2019s registration of lomonaco.com. The World Intellectual Property Organization (\u201cWIPO\u201d) reviewed the complaint. In December 2005, a WIPO panel concluded lomonaco.com was confusingly similar to Lo Monaco Hogar\u2019s Spanish trademarks utilizing the words \u201cLo Monaco\u201d and ordered Monikor Online Services to transfer the registration of lomonaco.com from Mail-planet.com to Lo Monaco Hogar.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Before any transfer was made, Mailplanet.com filed a complaint in district court against Lo Monaco Hogar seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(v) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1114 is a provision of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq., </em>that was amended by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\u201cACPA\u201d). \u2022 Section 1114(2)(D)(v) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">A domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended, disabled, or transferred under a policy described under clause (ii)(II) may, upon notice to the mark owner, file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>registrant is not unlawful under this chapter. The court may grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant, including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(v). Lo Monaco Hogar does not dispute that the WIPO panel decision constitutes a \u201cpolicy\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(v) and that the decision ordered a transfer of lomonaco.com from Mailplanet.com to Lo Monaco Hogar.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Mailplanet.com\u2019s complaint requested that the district court grant it this relief: (1) \u201c[a] DECLARATION that MAIL-PLANET\u2019S registration of the domain name is lawful, and does not violate any enforceable right of LO MONACO HO-GAR in the United States of America\u201d; and (2) \u201c[a]n injunction under 15 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 1114(2)(D)(V) including reactivation of the domain name and maintenance of registration to Plaintiff, to prevent transfer to the Defendant.\u201d Mailplanet.com also sought costs, fees, and other relief the court deemed proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">After Lo Monaco Hogar answered, Mail-planet.com moved for summary judgment. Lo Monaco Hogar responded to the summary judgment motion and moved to dismiss Mailplanet.com\u2019s complaint as moot. Lo Monaco Hogar explained it had decided to curtail its online business activities and to forego its claim to lomonaco.com. Lo Monaco Hogar had informed Mailplanet.com and Moniker Online Services of its decision. Because Lo Monaco Hogar had conceded the only thing at issue (the ownership of lomonaco.com), Lo Monaco Ho-gar argued there was no case or controversy for the district court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Mailplanet.com responded that Lo Monaco Hogar\u2019s concession of Mailplanet.com\u2019s ownership of lomonaco.com did not render the case moot because there were other issues remaining, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the legality of Mailplanet.eom\u2019s past and present use of lomonaco.com.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mailplanet.com argued a declaration of its rights was necessary to preempt future litigation by (1) Lo Monaco Hogar for trademark infringement or for bad faith acquisition and use of lomonaco.com, and (2) other parties who may rely on the WIPO panel\u2019s adverse findings to Mailplanet.com\u2019s detriment. Mailplanet.com suggested Lo Monaco Ho-gar\u2019s challenge to Mailplanet.eom\u2019s ownership of lomonaco.com was reasonably likely to recur in the future because Lo Monaco Hogar never admitted that it has no rights to the \u201cLo Monaco\u201d mark in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">The district court granted Lo Monaco Hogar\u2019s motion to dismiss because Mail-planet.com failed to show there was still a substantial controversy to which the court could grant meaningful relief after Lo Monaco Hogar consented to Mail-planet.com\u2019s ownership of lomonaco.com. The district court noted that Moniker Online Services had not yet transferred lomonaco.com to Lo Monaco Hogar and a declaration as to the lawfulness of Mailplanet.eom\u2019s use of lomonaco.com would constitute an inappropriate advisory opinion. The district court stated the voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply here because Lo Monaco Hogar had not been charged with any illegal or offensive conduct. Further, even if Lo Monaco Ho-gar did bring suit against Mailplanet.com in the future regarding lomonaco.com, it likely would be precluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>there was no live case or controversy, the district court dismissed Mailplanet.com\u2019s complaint as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The district court also denied Mailplanet.com\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Mail-planet.com filed a timely appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">A case is moot when it no longer presents a \u201clive\u201d issue or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome, because, at that point, a court can no longer give meaningful relief. <em>Troiano v. Supervisor of Elections in Palm Beach County, </em>382 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir. 2004). The mootness doctrine derives directly from Article Ill\u2019s limitation on federal court jurisdiction to the consideration of \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies\u201d because a moot action cannot be characterized as an active case or controversy. <em>Id. </em>at 1281-82. If an event occurring after the filing of a suit deprives the court of the ability to give the parties meaningful relief, then the case is moot and must be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The district court properly dismissed Mailplanet.com\u2019s complaint as moot. This litigation arises from Lo Monaco Hogar\u2019s challenge to Mailplanet.com\u2019s registration of lomonaco.com and its desire to have lomonaeo.com transferred to it. After Lo Monaco Hogar was successful in the WIPO proceedings, Mailplanet.com filed a complaint in federal court seeking (1) a declaration that its registration of lomonaco.com was lawful and did not violate Lo Monaco Hogar\u2019s rights in the United States, and (2) an injunction preventing transfer of lomonaco.com to Lo Monaco Hogar. Lo Monaco Hogar\u2019s decision to concede Mailplanet.com\u2019s ownership of lomonaco.com and to forgo its request for a transfer of lomonaco.com from Mailplanet.com effectively provides Mailplanet.com the relief it sought in its complaint and resolves the dispute between the parties that gave rise to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Mailplanet.com relies on <em>Sallen v. Corinthians Licenciumentos LTDA, </em>273 F.3d 14 (1st Cir.2001), but our conclusion is consistent with that decision. The First Circuit concluded that a live controversy existed because (1) both parties were still claiming exclusive rights to the same domain name, (2) the domain name had been transferred to the complainant, and (3) the complainant was using the domain name. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Here, in contrast, Lo Monaco Hogar has relinquished its claim to the ownership of lomonaco.com. Furthermore, lomonaco.com has not been transferred to Lo Monaco Hogar and is not being used by Lo Monaco Hogar.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">We also reject Mailplanet.com\u2019s claim that there is still a live controversy between the parties as to whether its \u201cuse\u201d of lomonaco.com was lawful. Mailplanet.com is correct that \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(v) allows it to file an action \u201cto establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this chapter.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(v). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>However, Mailplanetcom\u2019s complaint sought only a declaration that its \u201cregistration\u201d of lomonaco.com was lawful. Although Mailplanet.com\u2019s complaint stated in the facts section that \u201cMAILPLANET reasonably believes its registration and use of the domain name lomonaco.com was and is lawful under the Lanham Act,\u201d its prayer for relief does not seek a declaration regarding its \u201cuse\u201d of lomonaco.com. Moreover, Lo Monaco Hogar does not claim any right to the domain name lomonaco.com, and thus there are no adverse parties or disputed claims as to that domain name. Consequently, there is no live controversy between the parties as to Mailplanetcom\u2019s use of lomonaco.com.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Finally, Mailplanet.com\u2019s concerns \u2014 that Lo Monaco Hogar may change its mind and bring another suit in the future regarding lomonaco.com \u2014 do not alter our conclusion. It is true that in deciding mootness issues we often look to whether there is a reasonable expectation that the voluntarily ceased activity will actually recur after the case terminates. <em>See Troiano, </em>382 F.3d at 1282-83. Here, the relevant behavior by Lo Monaco Hogar was its challenge to Mailplanetcom\u2019s registration of lomonaco.com and request to have registration of lomonaco.com transferred to it. Lo Monaco Hogar has ceased this behavior pursuant to a change in its business plan, has raised no counterclaim against Mail-planet.com in this suit, and has given no indication that it will bring suit against Mailplanet.com in the future regarding lomonaco.com.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To the extent the voluntary cessation doctrine is applicable to this action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, we conclude Mailplanet.com failed to show there is a reasonable expectation that Lo Monaco Hogar will resume its challenge to Mailplanet.com\u2019s ownership of lomonaco.com and seek to bring legal action against it in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Based on the above reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Mail-planet.com\u2019s complaint as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\">. A domain name is an alphanumeric designation that allows an Internet user to access a particular website. <em>See Sallen v. Corinthians Licenciamentos LTDA, </em>273 F.3d 14, 19 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.2001). A domain name consists of the top level domain (such as .com, .net, or .org), which is preceded by the second level domain (a combination of letters, numbers, or some symbols). <em>Id. </em>at 19. For example, in the domain name uscourts.gov, \".gov\u201d is the top level domain name and \"uscourls\u201d is the second level domain name. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\"><em>. </em>A \"parking service\u201d displays a list of words relating to products or services offered by advertisers on the domain name\u2019s Internet website.

The owner of the website is in turn paid a small fee for this referral.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b254-16\">.

The district court also determined Mailplan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>et.com was not eligible for damages or attorney's fees for two reasons. First, Mailplanet.com did not allege that lomonaco.com had been suspended based on a \"knowing and material misrepresentation\u201d so as to recover damages and fees under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(iv). Second, Mailplanet.com had not asserted a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 so as to recover damages and fees under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117. Mailplanet.com does not challenge these determinations by the district court on appeal. In any event, we point out that Mailplanet.com never prays for any damages in its complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-13\">.

We reject Mailplanet.com\u2019s argument on appeal that it should have been allowed leave to amend its complaint to include a prayer for relief regarding its use of lomonaco.com. <em>See, e.g., Wagner v.
