The district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>view pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">First, sovereign immunity bars Mun\u2019s Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) retaliation claim. When the original complaint was filed, Alaska Stat. \u00a7 09.50.250 (2003) authorized a \u201cperson or corporation having a contract, quasi-contract, or tort claim against the state [to] bring an action against the state.\u201d Devoid of any reference to federal court, this statute does not make a \u201cclear declaration\u201d that the state intended to submit itself to federal jurisdiction. <em>Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 </em>U.S. 666, 675, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, even if the statute in effect at the time this action was commenced could be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity, the statute has since been amended. Alaska Stat. \u00a7 09.50.250 (2005) now provides that actions against the state may be brought only \u201cin a state court.\u201d And a state may withdraw its consent even as to pending actions. <em>See Coll. Sav. Bank, </em>527 U.S. at 676, 119 S.Ct. 2219 (stating that a state may \u201calter the conditions of its waiver and apply those changes to a pending suit\u201d); <em>see also Beers v. Arkansas, </em>61 U.S. 527, 529, 20 How. 527, 15 L.Ed. 991 (1857) (noting that a state \u201cmay withdraw its consent whenever it may suppose that justice to the public requires it\u201d). Thus, sovereign immunity applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Second, Mun\u2019s claim that he suffered racial discrimination because he was not appointed Director of Summer Sessions was time-barred. The twenty-two months that elapsed between the incident and the complaints exceeded the statute of limitations. <em>See Raad v. Fairbanks North Star Borough Sch. Dist., </em>323 F.3d 1185, 1192 n. 5 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cA plaintiff must file a charge within 180 days after the unlawful employment practice occurred if filing directly with the EEOC, or within 300 days if filing with a state agency possessing the authority to process and remedy such claims under state law.\u201d). \u201c[Discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Third, Mun failed to establish a prima facie case that he suffered racial discrimination through denial of overtime pay as a Facilities Scheduling Coordinator. Although the record contains multiple exhibits regarding overtime in the Curriculum Advising and Program Planning Coordinator position, Mun did not produce any evidence regarding overtime in the Facilities Scheduling Coordinator position.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Fourth, Mun did not produce adequate evidence to survive summary judgment on his hostile work environment claims. Two isolated statements are insufficient to survive summary judgment under <em>Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>349 F.3d 634, 643-44 (9th Cir.2004). Those two statements and the facially neutral incidents were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to violate Title VII. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Fifth, Mun\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim fails because he did not produce evidence that he participated in a protected activity prior to alleged retaliation on October 22, 2002. Thus, there cannot be the required casual nexus between any protected activity and the retaliatory conduct. The only formal grievance filed on or before that date does not contain a single reference to race, religion, or Title VII protections. The text of Mun\u2019s affidavit regarding conversations with Rick Weems and Charita Franklin does not specify that the alleged \u201cdiscrimination\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>was anything other than the complaint of overtime pay disparities between campuses discussed in the written grievance. These activities are not protected under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Sixth, we find the issue of sanctions moot because the imposed sanctions only affected the availability of evidence at trial and this case never went to trial. Although Mun\u2019s counsel filed a notice of non-opposition shortly after the sanctions order, Mun\u2019s counsel included the excluded evidence in his evaluation of the case and he attributed his move to \u201cthe court\u2019s last ruling on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment,\u201d rather than the sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Finally, we affirm the district court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of the defendants. Mun\u2019s counsel did not move to dismiss the case without Mun\u2019s authority; he filed a notice of non-opposition to opposing counsel\u2019s motion. The district court was entitled to consider counsel\u2019s statements when deciding the unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>See Link v. Wabash R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (\u201c[E]ach party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \u2018notice of all facts.... \u2019 \u201d). Additionally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing Mun\u2019s personal request for a status conference because he continued to be represented by counsel at the time he made his pro se request.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
