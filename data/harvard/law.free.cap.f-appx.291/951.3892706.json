(\u201cHon Realty\u201d) appeals from the grant of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the denial of its cross-motion for summary judgment in the instant declaratory judgment action arising out of a title insurance policy appellant purchased from defendant-appellee First American Title Insurance Co. (\u201cFirst American\u201d). At issue on appeal is whether the term \u201cpublic records\u201d used in an applicable exclusion term of the insurance contract includes public records that were not filed with the \u201cOfficial Records\u201d of Florida, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 695.11,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the state\u2019s recording statute for encumbrances and liens against real property. For the following reasons, we conclude that the contractual term \u201cpublic records\u201d includes only those records filed under the state\u2019s recording statute to obtain constructive notice of a particular encumbrance or lien pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 695.11. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">The facts are straightforward and undisputed. Hon Realty purchased a property, against which the City of Miami had an encumbrance because of the prior landowner\u2019s violations of several city ordinances. First American warranted title on the property as of the closing of the property, the effective date of the title insurance contract. The enforcement order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>the encumbrance was issued prior to the purchase of the property \u2014 and, importantly, prior to the effective date of the title insurance \u2014 but the order was not recorded under Florida\u2019s recording statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 695.11, with the Miami-Dade County clerk of court until two weeks after Hon Realty closed on the property and after the effective date of the insurance policy. The district court determined\u2014 and the parties do not dispute on appeal\u2014 that the title insurance policy would warrant the title against (thus insuring against) said encumbrance, but only if the enforcement order with respect to the encumbrance \u201cha[d] been recorded in the public records at Date of Policy.\u201d Because the enforcement order was available in the City\u2019s public records but was not recorded in Miami-Dade\u2019s statutory \u201cOfficial Records\u201d until after Hon Realty recorded the warranty deed on the property, we must decide whether the insurance contract\u2019s provision that would cover encumbrances \u201crecorded in the public records\u201d by the date of the policy would include the City\u2019s public records or only the \u201cOfficial Records\u201d described in the state\u2019s recording statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Burton v. Tampa Hous. Auth., </em>271 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; <em>Celotex v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The parties agree that this case presents only a question of law requiring the Court to interpret the parties\u2019 title insurance contract under Florida law. <em>Flintkote Co. v. Dravo Corp., </em>678 F.2d 942, 945 (11th Cir.1982) (recognizing that courts sitting in diversity apply the substantive law of the forum); <em>see State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Metro. Dade County, </em>639 So.2d 63, 65 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.1994) (stating that contract construction is a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Florida law construes insurance policy exclusions narrowly, and any ambiguity in the contract should be resolved in favor of coverage and construed against the drafter. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>639 So.2d at 65. However, \u201cwhere the language of a policy is clear and unambiguous on its face, the policy must be given full effect.\u201d <em>Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. Farrey\u2019s Wholesale Hardware Co., Inc., </em>507 So.2d 642, 645 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">We conclude that the policy is clear and unambiguous on its face and resolves the issue presented. The policy itself defines \u201cpublic records\u201d as follows: \u201crecords established under state statutes at Date of Policy <em>for the purpose of imparting constructive notice of matters related to real property to purchasers for value and 'without </em>knowledge.\u201d District Court Order at 4 (emphasis added). It is clear that the \u201cpublic records\u201d definition contemplated only the inclusion of those records filed under a state recording statute and not those general public records that may be available from, for example, a public records request with the state or a local municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Notably, the enforcement order of the encumbrance at issue here specifically contemplated that the City\u2019s order be recorded with the county in order to be recorded as a lien against the property, which evinces the fact that the purported record of the enforcement order itself was not effective as an encumbrance to subsequent purchasers for value without knowledge prior to recording under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 695.11. <em>See also </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>\u00a7 162.09(3) (West 2000) (providing same). If the order itself was not effective against Hon Realty until its recording under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 695.11, the order cannot be reasonably considered a \u201cpublic record\u201d within the meaning of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Appellant argues that the record of the enforcement order was itself created under the City\u2019s authority granted by state statute permitting it to enforce local ordinances and is therefore a record \u201cestablished under [a] state statute[ ]\u201d that provides notice with respect to real property. Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. The statute granting the City the authority to enforce its ordinances through encumbrances has nothing to do with a record filed under a statute <em>\u201cfor the purpose of </em>imparting constructive notice of matters related to real property....\u201d The purpose of Chapter 162 of the Florida Statutes, relied upon by Appellant, is to provide a mechanism for enforcing local ordinances and not a mechanism for imparting constructive notice of matters related to real property. Moreover, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 162.09(3) expressly contemplates that a \u201ccertified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records\u201d in order to effect a lien under the state\u2019s recording statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the judgment of the district court is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-12\">.
