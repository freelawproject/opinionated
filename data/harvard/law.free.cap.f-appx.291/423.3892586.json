May 17, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 720 464 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See, e.g., Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to fact. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Here, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. In support of that determination, the IJ noted that while Weng testified that the authorities went to his home in March 2002 and then forced his wife to have an IUD inserted, his wife\u2019s letter stated that the IUD insertion occurred in May 2002 and she never mentioned that the authorities went to their home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, both the IJ and the BIA noted that although Weng testified that his son was born in January 2002, his asylum application stated that his son was born in February 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Weng argues that such inconsistencies were too minor to support an adverse credibility determination. However, taken together, the agency reasonably relied on these discrepancies where they called into question whether or not Weng\u2019s wife ever experienced any form of mistreatment, particularly in the form of a forced abortion or IUD insertion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">The IJ also based his adverse credibility determination on his observation of Weng\u2019s demeanor during his testimony, specifically noting instances where Weng was hesitant and unresponsive to the specific questions that were asked. We accord particular deference to such findings. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">In light of the agency\u2019s reasonable inconsistency and demeanor findings, its adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Because Weng was found not credible, he failed to show the necessary subjective basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution, <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir.2004), and the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was proper. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). In addition, because Weng\u2019s application for withholding of removal and CAT relief was based on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, the adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes success on those claims. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006) (withholding); <em>Xue Hong </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Yang v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005) (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">. When asked to clarify this discrepancy, Weng simply urged the IJ to credit his testimony over his wife's letter. The IJ was not required to do so. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
