Davis claims that the defendant is liable to his son under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violating his son\u2019s right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. He claims that the defendant did not expel two similarly situated students and, therefore, violated his son\u2019s right under the equal protection clause to be free from intentional discrimination at the hands of government officials. <em>See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (per curiam); <em>Campbell v. Rainbow City, </em>434 F.3d 1306, 1313-14 (11th Cir.2006). The district court granted summary judgment to the defendant board of education. We review this grant <em>de novo. Arrington v. Helms, </em>438 F.3d 1336, 1341 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-24\">In order for another student to be similarly situated to Joshua Davis, plaintiff must show that the students are \u201cprima facie identical in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>434 F.3d at 1314. Two individuals are \u201csimilarly situated\u201d if the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct is \u201cnearly identical\u201d to the individual raising the discrimination claim. <em>Maniccia v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Plaintiff has offered two students whom he claims are similarly situated to Joshua Davis, but who were not expelled. The first student, however, was involved in \u201chorseplay\u201d by the sole victim\u2019s own testimony, who urged that he be \u201ctalked to\u201d but not disciplined. The second proposed comparator was a sixth grade student who did not strike anyone. We conclude that neither of these proposed comparators is similarly situated to Joshua Davis under the law of this circuit. <em>See Maniccia, </em>171 F.3d at 1368 (comparators who did not do what the plaintiff did are not similar); <em>Hammock ex rel. Hammock v. Keys, </em>93 F.Supp.2d 1222, 1232 (S.D.Ala.2000) (equal protection does not require that elementary and high school students be treated identically in school discipline cases). Accordingly, plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of intentional discrimination against his son under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the judgment of the district court is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
