Wang appeals from the district court\u2019s order upholding the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) denial of disability insurance benefits. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">The ALJ\u2019s opinion recites that \u201c[t]he claimant\u2019s treating physicians did not report any limitations\u201d on Wang\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC). A.R. 27. But, as the opinion acknowledges, Wang\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Sobol, opined: that Wang is (1) limited to sedentary work and (2) precluded from prolonged sitting. A non-examining physician, Dr. Brown, whose opinion the ALJ relied upon, proffered contradictory views. First, Dr. Brown testified that Wang could lift up to ten pounds on a frequent basis and lift up to twenty pounds on an occasional basis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a) (\u201cSedentary work involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time.... \u201d). Second, Dr. Brown testified that Wang could sit \u201cup to six hours.\u201d A.R. 27, 426. As the Commissioner\u2019s brief acknowledges, \u201c[t]he district court agreed with Claimant that the ALJ erred in his treatment of Dr. Sobol\u2019s opinion. The district court found that the ALJ erred by stating that the Claimant\u2019s treating physicians \u2018did not report any limitations\u2019 when Dr. Sobol had limited Claimant from \u2018prolonged sitting.\u2019 \u201d Comm\u2019r Br. at 9 (citations omitted). However, the District Court concluded that the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless, and the Commission\u00e9r agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">The District Court\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ erred, which is echoed by the Commissioner, is clearly correct. \u201cThe ALJ may not reject the opinion of a treating physician, even if it is contradicted by the opinions of other doctors, without providing specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 856 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>marks omitted). The ALJ failed to provide such reasons in rejecting Dr. Sobol\u2019s opinions as to Wang\u2019s RFC limitations in favor of those of a non-examining physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Given that the ALJ erred, the question to be addressed is whether the District Court and the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the error was harmless can be sustained. According to the Commissioner, \u201cthe district court correctly held [that] the error was harmless since the ALJ presented Dr. Sobol\u2019s sitting and positional limitations to the [vocational expert], who testified that someone so limited could perform Claimant\u2019s past relevant accounting jobs, which were sedentary in nature.\u201d Comm\u2019r Br. at 13. However, we may not accord any weight to the vocational expert\u2019s testimony. \u201cIf a vocational expert\u2019s hypothetical does not reflect all the claimant\u2019s limitations, then the expert\u2019s testimony has no evidentiary value to support a finding that the claimant can perform jobs in the national economy.\u201d <em>Matthews v. Shalala, </em>10 F.3d 678, 681 (9th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 422 (9th Cir.1988). The ALJ posed hypothetieals to the vocational expert that involved a worker incapable of prolonged sitting, which was one of the two limitations identified by Dr. Sobol. However, the worker described in these hypothetieals is one that \u201ccan lift up to 20 pounds occasionally, 10 pounds frequently assuming this is being performed with the use of wrist splints,\u201d A.R. 435, while Dr. Sobol opined that Wang was capable of performing only sedentary labor. \u201cHypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert must set out <em>all </em>the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant, including, for example, pain and an inability to lift certain weights.\u201d <em>Embrey, </em>849 F.2d at 423 (emphasis in original). We therefore cannot speculate as to whether the vocational expert\u2019s testimony would have been different if the hypothetieals posed to her included the confluence of limitations that, in Dr. Sobol\u2019s view, Wang possesses. Accordingly, we cannot rely on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony to conclude that the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>we held that \u201c[w]here the Commissioner fails to provide adequate reasons for rejecting the opinion of a treating or examining physician, we credit that opinion as a matter of law.\u201d 81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we credit Dr. Sobol\u2019s submissions as true, including his opinion that Wang is \u201cnot ... physically capable of performing his preinjury work duties as an accountant.\u201d A.R. 253. However, even though we credit Dr. Sobol\u2019s opinion, it is still not \u201cclear from the record that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled.\u201d <em>Benecke v. Barnhart, </em>379 F.3d 587, 593 (9th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2000) (stating circumstances when court should remand for an immediate award of benefits)). Specifically, Dr. Sobol\u2019s opinions appear to leave open the question whether Wang is capable of performing \u201cany other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). It is thus necessary for the ALJ to further develop the record on this point, giving consideration to Dr. Sobol\u2019s submissions. We therefore remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED, with instructions to remand to the Commissioner of Social Security for these further determinations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b852-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
