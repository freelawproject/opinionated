In October 2013, Pyskaty purchased a \u201ccertified pre-owned\u201d BMW from WWC, which she financed in part through a loan from BMW Bank. When the vehicle allegedly proved to be incurably defective, Pyskaty brought this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, asserting claims for (1) breach of express and implied warranties under the MMWA; and (2) deceptive acts and practices, breach of express and implied warranties, and fraud under New York State law. In connection with her MMWA claims, Pyskaty principally sought actual damages or, in the alternative, cancellation and rescission of the purchase agreement. In connection with her state-law claims, Pyskaty sought, <em>inter alia, </em>actual damages, capped treble damages, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">WWC moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that Pyskaty did not satisfy the MMWA\u2019s $50,000 minimum-amount-in-controversy requirement. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(3)(B). The district court (Judith C. McCarthy, <em>Magistrate </em>Judge) granted the motion, agreeing with WWC that the value of Pyskat/s MMWA claims did not amount' to $50,000 and that Pyskaty could neither amend her complaint to add a claim for punitive damages under the MMWA, nor rely on the value of her state-law claims, to meet the jurisdictional threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Because we conclude that the value of Pyskaty\u2019s MMWA claims, as pled, exceeds $50,000, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">On October 31, 2013, Pyskaty visited WWC, an automobile dealership located in Spring Valley, New York, seeking to purchase a \u201ccertified pre-owned\u201d (\u201cCPO\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> BMW for her personal use. Amended Complaint (\u201cCompl.\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. She inquired about the history of a 2010 BMW 750LXI (the \u2018Vehicle\u201d) tagged \u201cCPO,\u201d and asked specifically whether it had ever been in an accident. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. According to Pyskaty, the WWC salesman responded that the Vehicle had no accident history, was \u201cperfect,\u201d and had a \u201cclean\u201d CARFAX report. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 22.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The salesman then showed Pyskaty a purportedly clean CAR-FAX report dated October 31, 2013, and affirmed that the Vehicle had passed the mandatory inspection for CPO BMWs. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Allegedly relying on these representations, Pyskaty agreed to purchase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Vehicle for $51,195.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 27. Pyskaty financed the purchase by putting down a $2,000 deposit, trading in her 2010 BMW M5, and obtaining a loan from BMW Bank for the balance of the purchase price.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Within a week after the purchase, Pys-katy allegedly began experiencing problems while driving the Vehicle. Specifically, she alleged that the Vehicle \u201cran rough,\u201d \u201cvibrated while driving,\u201d and \u201cconsumed large amounts of oil.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 32-34. The Vehicle later presented additional, more worrisome issues, including intermittent loss of power steering, lack of power on acceleration, malfunctioning door -locks, and engine sluggishness while in reverse. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42, 50, 59, 81, 83. Between November 2013 and May 2014, Pyskaty visited multiple service centers and paid for several repairs in an attempt to fix the Vehicle. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 40, 42-45, 48, 51, 53-54, 57, 59-62.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The problems persisted, however, and in June 2014, Pyskaty returned to WWC seeking to \u201crevoke [her] acceptance of the [Vjehiele and arrange for [a] return, rescission, and refund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73-74. WWC indicated that it would accept the Vehicle only as a trade-in on another automobile that Pyskaty would have to purchase, and that it would value the Vehicle at $35,000 for that purpose. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 75-76. Pyskaty declined this offer because, she asserts, it would have left her with a substantial balance owed to BMW Bank pursuant to the retail installment contract by which she purchased her defective car. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Shortly thereafter, Pyskaty began to suspect that the Vehicle had been damaged in an accident before she purchased it, contrary to the CARFAX report that she was shown in October 2013. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 78. On June 12, 2014, Pyskaty obtained an AutoCheck report,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which confirmed that the Vehicle had in fact sustained a rear-impact collision on August 24, 2012. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79-80. Allegedly \u201c[Reeling both unsafe and uncomfortable driving the [V]ehicle given its numerous defects, [Pyskaty] took the Vehicle off the road\u201d and parked it in a garage where it has remained since. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">On March 4, 2015, Pyskaty filed this lawsuit against the defendants in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties consented to have a magistrate judge conduct all proceedings in the litigation, including the entry of final judgment, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>On July 30, 2015, Pyskaty filed an amended complaint alleging that the Vehicle she purchased for $51,195 was in fact worth only $20,478 at the time of sale \u201cin light of [its] undisclosed defects and history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 94. Pyskaty further alleged that the Vehicle, which was \u201cunsafe to drive and inoperable on public streets,\u201d had a current value of approximately $14,865. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 93, 95. Finally, Pyskaty alleged that WWC must have known at the time of sale that its representations regarding the Vehicle\u2019s condition and history were \u201cmaterially false,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 89, because \u201c[t]he Vehicle exhibited] a plethora of traits that, although not apparent to the layperson, would unequivocally inform a BMW dealership ... that the [V]ehicle had been in a major accident,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Based on these allegations, Pyskaty asserted claims against the defendants for: (1) breach of express and implied warranties under the MMWA and New York Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cN.Y. U.C.C.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 2-313, 2-314; (2) common law fraud; and (3) false advertising and deceptive acts and practices under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7\u00a7 349, 350. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 100-64. In connection with her MMWA claims, Pyskaty sought actual damages (or, alternatively, cancellation and rescission), attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and a declaratory judgment. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 165(a)-(b). In connection with her state-law claims, Pyskaty sought actual damages, capped treble damages, punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and injunc-tive and declaratory relief. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 165(c)-(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On August 21, 2015, WWC moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Pyskaty\u2019s claims did not meet the MMWA\u2019s $50,000 amount-in-controversy requirement for federal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Mem. of Law in Support of Mot. to Dismiss, <em>Pyskaty v. Wide World of Cars, LLC, </em>No. 15-cv-1600 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2015), ECF No. 18, at 2-7.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support, WWC argued that Pyskaty was not entitled to a refund under the MMWA because WWC had issued only \u201climited\u201d warranties, which are \u201cnot subject to the Act\u2019s extensive remedies including a refund of the purchase price.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. WWC further argued that the maximum actual damages Pyskaty could recover under the MMWA\u2014calculated by subtracting the alleged true value of the Vehicle from the purchase price\u2014amounted to only $30,717. <em>Id. </em>at 4; <em>see also </em>Affirmation of Keith V. LaRose, <em>Pyskaty v. Wide World of Cars, LLC, </em>No. 15-cv-1600 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2015), ECF No. 17, at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">In opposition, Pyskaty argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the amount in controversy under the MMWA is to be \u201ccomputed on the basis of <em>all claims </em>to be determined in this suit,\u201d including Pyskaty\u2019s state-law claims. Mem. of Law in Opposition to Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 30, at 11 (emphasis partially omitted) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(3)(B)); <em>see also id. </em>at 12-13. Viewed in the aggregate, Pyskaty contended, the value of all claims alleged in the amended complaint \u201cfar exceed[ed] the jurisdictional requirement of $50,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Pyskaty also argued that she was entitled under the MMWA to elect a remedy of revocation or rescission\u2014either of which, she asserted, would itself be worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>more than $50,000. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. Finally, Pyskaty requested leave to amend her complaint to seek punitive damages under the MMWA, thereby augmenting the value of her MMWA claims. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17 &amp; n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">On February 23, 2016, the district court issued a decision granting WWC\u2019s motion and closing the case. <em>See Pyskaty v. Wide World of Cars, LLC, </em>No. 15-cv-1600 (JCM), 2016 WL 828135, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2016).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court based its ruling on three principal conclusions. First, the value of Pyskaty\u2019s' state-law claims could not be counted toward the jurisdictional amount in controversy. <em>Id. </em>at *5, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *14-16. Second, Pyskaty\u2019s alleged actual damages under the MMWA amounted to only $30,717,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Pyskaty \u201ccould not use [the] proposed punitive damages to meet the MMWA minimum\u201d because she was not entitled to recover such damages under New York State law. <em>Id. </em>at-*7, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *20-21. Third, even if Pyskaty were entitled to revocation or rescission under the MMWA, the value of those remedies, too, would fall below the requisite $50,000 threshold. <em>Id. </em>at *7-9 &amp; n.14, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *23-28 &amp; n.14. Pyskaty appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The MMWA, also known as the federal \u201clemon law,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is a remedial statute designed \u201cto improve the adequacy of information available to consumers, prevent deception, and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. Abrams, </em>899 F.2d 1315, 1317 (2d Cir. 1990) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)). To achieve these goals, the Act permits \u201ca consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier, warrantor, or service contractor to comply with ... a written warranty [or] implied warranty .., [to] bring suit for damages and other legal and equitable relief.\u201d 15 U.S.C, \u00a7 2310(d)(1). The Act provides for federal jurisdiction, however, only where specified requirements are satisfied-Relevant here, the Act states that MMWA claims may be brought in federal court only \u201cif the amoqnt in controversy [meets or exceeds] the sum or value of $50,Q00 (exclusive of interests and costs) computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in [the] suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Pyskaty contends that the district court erred in declining to consider the value of her state-law claims whep calculating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>amount in controversy for the purpose of federal subject-matter jurisdiction under the MMWA. Pyskaty further asserts that the value of her MMWA claims alone is sufficient to satisfy the statute\u2019s jurisdictional threshold. Because we agree with the latter of these contentions, we need not, and do not, address the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AAA\">\u201cWhen reviewing the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>accepting all material facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Lotes Co. v. Hon Hai Precision Indus. Co., </em>753 F.3d 395, 403 (2d Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). We may \u201crefer[ ] to evidence outside of the pleadings\u201d to resolve issues of jurisdictional fact. <em>Zappia Middle E. Constr. Co. v. Emirate of Abu Dhabi, </em>215 F.3d 247, 253 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Although a plaintiff invoking federal jurisdiction must demonstrate a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the amount-in-controversy requirement is satisfied, <em>Tongkook Am., Inc. v. Shipton Sportswear Co., </em>14 F.3d 781, 784 (2d Cir. 1994) (citation omitted), \u201cwe recognize a rebuttable presumption that the face of the complaint is a good faith representation of the actual amount in controversy,\u201d <em>Colavito v. N.Y. Organ Donor Network, Inc., </em>438 F.3d 214, 221 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A defendant may rebut that presumption by demonstrating \u201cto a legal certainty that the plaintiff could not recover the amount alleged or that the damages alleged were feigned to satisfy jurisdictional m\u00ednimums.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and brackets omitted); <em>see also St. Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., </em>303 U.S. 283, 289, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938) (\u201cIt must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">II. The Value of Pyskaty\u2019s Claims Under the MMWA</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Pyskaty asserts claims against the defendants for breach of express and implied warranties under the MMWA. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 100-25. Under section 2304 of the MMWA, when a warrantor breaches a \u201cfull\u201d written warranty,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the plaintiff is entitled to a refund or replacement without charge for the defective product. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304(a)(4); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 2303(a)(1) (stating that a written warranty shall be designated as \u201cfull\u201d where it \u201cmeets the Federal minimum standards for warranty set forth in section 2304\u201d). However where, as here, the warrantor made only a \u201climited\u201d written warranty, <em>see </em>App\u2019x at 127 (\u201cBuyers Guide\u201d) (designating the applicable warranty as a \u201climited warranty\u201d); Appellant\u2019s Br. at 47 n.10 (acknowledging that Pyskaty is not seeking a \u201crefund\u201d under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304), the text and legislative history of the Act indicate that \u201ccourts [should] look to state law to determine the applicable measure of damages, which informs the amount in controversy.\u201d <em>Scarlott v. Nissan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>N. Am., Inc., </em>771 F.3d 883, 887 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing <em>Boelens v. Redman Homes, Inc., </em>748 F.2d 1058, 1069 (5th Cir. 1984)); <em>see also Torres-Fuentes v. Motorambar, Inc., </em>396 F.3d 474, 475 (1st Cir. 2005) (\u201c[T]he [MMWA] looks to state law to determine available damages.\u201d); <em>Schimmer v. Jaguar Cars, Inc., </em>384 F.3d 402, 405 (7th Cir. 2004) (same); <em>Boyd v. Homes of Legend, Inc., </em>188 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir. 1999) (same).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In the amended complaint, Pyskaty sought \u201cactual damage\u201d or, in the alternative, \u201ccancellation and rescission of the loan\u201d in connection with her MMWA claims. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-18, 124-45.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court construed this as a request for actual damages, rescission, or revocation of acceptance. <em>See Pyskaty, </em>2016 WL 828135, at *5-9 &amp; n.14, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *16-28 &amp; n.14. Pyskaty does not dispute that her claimed actual damages for breach of warranty fall well below the $50,000 amount-in-controversy requirement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She argues, however, that she can satisfy that threshold based on the value of either her rescission or revocation claim. Pyskaty further argues that she should be permitted to supplement the value of her MMWA claims by amending her complaint to add a request for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We agree with the district court that Pyskaty may not count the value of the proposed punitive damages toward the amount in controversy. However, we conclude that Pyskaty\u2019s rescission claim supplies a sufficient basis for subject-matter jurisdiction and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">A. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion, unless the denial was based on an interpretation of law, such as futility, in which case we review the legal conclusion <em>de novo.\u201c Panther Partners Inc. v. Ikanos Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>681 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir. 2012). \u201cFutility is a determination, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>matter of law, that proposed amendments would fail to cure prior deficiencies or to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In general, when assessing whether an amended complaint would state a claim, we consider \u201cthe proposed amendments] ... along with the remainder of the complaint,\u201d <em>Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm\u2019t, </em>592 F.3d 314, 323 n.3 (2d Cir. 2010), cert. <em>denied, </em>562 U.S. 1168, 131 S.Ct. 901, 178 L.Ed.2d 803 (2011), accepting as true all non-conclusory factual allegations therein, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor, <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). However, \u201cin computing [the] jurisdictional amount, a claim for punitive damages is to be given closer scrutiny, and the trial judge accorded greater discretion, than a claim for actual damages.\u201d <em>Zahn v. Int'l Paper Co., </em>469 F.2d 1033, 1033 n.1 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>aff'd, </em>414 U.S. 291, 94 S.Ct. 505, 38 L.Ed.2d 511 (1973). A \u201ctrial court is plainly not compelled to accept a claim of punitive damages, however unwarranted, made for the purpose of conferring federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In requesting leave to amend the complaint in the case at bar, Pyskaty did not propose to include additional <em>factual </em>allegations to support her claim for punitive damages. Rather, she sought permission to amend the complaint to clarify that she was seeking punitive damages as an additional remedy under the MMWA. <em>See </em>Mem. of Law in Opposition to Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 30, at 17 n.4.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The district court rejected that bid, concluding that the facts alleged in the amended complaint could not support an award of punitive damages under the MMWA and that the proposed amendment would thus be futile. <em>Pyskaty, </em>2016 WL 828135, at *7, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *20-22. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">As the district court correctly observed, \u201cpunitive damages are recoverable under the MMWA if they would be recoverable in a breach-of-warranty action brought under governing state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *18.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the N.Y. U.C.C. does not \u201cindicate that punitive damages are an element of recovery that is available in breach of warranty cases,\u201d 93 N.Y. Juris. 2d Sales \u00a7 325 (Feb. 2017), New York courts have assessed claims for punitive damages arising from a breach of warranty under the standard applicable to punitive damages claims arising from a breach of contract, <em>see, e.g., European Am.

To justify an award of punitive damages under that standard, \u201c(1) [the] defendant\u2019s conduct must be actionable as an independent tort; (2) the tor-tious conduct must be of [an] egregious nature ...; (3) the egregious conduct must be directed to [the] plaintiff; and (4) it must be part of a pattern directed at the public generally.\u201d <em>N.Y.

The argument is logical, but [the] plaintiff has still proven only a single incident of odometer alteration.\u201d); <em>Stegich v. Saab Cars USA, Inc., </em>177 Misc.2d 81, 82, 676 N.Y.S.2d 756, 756 (1st Dep\u2019t 1998) (per curiam) (\u201cPlaintiffs general assertion that he was \u2018only One of many members of the public who entered the defendant [dealer\u2019s] showroom to purchase a new car\u2019 is hardly sufficient to sustain a finding that defendants\u2019 conduct constituted a public wrong.\u201d (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, although the amended complaint alleges, \u201cupon information and belief,\u201d that WWC \u201cregularly\u201d induces customers to purchase vehicles based on false or inaccurate information, Compl. \u00b6 152, this allegation is entirely speculative: The amended complaint contains no allegations of fact which, if true, would suggest that WWC has engaged in similarly fraudulent transactions on other occasions or that Pyskaty has a good-faith basis for claiming that it does so on a \u201cregular and recurring basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 154; <em>see Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, </em>604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2010) (explaining that a \u201cconclusory allegation on information and belief ... [is] insufficient to make [a] claim plausible\u201d where \u201cthe complaint\u2019s <em>\u2018\\f\\actual allegations ... </em>[do not] raise a right to relief above the speculative level\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bell Atl.

First Manhattan Co., </em>902 F.2d 169, 172 (2d Cir. 1990) (\u201cWhere pleading is permitted on information and belief, a complaint must [still] adduce specific facts supporting a strong inference of fraud or it will not satisfy even a relaxed pleading standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Therefore, in light of the fact that Pys-katy has not proposed to supplement her complaint with additional <em>factual </em>allegations to support her request for punitive damages, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying her leave to amend the complaint to request such damages in connection with her MMWA claims. It follows that the potential value of those damages cannot be counted toward the amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">B. Rescission</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Under New York law, a plaintiff may obtain rescission\u2014in lieu of actual damages\u2014when a breach of contract is either \u201cmaterial and willful\u201d or \u201cso substantial and fundamental\u201d that it \u201cstrongly tend[s] to defeat\u201d the purpose of the contract. <em>See Graham v. James, </em>144 F.3d 229, 237 (2d Cir. 1998). Because it is an equitable remedy, rescission is available only if damages would not be a \u201ccomplete and adequate\u201d remedy and \u201cthe status quo may be substantially restored\u201d by equitable relief. <em>Rudman v. Cowles Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>30 N.Y.2d 1, 13, 330 N.Y.S.2d 33, 43, 280 N.E.2d 867, 874 (1972) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In the case at bar, the district court concluded that even if Pyskaty were entitled to rescission, the value of that remedy would not meet or exceed the $50,000 amount-in-controversy requirement. <em>Pyskaty, </em>2016 WL 828135, at *7 n.14, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *23 n.14. The district court based this conclusion on its observation that \u201cin an action seeking the equitable remedy of declaratory or injunc-tive relief, \u2018it is well \u25a0 established that the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 347, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977)). The district court reasoned that here, \u201cthe \u2018object of the litigation\u2019 is the Vehicle,\u201d which, according to Pyskaty, was worth only $14,865 at the time of suit\u2014less, of course, than the $50,000 jurisdictional threshold. <em>Id.; see also </em>Compl. \u00b6 95 (alleging that the \u201ccurrent value of the [Vjehicle is approximately $14,865.00\u201d). Accordingly, the district court concluded that Pyskaty could not establish federal subject-matter jurisdiction based on her rescission claim. <em>Pyskaty, </em>2016 WL 828135, at <em>*7 </em>n.14, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *23 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Pyskaty argues that the district court erred in treating the Vehicle, rather than the purchase agreement, as the \u201cobject of the litigation\u201d for the purpose of valuing her rescission claim. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 43-47. Pyskaty\u2019s position comports with the approach employed by our sister circuits for valuing rescission claims in this context: The Third and Sixth Circuits\u2014which appear to be the only ones to have explicitly reached this issue\u2014adhere to the principle that \u201cwhere a plaintiff seeks to rescind a contract, the contract\u2019s entire value, without offset, is the amount in controversy.\u201d <em>Rosen v. Chrysler Corp., </em>205 F.3d 918, 921 (6th Cir. 2000); <em>see also Metcalfe v. Renaissance Marine, Inc., </em>566 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir. 2009) (noting that the value of the plaintiffs rescission claim amounted to at least the full $85,000 purchase price of the allegedly defective powerboat and therefore satisfied the amount-in-controversy requirement for federal subject-matter jurisdiction).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Here, the \u201ctotal cash price\u201d of the Vehicle (including optional dealer-installed equipment, but excluding tax and dealer fees)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> was $51,195. Compl. \u00b6 27; App\u2019x at 125 (\u201cPurchase Order\u201d). Therefore, under the prevailing standard, assuming Pyskaty were entitled to rescission rather than contract damages under the MMWA, the value of that claim would satisfy the jurisdictional threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We decline to adopt the approach taken by the district court, which looked to the value of the defective item\u2014i.e., the Vehicle\u2014rather than the amount payable under the contract to be rescinded. That approach, we think, would likely have the perverse effect of reducing the jurisdictional value of a breach-of-contract claim in direct proportion to the seriousness of the defect: The more defective the product, the less the amount in controversy. Under such a rule, a plaintiff seeking to rescind a contract under which she paid $80,000 for an item worth $60,000, for example, would meet the jurisdictional threshold, but a plaintiff who paid $1 million for goods that were worth $25,000 would not, despite having suffered a far greater harm. Any such outcome strikes us as flatly inconsistent with an obvious purpose of the MMWA\u2019s amount-in-controversy requirement: reserving federal jurisdiction for suits involving substantial disputes. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. 93-1107, at 42 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7702, 7724, 1974 WL 11709 (explaining that the purpose of the MMWA\u2019s \u201cjurisdictional provisions is to avoid trivial or insignificant actions being brought ... in the federal courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">WWC does not dispute this point. It argues instead that Pyskaty is not entitled to rescission at all, and therefore cannot rely on the value of such a claim to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, because the contract with WWC limited Pyskaty\u2019s remedies to repair or replacement. WWC contends that this purported restriction is enforceable under N.Y. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-719, which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ase\">[an] agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this Article, as by limiting the buyer\u2019s remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of nonconforming goods or parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">N.Y. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-719(l)(a). We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">First, it is not clear that the purchase agreement in fact disclaimed Pyskaty\u2019s right to any remedy other than repair or replacement. The contract stated that upon the triggering of one of the express written warranties, WWC would \u201ceither repair the Covered Part free of charge,\u201d \u201creimburse [Pyskaty] for the reasonable cost of such repair,\u201d or, if WWC were \u201cunable to repair the [Vlehicle after a reasonable number of attempts, ... [provide] a full refund of the purchase price.\u201d App\u2019x at 129 (New York State \u201cLimited Lemon Law Warranty\u201d). The contract did not, however, expressly state that those were the <em>sole </em>remedies to which Pyskaty might be entitled. <em>See </em>N.Y. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-719(l)(b) (\u201c[R]esort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the sole remedy\u201d). To the contrary, it indicated that Pyskaty \u201cmay also have other [legal] rights\u201d in addition to those specifically stated in the written warranty. App\u2019x at 129; <em>see also </em>Purchase Order, <em>id. </em>at 123 (making clear that the contract\u2019s \u201cDisclaimer of Warranties\u201d \u201cdoes not limit any implied or other warranties imposed as a matter of law\u201d (emphasis omitted)); Buyers Guide, <em>id. </em>at 127 (identifying express limited warranties and noting that, \u201c[u]nder state law, \u2018implied warranties\u2019 may give [Pyskaty] even more rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Second, it seems to us unlikely that parties to a contract may, as a matter of law, contractually limit a buyer\u2019s right to the equitable remedy of rescission. By its terms, section 2-719 permits the exclusion of only those remedies that are \u201crecoverable under [N.Y. U.C.C. Article 2].\u201d N.Y. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-719(l)(a). Although Article 2 acknowledges the existence of rescission as a remedy for a breach of contract, that remedy\u2014as opposed to the similar, statutory remedy of revocation, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-608, 2-711\u2014is not among those whose elements are spelled out in the N.Y. U.C.C. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7 2-608, cmt. 1 (\u201cThe section no longer speaks of \u2018rescission^]\u2019 ... The remedy under this section is instead referred to simply as \u2018revocation of acceptance\u2019 of goods tendered under a contract for sale.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2-721 (noting that \u201c[n]either rescission [n]or a claim for rescission of the contract ... shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or [any] other remedy\u201d available under Article 2). Moreover, insofar as \u201cthe effect of rescission is to declare a contract void from its inception,\u201d 16 N.Y. Juris. 2d Cancellation of Instruments \u00a7 1 (citing <em>Cty. of Orange v. Grier, </em>30 A.D.3d 556, 557, 817 N.Y.S.2d 146, 147 (2d Dep\u2019t 2006)), it would be odd at best to allow the availability of this remedy to be curtailed by the very contract that the plaintiff seeks to rescind.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Finally, it is the law of this Circuit that there is a \u201crebuttable presumption that the face of the complaint is a good faith representation of the actual amount in controversy,\u201d <em>Colavito, </em>438 F.3d at 221 (citation omitted), and that \u201c[i]f the right of recovery is uncertain, the doubt should be resolved ... in favor of the subjective good faith of the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Tongkook, </em>14 F.3d at 785-86 (ellipsis in <em>Tongkook) </em>(quoting <em>McDonald v. Patton, </em>240 F.2d 424, 426 (4th Cir. 1957)). We have also held that \u201ca valid defense does not deprive a federal court of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Zacharia v. Harbor Island Spa, Inc., </em>684 F.2d 199, 202 (2d Cir. 1982). \u201cWere the law otherwise,\u201d we explained, \u201cthe orderly progress of litigation would be disrupted, and ... [i]ssues going to a federal court\u2019s power to decide would be hopelessly confused with the merits themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, for dismissal to be warranted, \u201cit must appear to a <em>legal certainty </em>from the complaint that the plaintiff cannot recover sufficient damages to invoke federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citing <em>St. Paul Mercury, </em>303 U.S. 283, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[E]ven where [the] allegations leave grave doubt about the likelihood of a recovery of the requisite amount, dismissal is not warranted.\u201d); <em>Tongkook, </em>14 F.3d at 785 (\u201c[T]he legal impossibility of recovery must be so certain as virtually to negative the plaintiffs good faith in asserting the claim.\u201d (quoting <em>Patton, </em>240 F,2d at 426)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">In the case before us, we conclude that \u201cfrom the face of the pleadings, it is <em>[not] </em>apparent, to a legal certainty, that [Pyskaty] cannot recover [on her rescission claim].\u201d <em>St. Paul Mercury, </em>303 U.S. at 289, 58 S.Ct. 586.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the value of this claim, which exceeds $50,000, satisfies the MMWA\u2019s jurisdictional threshold.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\">.

In order for a written warranty to qualify as a \"full\u201d warranty, the warrantor: (1) must agree to remedy the defective product within a reasonable time period and without charge; (2) may not impose any limitation on the duration of any implied warranty on the product; and (3) may not exclude or limit consequential damages for breach of any written or implied warranty on the product, unless such exclusion or limitation appears conspicuously on the face of the warranty. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2304(a)(l)-(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b250-5\">. As the Fifth Circuit explained in <em>MacKenzie v. Chrysler Corp., </em>607 F.2d 1162 (5th Cir. 1979), although the MMWA \"is virtually silent as to the amount and type of damages which may be awarded for breach of a[ ] ... limited warranty,\u201d the statutory text \"provides that nothing in the Act 'shall invalidate or restrict any right or remedy of any consumer under State law,' \u201d and \u201cthe legislative history clearly implies that a resort to state law is proper in determining the applicable measure of damages under the Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1166 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2311(b)(1)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. Pyskaty also sought declaratory relief and \"reasonable attorney's fees, costs[,] and expenses\u201d in connection with these claims. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117, 124. However, the district court concluded that attorney\u2019s fees and costs are \"generally not recoverable for MMWA claims,\u201d and therefore cannot be counted toward the amount in controversy. <em>Pyskaty, </em>2016 WL 828135, at *5, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21945, at *5 (citing <em>Boelens, </em>748 F.2d at 1069); <em>see also Boelens, </em>748 F.2d at 1069 (\"Nor may [a] claim for attorney[\u2019]s fees be used to satisfy the jurisdictional amount, because \u00a7 2310(d)(3) requires that the amount in controversy be calculated 'exclusive of interests and costs[,]\u2019 [and a]ttorney[']s fees are 'costs\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 2310(d)(3).\u201d); <em>Saval </em>v. <em>BL Ltd., </em>710 F.2d 1027, 1033 (4th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (\" '[C]ost\u2019 as used in \u00a7 2310(d)(3)(B) includes attorney[\u2019]s fees, and so they cannot be considered in calculating the jurisdictional amount.\u201d). Pyskaty does not challenge this determination on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b250-12\">.Under New York law, \"[t]he measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted.\u201d N.Y. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-714(2). Here, Pyskaty alleged that she purchased the Vehicle for $51,195, but that, at the time of sale, the Vehicle was actually worth $20,478. Compl. \u00b6 94. Accordingly, her alleged actual MMWA damages amount to only $30,717.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\">. Pyskaty\u2019s amended complaint already contained a request for punitive damages in connection with several of her state-law claims. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 146, 157, 165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Kelly v. Fleetwood Enters., Inc., </em>377 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004) (\"State law generally guides courts in determining whether punitive damages are available as a remedy for breach of warranty under the [MMWA].''); <em>Boyd, </em>188 F.3d at 1298 (\u201c[A court] should look to state law, rather than federal law, to determine whether punitive damages are available under the Magnuson-Moss Act....\u201d); <em>MacKenzie, </em>607 F.2d at 1166 (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">. The Seventh Circuit has similarly noted that for jurisdictional purposes, the amount in controversy does not ordinarily reflect offsets. <em>See Jadair, Inc. v. Walt Keeler Co., </em>679 F.2d 131, 133 n.5 (7th Cir. 1982) (suggesting without deciding that the value of the plaintiffs rescission claim might amount to the contract price, without offset for the value of the product that the plaintiff would be required to. return upon rescission).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\">. Pyskaty omits tax and dealer fees from her assessment of the Vehicle\u2019s \"total cash price.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 36, 45; <em>see also </em>Compl. \u00b6 27. R may be that these charges, which are itemized in the purchase agreement, <em>see </em>App'x at 125, can be counted toward the \"contract's entire value.\u201d <em>Rosen, </em>205 F.3d at 921. We need not resolve the issue, however, because the total price of the Vehicle, excluding t\u00e1x and dealer fees, exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">. It may be that there is a \"complete and adequate\u201d remedy at law available to Pyskaty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>that precludes her right to equitable relief. <em>Rudman, </em>30 N.Y.2d at 13, 330 N.Y.S.2d at 43, 280 N.E.2d at 874. However, on the record before the Court, we cannot conclude that the likelihood of this outcome is \"so certain as virtually to negat[e] [Pyskaty\u2019s] good faith in asserting [a] claim [for rescission].\u201d <em>Tongkook, </em>14 F.3d at 785 (quoting <em>Patton, </em>240 F.2d at 426).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b256-30\">. In light of this conclusion, we need not determine whether (1) Pyskaty\u2019s revocation claim under the MMWA would independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, or (2) the value of Pyskaty's state-law claims may be counted toward the jurisdictional threshold.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
