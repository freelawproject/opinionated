The jury deadlocked on the count charging attempted second-degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">On June 6, 2006, the court sentenced appellant to the jurisdiction of the Division of Corrections for a period of twenty years for his conviction of assault in the first degree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was also sentenced to fifteen years for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, three years for illegally carrying a handgun and five years for possession of a regulated firearm, these sentences to run concurrent with the twenty-year sentence for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">This appeal was thereafter timely noted, in which appellant presents the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">1. Whether the trial court improperly admitted a videotape which purported to be a recording of the events sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>rounding the shooting, where that videotape was never properly authenticated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">2. Whether the trial court improperly admitted a detective\u2019s lay opinion testimony implicitly identifying appellant in the videotape which purported to depict the events surrounding the shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">3. Whether [appellant\u2019s] jury was inappropriately pressured into reaching a verdict by the trial court\u2019s premature, repetitive and improperly worded <em>Allen[</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">4. Whether [appellant\u2019s] conviction for possession of a regulated firearm must be reversed where proof of the size of the firearm is a necessary element of the offense and the State failed to produce any evidence that [appellant] possessed a gun smaller than sixteen inches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">For the reasons that follow, we resolve the issues in favor of the State and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">During the evening of June 23, 2005, Jermaine Wright frequented Jerry\u2019s Bar, a bar and liquor store, located at 604 Poplar Grove Street in Baltimore City. At approximately 10:00 p.m., Wright stepped outside of Jerry\u2019s Bar and was shot. A bullet entered the right-side of Wright\u2019s stomach and became lodged in his spinal cord, resulting in L3 spinal cord injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">After arriving on the scene, police officers found narcotics on Wright\u2019s person and recovered a pink hat that was later determined to belong to Wright. Pursuant to police investigations, Wright told the officers that he did not know his assailant, but described him as \u201ca black male,\u201d having a \u201cthick build\u201d and \u201cwearing a white T-shirt.\u201d Wright also told the officers that he did not see the weapon used to shoot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Appellant was subsequently apprehended for the shooting of Wright and was charged under the seven counts set forth, <em>supra. </em>The lead detective working Wright\u2019s case, Carlos Vila, met with Wright on three separate occasions, including the day before trial, in an effort to identify his assailant. On those different occasions, Wright either refused to view the photo array that Detective Vila had prepared or claimed that he needed more time.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Appellant\u2019s trial began on March 20, 2006 and spanned three days. Despite Wright\u2019s failure to identify appellant prior to trial, Wright testified that he and appellant had an argument. Appellant subsequently left Jerry\u2019s Bar, returned ten minutes later and asked Wright to step outside. Believing that appellant wanted to \u201crumble,\u201d Wright followed appellant out of the bar. According to Wright, once outside of Jerry\u2019s Bar, appellant \u201cwhipped out his gun and shot [him],\u201d and everything \u201chappened real fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">After unequivocally identifying appellant, whom he had known for three years, as the man who shot him, Wright explained his reasoning for not coming forward until trial. He said: \u201cI wanted [appellant] to still be out there because, you know, I was going to take advantage myself. I was going to get him.\u201d \u201cI was so mad and angry I wanted\u2014you know, I was going to deal with it myself.\u201d Wright testified that, although he was still \u201cmad,\u201d he decided to come to court because he thought \u201cit\u2019s best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">An employee of Jerry\u2019s Bar, Charles Burrell, however, recounted a different version of events that occurred during the night of June 23, 2005. According to Burrell, a man named \u201cE\u201d and Wright engaged in a fight at approximately 9:00 p.m. Burrell broke up the fight and \u201cput the guy named \u2018E\u2019 out of the bar.\u201d Burrell then told Wright to sit in a chair, while he (Burrell) went next door to pick up food that he had ordered. While Burrell was waiting for his food, he heard gun shots. Burrell ran outside to find Wright \u201cat the front door of Jerry\u2019s Bar laying down on the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The State pointed out that, contrary to his trial testimony, Burrell had told police that he saw appellant on the day of the shooting. After refreshing Burrell\u2019s recollection with his taped statement to police, Burrell agreed that appellant \u201chad been in and out\u201d of the bar. Burrell additionally testified that appellant is known to wear a white T-shirt on his head \u201clike he an Arab or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Gregory Jennings confirmed Burrell\u2019s testimony that appellant always wore a T-shirt or towel around his head. Jennings also agreed that, on the day after the shooting, he identified appellant\u2019s photograph for the police. On the back of a photograph, Jennings wrote and signed that \u201c[he] saw [appellant] outside arguing with [Wright].\u201d At trial, however, Jennings claimed that it was his understanding that he was not free to leave during police questioning until he provided a statement to police. He further claimed that police officers informed him of what to say in his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">During appellant\u2019s trial, the State presented the testimony of Detective Vila regarding his investigation. Detective Vila testified that, once he discovered that David Kim, the owner of Jerry\u2019s Bar, had installed eight surveillance cameras, he requested a copy of the footage. Kim, however, did not know how to extract data from the computerized system and, in turn, called a \u201ctechnician\u201d to transfer the recorded data to a compact disc. Thereafter, Kim provided the disc to Detective Vila, which was later converted to VHS. The State offered the videotape and excerpted photographic stills therefrom into evidence. Over appellant\u2019s specific objection that the videotape lacked proper authentication, the court allowed the State to play the videotape in the courtroom and permitted the jury to view the videotape during its deliberations. Additionally, Detective Vila conveyed to the jury his observations of the still photographs. Appellant takes issue with the detective\u2019s testimony, claiming that he repeatedly \u201cimplied\u201d that an individual pictured in the photographs was appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">After hours of deliberation, the jury returned its verdict. As noted, appellant was found guilty of first-degree assault, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>second-degree assault, use of a handgun in a felony or crime of violence, possession of a regulated firearm and illegally carrying a handgun. Appellant was acquitted of attempted first-degree murder. The jury, despite an <em>Allen </em>charge, remained deadlocked on the charge of attempted second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Additional facts will be discussed as warranted throughout our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Appellant initially argues that the videotape of the surveillance footage taken from Jerry\u2019s Bar was not properly authenticated. Specifically, he argues that, pursuant to the \u201csilent witness\u201d theory of authentication, the State failed to present sufficient evidence describing the process that produced the videotape and excerpted still photographs therefrom. To the extent preserved, the State contends that it presented sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to infer that the \u2022videotape is an accurate recording of events surrounding the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Preliminarily, the State argues that appellant\u2019s specific contention that the State failed to establish if and how the videotape was \u201cedited\u201d is unpreserved for appellate review. At trial, Kim testified that the computerized surveillance system of Jerry\u2019s Bar records automatically, twenty-four hours a day. To provide Detective Vila with the footage of the shooting, Kim asked a \u201ctechnician\u201d to transfer the data from the system to a compact disc because he did not know how to do so himself. A compact disc was subsequently provided to Detective Vila that night.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Appellant objected to the admittance of the videotape into evidence, arguing that the State failed to present testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>someone familiar with the computer generated system. Thus, he asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a hole that\u2019s not filled\u201d regarding the copying of the computer data onto compact disc. On appeal, appellant contends that, \u201cwithout specific evidence describing how the video data recorded from multiple cameras was transferred and compiled into a single viewable format, and how the portions of the video admitted into evidence were edited, a trial court could not know whether the video was presented in a manner which significantly altered the accuracy of the tape.\u201d Because appellant failed to explicitly mention the possibility of \u201cediting\u201d to the trial court, the State argues that the trial judge \u201cwould have no reason to suspect that any \u2018editing\u2019 had occurred and could not have considered this aspect of the current claim in its ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u201cTo preserve an issue for appellate review, it must first have been presented, with particularity, to the trial court.\u201d <em>Jordan v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 225, 244, 571 A.2d 238 (1990), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>323 Md. 151, 591 A.2d 875 (1991); <em>Harmony v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 306, 317, 594 A.2d 1182 (1991) (opining that \u201c[a]n offhand remark that the \u2018statute of limitations or something like that\u2019 might \u2018come into play\u2019 is simply not particular enough to allow appellate review\u201d). A party is required to \u201cbring his argument to the attention of the trial court with enough particularity that the court is aware first, that there is an issue before it, and secondly, what the parameters of the issue are.\u201d <em>Harmony, </em>88 Md.App. at 317, 594 A.2d 1182. The trial court needs sufficient information to allow it to make a thoughtful judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Appellant\u2019s repeated general objections that the videotape lacked authentication encompasses his specific contention of \u201cediting\u201d on appeal. Appellant brought the issue of authentication to the trial court\u2019s attention by pointing to the gap in testimony and arguing that \u201csomeone familiar with the computer generated system\u201d needed to testify to \u201cthe copying from the system onto CD_ROM or CD\u2014a DVR or whatever.\u201d Clearly, the issue before the trial court was the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>testimony regarding how data from eight different cameras, feeding into the computer generated system, was compiled into a single viewable format. The fact that \u201cediting\u201d may have been required is reasonably implied by the objection raised below. <em>See Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 116, 857 A.2d 88 (2004). Thus, the issue of \u201cediting\u201d is properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Addressing the merits, videotapes are generally admissible in evidence on the same basis as motion picture films and are subject to the same general rules applicable to photographic evidence. <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Cole, 342 </em>Md. 12, 20, 672 A.2d 1115 (1996) (Cole II);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tobias v. State, 37 Md.App. 605, 615, 378 A.2d 698 (1977). Photographs may be admissible under one of two distinct rules. Typically, photographs are admissible to illustrate testimony of a witness when that witness testifies from first-hand knowledge that the photograph fairly and accurately represents the scene or object it purports to depict as it existed at the relevant time. <em>Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 21, 672 A.2d 1115 (This method of authentication is known as the \u201cpictorial testimony\u201d theory.); <em>see also </em>6 Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 901.2, at 491 (1987). There is a second, alternative method of authenticating photographs that does not require first-hand knowledge. The \u201csilent witness\u201d theory of admissibility authenticates \u201ca photograph as a \u2018mute\u2019 or \u2018silent\u2019 independent photographic witness because the photograph speaks with its own probative effect.\u201d <em>Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 21, 672 A.2d 1115; <em>see also Sisk v. State, </em>236 Md. 589, 591-92, 204 A.2d 684 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Professor Wigmore, explaining the rationale behind this theory, has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">With later advancements in the art of photography ... and with increasing awareness of the manifold evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>uses of the products of the art, it has become clear that an additional theory of admissibility of photographs is entitled to recognition. Thus, <em>even though no human is capable of swearing that he personally perceived what a photograph purports to portray </em>(so that it is not possible to satisfy the requirements of the \u2018pictorial testimony\u2019 rationale) there may nevertheless be good warrant for receiving the photograph in evidence. <em>Given an adequate foundation assuring the accuracy of the process producing it, </em>the photograph should then be received as a so-called silent witness or as a witness which \u2018speaks for itself.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><em>Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 21-22, 672 A.2d 1115 (citing 3 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 790, at 219-220 (Chadbourn rev.1970)) (emphasis added). Under the silent \"witness doctrine, \u201cphotographic evidence may draw its verification, not from any witness who has actually viewed the scene portrayed on film, but from other evidence which supports the reliability of the photographic product....\u201d <em>Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 22, 672 A.2d 1115 (citing 2 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 214, at 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Appellant argues that the State attempted to authenticate the videotape and still photographs therefrom, pursuant to the silent witness theory. He contends, however, that the \u201cscant evidence\u201d adduced at trial regarding the process that produced the videotape stands in stark contrast to the detailed testimony that the Court of Appeals concluded warranted admissibility in <em>Sisk v. State, supra </em>and <em>Cole II, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The Court in <em>Sisk </em>relied upon the \u201csilent witness\u201d theory over forty years ago to uphold the admission of a Regiscope photograph.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its prosecution of James Sisk for obtaining money by false pretenses, the State entered into evidence a Regiscope photograph that showed Sisk passing the check, the identification Sisk used in passing the check and the check itself. By presenting evidence that showed when, where and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>under what circumstances the picture was taken, the State laid an adequate foundation for admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">William Shraver, Chief Investigator for Montgomery Ward, testified that, after receiving an unpaid check, he removed the film from the store\u2019s Regiscope camera. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 204 A.2d 684. He then sent the film, by mail, to the \u201cRegiscope Company,\u201d with a description of the check and the Bates number thereon and requested a photograph. The returned photograph was admitted into evidence. The bottom part of the photograph was a picture of the person cashing the check, while the top part was a picture of the check and the identification used to cash the check. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Marian Stevens, head cashier of Montgomery Ward, testified that she and her assistants cashed approximately twenty-five to thirty checks on the day in question and that they had each operated the Regiscope machine on many occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 204 A.2d 684. Stevens explained to the court the location of the machine in the store and how a picture is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Joseph Slattery, an employee of Regiscope, demonstrated for the court, in detail, how the camera worked. <em>Id. </em>Slattery additionally explained how his company processed and stored the film. After examining the roll of developed film in the film reader and finding the negative of the \u201cparticular transaction,\u201d he testified that the enlargement was a true representation of the negative. <em>Id. </em>According to Slattery, the film used in taking Regiscope pictures is perforated on one side only, so that the film \u201ccannot be put in reverse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 204 A.2d 684. Therefore, on the finished picture, the check is always above the person\u2019s picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The detailed explanation of the operation of the Regiscope camera made \u201cthe possibility of error in the photograph almost <em>nil, </em>in the absence of some intentional trickery to \u2018fake\u2019 the photograph\u201d and, thus, the court held that the negative and enlargement thereof accurately portrayed the subjects illustrated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Thirty years after <em>Sisk, </em>the Court of Appeals in <em>Cole II, supra, </em>applied the \u201csilent witness\u201d principle to videotape evidence. The videotape at issue showed a disruptive inmate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>being extracted from a prison cell and was offered at an administrative hearing for termination of employment of a correctional officer who had participated in the extraction. The Department, however, did not produce a witness who was present at the extraction to testify to the videotape\u2019s accuracy. Thus, in an effort to authenticate the videotape pursuant to the \u201csilent witness\u201d theory, the prison warden testified that cell extractions are ordinarily videotaped and routinely labeled with the date and time of the extraction and the names of the inmate and officers involved. <em>Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 27, 672 A.2d 1115. (The warden was competent to testify as to the routine practices of the prison under Md. Rule 5-406); <em>see </em>Md. Rule 5-406 (2007) (\u201cEvidence of the ... routine practice of an organization is relevant to prove that the conduct of the ... organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the ... routine practice.\u201d). According to the warden, the videotapes are kept in an individual envelope and are stored in a security vault at the institution, where they may be viewed only by signing in and out on a chain of custody form. <em>Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 27, 672 A.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, the Court held that the videotape was sufficiently authenticated. <em>Id. </em>Applying the \u201csilent witness\u201d theory to videotape evidence for the first time, the Court declined to adopt any rigid, fixed foundational requirements for authentication, reasoning that the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of photographic evidence and its intended use at trial will vary from case-to-case. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 672 A.2d 1115. Thus, the Court left the trial court with \u201csome discretion in determining what is an adequate foundation\u201d so long as the foundation laid assures the accuracy of the process producing the photographic evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27, 672 A.2d 1115; <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 5-901(a) (2007) (\u201cThe requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">It is clear from <em>Sisk </em>and <em>Cole II </em>that the governmental entities utilized the silent witness theory so that the Regiscope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>photograph and videotape \u201cspoke for themselves,\u201d rather than <em>\u201csolely </em>to add to or illustrate the testimony of a human witness.\u201d <em>Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 23, 672 A.2d 1115 (emphasis added). In <em>Sisk, </em>the State\u2019s entire case rested upon the Regiseope photograph. By comparison, in <em>Cole II, </em>the Department did not produce a witness who was present at the cell extraction to testify as to the accuracy of the videotape. Because it was undisputed that Cole was depicted in the videotape, <em>see Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 27, 672 A.2d 1115, the Department\u2019s primary objective in showing the videotape was to demonstrate that Cole committed actions that warranted his dismissal. Accordingly, the application of the silent witness theory hinges, in large part, on the proponent\u2019s purpose in entering the videotape or photograph into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Undeniably, the State\u2019s purpose for showing the videotape of the surveillance footage in the case <em>sub judice </em>was to place appellant at the scene of the shooting. <em>Cf. Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 27, 672 A.2d 1115 (where the videotape showed the <em>commission of improper conduct </em>and not that Cole was present at the time of the cell extraction). To completely resolve the issue before us, however, we must also determine whether the videotape was probative evidence that appellant was at the scene of the crime or whether the images portrayed by the videotape added to the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The State elicited testimony from three witnesses who were present in Jerry\u2019s Bar on the night of the shooting. Its primary witness, Wright, unequivocally identified appellant as the individual who shot him. The other two witnesses, Burrell and Jennings, testified that appellant frequented Jerry\u2019s Bar that evening. Prior to appellant\u2019s trial, including the day before trial, however, Wright had failed to identify his assailant. We may not assume, however, that the State was uncertain as to whether Wright would testify that appellant was the shooter or place him at the scene of the shooting when he was called to testify.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sequentially, the State produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Wright as a witness only after the State had called Detective Vila and introduced the videotape and still photographs therefrom through his testimony. <em>See infra </em>Part II. It was subsequent to Vila\u2019s testimony that Wright was called to testify during which he identified appellant as the individual who shot him. Thus, irrespective of the order in which the witnesses were called to testify, the net effect of the videotape served to bolster Wright\u2019s credibility and corroborate his testimony that, not only was appellant present at the scene of the shooting, but that appellant had shot him. <em>See Cole II, </em>342 Md. at 24, 672 A.2d 1115 (citing <em>Fisher, </em>643 S.W.2d at 573-75) (Photographic evidence is the best available means of preserving the appearance of a scene at a given time and because \u201c[e]yewitness testimony is subject to errors in perception, memory lapse, and a witness\u2019 problem of adequately expressing what he observed in language so that the trier of fact can understand,\u201d photographic evidence is superior to eyewitness testimony in certain respects.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The purpose for which the videotape was offered in the instant case thus differs from the purpose for which the videotape and photographs were offered in <em>Sisk, Cole II </em>and cases from other jurisdictions, in which there was no testimony from a witness capable of swearing that he or she personally perceived what the videotape or photograph purported to portray. <em>Cf. Brooks v. Virginia, </em>15 Va.App. 407, 424 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1992) (videotape of a drug transaction between Brooks and a police informant, where the State authenticated the videotape by showing that tabs allowing alteration of the tape were removed and that the videotape contained an onscreen display of the seconds that had passed and by presenting testimony of three police officers who verified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>voice on the tape was that of Brooks even though none of the officers testifying actually observed the drug transaction taking place); <em>Fisher v.

Consequently, appellant\u2019s case does not, technically, fall within the silent witness rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Authentication of the videotape of the surveillance film is required, however, in any event.

Earn testified that- the computerized system at Jerry\u2019s Bar is comprised of eight cameras, with six cameras located inside of the bar and two cameras located outside of the bar. According to Kim, the system is \u201calmost hands-free\u201d and records constantly, twenty-four hours a day, depending \u201con the activity of the movement.\u201d On the night of the shooting, Kim received a telephone call from Detective Vila, asking him to come to Jerry\u2019s Bar and provide police with the surveillance footage in issue. Unable to transfer the data from the computer system to a compact disc himself, Kim asked a \u201ctechnician\u201d to transfer the data. A compact disc was provided to Detective Vila that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The eight cameras recorded automatically onto a computerized system, but the data was transferred onto one rather than eight different discs. There was no testimony describing how the recordings from eight different cameras were compiled into a single viewable format. It was necessary for the \u201ctechnician\u201d or someone possessing expertise or knowledge of the computerized system and how the data is transferred therefrom to explain whether the videotape was edited and, if so, how it was edited. Despite the fact that the date and time is displayed, the lack of evidence regarding the process of transferring the data from the computerized system to compact disc leaves open the possibility of distortion. <em>See 5 </em>Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 403.6 at 322 (1987) (pointing out that \u201cthe courts suspect that movies and tapes may be easily manipulated, through such means as editing and changes of speed, to produce a misleading effect.\u201d). Because of the lack of extrinsic evidence showing under what circumstances the surveillance footage was transferred to a compact disc, the trier of fact could not reasonably infer that the subject matter is what the State claims it to be and, thus, the videotape was not sufficiently authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Nevertheless, we are of the view that the trial court\u2019s error in admitting the videotape and still photographs therefrom was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>State, </em>276 Md. 638, 648, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (\u201cIn those circumstances where a violation of a right protected by the Federal Constitution occurs, the Supreme Court, as the ultimate arbiter in interpreting and implementing constitutional guarantees, has declared such error to be \u2018harmless,\u2019 where, upon a review of the evidence offered the [C]ourt [is] able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (internal citation omitted) (alterations in <em>Dorsey); see also Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 161, 872 A.2d 25 (2005) (citing <em>Dorsey </em>in finding harmless error beyond reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Although appellant and the State, in closing arguments, declared that the \u201ctape [was] the best evidence,\u201d the gravamen of the State\u2019s case was Wright\u2019s unequivocal identification of appellant as the man who shot him. According to Wright, on the night of the shooting, Wright and appellant engaged in an altercation inside of Jerry\u2019s Bar. Thereafter, appellant asked Wright to step outside of Jerry\u2019s Bar to \u201crumble.\u201d Wright testified that, once outside of the bar, appellant \u201cwhipped out his gun and shot [him],\u201d and that everything \u201chappened real fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The most important aspect of Wright\u2019s direct-examination was his testimony that he had known appellant for approximately three years. On the night of June 23, 2005, he argued with appellant face-to-face and immediately followed appellant outside to continue their fight, whereupon he was shot. From the testimony elicited at trial, there was nothing concealing appellant\u2019s identity. Thus, Wright was able to positively and accurately identify appellant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Appellant, however, takes issue with Wright\u2019s conclusive identification, pointing to the fact that Detective Vila met with Wright on three separate occasions, including the day before trial, in an effort to have Wright identify his assailant. On those different occasions, Wright either refused to view the photographic array that Detective Vila had prepared or claimed that he needed more time. During the trial, Wright provided a plausible explanation for his failure to identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>appellant until the trial. He explained: \u201cI wanted [appellant] to still be out there because, you know, I was going to take advantage myself. I was going to get him.\u201d He also said: \u201cI was so mad and angry I wanted\u2014you know, I was going to deal with it myself.\u201d Wright testified that, although he was still \u201cmad,\u201d he decided to come to court because he thought \u201cit\u2019s best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Additionally, Jennings, who \u201chelps [Jerry\u2019s Bar] out,\u201d saw Wright and appellant inside of the bar on the night of the shooting. He testified that Wright, whom he had known as \u201cJuice,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201chad a few words with a couple guys in the bar and [appellant] was one of them.\u201d According to Jennings, at some point, Wright and appellant went outside of the bar. Moreover, in a statement to police, Jennings identified appellant\u2019s photograph and wrote on the back of the photograph, \u201cI saw [appellant] outside arguing with Juice\u201d and signed his name. During trial, however, Jennings claimed that police officers told him what to write in his statement and refused to allow him to leave the station until he gave that statement. Burrell, after the State refreshed his recollection with his taped statement to police, confirmed the testimony of Jennings by testifying that appellant \u201chad been in and out\u201d of Jerry\u2019s Bar on the evening of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Upon our independent review of the record, we can affirmatively say beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error in admitting the videotape and still photographs without proper authentication did not in any way influence appellant\u2019s verdict. <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 581, 886 A.2d 876 (2005). The videotape and still photographs added to or illustrated the testimony of Wright, Burrell and Jennings and, thus, in our view, the jury would have found appellant guilty without reliance on the improperly admitted evidence. Because the error \u201cprobably\u201d did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict, a reversal is not warranted. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Kotteakos v.

The first category is \u201cwhere it is impossible, difficult, or inefficient to verbalize or communicate the underlying data observed by the witness.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>348 Md. 104, 119, 702 A.2d 741 (1997); <em>Brown v.

Imwinkelried, <em>Evidentiary Foundations </em>241 (3rd ed.1995)). In regard to the latter category, Maryland recognizes that law enforcement officials often have specialized training and experience to justify permitting them to offer testimony in the form of a lay opinion. <em>Bey, </em>140 Md.App. at 624, 781 A.2d 952. \u201cTo restrict such testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>underlying factual observations would often deprive the trier of fact of the necessary benefit of the percipient mind\u2019s prior experiences.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>348 Md. at 120, 702 A.2d 741. These \u201cprior experiences would be a <em>sine qua non </em>to a full understanding of the underlying factual data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120, 702 A.2d 741; <em>see also Tu v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 486, 501, 631 A.2d 110 (1993), a<em>ff'd on other grounds, </em>336 Md. 406, 648 A.2d 993 (1994) .</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In <em>Robinson v. State, supra, </em>two State troopers testified as lay witnesses and expressed the opinion that, based on their training and experience, the alleged contraband <em>was in fact </em>crack cocaine and not simply that the disputed substance <em>looked like </em>crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 120-21, 702 A.2d 741 (emphasis supplied). The troopers did not possess sufficient personal knowledge to give such an opinion. Although the record indicated that the troopers had training and experience enabling them to perceive the visual characteristics of suspected cocaine, there was no showing that they had the necessary training and experience to identify accurately the chemical nature of that substance. <em>Id. </em>at 121-23, 702 A.2d 741. Moreover, the troopers\u2019 testimony was not helpful to the trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 702 A.2d 741 (Lay opinion must be based \u201con probability and not on mere possibility.\u201d); <em>see also Kujawa v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>224 Md. 195, 203-04, 167 A.2d 96 (1961). For these reasons, the Court of Appeals held that the State troopers\u2019 testimony was inadmissible lay opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Our decision in <em>Goren v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>113 Md.App. 674, 688 A.2d 941 (1997), is also instructive. In <em>Goren, </em>a State trooper testified as a lay witness to events that occurred during a car accident. Specifically, he testified that Barbara Goren never applied her brakes during the accident, that her vehicle left the roadway twice and that, after she struck the construction barrel, she had two wheels on the grass, before returning to the northbound lane. <em>Id. </em>at 678, 688 A.2d 941. The trooper further testified that Goren\u2019s car did not make any 360 degree revolutions. The trooper\u2019s opinions were not based upon events that he had witnessed and exceeded a recitation of facts that he observed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>scene. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the trooper\u2019s opinions were not helpful to the jury within the meaning of the rule, because they were the type of opinions that required expertise in accident reconstruction, which the trooper admittedly did not possess. <em>Id.; see also Bruce v. State, </em>328 Md. 594, 630, 616 A.2d 392 (1992) (articulating that historically non-expert opinions have been excluded from evidence in areas in which only an expert could reach a rational conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We said in <em>Goren: </em>\u201c[W]hen ... the [lay] witness is \u2018pulling together\u2019 his observations and is therefore testifying to conclusions, the trial judge should not admit such testimony.\u201d <em>Goren, </em>113 Md.App. at 687, 688 A.2d 941 (citing Joseph F..

Accordingly, we held that the trooper\u2019s opinions were not properly admitted as lay opinion testimony. <em>See also Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 725, 870 A.2d 609 (2005) (holding that police officers must be qualified as experts before testifying to opinions that are based on specialized training and knowledge.).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Detective Vila, a twelve-year veteran of the Baltimore City Police Department, testified on behalf of the State about his investigation. During the State\u2019s direct examination, a videotape and a series of still photographs thereof were shown to Detective Vila and the court. As Detective Vila watched the videotape with the jury, he narrated the action that had been captured. The State then questioned the detective regarding his observations of several still photographs. Appellant takes issue with Detective Vila\u2019s testimony, claiming that he \u201cimplicitly\u201d identified appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Detective Vila informed the court that the photographs marked as \u201cState\u2019s Exhibit\u2019s 2A\u201d, \u201c2B,\u201d \u201c2D\u201d and \u201c2E,\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>all recorded at 8:23 p.m. inside of Jerry\u2019s Bar.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> According to Vila, one of the individuals pictured in 2A wore a white T-shirt, blue jeans and a T-shirt or rag on his head. While testifying to his observations of the still photograph marked \u201c2B,\u201d the State asked, \u201cWhat, if any observations did you make regarding the shoes of the Defendant?\u201d The court sustained appellant\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s reference of the individual as the \u201cDefendant.\u201d The court, over appellant\u2019s objections, however, allowed the State to question Detective Vila regarding his observations of the individual.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Later, the detective testified that, in the photograph labeled \u201c2D,\u201d the individual had a goatee and was seen wearing a large watch on his left wrist and another piece of large jewelry on his right wrist. According to Detective Vila, photograph 2E depicts \u201cthe backside of the same individual we discussed on 2D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The State also showed Detective Vila photographs marked as \u201cState\u2019s Exhibit 2C\u201d and \u201c21\u201d that were taken at 9:52 p.m. inside of Jerry\u2019s Bar, moments before the shooting. The detective informed the jury that the individual depicted is the \u201csame individual depicted in photograph 2A and 2B, but without a rag or T-Shirt on his head.\u201d Detective Vila later testified that the individual in 21 is \u201cthe same individual [he] saw on 2C, this time with no bandanna or head gear and a watch on the left wrist, shoelaces on the shoes hanging out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Additionally, Detective Vila informed the jury that the photograph marked as \u201cState\u2019s Exhibit 2G,\u201d which was recorded at 9:53 p.m. outside of Jerry\u2019s Bar, depicted an \u201cindividual wearing a pink hat falling to the ground\u201d and an \u201cindividual wearing a white T-shirt, the blue jeans at a distance [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Appellant argues that, because the State presented witnesses who testified that appellant was known to wear a T-shirt or rag on his head, Detective Vila was essentially allowed to testify that appellant was at the scene of the shooting. Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. The State presented relevant testimony to make its case and stopped short of asking the detective whether the individual shot Wright or was appellant. Accordingly, Detective Vila\u2019s testimony consisted primarily of underlying factual observations. <em>Cf. Robinson, </em>348 Md. at 120-21, 702 A.2d 741 (concluding that the troopers\u2019 opinions that the alleged contraband \u201cwas in fact\u201d crack cocaine was improper lay opinion); <em>Goren, </em>113 Md.App. at 678, 688 A.2d 941 (opining that the trooper\u2019s opinion exceeded a recitation of facts to make specific conclusions about the accident beyond his expertise).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Furthermore, appellant cites no authority to support his contention that the trial court erroneously permitted the detective to make an \u201cimplicit\u201d identification. Instead, appellant relies on case law from other jurisdictions regarding the admissibility of witness testimony explicitly identifying an individual pictured in a photograph or videotape as the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. Colorado, </em>927 P.2d 381 (Colo. 1996); <em>United States v. Jackman, </em>48 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995); <em>Massachusetts v. Austin, </em>421 Mass. 357, 657 N.E.2d 458 (1995); <em>United States v. LaPierre, </em>998 F.2d 1460, 1465 (9th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>787 F.2d 933 (4th Cir.1986); <em>vacated and remanded, </em>479 U.S. 1077, 107 S.Ct. 1271, 94 L.Ed.2d 132 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The detective, however, did testify that the individual pictured in the photographs taken at 9:52 p.m. was the same individual pictured in the photographs taken at 8:23 p.m., but without a rag or T-shirt on his head. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this testimony constituted an \u201copinion,\u201d the trial court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 5-104(a) &amp; 5-403 (2007); <em>Tate v. State, </em>176 Md.App. 365, 409, 933 A.2d 447 (2007) (articulating that, generally speaking, trial courts are afforded broad discretion in the conduct of trials and in determining the reception of evidence). To be permissible lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>opinion, the detective\u2019s opinion must have been rationally based and helpful to the jury. Md. Rule 5-701.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The State claims that the detective\u2019s testimony was helpful to the jury because the detective explained his observations in reference to his investigation. Appellant, however, insists that, in light of the videotape and photographs shown during trial and also available during deliberations and considering that appellant was seated in the courtroom, the jury possessed the knowledge and skill to draw its own inferences from the photographs. It is for this same reason, however, that the detective\u2019s testimony was harmless. <em>Cf. Goren, </em>113 Md.App. 674, 688 A.2d 941 (holding that the trial court\u2019s error in allowing the trooper who investigated the accident scene to be cross-examined as to his opinions on how events occurred, despite the fact that he was not qualified to offer lay opinion testimony, was not harmless on the basis that the testimony concerned only the driver\u2019s contributory negligence, and not alleged negligence of the defendants, but rather warranted grant of new trial; the jury could have used the trooper\u2019s testimony to resolve issues of defendants\u2019 primary negligence). Additionally, both counsel and the court made clear to the jurors that it was their responsibility to determine the identity of the individual pictured in the surveillance footage.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The trial court, in our judgment, did not abuse its discretion in permitting lay opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Appellant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s issuance of \u201cimproper, repetitive, and improperly worded Allen<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to the jury.\u201d Specifically, appellant argues that, because the jury had neither indicated that it was deadlocked nor deliberated for excessive amounts of time, the <em>Allen </em>instruction was premature and, thus, improper. Appellant further contends that the court compounded its initial error by issuing another <em>Allen </em>charge, using antiquated language that has been expressly prohibited by Maryland\u2019s appellate courts. The State, however, refutes appellant\u2019s claim of coercion and argues that any error or abuse of discretion committed by the trial court did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Kelly v. State, </em>270 Md. 139, 310 A.2d 538 (1973), examined the propriety of <em>Allen-type </em>instructions. Opining that the facts and circumstances may make a charge inadvisable or require that the trial court exercise great care in selecting the language of the instruction, the decision \u201cas to whether to utilize an Allen-type charge, when to employ it, and what words should be selected are best left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 310 A.2d 538 (From the trial judge\u2019s \u201cvantage point he has the opportunity to surmise which of the phrases in his instructions have been absorbed and which should be embellished or repeated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In an effort to be of assistance to trial courts, however, the Court suggested guidelines for employment of the charge. Briefly stated, the guidelines are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">1) that before the jury retires, the American Bar Association [<footnotemark>14</footnotemark><em>] </em>approved charge is \u2018always proper\u2019;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>2) that if the trial judge desires to \u2018personalize\u2019 the charge given before the jury retires he has greater latitude in doing so then than [sic] later;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\">3) that after the jury retires the trial court \u2018should closely adhere to the wording of the American Bar Association recommended instruction\u2019; and that in the absence of such adherence a reviewing court will carefully scrutinize the language of the charge to determine whether the jury has been coerced or its province invaded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Burnette, </em>280 Md. at 97, 371 A.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A charge which departs from the recommended instruction will be closely scrutinized to insure that the charge conforms to the intent of the American Bar Association\u2019s developed standards. <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 371 A.2d 663. The Court, therefore, does not require that the exact wording of the American Bar Association\u2019s approved instruction be the only instruction that a trial judge may employ. <em>Kelly, </em>270 Md. at 142, 310 A.2d 538 (\u201cWe are not convinced of the need to imprison the trial judges of this State within the walls of foreordained verbiage.\u201d). Instead, the trial judge may \u201cpersonalize\u201d the charge, adopting minor deviations in language to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>adjust the charge to the circumstances encountered. <em>Burnette, </em>280 Md. at 98, 371 A.2d 663. This personalization must be done cautiously and in the spirit of the American Bar Association\u2019s language. Deviations in substance will not be met with approval. Coercion of the jury for the purpose of breaking a deadlock will constitute reversible error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Turning to the facts, the jury, after deliberating for an hour and a half, sent a written question to the court asking, \u201cWhat is assault in the first degree and what is assault in the second degree? Can you clarify?\u201d The court subsequently summonsed the jury into the courtroom and re-instructed it regarding the definitions of first-degree and second-degree assault. Immediately thereafter, the court reminded the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">Your verdict must be unanimous. You must consult with one another and deliberate with a view in reaching an agreement, if you can do so without violence to your individual judgment. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but do so only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">During deliberations do not hesitate to re-examine your own views. You should change your opinion if convinced you are wrong, but do not surrender your honest belief as to the weight of the evidence only because of the opinion of your fellow jurors or for the mere purpose of reaching a verdict.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Appellant argues that the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>issuance of the abovementioned modified <em>Allen </em>charge was premature and, thus, akin to the reversible Allen-type instruction issued in <em>Miller v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 157, 160, 268 A.2d 596 (1970) and <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 153, 154-57, 258 A.2d 781 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In <em>Fletcher v. State, supra, </em>we reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction because the trial judge, after one hour and five minutes of jury deliberation and without having received any communication from the jury indicating that it was dead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>locked, interrupted deliberations and issued an <em>Allen </em>charge. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 258 A.2d 781. Our principal concern was not with the language employed,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but with the coercive effect that the instruction may have had upon the jury in the circumstances and conditions under which it was given. With no communication of any kind, the judge, on his own initiative, decided to interrupt jury deliberations and give the <em>Allen </em>charge. The single fact that the jury had been deliberating for one hour and five minutes did not justify, in the absence of other compelling factors, the interruption of its deliberations, returning the jury to the courtroom and issuing the <em>Allen </em>charge. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 258 A.2d 781. Noting that the case involved three separate defendants in a joint trial, each represented by separate attorneys, we held that the use of the charge was premature and that, under the circumstances, we were unable to say that the instruction had no coercive or compelling influence upon the jury. <em>Id.; see also Miller, </em>10 Md.App. at 160-61, 268 A.2d 596 (trial court\u2019s issuance of an <em>Alien </em>charge, <em>sua sponte, </em>after the jury had deliberated for one hour and twelve minutes and after the foreman expressly stated that there was a possibility of reaching a decision in the case constituted reversible error).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Conversely, in <em>Stewart v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 565, 244 A.2d 452 (1968), we reviewed the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s propounding of an <em>Allen </em>charge and held that the judge did not abuse his discretion. In <em>Stewart, </em>the jury began its deliberations at 4:25 p.m. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 244 A.2d 452. At 6:32 p.m., the jury sent a note to the judge requesting to hear additional testimony. The request was denied. Later, at 7:00 p.m., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>jury advised the court that it could not reach a verdict. <em>Id. </em>The jurors continued to deliberate until the court gave the <em>Allen </em>charge at 10:37 p.m. Similarly, in <em>Plumley v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 671, 245 A.2d 111 (1968), we approved the use of the <em>Allen </em>charge where, after a four-day trial and jury deliberations lasting approximately seven hours, the court returned the jury to the courtroom and gave the <em>Allen </em>charge. Although the foreman informed the court that \u201c[w]e can report progress,\u201d when considering the length of the trial and the length of time the jury had been deliberating, the resort to the charge was not improper. <em>Id. </em>at 681-83, 245 A.2d 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Prior to the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>issuance of the <em>Allen-type </em>instruction, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the jury had deliberated for one hour and a half before returning to the courtroom to have its questions regarding the definition of first-degree and second-degree assault resolved. The jury neither indicated that it was deadlocked nor that it was having difficulty reaching an agreement. Charged with weighing three days of evidence to reach a verdict on seven different counts, the one and one half hours of deliberations cannot be considered excessive. <em>See Fletcher, </em>8 Md.App. at 158, 258 A.2d 781 (opining that the case was \u201cnot entirely uncomplicated\u201d and that the jury\u2019s deliberation of one hour was not unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Although it would have been preferable for the trial judge to wait until the jury either directly or indirectly communicated that it was deadlocked, the Allen-type charge was undoubtedly non-coercive. After submitting its question regarding assault in the first and second degree, the jury was summoned into the courtroom by the trial judge. Appellant requested that the court re-instruet the jury on reasonable doubt. The trial court granted appellant\u2019s request and included instructions on the presumption of innocence and the jury\u2019s obligation to be impartial. Reiterating the pattern instruction on the duty to deliberate along with the other general instructions was not coercive. Furthermore, the record clearly reflects that the jury was not coerced, as it later announced that it <em>was deadlocked </em>on the count of attempted second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Without reaching an agreement that night, the jury was released for the evening. Less than thirty minutes into deliberations the next day, the jury communicated to the court, at 10:46 a.m., \u201cWe are definitely deadlocked on question two on the verdict sheet. Everything else is agreed upon.\u201d The court subsequently called the jury into the courtroom. When asked if \u201cfurther discussion would be helpful,\u201d the forelady answered in the negative. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">[Y]our verdict must be unanimous. Your [sic] further instructed that there are many\u2014there may be cases in which absolute certainty cannot be expected. Although the verdict must be the verdict of each individual juror as a result of his or her own conviction and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusions of your fellow jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">Each of you should examine the questions submitted with candor and with a proper regard indifference [sic] to the opinions of your fellow jurors. It is your duty, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, to decide this case if you can conscientiously do so. You should listen with a disposition to be convinced to each other\u2019s arguments. If your views are contrary to those of the vast majority you should consider whether your views which make no impression on the minds of so many equally intelligent jurors are correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">You\u2019re again reminded that your verdict must be the [sic] unanimous. You must consider the evidence and weigh the evidence in light of the discussions of your fellow jurors. Under the circumstances, madame forelady, in light of the fact that you\u2019ve only been deliberating for an hour, this court is sending you back for further deliberations in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Even though the employment of the <em>Allen </em>charge appears justified given the jury\u2019s statement that it was deadlocked, for an <em>Allen </em>charge to be proper, \u201cit must be couched in language and delivered in a manner to avoid \u2018savoring of undue pressure or coercion to reach a verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>10 Md.App. at 160, 268 A.2d 596 (citing 1 Branson\u2019s Instructions to Juries (3rd Ed. A. Reid 1960 Repl.) pp. 149-50). Pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>guidelines set forth in <em>Kelly, </em>the trial court was required to closely adhere to the wording of the American Bar Association\u2019s recommended instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Similar to the ABA instruction, the trial court\u2019s charge pays attention to the important principle that honest judgment, and not mere acquiescence, should be the basis of a juror\u2019s decision. The instruction places emphasis on the fact that questions are to be considered with \u201cproper regard and deference to the opinion of others.\u201d Although a definition of the phrase \u201cproper regard and deference\u201d is not given, the jury is later told that, \u201c[i]f your views are contrary to those of the vast <em>majority </em>you should consider whether your views, which make no impression on the minds of so many equally intelligent jurors, are correct.\u201d (Emphasis added). Consequently, the charge focuses on the minority, portraying it somehow as the cause of the deadlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The trial judge in <em>Burnette </em>issued an Allen-type charge using identical language. The Court of Appeals opined that \u201c[i]t is difficult to imagine a minority juror who would not be placed in some discomfort on hearing this instruction. Criticism runs directly to him, and he might understandably conclude that proper \u2018deference\u2019 to the opinions of the majority demands that he abandon his conscientious position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 371 A.2d 663. On the other hand, the \u201cequally intelligent\u201d majority receives flattering attention and is subjected to no criticism. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf anything, the instruction might tend to unduly strengthen the majority\u2019s convictions, perhaps making the majority less willing to seriously engage in further deliberations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">While the trial court\u2019s instruction clearly deviated in substance from the ABA\u2019s recommended charge, it was not coercive. Prior to the trial court\u2019s issuance of a second <em>Allen-type </em>charge, the jury announced that it was hung on the count of attempted second-degree murder. Even after the instruction, the jury remained deadlocked on the count. Because it is unquestionable that the jury was not coerced into convicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>appellant of the assault and handgun charges, the conviction may stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Appellant complains that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of Count seven, unlawfully possessing a regulated firearm, to wit, an unknown caliber handgun. Specifically, appellant argues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed a regulated firearm with a barrel less than sixteen inches long. The State contends, however, that appellant did not raise the claim <em>sub judice </em>in support of his motion for judgment of acquittal and, thus, the issue is not preserved on appeal. Advancing its argument, the State asserts that, even if preserved, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Appellate review of an insufficiency of evidence claim is available only for the reasons given by appellant in his motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>Taylor v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 153, 160, 926 A.2d 805 (2007). During his motion, appellant argued that, because \u201c[w]e have one handgun,\u201d only one of the handgun counts should go to the jury. Thus, appellant did not preserve this issue for appeal. Furthermore, we agree with the State\u2019s contention that, even if the issue was preserved, it would fail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The standard for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 429, 842 A.2d 716 (2004) (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533-34, 823 A.2d 664 (2003)). The function of the jury as the fact finder is to weigh the credibility of witnesses and to resolve conflicts in testimony. <em>Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 429, 842 A.2d 716 (quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998)). Thus, we will give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] findings of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>bility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 430, 842 A.2d 716 (quoting <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821 (2002)). Moreover, in assessing the sufficiency of evidence presented at trial, the limited question before us is not \u201cwhether the evidence <em>should have </em>or <em>probably would have </em>persuaded the majority of fact finders but only whether it <em>possibly could have </em>persuaded <em>any </em>rational fact finder.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>146 Md.App. 83, 137, 806 A.2d 682 (2002) (quoting <em>Fraidin v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 231, 241, 583 A.2d 1065 (1991)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Section 5-133(b)(l)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the Public Safety Article of the Maryland Annotated Code prohibits a person from possessing a <em>regulated firearm </em>if the person has been convicted of a disqualifying crime. (Emphasis added). A regulated firearm includes a handgun. \u00a7 5\u2014101(p)(l). A handgun is defined as a firearm with a barrel less than sixteen inches in length. \u00a7 5-101(n)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Because the parties stipulated that appellant had been convicted of a disqualifying crime, the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant possessed a firearm with a barrel less than sixteen inches in length. <em>Brown v. State, 169 </em>Md.App. 442, 463, 901 A.2d 846 (2006) (State must prove all the elements of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">There is no question that the gun at issue was concealed on appellant\u2019s person when appellant called Wright outside. Furthermore, Wright testified that, once outside, appellant \u201cwhipped out his gun\u201d and shot him. Based on the circumstantial evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that the gun\u2019s barrel was less than sixteen inches long. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 243 (6th ed.1990) (\u201cCircumstantial evidence\u201d is defined as \u201cEvidence of facts or circumstances from which the existence or nonexistence of fact in issue may be inferred. Inferences drawn from facts proved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of unlawfully possessing a regulated firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-12\">.

Regarding the purpose for introducing the videotape, while the record does not reveal whether the State had been informed that Wright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>would, in fact, identify appellant at trial, the purpose may not be determined from the sequence of the receipt of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">.

Although appellant points to this ruling in support of his claim regarding \"implicit\u201d identification, appellant failed to object when the court ruled that the detective could refer \u201cto the individual depicted\u201d and did not request a curative instruction or additional action by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\">. The term <em>\u201cAllen </em>charge\u201d is derived from <em>Allen v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896). In <em>Allen, </em>the Supreme Court approved the use of a jury instruction which specifically asked the jury to conciliate their differences and reach a verdict. In the years following the decision, the <em>Allen </em>instruction came under increasing criticism by state and federal courts on the grounds that the charge was coercive and intruded upon the function of the jury. <em>See Huffman v. United States, </em>297 F.2d 754, 759 (5th Cir.1962) (Designed to achieve jury unanimity in deadlock situations, the instruction has been referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to as the \"dynamite\u201d or \"nitroglycerin\u201d charge.). Courts, in establishing parameters for an <em>Allen </em>instruction have employed different language to convey the spirit of the charge. For this reason, the Court of Appeals has referred to such an instruction or one merely reminding the jury of its responsibilities as an \"Allen-type\u201d charge. <em>Kelly v. State, </em>270 Md. 139, 140 n. 1, 310 A.2d 538 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\">.
