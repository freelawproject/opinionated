At a motions hearing, appellant moved to suppress the evidence seized during the traffic stop and the statements that he made to the police. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge took the case under advisement and, thereafter, issued a written opinion denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Appellant entered into an agreement with the State to proceed on an agreed statement of facts as to one count of unlawfully bringing a controlled dangerous substance into the State. The trial judge found the agreed facts sufficient to establish a factual basis for the charge and entered a verdict of guilty. On November 29, 2006, appellant was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 incarceration. The State entered a <em>nolle pros </em>to the remaining counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the physical evidence. Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">On August 16, 2006, the hearing on the motion to suppress was held. Trooper Jeremiah Gussoni of the Maryland State Police, Centreville Barrack, was the only witness to testify. Based on his testimony, the following facts were adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">On December 20, 2005, at 11:40 p.m., Trooper Gussoni was traveling on Route 301 southbound in Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland when he observed a Chevy pickup truck driving erratically. Trooper Gussoni testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">I observed that the vehicle would be [sic] traveling in lane one, the fast lane, would go across the edge line, back over the center line, the divided white line, into lane two, across the edge line, back into lane one; made several erratic moves like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">At one point, two vehicles actually had to take evasive maneuvers to keep from being struck. I paced the vehicle about a half mile. [It] [w]as actually traveling down the center of both the lanes. I then activated my emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The vehicle pulled over onto the right-hand shoulder of Route 301, a short distance before the 101 mile marker. It was very dark outside, and Trooper Gussoni described the area as \u201cpoorly lit.\u201d Trooper Gussoni observed two individuals in the vehicle, a driver and a front-seat passenger. When Trooper Gussoni approached the stopped vehicle, he advised the driver of his name and the reason for the stop. The driver apologized, explaining that the reason for his erratic driving was that he was tired. The driver identified himself as Hugh Collins Hines and appellant as his passenger. Appellant stated that it was his vehicle and that he was not carrying any identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">During the stop, Trooper Gussoni observed that both Hines and appellant were nervous. In particular, Trooper Gussoni noticed that appellant, who was \u201cstaring straight, wouldn\u2019t look at me, was just\u2014just appeared to me to be out of it.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Trooper Gussoni returned to his vehicle and initiated a driver\u2019s license check on the status of Hines\u2019s license as well as a \u201ccheck on both men.\u201d While sitting in his vehicle, Trooper Gussoni could see into appellant\u2019s vehicle, which was illuminated by the trooper\u2019s \u201cmulti-patrol vehicle spot light.\u201d Trooper Gussoni saw appellant \u201cbending down, bending over. I could see him twisting his body. He made several movements like that. At that point, appearing that he might have been retrieving a weapon, I requested backup,\u201d which was approximately 15 to 20 minutes away.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Trooper Gussoni exited his patrol car, \u201cwent to the rear of [his] vehicle as not to cross [the vehicle\u2019s] high beam light,\u201d and walked up to the passenger side of the stopped pickup truck. Trooper Gussoni \u201cstood just behind the passenger side window,\u201d where he \u201cobserved [appellant] reaching underneath his seat and then behind his seat into a gym bag.\u201d The gym bag was \u201ca standard gym bag, two and a half feet by a foot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>and a half\u2019 and \u201cundoubtedly\u201d large enough to hold a weapon. Trooper Gussoni testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">At that point, I knocked on the window and spoke with [appellant]. I asked him what he was reaching for in the bag. I observed that the driver was now smoking a cigarette. [Appellant] had advised me that he was looking for cigarettes. I said, well, [appellant], are there any cigarettes in the bag and he said, well, no. I said what are you doing going into that bag. Again, figuring he had some type of weapon in there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Appellant\u2019s nervous movements made Trooper Gussoni fearful that, based on his training at the State Police Academy, appellant had a weapon. Trooper Gussoni described appellant\u2019s movements as \u201cindicative of someone trying to hide an item or retrieving a weapon or hiding a weapon.\u201d Trooper Gussoni elaborated: \u201cA normal person is not going to reach underneath a seat, reach behind his seat into a bag and, then, when you ask about his [sic] contents, he is quickly moving away from that bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Because of his belief that \u201cthere was a weapon in the bag or [appellant] had secreted one,\u201d Trooper Gussoni asked appellant to exit the vehicle and bring the bag with him. Hines remained in the driver\u2019s seat while Trooper Gussoni directed appellant to \u201ccome to the rear of the vehicle, along with the bag.\u201d When asked \u201cWhy did you have [appellant] bring the bag out [of the car]?,\u201d Trooper Gussoni responded: \u201c[F]rom the initial point of the traffic point [sic] how [appellant] was acting, the movements into the bag. I believe he had placed a weapon in there. It would be foolish of me to leave a bag with a weapon with another person in a vehicle with me outside.\u201d Trooper Gussoni further explained: \u201cI was going to search the bag for a weapon. I was going to make sure there wasn\u2019t a gun in there or a knife or something that would harm me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">When appellant reached the rear of the vehicle, Trooper Gussoni expressed to appellant his fear that appellant was retrieving a weapon or hiding a weapon in the bag. Appellant responded: \u201c[N]o, there\u2019s no weapons in there,\u201d after which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Trooper Gussoni asked appellant to open the bag. Appellant opened the bag \u201cextremely wide from the top and the sides,\u201d and Trooper Gussoni observed several prescription bottles, personal hygiene items, clothing, used syringes, and a torn plastic baggy containing white powdery residue. Trooper Gussoni described the syringes: \u201cYou could tell from the syringes that they had been used. Some were partly drawn back. There was dry blood in there\u2014what appeared to be dried blood at that point[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Based on his training and expertise, Trooper Gussoni believed that the torn baggy was drug paraphernalia containing either cocaine or heroin, because \u201c[tjhose are drugs that are heavily ... injected into the body.\u201d When backup arrived, Trooper Gussoni placed appellant under arrest and performed a search incident to arrest of appellant\u2019s person and the pickup truck. Several torn plastic baggies of powdery residue were found in the front pocket of appellant\u2019s jeans. Recovered from the vehicle were several torn plastic baggies, a spoon with residue on one side and burn marks on the other side, a syringe left in the glove box, 20 packages of mannite, an agent commonly used for cutting narcotics, and numerous bloody towels.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The gym bag was transported to the police barracks where it was searched further. Trooper Gussoni found two knotted plastic baggies containing 55.5 grams of a brownish substance, later determined to be heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the motions judge took the case under advisement and, on September 7, 2006, issued a written opinion denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the physical evidence and the statements that he made to the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the motions court stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Trooper Gussoni had reasonable articulable suspicion that [appellant] was armed and dangerous, thereby allowing him to conduct a frisk of [appellant], and of the gym bag. Trooper Gussoni described that at the time of the stop it was dark, late at night; the Trooper was conducting a traffic stop whereby he received an out of state driver\u2019s license from the driver who did not own the vehicle; the passenger in the right front passenger seat owned the car but was not driving it; the same passenger seemed \u201cout of it\u201d; [appellant] was making furtive gestures towards the rear seat of the car, and the gym bag was in the rear seat. [Appellant] was reaching for it during the traffic stop, and the bag was large enough to hold a handgun. These are not the inchoate, unparticularized facts present in <em>Derricott [v. State, </em>327 Md. 582, 611 A.2d 592 (1992) ] or <em>Payne [v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 566, 501 A.2d 484 (1985) ]. The Trooper here observed what he considered furtive gestures, suspicious activity by the passenger, in particular, while effectuating the stop and attempting to obtain information from and about the driver and passenger, which led him to believe that [appellant] possessed a weapon which might have harmed him. As in <em>Matoumba [v. State, </em>162 Md.App. 39, 873 A.2d 386 (2005) ], Trooper Gussoni acted as a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances and was warranted in the belief that his safety was in danger. Upon re-approaching the car, on the passenger side, he observed [appellant] reaching for the bag. [Appellant] indicated, when questioned about the bag and his activities, that he wanted a cigarette but stated that there were none in the bag. It was then that the officer had [appellant] exit the vehicle with the bag. \u201cWhen a police officer lawfully conducting a protective search reasonably believes a gun is concealed in the detainee\u2019s bag, the officer remains vulnerable and in danger if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>bag is returned and the detainee released at the conclusion of the investigative stop. It would be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.\u201d <em>Jordan [v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 528, 531 A.2d 1028 (1987) ]. Quite similarly, if Trooper Gussoni had taken a different course of action and allowed [appellant] to reenter the vehicle without further investigation into what he believed contained a weapon, the threat would not have been neutralized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">The Trooper\u2019s order to [appellant] that he get out of the vehicle and for him to bring the bag with him was a protective \u2018frisk\u2019 of the passenger and the item, specifically narrowed in. scope to the specific bag which the Trooper believed contained the weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">The Court finds the testimony of the Trooper fully credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">Consequently, the evidence obtained from [appellant\u2019s] gym bag and from any searches of [appellant\u2019s] person or automobile ... will not be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">On October 5, 2006, appellant entered into an agreement with the State to proceed on an agreed statement of facts as to one count of unlawfully bringing a controlled dangerous substance into the State. At a hearing on October 10, 2006, the judge found that the agreed facts were sufficient to establish a factual basis for the charge and entered a verdict of guilty. On November 29, 2006, appellant was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 incarceration. The State entered a nolle prosse to the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Appellant timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In <em>Hoerauf v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 292, 306, 941 A.2d 1161 (2008), we recently discussed the appropriate standard for reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">When reviewing a circuit court\u2019s disposition of a motion to suppress evidence, we \u201cconsider only the facts and information contained in the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 498, 924 A.2d 1129 (2007). \u201c \u2018[W]e view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion,\u2019 \u201d in this case, the State. <em>Owens v. State, </em>399 Md. 388, 403, 924 A.2d 1072 (2007) (quoting <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439 (2003)). We defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings and uphold them unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>We also make our \u201c\u2018own independent constitutional appraisal,\u2019 \u201d by reviewing the relevant law and applying it to the facts and circumstances of this particular case. <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 499, 924 A.2d 1129 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>343 Md. 448, 457, 682 A.2d 248 (1996)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Appellant maintains that the search of the gym bag was unlawful because it was \u201cconducted without a warrant, without probable cause, and without authority under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889[ ] (1968) ... since there were no facts to suggest that [appellant] was armed.\u201d Consequently, appellant contends that the motions court should have suppressed the physical evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is made applicable to the State of Maryland through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Mapp v. Ohio, </em>867 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <em>Owens v. State, </em>322 Md. 616, 622, 589 A.2d 59 (1991), and \u201cprotects against unreasonable searches and seizures, including seizures that involve only a brief detention.\u201d <em>Stokes v. State, </em>362 Md. 407, 414, 765 A.2d 612 (2001). \u201cIt is fundamental, under Federal and Maryland jurisprudence, that the detention of a motorist pursuant to a police traffic stop is a seizure encompassed by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Farewell v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 540, 562, 822 A.2d 513 (2003); <em>see United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985); <em>State v. Green, </em>375 Md. 595, 609, 826 A.2d 486 (2003); <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 432, 769 A.2d 879 (2001); <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 369, 735 A.2d 491 (1999); <em>Edwards v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 155, 164, 792 A.2d 1197 (2002). Such a stop, however, does not initially violate the federal Constitution if the police have probable cause to believe that the driver has committed a traffic violation. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Furthermore, an officer making a traffic stop may order the passengers to get out of the car pending completion of the stop, because the \u201cdanger to an officer from a traffic stop[, which] is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver,\u201d outweighs the \u201cminimal\u201d intrusion on the passenger. <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 414-15, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201cAlthough warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable, because the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.\u201d <em>In re Calvin S., </em>175 Md.App. 516, 528, 930 A.2d 1099 (2007) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Madison-Sheppard v. State, </em>177 Md.App. 165, 173, 934 A.2d 1046 (2007) (\u201cThis constitutional guarantee is subject only to a few limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>exceptions when the search or seizure is \u2018conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation omitted)) (quoting <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 372, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993) (footnote omitted)) (quoting <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">One of the exceptions to the warrant requirement was announced in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In <em>Terry, </em>the United States Supreme Court authorized police officers to conduct brief, investigatory stops of persons without a warrant or probable cause to arrest, so long as the officer has reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed, has been committed, or is about to be committed by the individual stopped. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Further, under <em>Terry, </em>when an officer justifiably believes that an individual is armed and presently dangerous, the officer may conduct a pat down search of an individual to determine whether the individual is carrying a weapon. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">[Wjhere a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or others\u2019 safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him. Such a search is a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment, and any weapons seized may properly be introduced in evidence against the person from whom they were taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIv\"><em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Thus the purpose of a protective search under <em>Terry </em>is not to discover evidence of a crime; rather, it allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>an officer to conduct an investigation without fear of violence. <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 373, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). Accordingly, \u201c[i]f the protective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under <em>Terry </em>and its fruits will be suppressed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1049, 1053, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983), the Supreme Court extended the reach of the <em>Terry </em>stop and frisk, holding that, in the context of a roadside encounter, a police officer may conduct a protective search for weapons not only of an individual, but also of the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In <em>Long, </em>two deputy police officers were on patrol one evening when they noticed a car \u201ctraveling erratically and at excessive speed,\u201d eventually turning onto a side road and swerving into a ditch. <em>Id. </em>at 1035, 103 S.Ct. 3469. When the deputies approached the car to investigate, the driver and only occupant of the automobile met the officers at the rear of the vehicle, \u201cwhich was protruding from the ditch onto the road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1035-36, 103 S.Ct. 3469. The driver\u2019s door was left open. <em>Id. </em>at 1036, 103 S.Ct. 3469. The driver did not respond to the initial requests for his license or registration, and according to one of the deputies, \u201cappeared to be under the influence of something.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1036, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (internal quotation omitted). Having produced his license, the driver was asked again for his registration, after which he turned from the officers and walked toward the open driver\u2019s door of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Walking behind the driver, the officers observed a large hunting knife on the floorboard of the car. <em>Id. </em>The officers stopped the driver and subjected him to a <em>Terry </em>protective pat down, but recovered no weapons. <em>Id. </em>One of the deputies then proceeded to search the vehicle for other weapons by shining his flashlight into the car without entering the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>When the officer noticed something protruding from under the front armrest, the officer knelt in the vehicle, lifted the armrest, and discovered an open pouch on the front seat. <em>Id. </em>Upon shining his flash light on the pouch, the officer saw that it contained what appeared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>marijuana. <em>Id. </em>The driver was arrested for possession of marijuana. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In considering whether a police officer may conduct a Terry-type search of the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle during a lawful investigatory stop of the occupant, the Court in <em>Long </em>emphasized a police officer\u2019s interest in self-protection and the protection of others. <em>Id. </em>at 1047-52, 103 S.Ct. 3469. The Court observed that \u201cinvestigative detentions involving suspects in vehicles are especially fraught with danger to police officers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1047, 103 S.Ct. 3469, that \u201csuspects may injure police officers and others by virtue of their access to weapons, even though they may not themselves be armed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1048, 103 S.Ct. 3469, and that \u201c[i]f a suspect is \u2018dangerous,\u2019 he is no less dangerous simply because he is not arrested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1050, 103 S.Ct. 3469. In particular, the Court stressed that, when a stop \u201cinvolves a police investigation \u2018at close range,\u2019 \u201d the police officer \u201cremains particularly vulnerable in part <em>because </em>a full custodial arrest has not been effected, and the officer must make a \u201cquick decision as to how to protect himself and others from possible danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1052, 103 S.Ct. 3469. The Court further opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">Our past cases indicate then that protection of police and others can justify protective searches when police have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses a danger, that roadside encounters between police and suspects are especially hazardous, and that danger may arise from the possible presence of weapons in the area surrounding a suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The Court held that the police may search the passenger compartment of an automobile, \u201climited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden[ ] ... if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u2019 the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1049-50, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Turning to the facts before it, the Court concluded that the deputies had a reasonable belief that the defendant \u201cposed a danger if he were permitted to reenter his vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1050, 103 S.Ct. 3469.

This process allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person. Although an officer\u2019s reliance on a mere hunch is insufficient to justify a stop, the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\"><em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274-75, 122 S.Ct. 744 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The totality of the circumstances test was explained by former Chief Justice Burger in <em>United States v.

First, the assessment must be based upon all the circumstances. The analysis proceeds with various objective observations, information from police reports, if such are available, and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From these data, a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions-inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">The process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same-and so are law enforcement officers. Finally, the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">The second element contained in the idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion is the concept that the process just described must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.

Both officers exited their cruiser and approached the vehicle, one officer went to the driver\u2019s side and the other to the passenger side. <em>Id. </em>The officer who approached the passenger side observed the conduct of the appellant, who was seated in the right rear passenger seat. <em>Id. </em>According to that officer, the appellant \u201crepeatedly looked back at the police cruiser\u201d during the stop, \u201cappeared to dip his right shoulder down toward the floor as [the officer] approached,\u201d \u201cplaced his right hand behind his back as [the officer] [] reached the rear passenger side,\u201d \u201cmaintained constant eye contact with [the officer],\u201d and \u201cdemonstrated visibly shaking hands when commanded to show them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When all of the occupants were ordered out of the vehicle and the appellant was frisked, one of the officers discovered a handgun in the appellant\u2019s back pocket. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In considering whether the trial court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, we addressed the appellant\u2019s argument that the officer\u2019s frisk was invalid'under the Fourth Amendment, \u201cbecause the officer lacked a reasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 873 A.2d 386.

Thereafter, the officer asked the appellant to step out of the vehicle and to remove the black bag. <em>Id. </em>After patting the exterior of the bag and feeling the outline of a handgun, the officer opened the bag and discovered a handgun, cartridges, and a marijuana cigarette. <em>Id. </em>at 569, 501 A.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Reviewing the constitutionality of the frisk, this Court concluded that the record contained \u201cabsolutely no \u2018specific and articulable facts\u2019 from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that [the appellant] was armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 501 A.2d 484.

How anyone can reasonably deduce from those facts that [the appellant] had a gun totally eludes us, unless [the officer] was clairvoyant. [The officer] might just as easily have concluded that [the appellant] had placed on the floor of the car narcotics, or pornographic matter, or receipts of a \u2018numbers\u2019 pickup, or money or jewelry.

The traffic stop was initiated late at night, in a very dark and \u201cpoorly lit\u201d area. The trooper was alone on the shoulder of the road, about 15 to 20 minutes from any backup, and two individuals occupied the stopped pick up truck. The trooper observed that <em>both </em>the driver and appellant were nervous and appellant appeared to be \u201cout of it.\u201d When Trooper Gussoni returned to his patrol vehicle, he saw appellant bending down and twisting his body several times. For fear that appellant was retrieving a weapon, Trooper Gussoni requested backup. When he approached the passenger side of the vehicle, Trooper Gussoni observed appellant reaching underneath his seat and then behind his seat into a gym bag. When asked what he was reaching for in the gym bag, appellant said that he was looking for cigarettes. But when the trooper asked him whether there were cigarettes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>bag, appellant said no\u2014an answer that Trooper Gussoni interpreted as contradictory. Trooper Gussoni explained that a normal person would not reach underneath his or her seat, then behind the seat into a bag, and, when asked about the contents, \u201cquickly mov[e] away from the bag.\u201d Based on his training at the State Police Academy, Trooper Gussoni formed a belief that appellant had a weapon, because appellant\u2019s movements were indicative of someone \u201cretrieving a weapon or hiding a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In light of the trial court\u2019s finding that Trooper Gussoni\u2019s testimony was \u201cfully credible,\u201d we conclude that the record contains sufficient specific and articulable facts from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that appellant was armed and dangerous and that a weapon may have been placed or hidden in the gym bag, which was in the passenger compartment and large enough to contain a weapon. Accordingly, under the teachings of Long and its progeny, Trooper Gussoni was permitted to order appellant to exit the vehicle with the gym bag and to conduct a Terry-type search of the bag for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The Search Without a Pat Down</p>\n<p id=\"APA\">Appellant also challenges the scope of Trooper Gussoni\u2019s <em>Terry-type </em>search of the gym bag, arguing that \u201ca search of a container is not permissible when its characteristics permit the law enforcement officer to pat it down to determine if a weapon is inside.\u201d Under <em>Terry </em>and <em>Long, </em>appellant contends that, if Trooper Gussoni suspected that the gym bag contained a weapon, \u201che should have separated [appellant] from the bag,\u201d and patted down the outside of the bag for weapons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The Supreme Court in <em>Long </em>\u201chad no occasion to consider whether, if the container is soft, a \u2018pat down\u2019 of it and discovery of a hard object within are prerequisites to search into the container, just as is true of [a] search of the suspect\u2019s person.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, 4 Search And Seizure: A Treatise On The Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.6 (4th ed.2004). Nevertheless, in <em>United States v. Shranklen, </em>315 F.3d 959 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Fleming v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 971, 123 S.Ct. 1774, 155 L.Ed.2d 529 (2003), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that, during a traffic stop where a police officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that an occupant of the vehicle is armed and dangerous, the officer is \u201cnot constitutionally required to pat down\u201d a container found in the passenger compartment prior to opening and inspecting it. 315 F.3d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In <em>Shranklen, </em>the container was a black pouch that was retrieved by the police officer from under the front passenger seat. <em>Id. </em>at 960. The officer opened the pouch, searching for weapons, but instead found new and used syringes and illegal drugs. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated that \u201ca person\u2019s privacy interest in an item such as a pouch, while protected by the Fourth Amendment, is not sacrosanct during an investigative traffic stop and must be balanced against the inherent risk of danger to officers at such stops.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 964 (citation omitted). The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">Had the black pouch contained a weapon, there is no guarantee that merely feeling the pouch would have led [the police officer] to discover the weapon. For example, some type of padding could have enveloped the weapon, or the weapon could have been a pocket knife with an unexposed blade. It was therefore reasonable for [the police officer] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>open the pouch in order to inspect for weapons with his sense of sight and not solely with his sense of touch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvN\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Finally, the Court noted the similarity of the facts in <em>Shmnklen </em>with those in <em>Long, </em>and stated that \u201cthe Supreme Court gave no indication that the officers should have patted down the pouch first.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Similarly, by way of <em>dicta, </em>this Court has interpreted <em>Long </em>as not requiring an officer to first pat down a container found in the passenger compartment that may contain a weapon. <em>Watkins v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 437, 444-45, 601 A.2d 1115, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 80, 607 A.2d 921 (1992). We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">By virtue of this rule, when the police legally stop a person in an automobile, the police may \u201cfrisk\u201d the automobile for weapons provided the police have reason to believe that a weapon is in the car, the police have reason to believe that the suspect is dangerous, and the police confine their search to areas of the passenger compartment \u201cin which a weapon may be placed or hidden.\u201d When in the course of such a search a container is found, the police may open and inspect the container without first patting it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We find the reasoning of <em>Shranklen </em>to be persuasive. There simply is no assurance that merely feeling the outside of a container, which is capable of being physically manipulated, will reveal the presence of a weapon located inside. Only opening and inspecting the container will definitively remove the potential threat to the officer\u2019s safety. In addition, a constitutional rule requiring a pat down first of all containers will encounter practical difficulties in the field when a police officer is confronted with a container with both hard and soft sides, such as certain gym bags and back packs.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Finally, under the circumstances of the case <em>sub judice, </em>Trooper Gussoni\u2019s safety would have been compromised if he had been required to pat down the gym bag instead of directing appellant to open it. The traffic stop took place late at night in a poorly lighted area, with Trooper Gussoni the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>only officer on the scene and backup about 15 to 20 minutes away. He had to control two nervous occupants of a vehicle, one of whom he came to reasonably believe was armed and dangerous. Trooper Gussoni also held the reasonable belief that there was a weapon in the gym bag located directly behind appellant in the vehicle. For Trooper Gussoni to have patted down the bag, he would have had to use his hands, thereby exposing his service weapon and inviting possible attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Therefore, we transform the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Watkins </em>into a holding that, when a <em>Terry-type </em>search for weapons of the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle is constitutionally permitted and, during such search, a container is found in which a weapon may have been placed or hidden, a police officer may open and inspect the container without first patting it down. Accordingly, Trooper Gussoni did not violate appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when he directed appellant to open the gym bag without first patting it down. Under <em>Long, </em>when a valid Terry-type search for weapons results in the discovery of illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia, the officer need not ignore the contraband, and \u201cthe Fourth Amendment does not require its suppression in such circumstances.\u201d <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. at 1050, 103 S.Ct. 3469.
