This matter is before us on appeal by plaintiff Pazir Mohammad from the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants Toyota Motor Sales USA (\u201cToyota\u201d), Darcars of Cherry Hill, Inc., and Aseer Mohammad. The defendants are the manufacturer, retail dealer, and the owner of the 2003 Toyota Tundra truck that was involved in the accident. Appellant was the driver of the Tundra at the time of the accident, and was seriously injured as a result. A passenger lost his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">On appeal, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment. The key to this appeal is whether the absence of an expert as to the presence of a defect or causation corrodes appellant\u2019s case. The circuit court ruled that it did, and, under the circumstances found here, we affirm the entry of summary judgment as to all defendants in all respects for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"ARR\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The indispensable facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant, are these. Appellee, Aseer Mohammad (\u201cAseer\u201d), is the appellant\u2019s brother and the Tundra\u2019s owner. On December 4, 2002, Aseer, accompanied by appellant, purchased a new 2003 Toyota Tundra pickup truck from Darcars of Cherry Hill Road, Inc. He allowed only appellant to drive the Tundra.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On December 27, 2002, appellant took the Tundra to the Darcars service department, complaining that the truck seemed to pull to the left. After an inspection, Darcars\u2019s mechanics told appellant that they found no mechanical, structural, or other defects with the Tundra and instead attributed the phenomenon to uneven tire pressure. Appellant took the truck, and later called Darcars back to complain that the problem continued. Although Darcars said that it would arrange to have a Toyota engineer or field representative call him to schedule another inspection of the truck, appellant claims that no one from Darcars contacted him again. Appellant continued to drive the Tundra because the dealer assured him that the truck had no mechanical, structural, or other defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">On February 15, 2003, appellant, who owned a construction company, drove the Tundra to a job site in Silver Spring. His brother .Aseer and another brother accompanied him. A friend, Mr. Khalid Mahmoud, came to the job site and asked for a ride to Dulles International Airport to see a relative. Appellant and he then left for the airport, and stayed there a short time. At about 3:50 p.m., they were returning to Maryland, had just left the parking lot at the Dulles International Airport, and were pulling away from a toll booth heading eastbound on the access road when the Tundra began to accelerate without warning.- The accelerator appeared to be stuck, and when appellant pushed, the accelerator went \u201call the way down.\u201d Appellant checked to make sure the cruise control had not engaged, opened his side window, and waved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>his arm to alert drivers in front of him to get out of the way. After four miles of travel, appellant applied the brakes and heard a breaking sound coming from the engine compartment. The Tundra veered to the left, crossed the median strip, hit a Jersey barrier, and rolled on its side. Appellant was severely injured, and Mr. Mahmoud was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The summary judgment record includes these additional facts. In August 2005, Toyota issued a \u201cSafety Recall Notice\u201d\u2014SSC 50J. The notice represented that \u201cToyota has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in the Front Suspension Lower Ball Joint of certain 2002 through early 2004 Tundra and Sequoia vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Appellant deposed three Toyota experts-Steven Fen-ton, P.E., Robert M. Landis, and Donald F. Tandy, Jr.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Landis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>inspected the Tundra and testified that the \u201cleft side ball joint ... on this vehicle is still intact, feels good, works properly and is not a separated ball joint, which is the phenomenon associated with the recall.... [T]he ball joint is in excellent shape.\u201d Landis opined that the steering components did not break until after the truck hit the Jersey barrier or when it rolled over:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">Q. Did you notice whether any portions of the steering or suspension system on the left side were no longer in working order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">A. Yes. The steering knuckle on the left side is bolted to the housing that the ball joint is in. There\u2019s four bolts that hold it and those four bolts were sheared in the impact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">And there has been some distortion to all the pieces in the suspension on the left side I would say as a result of impact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">... [Tjhey\u2019re broken, they had tensile failure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">Q. Do you have an opinion as to how the bolts broke or what caused the bolts to break?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">A. I have a preliminary opinion. I would want to see the reconstruction to have a complete opinion, but the bolts could have broke as a result of the impact with the median or they could have broke as a result of the rollover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>... [T]he vehicle came to rest, then the bolts broke.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Toyota expert Donald Tandy testified that the \u201cphysical evidence is consistent with both ball joints performing properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">On February 10, 2006, appellant filed this products liability action seeking damages from seven corporate defendants under theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and breach of express warranty. He also alleged that his brother, Aseer Mohammad, as the owner and bailor of the Tundra, was negligent by \u201cfailing to inspect and maintain\u201d the Tundra and by otherwise permitting appellant to drive a vehicle that was defective and unsafe. After certain defendants were dismissed on July 31, 2006, this case proceeded against Toyota, Darcars, and Aseer Mohammad.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">On May 12, 2006, the trial court issued a \u201cScheduling and Pretrial Order.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-504.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Order required, <em>inter alia, </em>that the parties disclose their experts by July 26, 2006. An Amended Scheduling Order reset this due date to September 15, 2006. Appellant did not identify any expert who would address the issue of liability or the presence of a manufacturing or design defect, and did not submit any expert report or opinion with respect to these issues. Discovery closed without any designation by appellant of a liability or defect expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">On January 16, 2007, each defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. The circuit court held a hearing on these motions on March 7, 2007. Ruling from the bench after hearing argument, the circuit court entered judgment in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>of the defendants on all counts. The court held that, without expert opinion or testimony with respect to the existence of a defect, there was insufficient evidence to go to the jury on the strict liability, negligence, and implied warranty counts. As to the breach of express warranty count, the court entered summary judgment because there was no allegation of an actionable express statement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The common thread in the circuit court\u2019s analysis of the strict liability, negligence, and implied warranty counts was appellant\u2019s failure to identify an expert witness who by testimony or report would offer an opinion with respect to a design or manufacturing defect an d the role such defect would have played in causing the accident and resulting injuries. The court noted that \u201cproof of a defect must rise above, surmise, conjecture, or speculation. And there is no right to recovery based on any presumption from the mere happening of an accident.\u201d This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">A. Introduction: Choice of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The accident took place in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Maryland, unlike most other States, continues to adhere to the <em>lex loci delicti </em>principle set forth in the Restatement, Conflict Of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 378-390. <em>Laboratory Corporation of America v. Hood, </em>395 Md. 608, 615, 911 A.2d 841 (2006). <em>See Farwell v. Un, </em>902 F.2d 282, 286 (4th Cir.1990). <em>See also Carter v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 791, 794 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cMaryland ... adheres to the old-fashioned conflicts principle of <em>\u2018lex loci </em>delicti.\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1111, 124 S.Ct. 1078, 157 L.Ed.2d 899 (2004). Thus, \u201cwhere the events giving rise to a tort action occur in more than one State, we apply the law of the State where the injury\u2014the last event required to constitute the tort\u2014occurred.\u201d <em>Laboratory Corporation of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>America v. Hood, </em>395 Md. at 615, 911 A.2d 841 (citing cases). But while substantive law of Virginia would be applied, \u201cits application to the facts presented in the forum court is to be determined in accordance with the rules of evidence, inference and judgment of the forum State.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 616, 911 A.2d 841. Accordingly, \u201cMaryland law ... controls as to the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, the inferences from it to go to the jury and other procedural matters.\u201d <em>Vernon v. Aubinoe, </em>259 Md. 159, 162, 269 A.2d 620 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">At issue is the propriety of the circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of TMS, Darcars and Pazir Mohammad. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-501(a), \u201c[a]ny party may file at anytime a motion for summary judgment ... on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 2\u2014501(f) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The role of summary judgment is to \u201c \u2018pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushita Electric Industries Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the circuit court does not resolve disputed issues of fact but \u201cmakes rulings as a matter of law[.]\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993). <em>See Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, LLC, </em>402 Md. 281, 294, 936 A.2d 343 (2007). Because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">this case was decided on summary judgment, there have not yet been factual findings by a judge or jury, and [appellant\u2019s] version of events (unsurprisingly) differs substantially from [appellees\u2019] version. When things are in such a posture, courts are required to view the facts and draw reasonable inferences \u201cin the light most favorable to the party opposing the [summary judgment] motion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\"><em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962) (per curiam)). <em>See Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 676, 766 A.2d 617 (2001) (reciting standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>We evaluate the facts and pleadings employing the same standard as does the circuit court, and will not defer to that court\u2019s conclusions of law. Because we must determine whether the circuit court was legally correct, our review over a circuit court\u2019s decision on summary judgment, therefore, is plenary. <em>Hemmings v. Pelham Wood Ltd. Liab. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>375 Md. 522, 533, 826 A.2d 443 (2003); <em>Carter v.

The \u201cmoving party must set forth sufficient grounds for summary judgment,\u201d <em>Davis v. Goodman, </em>117 Md.App. 378, 392, 700 A.2d 798 (1997), and the movant is responsible for informing the circuit court of the basis for its motion and for identifying deficiencies in the pleadings and record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact. <em>Bond v. NIBCO, Inc., </em>96 Md.App. 127, 136, 623 A.2d 731 (1993) (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). The party opposing a motion for summary judgment must produce admissible evidence to show a genuine dispute of material fact, and offer more than \u201c \u2018conclusory statements, conjecture, or speculation [which] will not defeat summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter v. Aramark, </em>153 Md.App. at 225, 835 A.2d 262 (citations omitted). Summary judgment is the \u201c \u2018put up or shut up\u2019 moment in a lawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would convince the trier-of-fact to accept its version of events.\u201d <em>Schacht v. Wisconsin Department of Corrections, </em>175 F.3d 497, 504 (7th Cir.1999), disapproved on other grounds, <em>Higgins v. Mississippi, </em>217 F.3d 951 (7th Cir.2000). There \u201cmust be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Crickenberger v. Hyundai Motor America, </em>404 Md. 37, 45, 944 A.2d 1136 (2008). The Court of Appeals reminds us that undisputed material facts that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>susceptible of more than one inference should go to the jury. <em>See Hill v. Cross Country, </em>402 Md. at 294, 936 A.2d 343 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">C. Expert Testimony or Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The theory of strict liability in tort is set forth in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) Of Torts (1965). The Court of Appeals adopted for Maryland the strict liability formula of Section 402A in <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A.2d 955 (1976). Section 402A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQo\">Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm to User or Consumer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his [or her] property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his [or her] property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his [or her] product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-13\">Judge Bloom pointed out for this Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-14\">Basically, to recover in a strict liability case, a plaintiff need not prove any specific act of negligence; he must merely prove that the product was in a defective condition and unreasonably dangerous at the time it was sold. The defect may be one that occurred in the manufacturing process, in which case the product does not conform to the manufacturer\u2019s own standards, or it may be a defect in design, in which case what proves to be a defect was actually intended by the manufacturer. With respect to the former, the focus is on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the conduct of the manufacturer; with respect to the latter, the inquiry focuses on the product itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><em>Klein v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>92 Md.App. 477, 484, 608 A.2d 1276, <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 447, 614 A.2d 973 (1992). Maryland \u201cespoused the doctrine of strict liability in tort in order to relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving specific acts of negligence by permitting negligence to be implied where plaintiffs can prove a product is defective and unreasonably dangerous when placed in the stream of commerce.\u201d <em>Nissen Carp. v. Miller, </em>323 Md. 613, 624, 594 A.2d 564 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The Commercial Law Article respectively defines express warranty and the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u00a7 2-313.

Implied warranty; merchantability; usage of trade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(1) Unless excluded or modified (\u00a7 2-316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-11\">(2) Goods to b e merchantable must b e at least such as ...

The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. The dispositive point was that the collapse of the concrete slab was a phenomenon within the general expertise and knowledge of ordinary reasonable jurors, and that an expert was unnecessary to illustrate this obvious point. The Court considered it to be a matter of common knowledge that concrete structures require steel reinforcement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201cIt is a matter of general knowledge that concrete is strong in resisting compression strains and weak in withstanding tensile strains.

American Motors Corp., </em>50 Md.App. 226, 437 A.2d 242 (1981), is on point. As in the case <em>sub judice, Jensen </em>involved a single vehicle accident that resulted in the death of the passenger and injury to the driver. The driver was traveling in a 1976 Custom Jeep along Maryland Route 213 when the Jeep \u201cswerved to the left a couple of times[.]\u201d The driver stopped a couple of times to investigate, but detected nothing wrong with the vehicle. The weather was clear, the road was dry, and the Jeep proceeded at about 55 miles per hour. Just before the accident, the driver \u201chear[d] the tires squealing. It sounded like it came from the left side.\u201d The driver attempted without success to control the Jeep, and the vehicle rolled over three or four times, resulting in the injuries noted above. <em>Id. </em>at 228, 437 A.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The wrecked Jeep was taken to the owners property, where it remained for at least six months. Two months after the accident, the owners received a recall notice from American Motors Sales Corporation which provided that \u201c[o]n some of the subject vehicles the bolts that secure the steering gear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>bracket to the frame may lose them torque.\u201d No one inspected the Jeep on behalf of the plaintiffs. The defendant\u2019s \u201cinspectors\u201d represented that they \u201cfound no defect in steering gear or running gear of this vehicle to cause loss of control of the vehicle[,]\u201d although they detected \u201csome play and a noise in the steering gear which they attributed to the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 437 A.2d 242. We affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The victims\u2019 mother, individually and acting as the personal representative and next friend of the injured minor survivor, sued the owners of the Jeep and American Motors on theories of strict liability, negligence and breach of warranty. The defendants filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted by the circuit court. The plaintiffs appealed, and at the outset declared in their opening brief that they \u201cdo not have direct evidence per se of any specific defective part in the steering mechanism ... [and] rely upon the circumstantial evidence presented above which logically leads to the conclusion that the steering mechanism was defective.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Judge Moore began the dissection for this Court by observing that \u201c \u2018[t]he bare fact that an accident happens to a product ... is usually not sufficient proof that it was in any way defective____ On the other hand, the addition of very little more in the way of other facts, ... may be enough to support the inference....\u2019\u201d <em>Jensen v. American Motors Corp., </em>50 Md.App. at 229, 437 A.2d 242 (quoting W.L. Prosser, <em>The Fall of the Citadel, </em>50 Minn. L.Rev. 791, 840-44 (1966)). In affirming the circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, we were unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that there was a reasonably permissible inference from the facts shown that the Jeep was defective. The absence of expert testimony to support the plaintiffs\u2019 case in <em>Jensen </em>undermined their case. Judge Moore concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">In this case there is a complete absence of essential facts from which an inference of a defect may reasonably be drawn. The driver, Samuel Teate, heard a squeal in the tires and lost control. There was no testimony that the steering mechanism locked or failed nor that the vehicle behaved erratically. No one on behalf of the appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>made any determination as to whether there was any looseness in the bolts that secured the steering gear to the frame, despite the fact that the damaged vehicle was available to the appellants for such inspection over an extended period o f time; and this was not a situation where the vehicle was so damaged that discovery of a defect was impossible.... There is nothing here to show the slightest connection between the squealing of tires and the alleged defect in the vehicle\u2019s steering mechanism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">Regardless of the recovery theory, the plaintiff in product litigation must satisfy three basics from an evidentiary standpoint: 1) the existence of a defect; 2) the attribution of the defect to the seller; and 3) a causal relation between the defect and the injury---- Appellants here have satisfied none of the above. They have been unable to show that what might possibly have happened did probably happen. Reduced to its simplest form, their argument is that because a one-car accident happened without apparent cause, the manufacturer must be to blame. Such a theory is not supported by established principles of common-law negligence or strict liability or breach of warranty____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">We conclude that, on the record <em>sub judice, </em>in the absence of expert testimony, a reasonable jury would not be able to determine either the existence of a defect or causation without engaging in speculation. <em>See Crickenberger v. Hyundai Motor America, </em>404 Md. at 54, 944 A.2d 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Cases cited by appellant are unpersuasive. In <em>Stewart v. Budget Rent-a-Car Corp., </em>52 Haw. 71, 470 P.2d 240 (1970), a leading Hawaii decision on automobile products liability, the Supreme Court of Hawaii adopted a test that essentially follows the rule of strict liability in tort as set forth in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. <em>Stewart, </em>470 P.2d at 243. The plaintiff in that case was injured when her rental car ran off the road. The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the manufacturer and the car\u2019s distributor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>but the jury returned a plaintiffs verdict against the rental agency. The rental agency appealed, claiming that there was insufficient evidence of a defect or causation. The agency also challenged the trial court\u2019s dismissal of its cross-claim against the distributor and manufacturer. The Hawaii Supreme Court vacated the dismissal of the cross-claim and remanded for a trial on the question of the manufacturer\u2019s and distributor\u2019s liability. The court otherwise affirmed the award in favor of the plaintiff driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">A decisive evidentiary issue in <em>Stewart </em>was whether expert opinion evidence was required. The court articulated the problem and its solution as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">The nature and quality of evidence used in products liability cases to show the defect and the nexus between the defect and the accident naturally varies. The most convincing evidence is an expert\u2019s pinpointing the defect and giving his opinion on the precise cause of the accident after a thorough inspection. If an accident sufficiently destroys the product, or the crucial parts, then an expert\u2019s opinion on the probabilities that a defect caused the accident would be helpful. If no such opinion is possible, as in the present case, the user\u2019s testimony on what happened is another method of proving that the product was defective. If the user is unable to testify, as where the accident killed him or incapacitated him, no other witness was present at the time of the accident, and the product was destroyed, the fact of the accident and the probabilities are all that remain for the party seeking recovery. At this point the plaintiff can attempt to negate the user as the cause and further negate other causes not attributable to the defendant. These kinds of proof introduced alone or cumulatively are evidence which help establish the presence of a defect as the cause of the damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">Of course whether the proof is of the sufficient quantum to get past a motion for a directed verdict and to the jury will depend on each case. In most products liability cases the proof of a defect is usually shown by an expert witness or by the user\u2019s testimony as substantiated by an additional eye <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>witness. Yet where there is no additional eye witness, as in the present case, and where the only expert was unable to form an opinion because of the damaged condition of the car and the subsequent changes in the car\u2019s condition, we nevertheless do not think that a directed verdict against the plaintiff is always justified as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">Circumstantial evidence is certainly admissible to establish a defect and the fact that it caused the accident.... The question whether a directed verdict is proper turns on the court\u2019s judgment whether the inferences drawn from the circumstantial evidence measure up to the standard for a directed verdict. We think the testimony of the plaintiff, Mrs. Stewart, concerning the events immediately preceding the accident was sufficient to yield an inference that there was a defective condition which caused the accident.... Added to this was other testimony by Mrs. Stewart that tended to negate any causation not attributable to the rental agency, the distributor or the manufacturer. The car had not been taken on bumpy roads after the plaintiff rented it. It was a clear day and she drove on a straight and level highway at the time of the accident. Furthermore, there was also testimony concerning the damage to the front end of the car although such damage may well have been caused by the accident rather than causing it. Taken as a whole we think the quantum of evidence in this case was sufficient to go to the jury, fully recognizing that except for the evidence concerning the broken parts it was circumstantial and offered by the user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\"><em>Stewart v. Budget Rent-a-Car Corp., </em>470 P.2d at 243-44 (footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In <em>Bollmeier v. Ford Motor Company, </em>130 Ill.App.2d 844, 265 N.E.2d 212 (1970), the plaintiffs minor son was injured when the Ford Thunderbird he was driving ran off the road. He said that the car did not respond when he tried to steer the vehicle around a curve. The car had been delivered in April, 1966, roughly three months before the accident. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>that point, the Bollmeiers \u201cobserved a vibration which could be seen and felt in the steering column and the steering wheel.\u201d They heard a \u201chumming noise\u201d described as \u201csimilar to a swarm of bees or the sound of snow tires.\u201d <em>Bollmeier, </em>265 N.E.2d at 213. The car had about 342 miles on the odometer when Mr. Bollmeier took it back to the dealer. The salesman recognized that there was a problem, and measures were taken to fix the vibration problems. At the time of the accident, the car had about 4400 miles. <em>Bollmeier, </em>265 N.E.2d at 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Plaintiff filed an action in strict liability. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for directed verdicts at the close of the evidence, and the plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed the directed verdict on the negligence count, but reversed that disposition on the strict liability/warranty counts. The trial court had ruled that the plaintiffs were required to prove a specific defect, and that they had failed to prove a defect in the steering mechanism or automobile that caused the injuries. The Illinois intermediate appellate court recited the pertinent issue to be \u201cwhether in a suit for breach of implied warranty or strict tort liability it is necessary to prove the specific defect in the product which caused the injury either by direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Bollmeier v. Ford Motor Company, </em>265 N.E.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The court noted that, in formulating the requirements for a products liability case, the Illinois Supreme Court had not indicated \u201cthat proof of the specific defect which causes the product to be in an unreasonably dangerous condition is necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215-16 (citing <em>Suvada v. White Motor Company, </em>32 Ill.2d 612, 210 N.E.2d 182, 188 (1965)). Drawing on cases in which circumstantial evidence has been sufficient, the <em>Bollmeier </em>court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">Therefore, direct or circumstantial evidence which tends to prove that the product failed to perform in the manner reasonably to be expected in the light of its nature and intended function, such as proof of a malfunction which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>tends to exclude other extrinsic causes, is sufficient to make out a prima facie case on this issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 217 (citations omitted). The court also observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">In the present case there was substantial evidence that there was some malfunction in the car which manifested itself in a vibration in the steering. There was also expert testimony that this vibration could cause a metal failure or loosening of bolts which could occur in a steering mechanism. Although there was no prior complaint about the steering in the car as to its responsiveness, there was evidence by the driver that the car failed to respond when he attempted to negotiate a curve to the left. We believe that from the evidence submitted up to this point in the case, the jury could have properly concluded that the automobile failed to perform in the manner that would reasonably have been expected and that this failure caused the plaintiffs injury. The fact that someone turned the steering and the wheels responded when the car was hoisted from the ground is not conclusive on the issue of a defective condition, but was some evidence which could have been considered by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\"><em>Bollmeier v. Ford Motor Company, </em>265 N.E.2d at 217-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">We have reviewed these decisions and consider them unpersuasive. Although the court in <em>Stewart </em>concluded that the plaintiffs testimony \u201cconcerning the events immediately preceding the accident was sufficient to yield an inference that there was a defective condition which caused the accident[,]\u201d the court also observed in a footnote that \u201c[i]n the most extreme circumstances a court might hold that where no specific defect can be shown, recovery is to be allowed anyway as a carefully driven vehicle does not leave the road in the absence of a defect in the car.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation, </em>470 P.2d at 244 n. 5. It also appeared to the court that, when no evidence is forthcoming, \u201cthe fact of the accident and the probabilities are all that remain for the party seeking recovery.\u201d The court said that in this instance the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>plaintiff can \u201cattempt to negate the user ... and other causes not attributable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">This view is not necessarily inconsistent with our cases, and we need only refer to Maryland law to resolve this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Harrison v.

He did not designate an expert on the issue of defect or causation. The second factor cited in Harrison\u2014relating to the length of time after the sale\u2014is more neutral. While the accident occurred just over two months after the Tundra was purchased, the truck had already traveled 10,500 miles. With respect to the third factor, whether the same type of accident had occurred in similar products, appellant fails to direct our attention to other mishaps involving the Tundra or other similar Toyota vehicles. While appellant cites to the Safety Recall Notice that was issued subsequent to the accident, we conclude that for reasons that shall be set forth below that notice is inadmissible. This factor can be considered neutral or weighs against appellant. We conclude that the fourth factor should be weighed in favor of appellant. For purposes of reviewing the ruling on summary judgment against appellant, we take as true his version of events on the day of the accident. His testimony eliminates the weather as a factor in this accident. Finally, we conclude that this is not the type of accident that would ordinarily never happen unless a defect existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In the final analysis, a single factor weighs in favor of appellant. While two factors can be adjudged \u201cneutral,\u201d the two remaining factors favor the defense. Of these two factors, the first, relating to the presence of an expert opinion, is entitled to considerable weight. Appellant did not adduce any expert on the presence, <em>vel non, </em>of a defect in the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Although circumstantial evidence has been held sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case in a products liability action, this is not a case where a reasonable juror could find on these facts the existence of either a design or manufacturing defect. This case does not present circumstances that would relieve appellant of the obligation to introduce expert testimony to establish the existence of a defect. In the absence of such evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the jury could only conjecture as to whether the Tundra was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">D. Safety Recall Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Appellant\u2019s brief suggests that the Safety Recall Notice that was issued subsequent to the accident is persuasive circumstantial evidence of a defect in the Tundra\u2019s design or manufacture. To recall, Toyota issued this safety notice in August 2005, subsequent to the accident. Appellant asserts that the defect in the Tundra was brought to the attention of Darcars\u2019s mechanics, and such alleged defect is \u201cconsistent with the steering difficulties referred to in Toyota\u2019s Safety Recall Notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The circuit court properly determined that this notice would not be admissible. We agree. Maryland Rule 5-407 governs when evidence of subsequent remedial measures may be admitted and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">Rule 5-407. Subsequent remedial measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">(a) In general. When, after an event, measures are taken which, if in effect at the time of the event, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">(b) Admissibility for other purposes. This Rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as (1) impeachment or (2) if controverted, ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The Rule is based on the corresponding Federal Rule, Fed. R.Evid. 407. <em>See Angelakis v. Teimourian, </em>150 Md.App. 507, 520, 822 A.2d 494 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">The \u201cevent\u201d referred to in Rule 5-407 means the date of the accident. <em>See Chase v. General Motors Corp., </em>856 F.2d 17, 21 (4th Cir.1988) (interpreting Fed.R.Evid. 407). The Fourth Circuit in <em>Chase </em>also held that Fed.R.Evid. 407 applies to strict liability cases. <em>Chase v. General Motors Corp., </em>856 F.2d at 22 (citing <em>Werner v. Upjohn Company, Inc., </em>628 F.2d 848, 857 (4th Cir.1980)). In <em>Troja v. Black &amp; Decker Manufactur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>ing Co., </em>62 Md.App. 101, 488 A.2d 516, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 471, 494 A.2d 939 (1985), we held that Md. Rule 5-407 likewise applies to strict liability actions. <em>Troja, </em>62 Md.App. at 113-14, 488 A.2d 516 (quoting <em>Werner, </em>628 F.2d. at 857).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Because the recall notice was issued after the \u201cevent,\u201d the accident in this case, it is inadmissible under the term of Rule 5-407(a). The recall notice came too late for appellant\u2019s case. Because the party opposing a motion for summary judgment must produce admissible evidence to show a genuine dispute of material fact, the Safety Recall Notice does not serve that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">E. Express Warranty and Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Although appellant\u2019s failure to designate an expert witness justifies the entry of summary judgment on all counts as to all of the defendants, the entry of summary judgment on the breach of express warranty against the corporate defendants and the negligence count against Aseer Mohammad can be disposed of summarily. Quite simply the alternative basis of the circuit court\u2019s disposition of these counts has not been challenged on appeal. Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5). <em>See Beck, </em>100 Md.App. at 149, 640 A.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. On appeal and in his brief before the circuit court appellant claims that the opinions of Fenton and Landis should not be considered because they \"have not been accepted by this court as an expert witness in any field [and n]o evidentiary foundation has been laid to allow the admissibility of their opinions.\u201d This point has not been adequately briefed or argued, and was not presented in oral argument before the circuit court. <em>See Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 38 n. 4, 566 A.2d 767 (1989) (Court does not address issue not adequately briefed or argued); <em>Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994) (same), <em>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, </em>337 Md. 580, 655 A.2d 370 (1995). The circuit court did not rely on these opinions in granting summary judgment. Further, any concerns about their qualifications could easily have been addressed by appellant\u2019s counsel when he deposed each witness by requesting a <em>curriculum vitae </em>or conducting a brief <em>voir dire. See </em>Md. Rule 2-415(g) (stating in part that \"objection to the competency of a witness ... is not waived by failure to make it before or during a deposition <em>unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been obviated ... if presented at that time.\") </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Given the procedural posture of appellant\u2019s claim, and noting that the employment of Toyota\u2019s experts does not influence our decision, we decline to rule on the issue of whether Landis or Fenton were qualified as experts. Moreover, appellant does not challenge the qualifications of Donald Tandy or the basis of his opinions. Any complaint about Tandy\u2019s testimony has been waived. <em>See Swann v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>95 Md.App. 365, 384, 620 A.2d 989 (1993), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds suh nom. Dover Elevator Co. v. Swann, </em>334 Md. 231, 638 A.2d 762 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">In any event, there is evidence that is relevant to Landis\u2019s qualifications and the foundations for his opinions. When questioned by appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>lant's counsel, Landis testified that he is employed by Toyota as a \"technical analysis manager for the technical analysis group within Toyota,\u201d that he \"utilize[s his] engineering education and experience to analyze our vehicles in the field,\u201d that he was a \"senior engineer in the quality assurance group ... responsible for chassis issues.\u201d He said that he reviewed vehicle documents for this specific Tundra and inspected the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\">. At the time of the pre-trial stage of this litigation, Md. Rule 2-504(b)(1)(B) required that the scheduling order contain \"one or more dates by which each party shall identify each person whom the party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, including all information specified in Rule 2-402(f)(l)[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">. The court explained that \u2018\u2018[t]here is no allegation in that count as to what was even said. I don\u2019t know whether they said the quality was poor or the quality was great. Obviously, I assume that they said it was a high quality vehicle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. Maryland law would govern the breach of warranty claims, because the corporate defendants\u2019 liability would be predicated on the sale of the Tundra, which occurred in Maryland. <em>See Frericks v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 304, 307, 363 A.2d 460 (1976) (citing <em>Volkswagen of America v. Young, </em>272 Md. 201, 220, 321 A.2d 737 (1974)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\">. For example, there is a dispute as to the road conditions. The \"accident description\u201d in the police accident report stated that appellant \"lost control of the vehicle during a snow storm. He crossed the median and was airborne. He landed on all four wheels then hit the jersey wall and then rolled the vehicle.\u201d Two police officers who investigated the accident, Corporals Gary Gross and Chris Smeal, respectively testified that it was snowing and that there was \"slush on the roads[,]\u201d that \"[tjhere were some icy patches and there was snow in the median strip and on the sides of the road.\u201d The accident report form also indicated that it was snowing, the \"surface condition\u201d of the roadway was \"icy,\u201d the pavement was \"slick,\u201d and that there had been \"rain, snow, etc. on the windshield.\u201d Mr. Mahmoud's brother testified that appellant told him that he had his arm out of the window to clear snow from the windshield. These facts are contradicted by appellant, who testified that there was no snow or ice on the road and that he was not clearing his windshield. These different versions about the road conditions, whether snow or ice had accumulated on the windshield, or even the estimated speed of the Tundra, while \"genuine\u201d issues, are not, at this juncture, \"material\u201d to the resolution of the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Toyota expert Steven Fenton testified that, had the accelerator stuck and given the distance of 4.3 miles between the toll booth and the site of the accident, the Tundra would have reached a speed well over 100 mph by the time it crashed. He concluded instead that the Tundra was going about 55 mph when the accident happened. At this juncture, we must accept as true appellant\u2019s version of events, <em>viz. </em>that the gas pedal stuck, although appellant does not claim that the truck was speeding when the accident took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. Certainly, we do not hold that a plaintiff must proffer expert testimony in every strict liability or breach of warranty action. <em>See Crickenberger v. Hyundai Motor America, </em>404 Md. 37, 54\u201455, 944 A.2d 1136 (2008) (Murphy, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
