Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. (collectively, the original participating manufacturers) and more than forty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>small tobacco manufacturers (collectively, the subsequent participating manufacturers). In 1998, the original participating manufacturers and the State, along with fifty-one other states and territories (collectively, the settling states), signed the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). The MSA resolved the settling states\u2019 claims of wrongful marketing and advertising of cigarettes, as well as damages based upon the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. In exchange for a release of liability, the original participating manufacturers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and subsequent participating manufacturers, who later joined the MSA, agreed to make annual payments that would be allocated among the settling states.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">In March 2006, the independent auditor, responsible for determining the annual MSA payments, refused appellees\u2019 request to reduce their payments for the 2003 calendar year. When the dispute continued, appellees requested arbitration pursuant to \u00a7 XI(c) of the MSA. The State refused appellees\u2019 demand and, on May 18, 2006, it sought declaratory relief from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Brown, J.), confirming that the independent auditor acted properly by not reducing the MSA payment. The original participating manufacturers responded on July 14, 2006, by filing a Motion to Compel Arbitration. Thereafter, the subsequent participating manufacturers joined the original participating manufacturers\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">During the October 5, 2006 motions\u2019 hearing, the parties argued, based upon the language and structure of the MSA, whether the present dispute was subject to arbitration or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In a written opinion, the court found that the arbitration provision was \u201cclear\u201d and applicable and rejected the State\u2019s arguments, opining that they were \u201cclearly in conflict with\u201d the language of the MSA. Accordingly, on January 19, 2007, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City ordered that arbitration be compelled and denied the State\u2019s Motion for Declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Order. The State, thereafter, filed a timely notice of appeal, in which it presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">1. Under the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between the State of Maryland and participating tobacco manufacturers, is the issue of whether the State was \u201cdiligent\u201d in its enforcement of Maryland*s escrow statute against non-participating manufacturers (NPMs) (a) an issue within the Circuit Court for Baltimore City*s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to implement and enforce the MSA, or instead (b) an issue subject to arbitration because it is a dispute \u201carising out of or relating to calculations performed by, or ... determinations made by\u201d the accounting firm responsible for calculating the amount that the participating tobacco manufacturers owe the State under the MSA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">2. Do a series of 2003 agreements, subsequent to the Master Settlement Agreement, between the State and the original participating tobacco manufacturers, resolving the issue of the State*s \u201cdiligent enforcement\u201d of its NPM escrow statute with respect to 1999-2002 tobacco sales, render non-arbitrable the present dispute concerning the State*s diligence in calendar year 2003, because the State*s enforcement activities in calendar year 2003 necessarily applied only to 1999-2002 tobacco sales?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the question of whether the State was diligent in its enforcement of Maryland\u2019s escrow statute against non-participating manufacturers is an issue subject to arbitration and that the series of 2003 settlement agreements between the State and the original participating manufacturers do not render the present dispute non-arbitrable. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">A. The Master Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In 1996, the State brought suit in Baltimore City Circuit Court against the major American tobacco companies, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>that the companies were engaged in wrongful advertising and marketing of cigarettes. Other states initiated similar actions in their own courts. In November 1998, the attorneys general of forty-six states, including Maryland and six territories, entered into a global agreement known as the MSA to resolve the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Under the MSA, the settling states agreed to dismiss any pending action and release all past and future claims in exchange for the original participating manufacturers to restrict the manner in which they market and advertise tobacco products and for each original participating manufacturer to make a substantial annual payment to be allocated among the settling states. On December 1, 1998, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered a consent decree and final judgment approving the MSA, thereby settling the previous civil action initiated by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As an incentive for additional tobacco manufacturers to join the MSA, the agreement provides that other tobacco manufacturers may voluntarily agree to abide by its provisions in the future and, in return, the settling states would release all past and future claims against them. The MSA refers to the tobacco manufacturers who enter the global agreement after its execution as the \u201csubsequent participating manufacturers.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the MSA, the subsequent participating manufacturers, like the original participating manufacturers, make annual payments to the settling states.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The MSA annual payments are used to help the settling states achieve \u201csignificant funding for the advancement of public health\u201d and \u201cthe implementation of important tobacco-related public health measures.\u201d Pursuant to the MSA, the original participating manufacturers and the subsequent participating manufacturers (collectively, the participating manufacturers) do not make annual payments directly to the State or the other individual settling states. Instead, each partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>pating manufacturer is required to make a single, nationwide annual payment into an escrow account on or before April 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The participating manufacturers\u2019 payment obligations are calculated annually by an \u201cIndependent Auditor\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW9\">[Calculate and determine the amount of all payments owed pursuant to [the MSA], the adjustments, reductions and offsets thereto (and all resulting carry-forwards, if any), the allocation of such payments, adjustments, reductions, offsets and carry-forwards among the Participating Manufacturers and among the Settling States, and shall perform all other calculations in connection with the foregoing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">MSA \u00a7 XI(a); <em>see </em>MSA \u00a7 IX(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The independent auditor calculates each participating manufacturer\u2019s annual payment obligation pursuant to a comprehensive formula contained within the MSA. The calculation begins with each original participating manufacturer paying into an escrow account its relative market share of the base amount for the calendar year. <em>See </em>\u00a7 IX(c)(l). This amount is then subject to several reductions and adjustments. One adjustment is the \u201cNon-Participating Manufacturer Adjustment\u201d (NPM Adjustment), which is at issue. MSA \u00a7\u00a7 IX(c)(j), XI(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Given the restrictions imposed by the MSA, the participating tobacco manufacturers were concerned that they would incur a competitive disadvantage to the non-participating manufacturers, who were not subject to the MSA\u2019s strict market<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ing restrictions and payment obligations. The NPM Adjustment attempts to level the marketplace by reducing the annual payment obligation of the participating manufacturers if, as a collective group, it is proven that they lost market share to the non-participating manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The MSA provides that participating tobacco manufacturers may be eligible to take a NPM Adjustment if (1) the independent auditor determines that, during the year in question, the participating manufacturers collectively lose more than two percent of their pre-MSA market share to non-participating manufacturers and (2) an economic consulting firm determines that the MSA was a \u201csignificant factor\u201d contributing to that loss. MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Even if the two stated conditions are satisfied, thereby making the NPM Adjustment applicable, the MSA contains a mechanism for a settling state to avoid a reduction of payment. The MSA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">A Settling State\u2019s Allocated Payment shall not be subject to an NPM Adjustment: (i) if such <em>Settling State continuously had a Qualifying Statute ... in full force and effect </em>during the entire calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the payment in question is due, and <em>diligently enforced the -provisions of such statute </em>during such entire calendar year....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Accordingly, if a state has a \u201cqualifying statute\u201d in full force and effect and diligently enforces that statute, the auditor must reallocate that state\u2019s share of the NPM Adjustment among the other states that do not qualify, \u201cpro rata in proportion to their respective Allocable Shares.\u201d MSA \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Maryland enacted the model \u201cqualifying statute\u201d contained in Exhibit T to the MSA, which is codified as Maryland\u2019s Escrow Act (Chapter 169 of the Acts of 1999, as amended by Chapter 141 of the Acts of 2001).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Escrow Act requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>all non-participating tobacco manufacturers to deposit into escrow a fixed sum per cigarette sold that is slightly less than the per-cigarette cost imposed by the MSA on participating manufacturers. Escrow Act \u00a7 3. These escrowed funds may ultimately be used to satisfy a judgment that the State may obtain against a non-participating manufacturer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3(b)(2)(i). If the funds are not so used within twenty-five years, they are returned to the non-participating manufacturer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">B. The Present Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The root of the dispute that underlies this appeal is the independent auditor\u2019s calculation of the participating manufacturers\u2019 annual payments for the 2003 calendar year. In 2003, the independent auditor determined that the participating manufacturers\u2019 total national market share was approximately six percent lower than their market share pre-MSA, satisfying the first condition of the NPM Adjustment. In March 2006, an economic consulting firm, selected pursuant to the MSA, determined that the MSA was a \u201csignificant factor,\u201d contributing to that loss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the participating manufacturers requested that the auditor apply the 2003 NPM Adjustment to their April 2006 payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Maryland and the other settling states, however, urged the auditor to deny the NPM Adjustment on the ground that the settling states \u201cdiligently enforced\u201d their qualifying statutes. After receiving letters from the State and participating manufacturers, the independent auditor released its preliminary calculations of the 2003 annual payments, which did not include the NPM Adjustment. Recognizing that the parties disputed whether the NPM Adjustment should apply, the auditor stated that \u201cthe Independent Auditor is not charged with the responsibility under the MSA of making a determination regarding this issue. More importantly, the Independent Auditor is not qualified to make the legal determination as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>whether any particular Settling State has \u2018diligently enforced\u2019 its Qualifying Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Although the independent auditor did not, in its preliminary calculations or elsewhere, explicate its current approach to determining whether a NPM Adjustment applies, apparently its approach was to <em>presume </em>that the settling states were diligently enforcing their qualifying statutes. When the auditor issued its final calculations in March 2006, the calculations again did not include the NPM Adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Following the release of the independent auditor\u2019s final calculations, on May 22, 2006, counsel for the participating tobacco manufacturers wrote former Attorney General Joseph Curran to request that the State submit to arbitration on the issue of whether Maryland diligently enforced the Escrow Act during the 2003 calendar year.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">On May 18, 2006, the State asked the Baltimore City Circuit Court for declaratory relief, declaring that the auditor properly determined not to reduce the participating manufacturers\u2019 MSA payments to reflect a NPM Adjustment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the approving court of the MSA, Baltimore City Circuit Court \u201cretain[ed] exclusive jurisdiction for the purposes of implementing and enforcing [the MSA],\u201d except as otherwise provided in the MSA. At issue is one of the exceptions, an arbitration provision governing the resolution of disputes regarding the auditor\u2019s calculations and determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to calculations performed by, or any determinations made by, the Independent Auditor (including, without limitation, any dispute concerning the operation or application of any of the adjustments, reductions, offsets, carry-for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>wards and allocations described in subsection IX(j) or subsection XI(i)) shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a panel of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be a former Article III federal judge. Each of the two sides to the dispute shall select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The arbitration shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">MSA \u00a7 XI(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">On July 14, 2006, the original participating manufacturers filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Stay the State\u2019s Motions. Thereafter, the subsequent participating manufacturers joined the original participating manufacturers\u2019 Motion to Compel Arbitration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Baltimore City heard arguments on October 5, 2006. After examining the provisions of the MSA in order to determine whether the question of diligent enforcement was arbitrable, the court concluded, in its written opinion, that \u201c[t]he language of the MSA is clear in its directive to submit a dispute such as this one to arbitration\u201d and that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s argument based on logistics and impracticality is unpersuasive and fails to overcome the controlling language of the MSA.\u201d Accordingly, on January 19, 2007, the court ordered that arbitration be compelled. The State subsequently filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The State comprehensively argues that a determination of whether it \u201cdiligently enforced\u201d its Escrow Act does not \u201carise out of\u2019 or \u201crelate to\u201d a \u201ccalculation performed by\u201d or \u201cany determination made by\u201d the independent auditor. Accordingly, the State maintains that the question of diligent enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ment must be resolved by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In response, appellees argue that, because the underlying dispute is over the independent auditor\u2019s determination not to apply the NPM Adjustment, it clearly falls within the MSA\u2019s arbitration provision. Thus, to answer the question of whether diligent enforcement is subject to arbitration or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Baltimore City Circuit Court, we look to the plain language of the MSA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>A. Plain Language of the MSA</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The construction of a written contract is a question of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court. <em>Bennett v. Wright, </em>167 Md.App. 291, 295, 892 A.2d 1164 (2006). As a fundamental principle of contract construction, we seek to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the contracting parties. The \u201cprimary source for determining the intention of the parties is the language of the contract itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Young v. Anne Arundel, </em>146 Md.App. 526, 585-86, 807 A.2d 651, <em>cert. denied, </em>372 Md. 432, 813 A.2d 259 (2002); <em>see General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306 (1985)) (\u201c[Cjlear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give away to what the parties thought that the agreement meant.\u201d). In ascertaining the true meaning of a contract, \u201cthe contract must be construed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>its entirety and, if reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 17, 919 A.2d 700 (2007) (citing <em>Sagner v. Glenangus Farms, </em>234 Md. 156, 167, 198 A.2d 277 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">i. A MSA Court\u2019s Exclusive Jurisdiction is Restricted</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 VII(a) of the MSA, Baltimore City Circuit Court has primary enforcement responsibility. The MSA enforcement provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\"><em>Jurisdiction. </em>Each Participating Manufacturer and each Settling State acknowledge that the Court: (1) has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action identified in Exhibit D in such Settling State and over each Participating Manufacturer; (2) shall retain exclusive jurisdiction for the purposes of implementing and enforcing this Agreement and the Consent Decree as to such Settling State; and (3) <em>except as provided in subsections IX(d), XI(c) and Exhibit O, </em>shall be the only court to which disputes under this Agreement or the Consent Decree are presented as to such Settling State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). By virtue of this language, while Baltimore City Circuit Court has exclusive jurisdiction as to matters arising within the State, the court\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to matters involving section XI(c) of the MSA, which provides for arbitration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 XI(c) constitutes an area of authority reserved from Baltimore City Circuit Court\u2019s general enforcement jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ii. MSA \u00a7 XI(c) Unambiguously Requires Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The arbitration provision in \u00a7 XI(c) of the MSA clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">(c) <em>Resolution of Disputes. Any dispute, </em>controversy or claim <em>arising out of or relating to calculations </em>performed by, <em>or any determinations made by, the Independent Auditor (including, without limitation, any dispute concerning </em>the <em>operation </em>or <em>application </em>of any of the adjustments, reductions, offsets, carry-forwards and allocations described in <em>subsection IX(j) </em>or subsection IX(i)) <em>shall </em>be submitted to binding arbitration before a panel of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be a former Article III federal judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The general phrase, \u201cany dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to .... \u201d delimits the substantive scope of the right to arbitrate under \u00a7 XI(c), while the narrower parenthetical phrase that immediately follows the general phrase, describes a subset of disputes that clearly fall within the scope of arbitration and shall be submitted to arbitration. This subset illustrates the range of disputes included in the general clause and demonstrates that the MSA drafters intended that the listed disputes would be subject to arbitration. <em>See, e.g., Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth. v. I.C.C., </em>645 F.2d 1102, 1112 (1981) (\u201cincluding, without limitation\u201d clause identifies examples that are specifically included in the general language they follow).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Focusing on the language of the narrower, parenthetical phrase, it is necessary to \u201cconnect the dots.\u201d Relevant to the issue <em>sub judice </em>is section IX(j), entitled \u201cOrder of Application of Allocations, Offsets, Reductions and Adjustments.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 IX(j), the sixth clause embodies the NPM Adjustment and sets forth that \u201cthe NPM Adjustment shall be applied to the results of clause \u2018Fifth\u2019 pursuant to subsections IX(d)(l) and (d)(2)____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Connecting the dots to \u00a7 IX(d)(l), this section discusses the calculation of the NPM Adjustment for the original participating manufacturers, including the significant factor determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>tion. More importantly, section IX(d)(2)(A) provides that the NPM Adjustment \u201cshall apply to the Allocated Payments of all Settling States, except as provided\u201d in \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(B), which sets forth that \u201c[a] Settling State\u2019s Allocated Payment shall not be subject to an NPM Adjustment ... if such Settling State continuously had a Qualifying Statute ... in full force and effect during the entire calendar year ... and <em>diligently enforced </em>the provisions of such statute during such entire calendar year....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Of import, this is the <em>only </em>MSA provision that mentions \u201cdiligent enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">After giving effect to each clause and construing the MSA in its entirety, arbitration is mandatory. <em>See Cochran, </em>398 Md. at 17, 919 A.2d 700. The parenthetical \u201cwithout limitation\u201d clause directly identifies the diligent enforcement issue and sets forth that diligent enforcement, along with any other issue regarding the NPM Adjustment, is subject to arbitration. <em>See, e.g., Connecticut v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>279 Conn. 785, 905 A.2d 42, 49-50 (2006) (opining that the \u201cconclusion that the underlying dispute is arbitrable is buttressed by referring to the specific examples of arbitrable disputes enumerated in section IX(c) of the agreement\u201d); <em>Massachusetts v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>448 Mass. 836, 864 N.E.2d 505, 512 (2007) (clause \u201cspecifically includes disputes related to the adjustments described in IX(j))\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Furthermore, the general language that \u201cany dispute\u201d \u201carising out of or relating to\u201d \u201ccalculations performed by or determinations made by, the Independent Auditor,\u201d on even a basic level, makes the present dispute arbitrable, as the question of diligent enforcement \u201carises out of\u2019 or \u201crelates to\u201d the auditor\u2019s calculations and determinations. The State contends, however, that a finding of lack of diligence will \u201cat most, result in a <em>future </em>calculation or determination made by the auditor.\u201d The State relies on the California decision, <em>In re Tobacco Cases I, </em>124 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1108, 21 Cal.Rptr.3d 875 (2004), in support of its proposition. In <em>In re Tobacco Cases I, </em>the state of California petitioned the court for a determination as to whether a Danish participating manufacturer was responsible for a Latvian cigarette manufacturer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>sales in the United States. On appeal, the court held that a dispute concerning the Danish company\u2019s obligation to make a payment for cigarettes sold by the Latvian company \u201cwill, at most, result in <em>future </em>calculations or determinations made by the Auditor regarding [the Danish company\u2019s] obligations under the MSA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109, 21 Cal.Rptr.3d 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The Danish company\u2019s obligation, in <em>In re Tobacco Cases I, </em>to make payments for cigarettes sold and the auditor\u2019s calculations and determinations were attenuated, whereas a determination of whether Maryland diligently enforced the Escrow Act will directly and immediately result in a different MSA calculation. In the instant case, the auditor did not apply the NPM Adjustment to reduce the participating manufacturers\u2019 annual payment, a determination that resulted in a calculation greater than if the auditor had applied the NPM Adjustment. Accordingly, the question of diligent enforcement \u201carises out of\u2019 or \u201crelates to\u201d the auditor\u2019s calculations and determinations because it directly affects the amount of MSA payment the State and all other settling states receive. <em>See, e.g., New York v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>8 N.Y.3d 574, 838 N.Y.S.2d 460, 869 N.E.2d 636, 639 (2007) (\u201cThe plain language of the MSA compels arbitration.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Stenehjem v.

As such, the dispute \u201crelates to\u201d the \u201coperation\u201d or \u201capplication\u201d of an \u201cadjustment\u201d or \u201callocation pursuant to IXQ).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">iii. Independent Auditor has express authority to make a \u201cdiligent enforcement\u201d determination</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The structure of the arbitration clause provides clear evidence of the parties\u2019 mutual understanding that, in performing the calculations and making the determinations, the independent auditor is not simply to make mathematical computations, as the State suggests, but to make and act upon preliminary determinations as to the operation and application of the adjustments, reductions, offsets, carry-forwards and alloca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>tions, if appropriate, in completing those calculations and determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Section XI(a) expressly empowers the independent auditor to \u201ccalculate <em>and determine </em>the amount of all payments owed pursuant to this Agreement, <em>the adjustments, </em>reductions and offsets thereto (and all resulting carry-forwards, if any), <em>the allocation of such payments, adjustments, </em>reductions, offsets and carry-forwards among the Participating Manufacturers and among the Settling States[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This provision confirms the linkage between the final amounts of all payments owed pursuant to the MSA and the amounts of all adjustments, reductions and offsets applicable to those payments. Accordingly, the auditor has authority to make \u201cdeterminations\u201d regarding appellees\u2019 payments, including the \u201capplication\u201d and \u201callocation\u201d of a NPM Adjustment based on the diligent enforcement exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Furthermore, \u00a7 IX(j) establishes the mandatory process by which \u201c[t]he payments due under this Agreement shall be calculated\u201d and sets forth in a list of thirteen sequentially numbered clauses, each of which describes or references a particular adjustment, reduction or offset that \u201cshall be applied to\u201d the results of the immediately preceding clause, providing that, \u201c[i]n the event that a particular adjustment, reduction or offset referred to in a clause below does not apply to the payment being calculated, the result of the clause in question shall be deemed to be equal to the result of the immediately preceding clause.\u201d MSA \u00a7 IX(j). This clause requires the independent auditor, as the party responsible for performing the calculation in question, to make a threshold determination whether the adjustment is applicable before computing its amount and modifying the amount of the subject payment by applying the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Moreover, there is no MSA provision that delegates any payment-related issue to the MSA court. If the parties had intended to create an exception to the auditor\u2019s authority under \u00a7 IX(a) to make payment-related determinations, as they did with the \u201csignificant factor\u201d determination, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>expressly would have done so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To sever the question of diligent enforcement from the NPM Adjustment, thereby placing it before MSA courts is illogical and at odds with the MSA. The diligent enforcement question, mentioned in the MSA only as part of the NPM Adjustment, is an indispensable underlying issue of the overall NPM Adjustment and, thus, the determination and calculations are inextricably linked. <em>See New Hampshire v. Philip Morris, </em>155 N.H. 598, 927 A.2d 503, 512 (2007) (\u201cCourt is not aware of, any provisions in the MSA other than those regarding the NPM Adjustment, where the diligent enforcement of a Qualifying Statute has any relevance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Accordingly, the MSA empowers and deems the independent auditor competent<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to determine, as part of a calculation or determination, whether any particular offset, adjustment, reduction or carry-forward is applicable to appellees\u2019 payment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Connecticut v.

Under the operative language of the MSA, the arbitration provision unambiguously requires arbitration because it is a dispute that \u201carises out of or relates to\u201d the independent auditor\u2019s calculation and determination of the MSA payments and because it is a dispute \u201cconcerning the operation or application of any of the adjustments ... and allocations described in subsection ix(j).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">iv. Meaning of \u201cArise out of\u2019 or \u201cRelate to\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The State complains that appellees are attempting to transform the arbitration clause into a massive exception to the court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction that \u201cswallow[s]\u201d the MSA\u2019s court jurisdiction \u201cvirtually whole, rendering that jurisdiction largely illusory.\u201d Specifically, the State argues that, in order for this Court to comport with Maryland principles of contract interpretation, we must not construe the phrases so as to render meaningless or illusory other provisions of the MSA. The State points to precedent, in a variety of legal contexts, for the imposition of \u201csubstantive, common sense limits on the potentially infinite phrases \u2018arising out of and \u2018relate to.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In discussing <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>514 U.S. 645, 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995), the State cautions this Court to heed the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201cif \u2018relate to\u2019 \u201d as used in the federal ERISA statute \u201cwere taken to the furthest stretch of its indeterminancy, then for all practical purposes preemption would never run its course, for \u2018really, universally, relations stop nowhere.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671 (citing H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New York ed., World\u2019s Classic 1980)). Our interpretation of the arbitration provision, however, does not construe \u201crelate to\u201d to the \u201cfurthest stretch of its indeterminacy\u201d because the clause applies specifically to the instant dispute. <em>See supra </em>Part I.A.ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Expounding on its contention that we must apply common sense, substantive limits on the arbitration phrase, the State points to <em>Beale v. American Nat\u2019l Lawyers Ins. Reciprocal, </em>379 Md. 643, 843 A.2d 78 (2004). <em>Beale, </em>however, is inapposite because the contractual language limited the insurance carriers\u2019 liability to damages \u201carising out of the same, related or continuing Professional Services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645, 843 A.2d 78. Because there was no dispute that all five clients\u2019 malpractice claims arose out of \u201cProfessional Services,\u201d the issue was whether the professional services received by the clients were the \u201csame\u201d or \u201crelated.\u201d The Court of Appeals noted that the term \u201crelate\u201d implied a \u201clogical or causal connection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, 843 A.2d 78. Not only is our interpretation of the arbitration clause logical, but the plain language of the clause clearly encompasses the issue of diligent enforcement for the purposes of a NPM Adjustment. Our reading of the arbitration provision does not render meaningless or illusory the enforcement clause or any other provisions of the MSA.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The State also suggests that the arbitration clause is limited to an \u201cappellate\u201d\u2014type review of disputes concerning calculations or determinations that \u201chave been made\u201d by the independent auditor. Section XI(c), however, is not limited to determinations \u201cactually committed to\u201d or \u201cactually made by\u201d the independent auditor because the meaning of the phrase \u201cdeterminations made\u201d encompasses determinations that \u201chave been made,\u201d \u201care made\u201d and are \u201cto be made.\u201d <em>See, e.g., County of Los Angeles v. Shalala, </em>192 F.3d 1005, 1013 (D.C.Cir.1999) (opining that the phrase \u201cpayments made\u201d does not convey a single meaning, but includes payments that have been made as well as payments to be made).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Accordingly, arbitration is required regardless of whether the independent auditor actually determined whether a state has \u201cdiligently enforced\u201d its qualifying legislation. <em>See Massachusetts, </em>864 N.E.2d at 513 (\u201cWhether the Auditor made this determination explicitly, impliedly, or by employing a presumption makes no difference.\u201d); <em>Connecticut, </em>905 A.2d at 53 (holding that the arbitration provision \u201cdoes not contain the limitation urged on us by the state, that only disputes over determinations or calculations \u2018actually committed to, and actually made by, the Independent Auditor in the first instance\u2019 are arbitrable\u201d); <em>New Hampshire, </em>927 A.2d at 510 (arbitration clause includes \u201cdisputes over issues not actually determined, just as well as those over issues which are actually determined\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Even if we were to adopt the State\u2019s proposed reading of \u00a7 XI(c), that arbitration is limited to determinations \u201cthat have already occurred\u201d by the auditor, the dispute is still arbitrable. Because there was a six percent \u201cMarket Share Loss\u201d and the MSA was a \u201csignificant factor\u201d of that loss, \u00a7 IX(d)(l)\u2019s requirements for a NPM Adjustment were satisfied. Given the fact that all settling states had a qualifying statute, the only way that the auditor could have denied the NPM adjustment for the 2003 calendar year was by finding that the states diligently enforced their statutes. <em>See Massachusetts, </em>864 N.E.2d at 513 (holding that \u201cthe only means by which the auditor could have denied the NPM Adjustment for that year was by affirmatively finding that there was diligent enforcement by the States. It is therefore logically necessary to assume that the auditor did make a diligent enforcement determination\u201d); <em>New Hampshire, </em>927 A.2d at 510 (\u201cAuditor did, in fact, make a determination regarding diligent enforcement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Accordingly, there is no language in the arbitration clause or the MSA that narrows or creates exceptions to the substantive scope of \u00a7 XI(c) as written or establishes conditions precedent to invoking the right to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>B. Structure of the MSA Requires Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Although this Court is satisfied that the plain language of the MSA requires arbitration, there are additional factors that support our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">i. Need for uniformity</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The State contends that \u201c[a] nationwide arbitration concerning the diligence of [fifty-two] states and territories in enforcing their own laws might well represent the ultimate in \u2018chaos.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The State, however, cannot explain how a proceeding that is subject to one final and binding determination would be less workable or expeditious than litigating the issue fifty-two times in fifty-two separate court systems with the imminent possibility of delays and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The MSA\u2019s payment structure is nationwide and unitary. The independent auditor calculates and determines the participating manufacturers\u2019 annual payments and then allocates those funds among the settling states. In the case of diligent enforcement, a single decision-maker is vitally important because the determination for one state affects every other settling state pursuant to \u00a7 IX(d)(2)(C)\u2019s \u201creallocation\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The question of diligent enforcement cannot be made in a vacuum. We concur with the numerous jurisdictions that have held that the present dispute must be resolved under one clear set of rules that apply with equal force to every settling state. We find the rationale of the Superior Court of Connecticut particularly compelling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">The problem is even more acute, however, when the resolution of a dispute as to calculations and determinations by the Independent Auditor will necessarily have different effects on different Settling States. Unless such disputes are presented to and decided by tribunals that have the power to hear from and bind each affected Settling State as a party, great mischief can be done and substantial unfairness can result. Where, for example, as in this case, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>claimed that an individual Settling State is exempt from the NPM Adjustment for a given year because it diligently enforced a Model Statute that was in full force and effect throughout that year, the decision of the tribunal deciding that issue will not only affect the interests of the Settling State seeking to qualify for the exemption, but those of all other Settling States as well. This is so because the granting of an exemption to one Settling State will inexorably lead to the reallocation of its allocated portion of the NPM Adjustment to all other non-exempt Settling States. Each Settling State thus has a vital interest in the granting or denial of each other Settling State\u2019s individual claim for exemption, and for obvious reasons, their interests are conflicting. Submitting such a dispute to a neutral panel of competent arbitrators affords all interested parties the right to be heard on a level playing field where no interested party enjoys an apparent home-field advantage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"><em>Connecticut v.

Pfizer, </em>398 F.3d 765, 775 (2005); <em>McDonnell Douglas Fin. Corp. v. Penn. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>858 F.2d 825, 832 (2d Cir.1988) (\u201cwhen an arbitration clause by its terms extends only to a specific type of dispute, then a court cannot require arbitration on claims that are not included\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">If, however, as appellees suggest, the clause is broad and there remains a question as to arbitrability, the State faces a near insurmountable hurdle overcoming the presumption of arbitration given the fact that courts from forty-five jurisdictions have rendered the clause susceptible of an interpretation requiring arbitration. The State attempts to seek refuge from this overwhelming and uniform authority with several unavailing arguments. First, the State insists that we should disregard the decisions because they do not apply to Maryland law. The touchstones of contract law, notably that the plain language of the contract governs and that contracts must be considered in their entirety, are the same principles of law that apply in the other forty-four jurisdictions. The State also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>suggests that the decisions lack value because they were issued \u201cin very rapid succession\u201d and, thus, constitute a \u201csnowball phenomenon.\u201d The State also argues that the opinions provide only a cursory review of the dispute <em>sub judice. </em>Contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, the decisions, which were issued over the last year and a half, thoroughly analyze the language and structure of the MSA. Ironically, the lone Louisiana decision, denying the participating manufacturer\u2019s motion to compel arbitration consists of one conclusory paragraph. The State is therefore unable to demonstrate with any degree of certitude that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. <em>See AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc., </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S.Ct. 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The 2003 Settlement Agreements with the original participating manufacturers</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In its second argument, the State contends that, with respect to the original participating manufacturers, a series of 2003 June Settlement Agreements settled the present dispute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Having already been resolved, the State argues that the present dispute is not arbitrable. The State additionally contends that, because the 2003 Agreements do not contain an arbitration clause, an arbitration panel does not have the authority to determine the scope and effect of those 2003 Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In 2003, each of the original participating tobacco manufacturers entered into a series of additional settlement agreements with the State. Specifically, the Agreements provide that the tobacco manufacturer \u201cabsolutely releases and forever discharges [the State of Maryland] from any and all monetary claims that it ever had, now has, or hereafter can, shall or may have under Section IX(d) of the MSA [\u2018Non-Participating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Manufacturer Adjustment\u2019] with respect to Cigarettes shipped or sold in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, including any effect such monetary claims may have on future payments under the MSA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Expounding upon its argument that the present dispute is not arbitrable, the State points to Maryland*s NPM escrow statute, which sets forth that non-participating manufacturers must pay a specified amount into escrow for each cigarette sold in Maryland \u201cby April 15 of the year following the year in question____\u201d Escrow Act \u00a7 3(a)(2). Thus, the State contends that it could undertake no enforcement activities with respect to cigarettes sold in 2003 until April 16, 2004. Elaborating, the State argues that \u201call enforcement activity during the calendar year 2003 could not have been with respect to cigarettes sold in 2003 ... and would necessarily have been with respect to Cigarettes shipped or sold in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The original participating manufacturers question whether the June 2003 Agreements apply to the present dispute, arguing that a participating manufacturer\u2019s NPM Adjustment for a particular year is based upon cigarettes sold in that year. The Agreements expressly limit the release of claims under \u00a7 IX(d) with respect to cigarettes sold or shipped from 1999 to 2002. Consequently, to the original participating manufacturers, the only claim an original participating manufacturer has under \u00a7 IX(d) is for a NPM Adjustment and an original participating manufacturer\u2019s NPM Adjustment for a particular year is based on the cigarettes shipped or sold in that year and, thus, the language of the 2003 Agreements simply release a claim for a NPM Adjustment with respect to those four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">It is unnecessary, however, to determine whether the NPM Adjustment is based upon sales from 2002 or 2003 because paragraph 8 of the 2003 Agreements expressly acknowledge that there continues to be a dispute \u201c[w]ith respect to potential NPM Adjustments relating to Cigarettes shipped or sold in 2003 and subsequent years.\u201d Therefore, paragraph 8 re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>serves the original participating manufacturers\u2019 right to seek a NPM Adjustment for the year 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Moreover, the original participating manufacturers contend that the State\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d defense is not a freestanding issue that can be decided apart from the MSA. Specifically, they argue that diligent enforcement through execution of the June 2003 Agreements is arbitrable because disputes concerning the applicability of a diligent enforcement exemption fall within the plain language of the MSA\u2019s arbitration clause. Thus, they contend that it is irrelevant that the June 2003 Agreements do not contain an arbitration clause because \u201c[w]hat is dispositive is that the dispute in which those agreements are being asserted as a defense is arbitrable.\u201d <em>See New Hampshire, </em>927 A.2d at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Concurring with the other jurisdictions, we agree with the original manufacturers\u2019 assertion. <em>See New Hampshire, </em>927 A.2d at 512; <em>see also Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79, 84, 123 S.Ct. 588, 154 L.Ed.2d 491 (2002) (\u201c[T]he presumption is that the arbitrator should decide \u2018allegation[s] of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Niro v.

The State argues that the placement of the arbitration provision within the \"Calculation and Disbursement of Payments\u201d section and not the \"Enforcement\u201d or even \"Payment\u201d sections is telling. Section XVIII(i), however, specifically provides that \u201c[t]he headings of the sections and subsections of this Agreement are not binding and are for reference only and do not limit, expand or otherwise affect the contents or meaning of this Agreement.\u201d As we will discuss <em>supra, </em>the placement of the arbitration clause is logical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. Pursuant to \u00a7 IX(d)(l)(C), \"a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants (the \u2018Firm\u2019) shall determine whether the disadvantages experienced as a result of the provisions of this Agreement were a significant factor contributing to the Market Share Loss for the year in question.\u201d The subsection goes on to discuss how the economic consultant must be chosen and retained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">. Sections IX(a) and IX(j) explicitly refute the State's claim that the auditor lacks \"competency to determine\u201d whether the State has diligently enforced its obligation. If the auditor\u2019s role was limited to mathematical computations, the MSA would not have required arbitration of disputes related to an auditor's determination by three former federal judges. <em>Connecticut v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>279 Conn. 785, 905 A.2d 42 (2006), <em>aff'g </em>2005 WL 2081763, *36 (Conn.Super.Ct. Aug.3, 2005) (\"Auditor is not simply ... to make mathematical computations of the sort it routinely performs as a certified public accountant\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. The State\u2019s claim that the auditor acknowledged in its March 7, 2006 Notice of Preliminary Calculation that it is \"not qualified\u201d to decide diligent enforcement is irrelevant. The MSA\u2019s language controls and not the auditor\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b182-5\">. There are other areas under the MSA that are subject to the circuit court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. In other jurisdictions, a wide range of disputes over the MSA\u2019s marketing and other restrictions have been litigated and resolved through enforcement actions in MSA courts. <em>See, e.g., People ex rel. Lockyer v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>116 Cal.App.4th 1253, 11 Cal.Rptr.3d 317 (2004); <em>State ex rel. Goddard v. R.J.

The State does not claim that the subsequent participating manufacturers have waived or released claims to a 2003 NPM Adjustment in the 2003 Settlement Agreements.
