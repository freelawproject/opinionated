The Board of Estimates, acting on behalf of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u201cCity\u201d), appellee and cross-appellant, subsequently adopted the 2007 Budget when it met on May 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Unhappy with the Supplemental Tax, Joan L. Floyd, <em>pro se, </em>appellant and cross-appellee, along with several others, filed a declaratory action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on June 5, 2006, against the City and the Authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs complained that the Authority\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) lacked a quorum when it approved the 2007 Budget. They alleged that the Board improperly counted towards its quorum three Board members who were ineligible to vote: Michael Gervais, Richard Burnham, and Eric Friedman. Consequently, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prohibit the City \u201cfrom imposing, collecting, and enforcing any and all Supplemental Tax for fiscal year 2007[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Following a merits hearing on July 18, 2006, the circuit court issued a Declaratory Judgment (the \u201cJudgment\u201d) and a \u201cMemorandum Opinion\u201d on July 26, 2006. It upheld the approval of the \u201cFY 2007 budget and property surcharge rate\u201d for the District, and denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief. Therefore, the court dismissed the suit, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to amend or alter judgment, which culminated in an Amended Declaratory Judgment (\u201cAmended Judgment\u201d). Making only a minor revision to its ruling, the circuit court again upheld the validity of the 2007 Budget and Surtax.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant poses the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">1. (As to Michael Gervais): Did the outgoing 2005 Board have the authority to elect an at-large Quadrant representative for the 2006 Board, and to do so without a quorum present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">2. (As to Richard Burnham): Did an individual, who was neither a registered voter within the district nor an owner of property within the district, lawfully occupy a voting seat on the Authority\u2019s Board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">3. When the total number of authorized voting seats on the Authority\u2019s Board is nineteen, and the quorum for the conduct of business is a fixed number, must that number be at least a majority, or ten (10)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">4. When the total number of authorized voting seats on the Authority Board is nineteen, and the affirmative vote of \u201ca majority of all of the voting Board members\u201d is required to adopt a Supplemental Tax rate for the coming fiscal year, must there be 10 votes?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">In its cross appeal, the City asks six questions. These include:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">1. Did the lower court err by entering a declaratory judgment in the absence of a justiciable controversy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">6. Did the lower court err by failing to exclude those plaintiffs who failed to comply with Maryland Rule 1-311 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and should this Court dismiss the present appeal as to all appellants except Ms. Floyd? [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The Authority was established in 1994 by the General Assembly. The Legislature gave the City the power to create up to \u201csix community benefits district management authorities,\u201d including the Charles Village Community Benefits District (the \u201cDistrict\u201d). <em>See </em>1994 Md. Laws, Chap. 732, codified at Baltimore City Charter (the \u201cCity Charter\u201d), Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 63(a)(1), (d)(1) (the \u201cEnabling Law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The purpose of the Authority, is to provide certain services to the \u201cbusiness interests and residents\u201d of the District, an area encompassing the greater Charles Village neighborhood of Baltimore City. City Charter, Art. II, \u00a7 63(a). These services include the provision of \u201csupplemental security and maintenance\u201d as well as \u201camenities in public areas\u201d and \u201cpark and recreational programs____\u201d City Charter, Art. II, \u00a7 63(a)(2). The Enabling Law authorized the City to pass an ordinance creating the Authority, subject to approval by the property owners and registered voters of the District. City Charter, Art. II, \u00a7 63(k)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Pursuant to the Enabling Law, the City passed Ordinance No. 94-414 (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d) on July 1, 1994, codified at Article 14, Subtitle 6 of the Baltimore City Code (the \u201cCode\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It sets forth the powers of the Authority in regard to its operation of the District. In part, the Code states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">\u00a7 6-4.

Rather, it required approval through a special election. Code, \u00a7 6-15 specified the criteria for eligibility to vote in that election.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">\u00a7 6-15.

Of all ballots cast and counted (1,578 ballots), 65% voted in favor of creating the District.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On January 11, 1995, the Board of Estimates certified the results of the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Pursuant to the Ordinance, the Authority \u201cshall be governed by and administered through a Board of Directors.\u201d Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(a). The Board is composed of both voting and non-voting members. Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(e). The \u201cnumber of members of the full Board must be at least 14, excluding vacancies, and no more than 27.\u201d Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(d)(l). In particular, there are nineteen authorized voting member positions, including four at-large voting members. Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Board is also required to include, as nonvoting members, two members of the City Council, appointed by the President of that body. Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(e). In addition, the Board is authorized to include four non-voting members from the neighborhood associations bordering the District, and two non-voting members from various non-profit organizations within the District. Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Further, the Ordinance authorized the Board to adopt bylaws. Code, \u00a7 6-6 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u00a7 6-6. Board of Directors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(g) Bylaws, rules, and regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">(1) The Board may adopt such bylaws, rules, and regulations as it deems necessary in carrying out the powers of the Authority, so long as the same shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this subtitle or of any ordinance amendatory or supplementary hereof or of the Enabling Legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">(2) All bylaws shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Estimates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">(3) The Board may establish its own procedures relating to the internal administration of the Authority, except as may be restricted by the Enabling Legislation or this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The Board of Estimates approved the Authority\u2019s Bylaws on January 11, 1995, when it certified the election results.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the same time, it approved the Board\u2019s initial members.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">As we shall see, <em>infra, </em>several provisions of the Bylaws are pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">2.02 <em>Composition of Board.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">A. The Board of Directors of the Authority must be at least <em>If </em>excluding vacancies, and no more than <em>27 </em>persons. Subject to limitations prescribed in the preceding sentence, the Board of Directors shall have the full authority to decrease or increase the number of directors.

Subject to paragraph 2.13 (Open Meeting), <em>members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone </em>or similar communication equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation in a meeting by these means constitutes presence in person at a meeting. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">2.12 <em>Quorum and Voting. The actual presence of at least 9 voting members shall constitute a quorum for all regular and special meetings </em>of the Board of Directors. Each member of the Board of Directors shall have one vote.

(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">5.03 <em>Supplemental Tax.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">A. The Board shall recommend to the Board of Estimates the supplemental tax rate each year as part of the financial plan. During the process of adopting the financial plan, the Board shall approve the supplemental tax rate in a separate vote different from the vote of the Board for the purpose of adopting the financial plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">B. The supplemental tax rate must be approved by a majority of all of the voting Board members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">C. For the initial or partial budget year, the rate of the supplemental tax shall be set to raise revenues equal to the cost of the financial plan but shall not exceed a full year rate of thirty cents ($.30) per $1.00.00 [sic] of assessed value. For the first full budget year, the rate of the supplemental tax shall be set to raise revenues equal to the costs of the financial plan but shall not exceed thirty cents ($.30) per $100.00 of assessed value, except that the rate may be adjusted to produce revenue equivalent to the full year 30-cent yield of the initial budget year.

The supplemental tax rate shall remain the same unless a majority of all the voting Board members vote to change it. If a majority of all the voting Board members do not vote to change the supplemental tax rate, then the Board shall submit a financial plan to the Board of Estimates for approval containing the existing supplemental tax rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">In addition, Bylaw 7.06 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">Robert [sic] Rules of Order.

According to the minutes, however, Mayer \u201chas since withdrawn her name from consideration.\u201d The Board\u2019s minutes of December 13, 2005, indicate that on that date the Board unanimously approved Michael Gervais as the Board representative for Quad 4. The minutes also show nine voting members were present for the vote, including Richard Burnham and Eric Friedman.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">According to the evidence, Friedman held the position designated by the Mayor, but did not reside or own property in the District. However, the City, whose interests Mr. Friedman purported to represent, owned property in the District at 2300 and 2324 Maryland Avenue, among other places. Burn-ham, the Board Treasurer, had been appointed by the Old Goucher Business Alliance. He was the sole owner, president, and representative of Graphic Imaging, Inc., a Subchapter S corporation that owned property in the District subject to the Surtax.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 5.01 of the Bylaws, the fiscal year of the Authority begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. At a meeting on April 11, 2006, the Board considered the Authority\u2019s 2007 Budget. Because of unfilled vacancies, the Board had fourteen voting members, ten of whom were in attendance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Board unanimously approved both the 2007 Bud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>get and, in a separate vote, a motion to retain the Supplemental Tax at the rate of twelve cents per $100 of assessed value.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Board of Estimates then considered the Authority\u2019s 2007 Budget at a public hearing held on May 17, 2006. At that hearing, Floyd voiced her opposition to the 2007 Budget, claiming that neither the 2007 Budget nor the Supplemental Tax had been properly approved by the Board on April 11, 2006. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board of Estimates approved the 2007 Budget, including the Surtax.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Thereafter, on June 5, 2006, the plaintiffs filed the underlying suit. They challenged the qualifications of three of the ten individuals the Board had counted towards its quorum at the meeting on April 11, 2006. The plaintiffs insisted that neither Mr. Friedman nor Mr. Burnham met the voting eligibility requirements under Code, \u00a7 6-15(b), because neither owned property within the District. Further, they alleged that the Board had improperly included Mr. Gervais in its quorum, because his appointment as an at-large voting member on December 13, 2005, exceeded the Board\u2019s statutory authority. Because of \u201cthe ineligibility of Friedman and/or Burnham,\u201d the plaintiffs asserted that \u201cthere were insufficient eligible voting members present at the December 13, 2005 meeting to constitute a quorum capable of appointing Michael Gervais to the Authority Board____\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs maintained that the Board had conducted business without a quorum, because only seven eligible voting members were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">According to the plaintiffs, the Board\u2019s approval of the 2007 Budget, without a proper quorum, was \u201cunlawful, null and void.\u201d Therefore, they claimed that \u201cany subsequent presentation of a proposed Supplemental Tax to the Board of Estimates on or about April 28, 2006 was also unlawful and a nullity____\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs asked the circuit court to declare the Surtax invalid, and to enjoin the City and the Authority from \u201cimposing, collecting, and enforcing\u201d the Surtax \u201cfor fiscal year 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The City filed a \u201cResponse to Request for Preliminary Injunction\u201d on June 28, 2006, asking the court to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction. It contended, inter alia, that the action was moot, and that \u201c[t]he only Plaintiffs in this case are those pro se Plaintiffs who have signed the Complaint and other papers: Joan L. Floyd, Stephen J. Gewirtz and Pamela J. Wilson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On June 21, 2006, the Board held a special public meeting to reconsider its approval of the 2007 Budget. At the time, there were fourteen voting members on the Board, thirteen of whom participated in the meeting.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Of those thirteen, two participated by telephone.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By a vote of twelve to zero, with Mr. Gervais abstaining, the Board approved a Resolution that stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">1. That the Board hereby approves the Authority\u2019s budget and the surtax rate for the Charles Village Community Benefits District for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, that were approved by the Board of Estimates of the City of Baltimore on or about May 17, 2006;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">2. That the Board hereby ratifies and approves the actions of the Board taken at the December 13 meeting, including but not limited to the appointment of Michael Gervais to membership on the Board as a voting member, representing Quad 4;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">3. That the Board hereby ratifies and approves the actions of the Board taken at the April 11 meeting, including but not limited to the Board\u2019s approval of the proposed budget for the Authority for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, and the Board\u2019s vote to keep the surtax rate of 12 cents per $100 of assessed value unchanged for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>4. That these resolutions have retroactive effect to the fullest extent necessary and allowed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The court (Matricciani, J.) held an evidentiary hearing on the merits on July 18, 2006.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Numerous documentary exhibits were presented, and the court heard testimony from Jennifer Martin, Board President; Sandra Sparks, initial Administrator of the Authority; and Richard Burnham, Board Treasurer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 2002 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 3-403 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), the court signed a Declaratory Judgment on July 26, 2006, (entered August 21, 2006), and issued a Memorandum Opinion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Notably, the court found that nine Board members constituted a quorum. Further, it found that Burnham and Friedman were eligible voting members of the Board on April 11, 2006, when the Board approved the 2007 Budget. The court also found that Gervais was \u201cduly elected to the Board of the Authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>on December 13, 2005 to fill [the] vacancy occasioned by the departure of the recently elected Quad 4 Board representative, Tammy Mayer.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, Gervais was \u201centitled to serve on the Board until its next annual meeting or such earlier or later time as his successor is elected and qualifies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Based on its conclusions, the court dismissed the Complaint, with prejudice. The Judgment stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">4. Pursuant to the Baltimore City Charter, Art. II, \u00a7 (63), the Baltimore City Code, Art. 14, subtitle 6 and the current by-laws [sic] of the Charles Village Benefits District and Management Authority \u00a7 2.12, the actual presence of at least nine voting members shall constitute a quorum for all regular and special meetings of the Board of Directors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">5. There being a quorum present and voting at the Authority\u2019s Board meeting of April 11, 2006, the Board\u2019s actions in approving the FY 2007 budget, financial plan and supplemental tax for properties within the Charles Village Community Benefits District and submitting same to the City Board of Estimates for final approval was valid and effective. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on by-laws \u00a7 5.03B is unavailing. Even if the supplemental tax rate had to be approved by a majority of all the voting Board members, the Court interprets this by-law provision to mean a majority of all the voting Board members duly elected and/or appointed and eligible to vote at any given time. The record reflects that there were fourteen such voting members (including Eric Friedman) as of April 11, 2006. Disallowing Mr. Friedman\u2019s vote on April 11, 2006, there were still nine votes to approve the supplemental tax rate, clearly a majority of the fourteen voting members required by \u00a7 5.03B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">6. The action of the City Board of Estimates of May 17, 2006 in approving the FY 2007 budget and property surcharge rate for the Charles Village Community Benefits District was in accordance with the statutory scheme and valid and effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>In its well reasoned Memorandum Opinion, the court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that Bylaw 2.12, setting a quorum of nine board members, \u201cis invalid for both historical reasons and as violative of Maryland common law.\u201d The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">The cases cited to the Court by plaintiffs concern statutes, county council and city council enactments and other formally enacted provisions which call for a majority of voting members to be present and voting in order for the respective bodies to take significant actions, consistent with their enumerated authority. None of the cited eases, nor the provision in the Authority\u2019s by-laws [sic] which adopts Robert\u2019s Rules of Order for the conduct of the Board\u2019s meetings, compel the result that plaintiffs desire. In the judgment of this Court, the enabling legislation, the Code and the by-laws of the Authority are consistent and the quorum provision contained in the by-laws was lawfully approved by the City Board of Estimates. The number of present and voting members required for the approval of the FY 2007 budget, financial plan and supplemental tax is nine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">Having determined that issue, the Court turns its attention to the April 11, 2006 meeting of the Authority\u2019s Board of Directors, at which a proposed budget for FY 2007 was approved and a motion passed to submit same to the Board of Estimates for final approval. The meeting minutes of April 11, 2006 (defendants\u2019 Exhibit 5) indicates that there were ten voting and one non-voting members present. The motions to approve the FY 2007 proposed budget, to maintain the same surtax rate of 12&lt;t per $100 of assessed value and to send the approved budget to the Board of Estimates for final approval were all sustained by unanimous votes. Among the voting members were the three individuals whose voting eligibility is challenged by plaintiffs, Richard Burnham, Eric Friedman and Michael Gervais. Thus, in order for an appropriate quorum to be present at this meeting, at least two of the three challenged Board members had to be eligible to vote.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>As to Burnham\u2019s eligibility to serve as a voting member of the Board, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">Richard Burnham testified that he had been a voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board for a period of five years and presently serves as its treasurer. His capacity to serve as a voting member of the Board arises from his representation of a constituent organization, The Old Goucher Business Alliance, Inc., which is allotted two voting members under Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(e)(4). Mr. Burnham further testified that he is the owner of a business, located within the District, known as Graphic Imaging, Inc., a sub-chapter S corporation of which he is the sole owner and president. Consequently, he personally pays the supplemental tax imposed on the property owned by Graphic Imaging, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">Plaintiffs challenge Mr. Burnham\u2019s eligibility to serve as a voting member of the Board. They point to Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u20146(e)(7) which requires that a voting member of the Board be eligible to vote in the election under \u00a7 6-15 of the Code. By its express terms, \u00a7 6-15 limits eligible voters to \u201cowners of property within the District which is subject to tax under \u00a7 6-8; and voters registered to vote within the District.\u201d Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u201415(b). Because Mr. Burnham is not technically either an owner of property within the District or registered to vote there, plaintiffs contend that he may not serve on the Board in a voting capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">In the judgment of the Court, plaintiffs\u2019 argument concerning Richard Burnham elevates form over substance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The very Code section to which plaintiffs point to disenfranchise Mr. Burnham, also indicates that \u201c[A]t least a majority of the Board shall be composed of owners or representatives of property owners subject to the tax imposed by this subtitle.\u201d Further, the Code provides that \u201c[T]he Board shall endeavor to maintain representatives on the Board from professionals practicing in the District, the retail merchants within the District, and the tenants of properties in the District; however, no minimum representation shall apply.\u201d Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u20146(e)(8). In furtherance of this purpose, the by-laws, approved by the Board of Estimates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>contain a provision which says that \u201c[A]t least a majority of the Board shall be composed of owners or representatives of property owners subject to the tax imposed by this subtitle. A voting member of the Board must be eligible to vote in the election under \u00a7 260 of the Ordinance. An owner of property which is utilized for commercial purposes may designate an individual to represent the owner if: (a) the individual is (1) a tenant of the owner, (2) a corporate officer or partner of the tenant of the owner, or (3) a business representative or agent of the owner, and (b) the owner authorizes and designates in writing an individual to represent the owner on the Board.\u201d The same provision goes on to set forth the goals set out in the Code provision maintaining representatives from professionals, retailers and tenants in the District. By-laws, \u00a7 202 B. Thus, while Richard Burnham is not technically an owner of property subject to tax within the District, he is the owner of a corporation, which may only act through persons such as himself and he is, by virtue of sub-chapter S status of the corporation, the actual individual who pays the supplemental tax on the property where Graphic Imaging, Inc. is located. His participation as a voting member of the Board is consistent with the provisions in all the governing documents calling for representatives of the professional and retail and tenant community to serve thereon. He is a duly appointed representative of the Old Goucher Business Alliance, Inc., which has a statutory entitlement to appoint two voting members to the Authority\u2019s Board. Considering all of the circumstances, the Court finds that Richard Burnham was an eligible voting member of the Board on April 11, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">As to Friedman\u2019s eligibility to serve as a voting Board member, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that Eric Friedman is the May- or\u2019s current appointee to serve on the Authority\u2019s Board.[] Nor do they dispute that the Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u20146(e)(1) authorizes the Mayor to appoint one voting member to the Board. Their contention with respect to Mr. Friedman is that he fails to meet the voting eligibility requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u00a7 6-15 because he is neither an owner of property subject to the tax within the District nor a registered voter there. Defendants counter that the Board has never interpreted this provision to require the Mayor\u2019s representative, the only citywide voting representative on the Board, to comply with the technical requirements of \u00a7 6-15 and, alternatively, that the City owns property within the District, although it is exempt from the supplemental tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">In the Court\u2019s judgment none of those facts is determinative. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim with respect to Mr. Friedman must fail for a want of evidence. Despite the fact that the Court admitted all of the documents proffered by the plaintiffs, including their own affidavits, at the adversary hearing on July 18, at the conclusion of these proceedings, the record is void of any evidence establishing that Eric Friedman either does not own property in the District subject to the tax or that he is not a registered voter in the District. It is the plaintiffs\u2019 burden to prove these facts and in the absence of such proof, the Court must find that Eric Friedman was an eligible voting member of the Authority Board on April 11, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The court found that because Mr. Burnham and Mr. Friedman were present and eligible to vote at the Board\u2019s April 11, 2006 meeting, the Board had \u201ca lawful quorum present\u201d when it approved the 2007 Budget. Therefore, it determined that \u201cthe Board\u2019s actions in approving a FY 2007 budget and supplemental tax were valid and properly presented to the Board of Estimates for approval.\u201d Thus, the court found it \u201cunnecessary to determine whether the Authority\u2019s actions were ratified at the Board meeting on June 21, 2006 and whether that ratification moots plaintiffs\u2019 claims here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In addition, the court found it unnecessary to \u201cdetermine whether Board member Michael Gervais became an eligible voting member of the Board on December 18, 2005 ...\u201d Nonetheless, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions with respect to Mr. Gervais do raise concerns with the Court because the evidence indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>in at least one previous vacancy situation in 2002 a different procedure was employed, involving a new nomination and special election to the Board. On the other hand, with the Court\u2019s findings today that a valid quorum was constituted by nine present voting members, and that Mr. Burnham and Mr. Friedman were eligible voting members, it does appear that Mr. Gervais\u2019 appointment was approved by the unanimous consent of the nine voting members present on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Mr. Gervais\u2019 status, therefore, hinges on Authority by-law 2.09, which governs the filling of vacancies of Board members not appointed by elected officials or associations. The by-law appears to permit the actions taken on December 13, 2005. The fact that Ms. Mayer\u2019s term had not yet begun points up a difficulty with the existing by-law because it does not contemplate such a situation. Nonetheless, Michael Gervais was selected by a majority of the remaining directors to fill her vacancy and he is entitled to serve until the next annual meeting or a new Board member from Quad 4 is elected and qualified. The Authority would be well advised to reconsider this by-law provision in light of its inconsistent interpretation and limited scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">(Internal citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 2-534, on July 28, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend judgment. In their memorandum, plaintiffs claimed that the court failed to decide the \u201cessential question\u201d of the meaning of Bylaw 5.03(B) and its effect on the Board\u2019s vote to approve the 2007 Budget. They argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEX\">In its determination that \u201c[t]he number of present and voting members required for the approval of the FY 2007 budget, financial plan and supplemental tax is nine\u201d (or 9 out of 19), the Court has relied on Section 2.12, the Bylaws provision cited by the Defendants, but has <em>failed to address </em>Section 5.03(B), the Bylaws provision cited by the plaintiffs, expressly requiring a majority of all voting members (or 10 out of 19) to affirmatively vote on the motion to adopt a Supplemental Tax rate. Section 5.03(B) was approved by the Board of Estimates in 1995 as part of the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Bylaws and cannot be disregarded, as it completed the statutory scheme for adoption of a Supplemental Tax rate on April 11, 2006. The Plaintiffs noted the significance of this provision at the first hearing before this Court, and extensively argued, with exhibits, the meaning and significance of Section 5.03(b) at the second hearing, yet the Court in its Judgment and Opinion fails to even acknowledge this relevant and <em>non-suspendableu </em>Bylaws provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">Regardless of the Court\u2019s position that a lawful quorum under the Bylaws was 9, the Court should alter and amend its judgement to state that <em>in the case of the adoption of a Supplemental Tax rate, </em>the minimum number of voting members required under Section 5.03(B) of the bylaws was 10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Plaintiffs also sought, <em>inter alia, </em>to present additional evidence to show that, on December 13, 2005, Friedman was \u201cneither a registered voter within the District, nor an owner of property subject to the Supplemental Tax.\u201d They proffered his 2005 Financial Disclosure Statement, showing that he lived outside the District. Plaintiffs asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">As Eric Friedman was <em>not </em>an eligible voting member of the Authority Board on December 13, 2005, 9 eligible voting members were <em>not </em>present on that date to appoint Michael Gervais, and Michael Gervais was <em>not </em>an eligible voting member on April 11, 2006. Therefore, the Court should alter and amend its Judgment accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The court held a motion hearing on August 22, 2006, at which it received Friedman\u2019s Disclosure Statement. Thereafter, the court signed an Amended Declaratory Judgment (entered August 30, 2006), again holding that the Board properly approved the 2007 Budget. The court reiterated that Mr. Burnham was a voting member, and continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">2. Although the Court admitted additional evidence at the post-trial motions hearing on the issue of Eric Friedman\u2019s qualifications as a voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board, the Court does not believe that plaintiffs have met their burden of proof by the introduction of admissible evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>to establish that Eric Friedman was neither an owner of property subject to the supplemental tax in the Benefits District nor a registered voter there. On the other hand, defendant cannot honestly contend that Mr. Friedman meets the voting member eligibility requirements of the Baltimore City Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6\u201415(b). Nor is there any express provision in the Baltimore City Code, exempting the Mayor\u2019s appointed representative from those voting eligibility requirements. Thus, a reasonable interpretation of the Code provisions would be that the Mayor is entitled to appoint a voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board, so long as he chooses someone who otherwise meets the voting eligibility requirements of \u00a7 6\u201415(b). For the purpose of this amended Declaratory judgment, therefore, the Court will not predicate its decision upon Eric Friedman\u2019s eligibility to serve as a voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">3. In accordance with the by-laws ... Michael Gervais was duly elected to the Board of the Authority on December 13, 2005 to fill a vacancy occasioned by the departure of the recently elected Quad 4 Board representative, Tammy Mayer. He is entitled to serve on the Board until its next annual meeting or such earlier or later time as his successor is elected and qualifies. Giving full consideration to the concerns expressed in the Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion of July 26, 2006, the Court nevertheless finds that Michael Gervais was a valid, voting member of the Authority\u2019s Board when it approved the FY 2007 budget, financial plan and supplemental tax on April 11, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">4. Pursuant to the Baltimore City Charter, Art. II, \u00a7 (63), the Baltimore City Code, Art. 14, subtitle 6 and the current by-laws of the Charles Village Community Benefits District and Management Authority, \u00a7 2.12, the actual presence of at least nine voting members shall constitute a quorum for all regular and special meetings of the Board of Directors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">5. There being a quorum present and voting at the Authority\u2019s Board meeting of April 11, 2006, the Board\u2019s actions in approving the FY 2007 budget, financial plan and supplemental tax for properties within the Charles Village <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Community Benefits District and submitting same to the City Board of Estimates for final approval was valid and effective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">6.

One concerns the City\u2019s contentions that Floyd, Gewirtz, and Wilson were the only proper plaintiffs, and that Floyd is the only viable appellant. The other pertains to Floyd\u2019s claim that the City\u2019s cross-appeal is invalid because it was filed in violation of Article VII, \u00a7 26 of the Baltimore City Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">In its cross-appeal, the City observes that \u201cthe present action was filed by Joan L.

The remaining plaintiffs signed affidavits that were filed during or after the motion hearing on June 29, 2006. Each affiant represented that he or she owned property in the District, was a plaintiff in the action, and affirmed that the contents of the Complaint were true to the best of the affiant\u2019s knowledge, information and belief. However, they did not sign and file an amended suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The notice of appeal and the addendum to it were signed only by Ms. Floyd, <em>pro se. </em>She also signed the brief \u201con behalf of the Appellants,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> designating herself as \u201cLead Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Because Maryland Rule 1-311 requires \u201ca party who is not represented by an attorney\u201d to sign \u201c[e]very pleading and paper,\u201d the City contends that the circuit court \u201cshould have excluded\u201d the fourteen plaintiffs \u201cwho failed to comply with Rule 1-311____\u201d For the same reasons, it argues that this Court should \u201cdismiss the appeal as to all appellants except Ms. Floyd.\u201d The City asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">The City raised the issue of non-compliance with Rule 1-311(a) several times and asked that the lower court strike the improper pleadings as to the non-signing parties.... In its order dated June 29, 2006, the lower court deemed that the plaintiffs were in compliance with Rule 1-311(a) and designated Ms. Floyd, Mr. Gewirtz and Ms. Wilson as \u201clead plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">The parties other than Ms. Floyd, Mr. Gewirtz and Ms. Wilson did not sign the pleadings. In effect, Ms. Floyd, Mr. Gewirtz and Ms. Wilson were placed in the position of acting as attorneys for the other fourteen plaintiffs. The lower court should have stricken the complaint as to the non-signing parties and allowed the case to proceed only as to Ms. Floyd, Mr. Gewirtz and Ms. Wilson, who complied with the rule and actually participated in the case.

We agreed, and vacated the judgment of the trial court because the Association \u201cwas not represented in the trial court by an attorney admitted to practice law in Maryland[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 666 A.2d 904. In doing so, we cited B.O.P. \u00a7\u00a7 10-206, and 10-601, and traced the history of Maryland\u2019s prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law back to 1831. <em>Id. </em>at 715-16, 666 A.2d 904. The Court observed that the purpose of the prohibition \u201c \u2018is to protect the public from being preyed upon by those not competent to practice law-from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 666 A.2d 904 (quoting <em>In re Application of R.G.S., </em>312 Md. 626, 638, 541 A.2d 977 (1988)). The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">As a general rule in other jurisdictions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201c[proceedings in a suit by a person not entitled to practice are a nullity, and if appropriate steps are timely taken the suit may be dismissed.... If the cause has proceeded to judgment, the judgment is void and will be reversed. Furthermore, the acts or steps of the unauthorized practitioner will be disregarded, and the papers and documents which he drafted should be stricken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 718, 666 A.2d 904 (quoting 7 C.J.S. Attorney &amp; Client \u00a7 31 at 869 (1980) (footnotes omitted)) (additional citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Consequently, we held that the petition for judicial review prepared and submitted by Ms. DeLalla\u2014a nonlawyer\u2014\u201cwas a nullity, as were the proceedings before the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720, 666 A.2d 904. This \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d was called for by \u201c[t]he totality of the circumstances, including the long history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of rules and legislation aimed at preventing the practice of law by nonlawyers[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719-20, 666 A.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Based on the principles discussed above, we agree with the City that Ms. Floyd is the only proper appellant. Because Floyd is not an attorney, she cannot represent other individuals in a legal capacity, nor otherwise act on their behalf in regard to the appeal. The failure of the <em>pro se </em>individuals listed as appellants to sign the notice of appeal disqualifies them as appellants.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, we shall dismiss the appeal as to all persons other than Ms. Floyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In reaching this decision, we are relieved of the need to consider the City\u2019s claim that the circuit court erred in failing to dismiss as plaintiffs the eleven persons who did not personally sign the Complaint. As a result, we need not determine whether the circuit court correctly concluded that, when these eleven individuals signed the affidavits, they satisfied Rule 1-311.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Floyd observes that the City\u2019s Notice of Cross-Appeal was signed by William R. Phelan, Jr., \u201cPrincipal Counsel, Baltimore City Department of Law,\u201d as \u201cAttorney for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.\u201d Relying on Article VII, \u00a7 26 of the Baltimore City Charter, Floyd contends that Phelan lacked the authority to file the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">We pause to review the City Charter, which states in Article VII, \u00a7 26:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u00a7 26. Department of Law: suits; appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">The City Solicitor shall have authority to institute, defend or discontinue on behalf of the City, any suit, action, or proceeding in any local, State or federal court or tribunal, but no appeals on behalf of the City to the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of the United States, or the United States Court of Appeals shall be taken except upon the written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>order of the City Solicitor, or outside counsel employed pursuant to Section 24(c), approved by the Mayor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">According to Floyd, Phelan was neither \u201coutside counsel\u201d nor the City Solicitor, \u201cand thus lacked the authority to file a cross-appeal on behalf of the City.\u201d While recognizing that \u00a7 26 of the City Charter does not refer to this Court, Floyd argues that the provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">was in effect in 1964 and thus predated the establishment of this intermediate appellate court. There is nothing to suggest that the establishment of this intermediate appellate court, and the re-assignment of appeals to the same, negated the pre-existing City Charter requirement for proper authorization of appellate action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The City responds that because \u00a7 26 of the City Charter does not refer to this Court, it is inapplicable. In its view, appellant\u2019s argument</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">does not account for the facts that a revised Charter was adopted by the voters of Baltimore in 1996 and that the new version of the Charter included the appeal approval provision without any mention of this Court, even though the Court was in existence long before the revised Charter was adopted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Based on the plain text of the Charter, we readily agree with the City that the requirements cited by Floyd do not apply to the filing of a cross-appeal by the City in this Court. Therefore, Floyd\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">We next examine a preliminary contention raised by both appellees: they urge us to dismiss the appeal as moot. In the City\u2019s view, \u201cthe Plaintiffs failed to present a justiciable controversy, because of the curative acts of the Authority\u2019s Board/<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d when it passed the Resolution of June 21, 2006, ratifying the 2007 Budget and approving the appointment of Mr. Gervais. Explaining that ratification is \u201c[c]onfirmation and acceptance of a previous act, thereby making the act valid from the moment it was done,\u201d the City contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>challenge to the Board\u2019s approval of the 2007 Budget on April 11, 2006, is now moot, because the subsequent \u201cratification made the previous budget and tax rate Valid from the moment\u2019 they were originally done.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Appellees also contend that the Board had a quorum when the ratification occurred. They note that eleven members were physically present and two other members participated through telephone conference call, as permitted by the Bylaws. \u201cBecause there were ten unchallenged voting members present at the June 21, 2006 meeting,\u201d they maintain that \u201cthere is no need to argue here the issue of whether the quorum is nine or ten.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Further, appellees argue that the Board of Estimates did not have to take any additional action to approve the 2007 Budget after the Board\u2019s ratification. They state: \u201cWhat the Board of Estimates approved on May 17, 2006 was the same budget and the same tax rate that were originally approved by the Authority and that were later ratified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Floyd disputes the claim that the ratification was proper, so as to render the issue moot. She argues that the Board did not have a quorum present at its meeting on June 21, 2006, when the resolution was passed, because only seven of the twelve members who approved the Resolution were eligible to do so. In this regard, she insists that Mr. Burnham and Mr. Friedman were ineligible, reducing the number of voters to ten. Of these ten, asserts Floyd, Denise Abrams could not be counted in the quorum because she arrived after the Board had called the meeting to order.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Appellant also argues that no statute permits Board members to participate through telephone conference, and thus the two Board members who were not \u201cphysically present\u201d could not vote on ratification. Conceding that Md.Code (2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 2-409(d) of the Corporations and Associations Article (\u201cC.A.\u201d) empowers some boards of directors to participate by telephone, Floyd nonetheless argues that this authorization does not apply to the Board. She explains: \u201cThe Authority\u2019s Board, a governmental body, is a creature of the General Assembly----The General Assembly has never provided the Authority with the power to meet by conference telephone. The Authority\u2019s own By-laws [sic], even if approved by the Board of Estimates, cannot convey this power to the Authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">In addition, appellant contends that, even if the Board had the power to ratify its actions, it was required to follow the same procedures required to take the actions in the first place. According to appellant, the Code requires the Board to \u201csubmit all materials [to the Board of Estimates] at least 2 months prior to the proposed effective date of a budget or Supplemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tal tax,\u201d yet the Board failed to submit the ratified 2007 Budget before the effective date of May 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Citing Bylaw 5.03, appellant also argues that the Board failed to take the \u201crequired separate votes\u201d of the Surtax rate and the 2007 Budget. Instead, argues Floyd, there was \u201conly a blanket \u2018resolution,\u2019 combining several prior actions, that was [sic] offered, considered and purportedly adopted [on] June 21, 2006 by a single vote.\u201d Appellant maintains that the Board of Estimates has final approval over the Supplemental Tax, and the Authority cannot impose such a tax above what the Board of Estimates approves. Even if the Board could ratify its prior action, argues appellant, it had no authority to ratify the Board of Estimates\u2019 approval of that prior act. Consequently, she insists that the 2007 Budget is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The circuit court concluded in the Amended Judgment that the plaintiffs presented \u201ca justiciable controversy.\u201d However, based on its analysis of the quorum issue and the Board qualification claims, the court found it unnecessary to reach the question of whether, on June 21, 2006, the Board properly ratified its earlier actions, \u201cand whether that ratification moots plaintiffs claims.... \u201d Moreover, in the court\u2019s view, the case involved \u201cmatters of public concern.\u201d Therefore, it proceeded to \u201cdeclare the rights and status of the parties.\u201d We agree with the circuit court\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The case before us involves challenges to the propriety of the actions of a community benefits district authority that has the power to propose tax-and-spend plans in order to provide services to the District. To resolve the dispute as to the legality and effectiveness of the ratification, as a necessary predicate to disposing of the mootness issue, we would have to address many of the same issues pertinent to appellant\u2019s challenge to the initial Board action approving the 2007 Budget. These include issues as to the qualifications of certain Board members and what constitutes a quorum of the Board. We would also have to consider additional issues not pertinent to appellant\u2019s challenge to the initial Board action, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>whether the ratification was effective despite the fact that the Board of Estimates did not approve the 2007 Budget for a second time, following the purported ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Even if we first addressed the issue of ratification, and concluded that the ratification was proper and rendered the case moot, we would exercise our discretion to consider appellant\u2019s challenge to the initial Board approval of the 2007 Budget. This is because the issues raised by the parties involve matters of important public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The doctrine of mootness is not without exceptions. As the Court recognized in <em>Katsenelenbogen v. Katsenelenbogen, </em>365 Md. 122, 125, 775 A.2d 1249 (2001), an appellate court \u201cwill, on rare occasions, address the merits of a moot case when [it is] \u2018convinced that the case presents unresolved issues in matters of important public concern that, if decided, will establish a rule for future conduct.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 250, 674 A.2d 951 (1996)). <em>See In Re Justin D., </em>357 Md. 431, 444-45, 745 A.2d 408 (2000); <em>State v.

Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>105 Md.App. 147, 158, 658 A.2d 1172 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to begin with an analysis of appellant\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s initial approval of the 2007 Budget.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Appellant challenges the Board\u2019s approval of the Surtax. Thus, she maintains \u201cthat the Board of Estimates did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>lawfully approve a Supplemental Tax on their properties for FY 2007, as it did not have before it a lawfully adopted Supplemental Tax proposal from the Authority\u2019s Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Noting that the Board cannot conduct business in the absence of a quorum, Floyd maintains that a quorum here necessarily consists of at least ten voting members of the Board, and thus the Board acted without a quorum. Conceding that Bylaw 2.12 provides for a quorum of nine members, Floyd insists that this provision is not controlling because the Authority \u201cis a governmental entity, created by statute for the purpose of imposing, collecting and spending a Supplemental Tax,\u201d and, \u201cunder the Corporations and Associations Article,\u201d the Board is not \u201cpermitted to conduct business with less than a majority____\u201d Given that there are nineteen authorized voting member positions, Floyd argues that the quorum must be ten, even if, because of unfilled vacancies, there are actually fewer than nineteen existing voting members on the Board. She asserts: \u201cAn act of less than a quorum of Board members is nothing but the act of individuals, and is void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">According to appellant, the provision in the Bylaws for a quorum of nine was the result of an \u201coversight,\u201d because the Bylaws \u201cwere never intended to designate a quorum of less than a majority....\u201d She continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">As pointed out to the court below during oral argument an examination of the initial By-laws [sic] indicates that the underlined word <em>\u2018voting\u2019 </em>was inserted into the text of subsection 2.03(f) to describe the Mayor\u2019s appointee as a voting member which would have had the effect of increasing the total voting membership from seventeen to eighteen, in conformity with the City Code. Simple neglect or failure to make the corresponding amendment to the quorum number, to increase it from nine (a majority of seventeen) to ten, would easily explain how the original eighteen-member body may have unintentionally appeared to be authorised to conduct business with less than a majority. Such a mistake might easily have been made, and overlooked, but cannot be used today to abrogate the common-law principle that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>quorum of a deliberative governmental body is at least a majority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">[T]he quorum for the Authority\u2019s Board was a fixed number; in order to provide a majority, the fixed number had to be no less than ten. It was error for the lower court to rule otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Appellees rely on Bylaw 2.12, which clearly provides for a quorum of nine.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> They dispute appellant\u2019s claim that the quorum of nine was established by \u201coversight,\u201d noting that the City approved Bylaw 2.12, and the Board has been employing a nine-member quorum since 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The Authority adds that the Board, as a \u201cpublic body,\u201d is subject to Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act, codified at Md.Code (2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-502(k) of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d). It notes that S.G. \u00a7 10-502(k)(2) defines a quorum as a majority of the members of a public body, or \u201cany different number that law requires.\u201d It also points to Bylaw 7.06, which obligates the Board to conduct meetings in accordance with the Enabling Law, the Ordinance, and the Bylaws, as supplemented, and, where not inconsistent, by Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, Newly Revised (\u201cRoberts\u201d). According to the Authority, Roberts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">flatly refutes the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a quorum must be at least a majority. In describing quorum requirements for boards, [Roberts] provides that the quorum is a majority of the members of the board \u201cunless a different quorum is fixed ... by the bylaws[.]\u201d Plainly, a quorum of less than a majority is entirely lawful. It is also sensible on a voluntary board such as the [Authority\u2019s] Board. As [Roberts] observes, a majority quorum may be appropriate in legislative bodies, such as the Congress, \u201cbut too large in most voluntary societies.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>In her reply, Floyd insists that \u201cthere is nothing to <em>empower </em>the Authority\u2019s Board to fix the quorum at less than a majority,\u201d i.e., ten persons. She claims that, absent a statute fixing a quorum, \u201ca majority of any body consisting of a definite number, is necessary to constitute a quorum.\u201d Acknowledging that C.A. \u00a7 2-408(b) authorizes some Maryland corporations to set quorums of less than a majority, appellant maintains that this provision does not apply to the Authority, a \u201cgovernmental body both politic and corporate,\u201d and \u201ca creature of the General Assembly,\u201d because the Legislature \u201chas never granted the Authority the power to lawfully meet and conduct business with less than a majority of the full voting Board.\u201d She also claims that \u201c[t]he Open Meetings Act may not be construed to authorize public bodies to convene less than a majority to transact their business.\u201d Even if the Board of Estimates approved Bylaw 2.12, Floyd insists that it \u201ccannot abrogate higher law\u201d and permit the Board to \u201cmeet and conduct public business with less than a majority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In its reply brief, the City impugns appellant\u2019s underlying position that the Board \u201cis a definite body composed of 19 members ....\u201d, and disputes appellant\u2019s position that a quorum consists of ten, i.e., a majority of the nineteen authorized voting members of the Board. The City points out that the Ordinance requires at least nineteen voting members, \u201cexcept during periods of temporary vacancies.\u201d Because of such vacancies, notes the City, the size of the voting membership is not definite or fixed at nineteen. It suggests that the quorum of nine \u201censures that there will be a substantial representation of the Board needed for a quorum.\u201d It explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Because the size of the voting membership is not fixed, but is rather the number of voting members sitting at a particular time, the Appellant\u2019s position that the quorum must be a majority of the voting members leads to the conclusion that the quorum can be less than ten. Of course, using the \u201cmajority of the sitting voting members\u201d formula to determine the quorum would lead to very small quorums at times. The bylaws, approved by the Board of estimates, wisely set the quorum at nine. Bylaws \u00a7 2.12. This allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the Board to function in time of temporary vacancies but guaranties that there will be a substantial number of voting members participating in the Board\u2019s decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The City reiterates that the Board \u201cmay adopt any bylaw that is not inconsistent with the ordinance or ... Art II, \u00a7 63 of the Charter.\u201d It also claims that C.A. \u00a7 2\u2014408(b) empowered the Authority, as a corporate body, to set a quorum of less than a majority. Moreover, the City maintains that Bylaw 2.12 is consistent with the Open Meetings Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We are readily persuaded that the circuit court properly found that a quorum of the Board consists of nine members. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In <em>Chisholm v. Hyattstown Volunteer Fire Dept., Inc., </em>115 Md.App. 58, 691 A.2d 776 (1997), we said, \u201c \u2018[b]y-laws are construed under principles governing the construction of ... contracts, primarily to effectuate the parties\u2019 intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 691 A.2d 776 (quoting <em>American Fed\u2019n of Teachers v. Lubman, </em>50 Md.App. 13, 19, 435 A.2d 801 (1981) (citations omitted)). Where the language of a contract is not ambiguous, a court generally will not look to parol or extrinsic evidence to vary its meaning. <em>Higgins v. Barnes, </em>310 Md. 532, 537, 530 A.2d 724 (1987); <em>Maslow v. Vanguri, </em>168 Md.App. 298, 317, 896 A.2d 408 (2006). Bylaw 2.12 clearly provides that \u201c[t]he actual presence of at least 9 voting members shall constitute a quorum for all regular and special meetings of the Board of Directors.\u201d Because there is no ambiguity in Bylaw 2.12, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that it fixed a quorum of nine members as the result of an \u201coversight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">We also disagree with appellant\u2019s claim that there was no statutory authority authorizing the Authority to adopt Bylaw 2.12. There are, in fact, several independent sources of this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">First, the Ordinance creating the Authority granted it the power, \u201csubject to approval of the Board of Estimates,\u201d to \u201cadopt, amend, and modify bylaws, consistent with the Enabling Legislation and this subtitle.\u201d Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-4(13). The Ordinance did not withhold from the Board the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>pass a bylaw setting a quorum of less than a majority, and Bylaw 2.12 is not in conflict with any provisions of the Enabling Law or the Ordinance. Second, the Authority\u2019s power to enact Bylaw 2.12 derives from C.A. \u00a7 2-408(b), which authorizes Maryland corporations to set quorums of less than a majority, and C.A. \u00a7 1-102, which provides that the Article applies to every Maryland corporation, except as otherwise provided by statute. In this regard, the Ordinance clearly states that, to the extent allowed under law, the Authority is a body corporate.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Appellant suggests that C.A. \u00a7 2\u2014408(b) does not apply to the Board because it is a \u201cgovernmental body.\u201d But, she cites no relevant authority to support her claim. The only case cited by appellant, <em>Heiskell v. Mayor, Etc., of Baltimore, </em>65 Md. 125, 4 A. 116 (1886), examined whether the Baltimore City Council, the council for a municipal corporation, could set the number of its members necessary to constitute a quorum. Unlike the City of Baltimore, however, the Authority is not a municipal corporation, as is evident from Md.Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 23A, which regulates municipal corporations. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u00a7 9.

Friendship Heights Citizens\u2019 Committee, </em>276 Md. 89, 344 A.2d 415 (1975). There, it noted that the Friendship Heights Special Taxing District, by statutory definition, is not a municipal corporation \u201cnor can it be, because it exercises no political powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 344 A.2d 415.

We decline to do so, for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">First, as appellees indicate, it can be difficult to procure participants for volunteer organizations. With this in mind, appellant seems to have overlooked that the quorum of nine actually protects the public from the potential for the conduct of a Board meeting with fewer than nine voting members. As the City points out, the size of the voting membership of the Board is not fixed. If, because of temporary vacancies on the Board\u2014which can happen with almost any volunteer organization\u2014the Board\u2019s active membership were less than nineteen members, and a quorum were defined as a majority of the voting members, as appellant suggests, the result could be a quorum of less than the nine presently required. By setting the quorum at nine, the District\u2019s residents are assured that there will be a reasonable number of voting members participating in the decisions of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Second, we are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s claim that a nine-member quorum undermines representative government. The Authority does not itself \u201cconduct the business of setting a Supplemental Tax rate and [spend] the tax.\u201d It is the Board of Estimates which must approve the actions of the Board in regard to the Surtax. This extra layer of approval allows people such as appellant to express concerns about the Board\u2019s actions to an elected body prior to any binding effect. Indeed, that is exactly what happened in this case; Ms. Floyd raised her concerns about the Board\u2019s action to the Board of Estimates before the latter body approved the 2007 Budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Before turning to the next contention, we shall review some additional, undisputed facts pertinent to the parties\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">As we indicated earlier, the District is divided into four quadrants, or Quads, each of which is allotted an at-large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>voting seat on the Board. <em>See </em>Bylaw 2.07 Quad representatives serve for one-year terms, commencing on January 1 in the year following their election to the Board. Bylaws 2.07(A) and 2.08. On October 18, 2005, when the Board conducted elections for at-large Quad seats, Tammy Mayer was elected to fill the Quad 4 Board seat as of January 2006. By November 2005, however, Ms. Mayer had decided not to assume a seat on the Board in January 2006. Accordingly, on December 13, 2005, the Board chose Mr. Gervais for the Quad 4 seat. He resides in Quad 4 and is registered to vote within the District.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">At trial, the Authority presented evidence in the form of a chart showing who held the voting and non-voting seats on the Board as of December 13, 2005, April 11, 2006, and June 21, 2006. That chart indicated that on December 13, 2005, the Quad 4 seat was vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Bylaw 2.09 authorizes the Board to fill vacancies created by the \u201cresignation, expiration, or other departure from the Board\u201d of a member who was not appointed by an elected official (ie., the Mayor or City Council) or by an association (ie., the constituent business and community associations within the District). Because Quad representatives hold seats based on elections, rather than appointments, Bylaw 2.09 applies to Quad seats that become vacant. Under Bylaw 2.09, a person appointed to such a vacancy only serves \u201cuntil the next annual meeting or such earlier or later time as his successor is elected and qualifies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Appellant contends that Gervais was not properly named to the Board because on December 13, 2005, \u201cthe 2005 Voting Board\u201d lacked \u201cthe authority to elect Michael Gervais to the 2006 voting Board.\u201d Even if the quorum is nine (as we have determined), appellant argues that the Board lacked a quorum when it appointed Gervais to the Board on December 13, 2005, and that a quorum was required for any action not taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>under Bylaw 2.09. She points out that only nine Board members were present at that meeting and one, Friedman, was not authorized to vote, because he was not a lawful Board member on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Appellant also challenges the Authority\u2019s belated reliance on Bylaw 2.09. Based on the minutes, she asserts that the Board did not rely on that provision to authorize Mr. Gervais\u2019s election, and it cannot do so \u201cretroactively\u201d to \u201clegitimize\u201d the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Even if the Board had relied on Bylaw 2.09, argues appellant, such reliance would have been misplaced. According to appellant, the Board can only invoke Bylaw 2.09 when a member has departed or resigned from the Board, resulting in a \u201cvacancy\u201d on an \u201cactual, sitting Board.\u201d In her view, Ms. Mayer\u2019s decision not to assume her seat on the Board, following her election, did not create a \u201cvacancy\u201d on the 2005 Board because Ms. Mayer never became a member of the \u201c2005 Board\u201d; her term would not have started until January 2006. In this regard, Floyd points to the testimony of Jennifer Martin. When Martin was asked if Ms. Mayer had ever actually taken her seat on the Board as of December 13, 2005, she replied: \u201cNo, her term didn\u2019t start until January of 2006.... \u201d Appellant continues: \u201cAs there was no \u2018vacancy\u2019 created on the 2005 Board by Ms. Mayer\u2019s withdrawal, there was no action for the 2005 Board to take under By-law 2.09.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Therefore, appellant contends that the circuit court \u201cerred\u201d when it \u201cagreed that the 2005 Board had acted under By-law 2.09 pursuant to Ms. Mayer\u2019s withdrawal when it elected Mr. Gervais to the 2006 Board.\u201d She explains: \u201cAn obvious difficulty with this interpretation and application of By-law 2.09 is the assigning of vacancy-filling authority <em>to the wrong Board.\u201d </em>Appellant asserts: \u201cThe relevant portion of By-law 2.09 provides only for replacement of a sitting Quadrant representative. Quadrant representatives are chosen during the preceding calendar year by an electorate. By-law 2.09 may not be construed to provide an <em>alternate </em>means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>electing a Quadrant representative for the coming year, bypassing the electorate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Floyd elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">Assuming ... that an individual elected to the 2006 Board can be considered to have \u201cresigned\u201d or \u201cdeparted\u201d in November of 2005 without ever having taken his or her seat, and can be construed as creating a \u201cvacancy\u201d thereby, then any such \u201cvacancy\u201d would occur only in the 2006 Board. Only the 2006 Board would be depleted by such an act, and only the \u201cremaining members\u201d of the 2006 Board would have the power, if any, to replace that individual under Bylaw 2.09; Of course, those \u201cremaining\u201d members would be the prospective 2006 Board members who had not yet taken their seats as of December 13, 2005 and would have no ability to act, whether to replace a member or otherwise, until <em>after they had taken their seats in January. </em>Thus, even assuming that By-law 2.09 could have been used to replace a Quadrant representative who had never taken her seat and never served, this power could only have accrued to the 2006 Board, and could only have been exercised after the 2006 Board was in place in January.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Claiming that Bylaw 2.09 does not permit the Board to bypass the electorate in selecting a Quad representative, Floyd also asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">[A]n entirely different procedure had been used in 2002 to replace an individual who was unable. to serve after an October election. On that occasion, it was acknowledged at a November 2002 Board meeting that a Quadrant election winner was not qualified to take her seat, and a new election would have to be held prior to the end of the calender year. At a special December meeting, the Board decided to hold a new election to fill the proposed vacancy____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Appellees regard appellant\u2019s position as untenable. The City asserts: \u201cIt was reasonable and in conformity with the policies expressed in the Charter and the ordinance for the lower court to construe [Bylaw] \u00a7 2.09 as permitting replace<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ment of Ms. Mayer with Mr. Gervais.\u201d In addition, it contends that \u201ca quorum is not needed to fill a vacancy, only a majority of the remaining directors.\u201d According to the City, on December 13, 2005, when the remaining members of the Board acted under Bylaw 2.09 to fill Ms. Mayer\u2019s position, nine of the remaining eleven voting members of the Board\u2014 more than a majority\u2014voted to replace Ms. Mayer with Mr. Gervais. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Friedman and Burnham were not proper members of the Board, the City notes that seven other Board members voted for Mr. Gervais, i.e., more than the five required to fill a vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Appellees also dispute Floyd\u2019s claim that there was no \u201cvacancy\u201d on the Board for Mr. Gervais to fill. The Authority asserts: \u201cWhether <em>Ms. Mayer\u2019s </em>resignation amounted to a \u2018resignation, expiration or other departure from the Board\u2019 is really the wrong question.\u201d The correct question is simply whether the Quad 4 seat was vacant by virtue of a resignation, expiration, or other departure of the Board member who preceded Mr. Gervais in the Quad 4 seat.\u201d According to the Authority, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">vacancy in December 2005 was, strictly speaking, not the result of Tammy Mayer\u2019s -withdrawal, because she would not have taken her seat on the Board until 2006. The vacancy in December 2005 existed because whoever had previously been in that seat had self-evidently departed from the Board some time before the December 13, 2005 Board meeting....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">When Tammy Mayer was elected in October 2005 it was expected that she would assume the Quad 4 seat in January 2006, and therefore there was no need to use Bylaw 2.09 to fill the Quad 4 vacancy for the short period between her election and her anticipated installation on the Board. When Ms. Mayer resigned in November, however, the situation changed. The Board then needed to fill the vacant Quad 4 seat. It was only because of Ms. Mayer\u2019s resignation that the Board needed to act under its Bylaw 2.09 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>authority.[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Appellees also dispute appellant\u2019s claim that another election was required to fill the vacancy on the Board. Indeed, they assert that appellant has not pointed to any rule, regulation, or bylaw requiring an election.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, they challenge appellant\u2019s argument that the \u201c2005 Board\u201d lacked the power to appoint a member of the \u201c2006 Board,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alg\">First, the distinction between the \u20192005 Board\u2019 and the \u20192006 Board\u2019 is an artificial one. There is no such eompartmentalization of Boards by calender year in the Ordinance or Bylaws. The fact is that most Board members serve two-year staggered terms. Ordinance \u00a7 6-6(d)(2); Bylaw 2.08.... Notably, the roster of the Board in December 2005, when Mr. Gervais was appointed, was much the same as it was in April 2006, when the Board, including Mr. Gervais, voted on the FY 2007 budget and Surtax rate____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">Second, there is nothing in the Bylaws, Ordinance or Enabling Law that prohibits a Board in 2005 from making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>an appointment that will commence in 2006. To the contrary, the Bylaws plainly contemplate that a Board may appoint members whose terms will commence in the following year....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">Third, if there were a legitimate distinction between the 2005 and 2006 Boards, such that only the Board in 2006 could appoint Mr. Gervais to a seat starting in January 2006, that issue was fully resolved by the Board on June 21, 2006, when it adopted a resolution pursuant to which the board, in 2006, fully ratified and affirmed Mr. Gervais\u2019s appointment to Quad 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In her reply brief, appellant argues: \u201cThe issue of Mr. Gervais\u2019 eligibility to move the adoption of the Supplemental Tax, and to vote on the matter, rests on the circumstances of his appointment to the Board on December 13, 2005.\u201d She maintains that the Board lacked a quorum when it named Mr. Gervais to the Board, \u201ceven using the number 9 instead of 10 ...,\u201d because Mr. Friedman \u201cwas neither a resident of the District<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> nor a property owner in the District on December 13, 200 5.\u201d Further, Floyd argues that, to the extent Bylaw 2.09 sanctioned the Board\u2019s action, it was invalid because the \u201cAuthority\u2019s Board, a governmental body, is a creature of the General Assembly, which has never granted the Authority the power to conduct business with less than a quorum present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Appellant also takes issue with the Authority\u2019s \u201cfactually new argument\u201d that Mr. Gervais was selected as a mid-term replacement for a 2005 Board member who vacated her seat. Characterizing the position as a \u201crevisionist explanation,\u201d Floyd asserts that \u201cthe new argument is plainly contradicted by the history of this action.... The final document in this history is the Authority\u2019s own official record of the December 13, 2005 meeting, in the form of the minutes clearly showing that the appointment of Mr. Gervais took place under item \u2018Nominations of new Board Members for 2006.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Finally, appellant argues that a bylaw that permits the sitting Board to specially fill an at-large seat, rather than hold an election, \u201cundermines and contradicts the nature and pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>pose of the \u2018at-large\u2019 position. She explains: \u201cWhen the City Council provided the Authority\u2019s Board with the ability to contain \u201c4 at-large voting members\u201d ... the intention could not have been to provide voting seats for Board members themselves to selectively fill by appointment, when <em>no other voting seats would be filled this way.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We conclude that Bylaw 2.09 authorized the Board to appoint Mr. Gervais. As indicated, the text of the Bylaw provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">In the event of resignation, expiration or other departure from the Board of a member not appointed by an elected official or an association, a majority of the remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum, may fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors. A director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy serves until the next annual meeting or such earlier or later time as his successor is elected and qualifies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The circuit court held that, pursuant to this provision, Mr. Gervais was properly selected by a majority of the remaining directors \u201cto fill a vacancy occasioned by the departure of the recently elected Quad 4 Board representative, Tammy Mayer.\u201d As noted, appellant insists that Mayer\u2019s decision to withdraw from consideration did not create a vacancy on the Board, since Mayer never assumed her seat. Even if technically correct, it is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Mr. Gervais was appointed to fill a seat on the Board that was to be filled by Ms. Mayer until she decided not to take a seat on the Board. The departure of the individual who preceded Ms. Mayer, and thus held the seat that Ms. Mayer was to fill, was the one who actually created a vacancy on the Board that was later filled by Mr. Gervais. Because Ms. Mayer never assumed a seat, the Board selected Mr. Gervais to fill the vacancy. Appellant does not explain why the Board would hold an election for the Quad 4 seat, and prepare to place the duly-elected Ms. Mayer in that seat, if the seat were not vacant. The fact that the record does not reveal any details about the individual who actually held the Quad 4 seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>before Ms. Mayer was chosen does not mean that there was no vacancy on the Board for Mr. Gervais to fill. Indeed, this assertion contradicts Ms. Floyd\u2019s concession at the hearing on the motion to amend judgment, when she said: \u201c[TJhere is nothing in the record of this case that explains why [the Quad 4] seat is vacant, we just know that it is vacant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">To be sure, as appellant indicates, the minutes of the meeting on December 13, 2005, show \u201cthat the appointment of Mr. Gervais took place under item <em>\u2018Nominations of new Board members for 2006.\u2019 \u201d </em>But, we do not see how this fact is dispositive; the Bylaws do not require that, in choosing a new member to fill a vacancy, the Board must assign a particular title to its action or explicitly cite the bylaw on which it relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We also reject appellant\u2019s arguments about the validity of Bylaw 2.09. We have already addressed these same arguments in rejecting appellant\u2019s insistence that the quorum for a meeting must be a majority of the authorized voting members of the Board, i.e., ten persons. The Ordinance authorized the Board to pass Bylaws, so long as they do not contradict the Ordinance or the Enabling Law. Appellant points to no such contradictions with respect to Bylaw 2.09; the Board properly employed that provision in appointing Mr. Gervais on December 13, 2005 as the Quad 4 Board representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Richard Burnham served on the Board for five years, including his service as the Board\u2019s treasurer for two years. He was appointed by the Old Goucher Business Alliance, one of several constituent organizations within the District that are entitled to appoint two voting members to the Board. See Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-6(e)(4). Of import here, Burnham is the sole owner and president of Graphic Imaging, Inc., a subchapter S corporation engaged in the printing and graphic design business. It is located at 107 East 25th Street, within the District. Graphic Imaging owns the property at that address, for which it pays the Supplemental Tax. Id. Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Burnham is not registered to vote within the District, nor does he reside in the District. Appellants\u2019 Brief at 24. Rather, Mr. Burnham served on the Board as the representative of a corporation he owns that is subject to the Supplemental Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Appellant challenged Richard Burnham\u2019s qualifications to serve as a voting member of the Board, claiming that he was neither a property owner nor a registered voter in the District, as required by Code, Art. 14, \u00a7 6-15(b). Moreover, Floyd argued that Burnham was not eligible to serve merely because of his ownership of a Subchapter S corporation, even if the corporation owned property within the District. Appellant urges that, in reaching the contrary conclusion, the circuit court relied on an \u201cincorrect\u201d and \u201can extremely problematic version of By-law 2.02(B),\u201d which \u201cwas never approved by the Board of Estimates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Citing Code, Art. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 6-6(e)(7) and 6-15(b), the City counters that \u201cMr. Burnham was qualified ... as the representative of a property owner.\u201d It contends that \u201ca person may serve as a voting member of the Board in the capacity of representative of a business that owns property within the District.\u201d Noting that a corporation can only act through individual representatives, the City claims that Mr. Burnham was qualified to serve on the Board based on his status as president and sole owner of Graphic Imaging, Inc., a Subchapter S corporation that owns property within the District. In its view, Mr. Burnham \u201cwas the representative of a qualified entity that owned property in the District.\u201d Appellees also maintain that a 1996 amendment to Bylaw 2.02(B) eliminated any doubt that a corporation owning property in the District has the right to hold a voting seat on the Board through a representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We first address appellant\u2019s contention that the version of Bylaw 2.02(B) on which the circuit court relied is \u201cfalsified\u201d and \u201cproblematic.\u201d The minutes of the Board of Estimates meeting of May 15, 1996, show that it approved the following amendment to the Authority\u2019s Bylaws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Section 2.02 BI\u2014(iv) An owner of property which is utilized for commercial purposes may designate an individual to represent the owner if: (a) the individual is (1) a tenant of the owner, (2) a corporate officer or partner of the tenant of the owner, or (3) a business representative or agent of the owner, and (b) the Owner authorizes and designates in writing the individual to represent the owner on the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">By contrast, the Authority\u2019s current published Bylaws, which the court below cited, omits Section \u201c(iv)\u201d and, instead, sets forth the text of the amendment in 2.02(B)(i), underneath the original text of that provision. The official version of Bylaw 2.02, as cited by the circuit court, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">B. Unless otherwise required by the Ordinance, the Board shall be subject to the following considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">i. At least a majority of the Board shall be composed of owners or representatives of property owners subject to the tax imposed by this subtitle.

The Board shall endeavor to maintain representatives on the Board from professionals practicing in the district, the retail merchants within the district, and the tenants of properties in the district; however, no minimum representation from the groups mentioned in this sub-paragraph shall apply; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">iii. Consistent with the encouragement of partnerships between the authority and property owners exempt from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the tax imposed by the Ordinance, the Board is encouraged to consider representation of such partners on the Board.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Regardless of the causes of the discrepancy between the location of what the Board of Estimates approved and where in the Bylaws it was published by the Authority, this does not render erroneous the circuit court\u2019s reliance on the published Bylaws. There is no substantive difference between the approved amendment and the published Bylaws that could have influenced the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">As we have seen, Bylaw 2.02(B) provides: \u201cA voting member of the Board must be eligible to vote in the election under Section 260 of the Ordinance.\u201d Section 260 of the Ordinance, as codified in the Code, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u00a7 6-15 Election approval process</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">(b) Eligibility criteria</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">The following persons are eligible to vote subject to the limitations that no person may have more than 1 vote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">(1) owners of property within the District which is subject to tax under \u00a7 6-8; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">(2) voters registered to vote within the District.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">We must determine whether these provisions authorized the Board to count Mr. Burnham as a voting member, given that he neither lived in nor personally owned property in the District, but did own a corporation that owned property in the District. In particular, we must ascertain the meaning of the word \u201cowner\u201d in order to determine whether Mr. Burn-ham could serve as a voting Board member.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">As we noted above, in interpreting bylaws we apply the general principles of contract construction. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>process, we construe a contract \u201cas a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intentions.\u201d <em>Sullins v.

Parol evidence is ordinarily inadmissible to vary, alter, or contradict a contract that is complete and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Maslow, </em>168 Md.App. at 317, 896 A.2d 408 (quoting <em>Higgins v. Barnes, </em>310 Md. 532, 537, 530 A.2d 724 (1987)). In our view, Bylaw 2.02(B) is unambiguous. Therefore, we decline to consider the \u201clegislative history\u201d proffered by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The plain meaning of the word \u201cowner\u201d is not restricted to a natural person. It is \"widely understood that a variety of non-corporeal entities, such as corporations, partnerships, and trusts, are capable of owning real property. The language of the Bylaws, including by reference the language of Section 260 of the Ordinance, does not show any objective intent to restrict the meaning of the word \u201cowner\u201d to include only natural persons. On the contrary, Bylaw 2.02(B)(i)(a) provides that an owner may designate an individual to represent the owner if the owner is a \u201ccorporate officer\u201d of the owner. This provision would be rendered meaningless if we adopted appellant\u2019s restrictive definition of owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Even if we were to consider parol evidence, we would reach the same conclusion. Sparks, the Authority\u2019s initial Administrator, testified that corporations that owned property subject to the Surtax were eligible voters in the referendum held to approve the establishment of the Authority. The list of eligible voters included every property in the proposed District, whether it was residential, commercial, nonprofit, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>governmental. Thus, corporations that owned property within the District were provided ballots and allowed to vote, in conformity with the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We concur with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Burnham was eligible to vote on April 11,2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We next consider a challenge based on Bylaw 5.03. As noted, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">5.03 <em>Supplemental Tax.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">A. The Board shall recommend to the Board of Estimates the supplemental tax rate each year as part of the financial plan. During the process of adopting the financial plan, the Board shall approve the supplemental tax rate in a separate vote different from the vote of the Board for the purpose of adopting the financial plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">B. <em>The supplemental tax rate must be approved by a majority of all of the voting Board members.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">D. The supplemental tax rate shall remain the same unless a majority of all voting members vote to change it. If a majority of all the voting Board members do not vote to change the supplemental tax rate, then the Board shall submit a financial plan to the Board of Estimates for approval containing the existing supplemental tax rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2i\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Appellant insists that Bylaw 5.03(B), requiring \u201ca majority of all of the voting Board members\u201d to approve the Supplemental Tax rate, means that a majority of all authorized voting board members\u2014ten members\u2014had to approve the 2007 Budget. According to appellant, the City Council serves as a \u201cmodel\u201d for the \u201cintended meaning of the minimum vote requirement of Authority By-law 5.03(B). She contends that because there were nineteen authorized voting Board members on April 11, 2006, ten affirmative votes were required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>adopt an annual Supplemental Tax rate for Board of Estimates approval.\u201d In essence, she claims that \u201cthe number of votes required for various actions was calculated according to the number of <em>authorized </em>members, not the number of members serving at any given time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Appellant buttresses this contention with a policy argument. She explains that the \u201cpublic policy inherent in such an interpretation is to protect the Supplemental Tax payers throughout the District from the act of a small number of voting Board members at times when participation on the Board does not, or cannot, meet the \u2018minimum representation\u2019 standards of the City Code.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201cIt is right that weak participation should hamper the Board\u2019s ability to impose a Supplemental Tax throughout the District. The annual voting on financial matters is the most important business to be done by the Authority\u2019s Board. It must be done correctly, or not done at all.\u201d Appellant concludes that \u201cthe Board must sustain a membership sufficient to reach agreement among at least ten qualified individuals as to the following year\u2019s Supplemental Tax rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In effect, appellant interprets Bylaw \u00a7 5.03(B) to require approval of the Surtax by a majority of the number of voting member <em>positions </em>authorized by law, rather than by a majority of actual members. Because there were nineteen authorized voting member positions, Ms. Floyd argues that ten votes were needed to set the Supplemental Tax rate, regardless of the number of voting members actually in place at the time of such a vote. Appellant concludes that, while the disqualification of Friedman \u201cdoes not affect the April 11, 2006 vote if only nine are needed, when the number of qualified voters is correctly fixed at ten, the loss of Eric Friedman, the tenth voter, voids the approval of the FY 2007 Supplemental Tax.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The City responds that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of Bylaw 5.03 requires a majority of all current, existing voting members, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>interpretation \u201cconsistent ... with the realities of volunteer organizations, which can often have vacancies among their authorized membership.\u201d Further, it maintains that appellant\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201cmajority of all of the voting Board members\u201d would impermissibly add to the end of the Bylaw the words \u201cpositions authorized by law.\u201d Further, the City claims that, unless the Board voted to change the tax rate, \u201cit was required to submit to the Board of Estimates a financial plan with the same tax rate as that from the previous year.\u201d Noting that the Board did not vote to change the tax rate, it contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Thus, even if Ms. Floyd is correct in arguing that the Authority\u2019s Board did not vote properly on the supplemental tax rate, and thus did not \u201cvote to change the supplemental tax rate,\u201d Bylaws, \u00a7 5.03(D), the Board was required to do exactly what it did\u2014submit to the Board of Estimates a budget utilizing the existing supplemental tax rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">According to the Authority, appellant\u2019s argument \u201camounts to re-writing the statute, and the trial court rejected it.\u201d It adds that, \u201cunder Bylaw 5.03(B) a majority vote, however that phrase is interpreted, is required only if the Board wants to change the Supplemental Tax rate. That was not the case here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Appellant replies that the Board of Estimates may not approve the Authority\u2019s budget without action by the Authority\u2019s Board, even if the Authority leaves the supplemental tax rate unchanged. Moreover, she asserts that Bylaw 5.03(B) required a majority of the Board\u2019s authorized members to approve the 2007 Budget, because the Authority is a \u201cgovernmental entity,\u201d like the Baltimore City Council, and \u201cit is a common practice for governmental entities to require the approval of a full quorum for the passage of important business items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The circuit court found that a majority of all voting members voted to maintain the existing tax rate. In rejecting appellant\u2019s position, it said: \u201cEven if the supplemental tax rate had to be approved by a majority of all the voting Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>members, the Court interprets this by-law provision to mean a majority of all the voting Board members duly elected and/or appointed and eligible to vote at any given time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On April 11, 2006, there were fourteen voting members on the Board. It follows that eight members constituted a majority of all of the then-existing voting members. Because there were only fourteen voting members in place on April 11, 2006, a vote of nine in favor of the Supplemental Tax was enough to carry the issue. In fact, there were ten voting members present and they unanimously agreed to retain the current tax rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The 2007 Budget consisted of two proposals: a financial plan and a supplemental tax rate. The Board held separate votes on these two components, and unanimously approved both. Bylaw 5.03(D) requires the Board to \u201csubmit a financial plan to the Board of Estimates for approval containing the existing tax rate.\u201d But, Bylaw 5.03(D) only requires the Board to approve the supplemental tax rate if it seeks to change the rate. The Board left the rate unchanged, so it did not have to hold a vote on the Supplemental Tax. Consequently, no matter how we construe the meaning of the word \u201cmajority\u201d in Bylaw 5.03(B), which applies to a change in the tax rate, there is no merit to appellant\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s approval of the Surtax.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">As to the financial plan, the number of Board members required to approve the plan is not fixed by Bylaw 5.03(B); that bylaw applies only to the vote on the Supplemental Tax rate. Instead, Bylaw 2.12 applies to the vote on the financial plan. It sets nine voting members as the quorum for Board meetings and also states: \u201cThe act of a majority of <em>voting members in attendance </em>at a Board of Directors meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the entire Board of Directors.\u201d (Emphasis added). As we concluded above, a quorum of nine members was present at the Board\u2019s April 11, 2006 meeting, and a majority of \u201cvoting members in attendance\u201d voted to submit the financial plan containing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>existing tax rate to the Board of Estimates, in accordance with Bylaw 2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">APPEALS OF STEPHEN GEWIRTZ AND PAMELA WILSON DISMISSED.

The Authority acknowledges that the Board held an election in 2002 to fill a vacancy, but it distinguishes that situation from the one in 2005 that led to Mr. Gervais\u2019s appointment. As the Authority explains, in October 2002, Debra Dodd was elected to the Quad 2 Board seat, but after the election the Board discovered she lived in Quad 1. Appellee asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">What happened in 2002 was that a flawed election process produced a flawed, and illegal, result. The Board therefore held a new election. By contrast, in 2005 Tammy Mayer was duly elected to Quad 4. There was no flaw in the election process. When she resigned before her term started, that created the prospect that the Quad 4 seat, already vacant, would remain vacant for yet another year unless the Board took steps to fill it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b472-14\">.
