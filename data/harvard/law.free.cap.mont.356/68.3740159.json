The District Court of the Twenty-First Judicial District held that Ashbys had an easement by necessity and defined the scope of the easement. Both sides appeal and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u00b62 Ashbys present issues for review that we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court erred in determining the scope of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred in failing to award Ashbys damages based upon a claim of interference with the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"Agx\">\u00b65 Maechlings present issues for review that we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A2K\">\u00b66 Issue Three: Whether the District Court erred in declaring that an implied easement by necessity exists across property of Maechlings to reach property owned by Ashbys.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">\u00b67 Issue Four: Whether the District Court erred in determining that West County Line Road is a public road.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">\u00b68 Issue Five: Whether the District Court erred in determining that the easement by necessity allows access to Ashbys\u2019 property for one residence. We deem this to be related to the scope of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b69 The property at issue is west of U.S. Highway 93 in northern Ravalli County, Montana, and is bordered on the north by Missoula County. In 1932 Ravalli County acquired tax deed title to a large tract of land that included all of the property now owned by the parties. At that time the West County Line Road, which runs east-west along the Ravalli-Missoula County line, entered the east end of the large Ravalli County tract and provided access to it. In 1934 the County sold to George Jones the property now owned by Maechlings. The County retained the property now owned by Ashbys and sold it to Robert McKenzie in 1935.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ashbys\u2019 tract is 120 acres and lies to the west of Maechlings\u2019 property. Maechling and Alcosser own and reside on 30 acres immediately east of Ashbys\u2019 land, and Dalton owns and resides on a tract immediately east of Maechling and Alcosser.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b610 No established roads have ever entered the Ashbys\u2019 property and no permanent residence or agricultural use was ever established there. There is an irrigation ditch that crosses the parcel, but it has not been developed other than three episodes of logging, one in the 1800s, another in the 1970s and another conducted by Ashbys in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b611 Ashbys bought their property in late 2004 along with a separate 150 acre parcel from the same seller. They knew at the time of purchase that there was no established access to the property and that their title insurance policy excepted access. Maechlings had for some time prior to 2004 maintained a locked gate on their property at the end of West County Line Road. The Road did not and apparently never has extended to the property now owned by Ashbys. In 2005 Ashbys wrote Maechling and Alcosser claiming an easement by necessity across their land for purposes of logging and offering not to sue them if Maechling and Alcosser sold Ashbys a perpetual non-exclusive easement for $10. Maechlings declined the offer, and this event precipitated Ashbys\u2019 claim for interference with the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b612 Ashbys sued in July 2005 seeking to establish that they had an easement by necessity across Maechlings\u2019 property to reach their 120-acre parcel, and for damages based upon Maechlings\u2019 alleged interference with the claimed easement. In February, 2006 Ashbys moved for summary judgment on the easement issue. In October, 2006 the District Court denied Ashbys\u2019 motion on the ground that they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>not met their burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the easement by necessity existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b613 In March, 2007 Ashbys again moved for summary judgment, and in June Maechlings also moved for summary judgment. On August 31, 2007 the District Court denied Maechlings\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to Ashbys, holding that West County Line Road is a public road, and that Ashbys have an easement by necessity across Maechlings\u2019 land to reach the road. Immediately after the District Court ruling, Ashbys arrived on Maechlings\u2019 land at the end of West County Line Road, removed the locked gate and constructed a road to their property across Maechlings\u2019 property. Maechlings have not blocked the access since the August 31, 2007, District Court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b614 In March, 2008, Ashbys moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of the scope of the easement, requesting that the \u201cCourt determine, as a matter of law, that the scope of the easement that arose in 1934 is unlimited other than that such use must be in accordance with laws that govern the normal use and development of real property in Ravalli County and the State of Montana.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maechlings also moved for reconsideration of the August 31, 2007 order regarding the existence of an easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b615 In July, 2008, the District Court denied Maechlings\u2019 motion for reconsideration, denied Ashbys\u2019 motion on the scope of the easement and granted summary judgment for Maechlings and against Ashbys on the claim for interference with the easement. The District Court then held an evidentiary hearing in September, 2008 on the scope of the easement. Witnesses testified and exhibits were received.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b616 The District Court entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment in November, 2008, and amended findings in January, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u00b617 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo, using the same standards provided in M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Spinler v. Allen, </em>1999 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 139, 983 P.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b618 A district court\u2019s findings of fact will be upheld if they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Steiger v. Brown, </em>2007 MT 29, \u00b6 16, 336 Mont. 29, 152 P.3d 705. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b619 We first consider the pivotal issue of whether the District Court properly held that an easement by necessity exists across Maechlings\u2019 land to access the Ashby land. Montana law has long recognized the existence of easements by necessity as a species of implied easements. At the same time, easements by necessity are \u201cconsidered with <em>extreme </em>caution\u201d because they deprive the servient tenement owner of property rights \u201cthrough <em>mere </em>implication.\u201d <em>Graham v. Mack, </em>216 Mont. 165, 174, 699 P.2d 590, 596 (1984) (emphasis in original). Easements by necessity arise from a legal fiction that the owner of a tract of land would not isolate a portion of it without having intended to leave a way of access to the parcel over the lands being severed. <em>Wolf v. Owens, </em>2007 MT 302, \u00b6 16, 340 Mont. 74, 172 P.3d 124. Two essential elements of an easement by necessity are unity of ownership and strict necessity. <em>Watson v. Dundas, </em>2006 MT 104, \u00b6 32, 332 Mont. 164, 136 P.3d 973. The proponent of the easement by necessity must prove the necessary elements by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33, 40-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b620 Unity of ownership exists where the owner of a tract of land severs part of the tract without providing an outlet to a public road. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 33. A single owner must at one time have owned both the tract to be benefited by the easement and the tract across which the easement would pass. <em>Loomis v. Luraski, </em>2001 MT 223, \u00b6 49, 306 Mont. 478, 36 P.3d 862. Unity of ownership can originate decades before the judicial determination of whether there is an easement by necessity. <em>Kelly v. Burlington Northern, </em>279 Mont. 238, 244-45, 927 P.2d 4, 7-8 (1996) (unity of ownership traced to 1891). The easement by necessity is created by operation of law at the time of severance of the parcels of land. <em>Albert G. Hoyem Trust v. Galt, </em>1998 MT 300, \u00b6 17, 292 Mont. 56, 968 P.2d 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b621 In this case it is undisputed that in 1932 Ravalli County owned a tract of land referred to as the tax deed parcel that included the land now owned by all parties to this litigation. It is also undisputed that in 1934 the County severed parts of the larger tract to Maechlings\u2019 predecessors in interest and then to Ashbys\u2019 predecessors in interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Therefore, the unity of ownership requirement was clearly met.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b622 The element of strict necessity requires that there is no practical access to a public road from the landlocked parcel. <em>Kelly, </em>279 Mont. at 244, 927 P.2d at 7. Strict necessity must exist at the time the tracts are severed from the original ownership <em>and </em>at the time the easement is exercised. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6 32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A developed way of access to the landlocked parcel need not actually exist at the time of severance, and an easement by necessity is \u201cdistinguished from other implied easements on the simple ground that [a developed way] need not be in existence at the time of conveyance ....\u201d <em>Schmid v. McDowell, </em>199 Mont. 233, 237, 649 P.2d 431, 433 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b623 In this case the District Court concluded upon a review of the evidence that there was no evidence of any practical road to connect Ashbys\u2019 parcel to a public road. Severance of the parcel now owned by Maechlings\u2019 landlocked the parcel now owned by Ashbys. No substantial evidence appears to contradict that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b624 Maechlings contend that the District Court should have found that quiet title actions brought in 1971 and 2001 extinguished any easement by necessity to serve the Ashby tract. The District Court considered but rejected the contention that the decrees in those two actions extinguished the easement by necessity, finding that while the predecessors to the Ashbys were well known, they were not made parties to the actions. The District Court further found that service by publication upon \u201call unknown persons\u201d was not effective to bind known individuals who can be identified with reasonable diligence. <em>Baertsch v. Lewis &amp; Clark County, </em>256 Mont. 114, 125, 845 P.2d 106, 113 (1992). The District Court therefore properly decided that the prior quiet title actions did not bar the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b625 The dissent argues that Ashbys failed to demonstrate strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>necessity because Ravalli County, as the predecessor owner of the relevant parcels, had the power to condemn an easement across the servient property to provide access to a public road. First, this issue should not be considered because, as the dissent acknowledges, it was not raised in the District Court and was noted only in passing on appeal. Second, the primary authority for the condemnation rule is <em>Leo Sheep Co. v. U.S., </em>440 U.S. 668, 99 S. Ct. 1403 (1979). <em>Leo Sheep </em>arose out of the checkerboard land ownership that resulted from grants of alternate sections of Federal land to the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1860s. The United States argued that it had an easement by necessity across lands formerly granted to the Union Pacific but now owned by Leo Sheep Co. to reach a recreation area on Federal land. The Supreme Court held that because the United States could condemn a right of way it could not demonstrate the strict necessity required to secure an easement. Since the Ashbys are not a governmental entity with the power of eminent domain, the <em>Leo Sheep </em>case does not resolve the present dispute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b626  Therefore, since there was clear and convincing evidence of both unity of ownership and strict necessity, the District Court properly concluded that an easement by necessity existed to provide access to the Ashby tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b627 The second issue we consider is whether the District Court properly concluded that the West County Line Road is a public road. An easement by necessity exists, if at all, to connect the landlocked tract of land to a public road. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b628 Maechlings contended that the West County Line Road is not a public road and therefore an easement by necessity could not be implied to provide access to it. The District Court received and carefully considered substantial historical evidence as to the nature of the West County Line Road. Based upon this evidence the District Court granted summary judgment to Ashbys, concluding that Ravalli County had declared the Road to be a public highway in 1894, and that the Road was already opened at that time with the exception of a one-half mile section. The District Court also concluded that the Road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>terminated at the northwest corner of Section 3, on land now owned by Maechlings, but not extending to the land now owned by Ashbys.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b629 Maechlings contended in District Court that the West County Line Road was never properly adopted as a public way. The District Court properly concluded that the Road is a public way and has been since 1894, relying on decisions from this Court recognizing the difficulty of reconstructing the detailed history of county roads created as much as 100 years ago. In Reid <em>v. Park County, </em>192 Mont. 231, 236, 627 P.2d 1210, 1213 (1981), this Court adopted \u201cthe rule that it is sufficient if the [county] record taken as a whole shows that a public road was created. Otherwise the burden on the public in a particular case to prove a public road was created so many years ago may well be insurmountable.\u201d Requiring production of documentary evidence of events that occurred long ago can be impracticable, <em>Powell County v. 5 Rockin\u2019 MS Angus Ranch, </em>2004 MT 337, \u00b6 25, 324 Mont. 204, 102 P.3d 1210, and there is a disputable presumption that official duty has been regularly performed. Section 26-1-602(5), MCA. Discrepancies in the description or location of a road in old county documents are not sufficient to turn a county road into private property. <em>Powell County, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b630  Here, the fact that the full length of the road was not opened in 1894 does not alter its status as a county road. <em>Bolinger v. Bozeman, </em>158 Mont. 507, 509, 493 P.2d 1062, 1063 (1972). Mere non-use, even for extended periods of time, is generally insufficient alone to indicate an intent to abandon a public way. <em>Baertsch, </em>256 Mont. at 122, 845 P.2d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b631 The record in this case, as explained in detail by the District Court\u2019s orders, sufficiently established that Ravalli County created and dedicated the West County Line Road as a public road. The District Court was correct in concluding that there were no material facts concerning whether the Road was created and that summary judgment on that issue was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b632 We next consider the issue of the scope of Ashbys\u2019 easement by necessity. Both sides appeal from the District Court\u2019s determination of the scope of the easement. Ashbys contend that the easement should be broader, while Maechlings contend that it is too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b633 The issue arose in the District Court upon Ashbys\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment in support of their contention that the scope of the easement is unlimited as long as it serves some use of the property and that use complies with applicable law. Ashbys have not specified any use they contemplate for their land, and in fact disclaim any plans for using it. They similarly did not specify the parameters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>of the easement by necessity, other than asserting that it must be sufficient to allow them to make any lawful use of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b634 After conducting an evidentiary hearing and after extensive review of the facts and law, the District Court concluded that the scope of the Ashby easement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">is approximately 12-15 feet wide, as it currently exists, for one single-family residential, non-commercial use by owners of the Plaintiffs\u2019 Property, their lawful successors and assigns, including recreational access to wildlands on Plaintiffs\u2019 property and for irrigation system inspection, repair, maintenance and use, and use by Plaintiffs related to forest thinning and logging consistent with reasonable and responsible forest practices and for no other. All other uses or use by persons other than lawful owners, successors or assigns of Plaintiffs\u2019 property shall exceed the scope of this easement and is prohibited. This easement by necessity shall automatically terminate if and when other legal alternate easement access is obtained to Plaintiffs\u2019 Property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b635 Ashbys contend that the scope of their easement must be unlimited in order to serve any use they can lawfully make of the property. Maechlings contend that the easement as decreed is too broad in that it allows use for residential purposes and there has never been a residence on the Ashby property.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b636 The law in Montana on the scope of an implied easement by necessity begins with <em>Herrin v. Sieben, </em>46 Mont. 226, 127 P. 323 (1912), one of the first Montana cases on the subject. In that case this Court held that easements by necessity cannot be used \u201cat will,\u201d but must be exercised with \u201cdue regard to the rights of both parties\u201d so that the use \u201cdoes not encroach upon the land of his grantor further than circumstances render it necessary.\u201d <em>Sieben, </em>46 Mont. at 235, 127 P. at 328. The District Court held that the <em>Sieben </em>case stands for the \u201cclear expectation that the dominant estate\u2019s access needs will be balanced with the servient estate\u2019s interests, and restricted in that such access cannot lawfully encroach upon the servient estate more than the circumstances rendered necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b637 This is a reasoned and appropriate statement of the basic scope of an easement by necessity. If such easements were unlimited, the property rights and property values of the servient estate owner could be materially impacted by a right of easement that in the final analysis arises only from a legal fiction. The property rights of the servient estate owner merit more protection under Montana law than would be the case if easements by necessity were unlimited. Those authorities that allow easements by necessity to be expanded to fit any lawful use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>imagined by the dominant estate owner fail to give sufficient consideration to the rights of the servient estate owner, which are no less important. <em>See e.g. Morrell v. Rice, </em>622 A.2d 1156 (Me. 1993). Implied negative easements are viewed with \u201cextreme caution\u201d since the servient landowner loses the use and control of some portion of his property. <em>Graham, </em>216 Mont. at 174, 699 P.2d at 596. This extreme caution should be observed both in determining whether an easement by necessity exists and, if so, in determining its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b638 The District Court also relied upon language in <em>Tungsten Holdings v. Kimberlin, </em>2000 MT 24, 298 Mont. 176, 994 P.2d 1114, as to the scope of implied easements. <em>Tungsten </em>did not involve an easement by necessity, but this Court endorsed the concept that a decision on the scope of an implied easement should consider \u201cthe actual uses being made [of the dominant estate] at the time of the severance, such uses as the facts and circumstances show were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of the conveyance, and such uses as the parties might reasonably have expected from future uses of the dominant tenement.\u201d <em>Tungsten, </em>\u00b6 27. Such evidence may be scarce in the case of an easement by necessity when, as in the present case, the severance occurred decades before issues arose as to the use of the easement. Nonetheless, if such evidence is available, it should be considered in determining the scope of an easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b639 Here, there is no evidence of the actual contemplation of Ravalli County or its purchasers as to the present and future use of the property in 1934. The County acquired the land in a Depression-era tax foreclosure but was able to sell portions of it and return it to the tax rolls a few years later. There is no evidence that the County ever used the property and it is therefore likely that the County\u2019s interest and expectation at the time was to realize tax income from the tract. There is evidence that the Ashby land was at that time forested wildland with no established public vehicular access route. The evidence also shows that the Ashby land had been logged in the late 19th century but otherwise had been used, if at all, for wildland recreational purposes. Similarly, the evidence is that at the time of severance the area surrounding the County tax parcel was rural, forested, agricultural and the site of scattered rural residential dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b640  Therefore, nothing in the history or condition of the property at the time of severance would support a finding that the extent of the implied easement by necessity across the land of the servient estates should be unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00b641 The District Court also properly considered that an easement by necessity, while not unlimited in scope, is not limited to the precise uses and prevailing technology at the time of severance. So, if the severance occurred at a time prior to the general use of motor vehicles and electric power, an easement by necessity may still allow for \u201creasonable technological developments\u201d as long as the use does not cause unreasonable damage or interference with the rights of the servient estate owner. See <em>e.g. Schumacher v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>663 N.W.2d 921, 924 (Mich. App. 2003). Thus, modern vehicle access and utility services may be allowed as part of an easement by necessity even though the easement arose as a legal matter before the general use of such improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b642 The District Court here properly recognized these principles and allowed for non-commercial recreational and residential vehicular access by road to the Ashby property. The District Court expressly did not address gates, cattle guards, underground or other utility transmission lines, because \u201c[although invited to do so by the Court, neither party\u201d addressed those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b643 Ashbys did not provide evidence upon which the District Court might have fashioned different parameters for the easement by necessity. They disclaimed having any specific plans, uses or needs for the property and only asserted that they had the right to do anything that the law allowed and that the easement must accommodate their future decisions, whatever they might be. By that reasoning, such disparate uses as a cattle feed lot, a gravel mine, a dirt track motorcycle racing venue or a high-density subdivision all might be legally permissible on the Ashby tract. It is not reasonable to impose such potential unknown and unlimited burdens on Maechlings\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b644 The District Court properly considered the current nature of the area in which the property is located in northern Ravalli County. The area surrounding the Ashby tract is mixed. To the immediate west is Forest Service land. The area is largely rural with scattered, low-intensity residential uses on larger lots or acreage. The District Court\u2019s decision to allow one single-family residence on the Ashby property, to be served by the easement, is a reasonable reflection of land use as it has developed in the area. The District Court reached a reasoned and proper decision on the scope of the easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b645 We next consider Ashbys\u2019 claim that the District Court erred in not awarding them damages for Maechlings\u2019 interference with the easement. Ashbys claim that they are entitled to damages of over $100,000 because Maechlings\u2019 rejection of the $10 perpetual easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>in 2005 caused them to have to acquire a temporary easement from a third party to conduct the logging on the property in 2007. The District Court granted summary judgment against Ashbys on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b646 The District Court noted that prior to its ruling in August, 2007, holding that the easement by necessity existed, Ashbys\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the existence of the easement had been denied. Further, after August 31, 2007 Ashbys used the easement without interference from Maechlings.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b647  While the essential acts that gave rise to the easement by necessity arose in the 1930s, Ashbys\u2019 right to the easement was not established until August 31,2007. Prior to that time Maechlings could not have wrongfully interfered with Ashbys\u2019 easement. <em>Stokes v. State, </em>2007 MT 169, \u00b6 10, 338 Mont. 165, 162 P.3d 865.

This entanglement is made all the worse when the litigation is poorly pleaded, poorly researched, poorly briefed, and poorly argued-as unfortunately is the case here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it is apparent on the face of the record that the easement by necessity claimed by the Ashbys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>does not exist for the simple reason that at the time the alleged I dominant tenement (the Ashbys\u2019 property) and the alleged servient tenement (Maechling and Alcosser\u2019s property) were severed from common ownership, they were held by a public entity (Ravalli County) which had the power to condemn a right-of-way, and thus there was no \u201cstrict necessity\u201d for an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b651 At the outset, I note that Maechling and Alcosser\u2019s current counsel made this exact point during oral argument and in the Appellees\u2019 Cross Appeal Reply Brief on appeal. The problem is that neither he nor his predecessor argued this specific legal theory in the District Court, and \u201c[t]he general rule in Montana is that this Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory.\u201d <em>Unified Indus., Inc. v.

In <em>Leichtfuss v. Dabney, </em>2005 MT 271, 329 Mont. 129, 122 P.3d 1220, the parties were arguing over whether Dabney\u2019s use of the easement in question constituted an increased burden on Leichtfuss\u2019s servient property. But both parties largely ignored the antecedent issue of whether the easement, which had been established through prescriptive use by the holder of a life estate, survived the termination of that life estate. At best, the briefing on this issue was \u201cnot particularly artful\u201d and the parties\u2019 arguments were \u201cunderdeveloped.\u201d <em>Leichtfuss, </em>\u00b6 37 n. 8. Yet, although under these circumstances we might otherwise have declined to address the issue, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201ca court may consider an issue \u2018antecedent to ... and ultimately dispositive of the dispute before it, even an issue the parties fail to identify and brief.\u201d <em>United States Nat.

Similarly, \u201c[w]hen an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.\u201d <em>United States Nat.

Moreover, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>boundaries of our opinions were circumscribed by the inadequacies of the briefs submitted on appeal, then in many cases we would be issuing opinions that set bad precedent and confuse, rather than clarify, the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><em>Leichtfuss, </em>\u00b6 37 n. 8 (ellipsis, asterisks, and brackets in original).

And the same is true of the more specific question of whether \u201cstrict necessity\u201d existed at the time of severance. In this regard, Maechling and Alcosser have always maintained that there was no \u201cstrict necessity\u201d for an easement over what is now their property. While the specific theory that Ravalli County lacked \u201cstrict necessity\u201d because it had the power to condemn an easement was raised belatedly, addressing this issue is an integral step in our analysis and is ultimately dispositive of the dispute before us. Indeed, as discussed below, the law fully supports Maechling and Alcosser on this point. Thus, we \u201cset bad precedent and confuse, rather than clarify, the law\u201d by ignoring Maechling and Alcosser\u2019s argument and affirming an easement by necessity despite caselaw to the contrary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Leichtfuss, </em>\u00b6 37 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b654 Turning, then, to the question of \u201cstrict necessity,\u201d I conclude that the following undisputed facts and well-established legal principles dictate the resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b655 1. The real properties at issue here, now owned by Ashbys, Maechling, Alcosser, and Dalton, were held in common ownership by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Ravalli County in 1934. All of these properties, in turn, were part of a larger tract the County acquired by tax deed in 1932. The larger tract is referred to in the record as the \u201cTax Parcel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b656 2. In July 1934, the County conveyed the properties now owned by Maechling, Alcosser, and Dalton, plus several adjoining tracts, to George W. Jones. The County retained the property now owned by the Ashbys (hereinafter, the Ashby Property). The following depiction of the properties is included as an exhibit to the Ashbys\u2019 motions for summary judgment. It has been reduced to 6.5 inches wide so that it could fit on the following page, and labels have been added identifying the properties. Also, the Ashbys\u2019 original diagram misrepresents the full extent of the Tax Parcel. Based on the property description contained in the 1932 tax deed to Ravalli County, the Tax Parcel also includes the shaded area shown below.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The Tax Parcel is represented by the heaviest bold line, and the relevant properties within the Tax Parcel are represented by the lighter bold lines and the dashed lines. The Ashby Property consists of the three adjoining tracts that are each numbered 7. The property sold to Jones consists of the seven adjoining tracts that are numbered 9,10, 5, 16, 11, 14, and 15 (collectively, the Jones Tracts). Of these, Maechling and Alcosser now own the tracts numbered 9 and 10 (hereinafter, the Maechling Property), and Dalton now owns the tract numbered 16. West County Line Road (WCL Road) runs along the boundary between Missoula County (to the north) and Ravalli County (to the south). WCL Road approaches from the east, and the record reflects that the road terminates at the northwest corner of Dalton\u2019s property. The easement claimed by the Ashbys, therefore, would connect the Ashby Property to WCL Road over the Maechling Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b657 3. When it transferred the Jones Tracts to Jones in 1934, Ravalli County failed to expressly reserve an easement over that land for the benefit of the Ashby Property. Specifically, the County failed to expressly reserve an easement connecting the Ashby Property to WCL Road via the Maechling Property. As a result, the Ashby Property supposedly became \u201clandlocked,\u201d i.e., \u201c[sjurrounded by land, with no way to get in or out except by crossing the land of another,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>894 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004). I say \u201csupposedly\u201d because the record is patently inconclusive on this point. For one thing, the Ashbys have not shown that all property (other than the Jones Tracts) adjacent to the Ashby Property at the time of severance was held or owned by someone other than Ravalli County. Indeed, the record is unclear as to whether the County, at this time, retained <em>other </em>properties within the Tax Parcel besides the Ashby Property and whether the County, at this time, held other properties adjacent to the Tax Parcel. <em>See State v. Cronin </em>179 Mont. 481, 488, 587 P.2d 395, 400 (1978) (\u2018We caution court and counsel to explore these factual questions where an implied ... easement by necessity is asserted. Examination of the titles to the surrounding parcels would provide a reliable indication of whether strict necessity existed when the land in question was conveyed. We therefore reverse the finding of implied easement by necessity, there being insufficient evidence in the record to support it.\u201d). Furthermore, the Ashbys tacitly acknowledged in the District Court that they do not know for certain whether other roads (besides WCL Road) accessed the Tax Parcel in 1934. They offered only that they had \u201cfound no evidence\u201d of any other access. Yet, some of the early- and mid-1900s maps included as exhibits to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment actually depict a road coming off a public highway and ending at or very near the eastern boundary of the Shaded Parcel. In short, the Ashbys failed to meet their burden of establishing that the Ashby Property in fact became landlocked as a result of the 1934 sale. If anything, their evidence creates genuine issues of material fact. Nevertheless, for purposes of the present discussion only, I will accept as true their premise that the Ashby Property was landlocked following the sale of the Jones Tracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b658 4. In September 1935, Ravalli County transferred the Ashby Property to L. Robert McKenzie. The Ashbys purchased this property in December 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b659 5. Ravalli County had the power to condemn an easement over the Maechling Property, in favor of the Ashby Property, before it sold the Ashby Property to McKenzie. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1622, 4478, 9934, RCM (1935). Ravalli County did not exercise this power.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b660 6. The Ashbys claim an easement by necessity. We have described two types of easement by necessity, one granted and the other reserved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">Where an owner of land conveys a parcel thereof which has no outlet to a highway except over the remaining lands of the grantor or over the land of strangers, a way of necessity exists over the remaining lands of the grantor. Similarly, a way of necessity is found when the owner of lands retains the inner portion conveying to another the balance, across which he must go for exit and access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\"><em>Schmid v. McDowell, </em>199 Mont. 233, 237, 649 P.2d 431, 433 (1982) (alteration, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted). The theory advanced by the Ashbys and adopted by the District Court is that when Ravalli County sold the Jones Tracts to Jones in 1934, it by implication <em>reserved </em>an easement by necessity over the lands thus conveyed for the benefit of the County\u2019s retained lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b661 To establish an easement by necessity, the proponent must show, by clear and convincing evidence, (1) unity of ownership, i.e., prior common ownership of the alleged dominant and servient tenements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>and (2) strict necessity for an easement at the time the dominant and servient tenements were severed from common ownership, as well as continuing necessity for an easement. <em>See Graham v. Mack, </em>216 Mont. 165, 175-76, 699 P.2d 590, 596-97 (1984); <em>Woods v. Houle, </em>235 Mont. 158, 163, 766 P.2d 250, 253 (1988); <em>Loomis v. Luraski, </em>2001 MT 223, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51, 306 Mont. 478, 36 P.3d 862; <em>see also Gacki v. Bartels, </em>859 N.E.2d 1178, 1184 (111. App. 2d Dist. 2006) (\u201cIt is the burden of the party claiming an easement to show the facts necessary to create an easement by implication. Furthermore, the party claiming the easement must meet this burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Griffeth v. Eid, </em>1998 ND 38, \u00b6 6, 573 N.W.2d 829 (\u201cA party seeking an implied easement has the burden of proving the existence of the easement by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d). The common law doctrine of easement by necessity \u201cdoes not exist to ensure a right of access to any and all landlocked property; rather, the doctrine is properly applied only when the circumstances establish that an access easement was intended at the time of the common owner\u2019s conveyance.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Burch, </em>205 P.3d 289, 294 (Cal. 2009). \u201cCourts are reluctant to find easements by implication for the reason that such an action results in depriving a person of the use of his property by imposing a servitude by mere implication.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>235 Mont. at 162, 766 P.2d at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b662 7. The requirement of strict necessity fails where the retained, landlocked parcel is held by a public entity. \u201cWhere a <em>private </em>landowner conveys to another individual a portion of his lands in a certain area and retains the rest, it is presumed at common law that the grantor has reserved an easement to pass over the granted property if such passage is necessary to reach the retained property. These rights-of-way are referred to as \u2018easements by necessity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leo Sheep Co. v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 668, 679, 99 S. Ct. 1403, 1409 (1979) (emphasis added). But where <em>the government </em>conveys a portion of its lands, \u201cthe easement is not actually a matter of necessity ... because the Government has the power of eminent domain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 99 S. Ct. at 1410.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">Jurisdictions have generally seen eminent domain and easements by necessity as alternative ways to effect the same result. For example, the State of Wyoming no longer recognizes the common-law easement by necessity in cases involving landlocked estates. It provides instead for a procedure whereby the landlocked owner can have an access route condemned on his behalf upon payment of the necessary compensation to the owner of the servient estate. For similar reasons other state courts have held that the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201ceasement by necessity\u201d doctrine is not available to the sovereign. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 99 S. Ct. at 1410 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Murphy, </em>205 P.3d at 294 (\u201cIn contrast to private party conveyances, however, conveyances involving a sovereign as the common owner typically do not give rise to implied <em>reservations of </em>easements or other property interests in conveyed land,\u201d in part because \u201cstrict necessity does not exist in the case of the sovereign as in the case of the private landowner, because the sovereign can exercise the power of eminent domain to obtain any and all reasonable rights-of-way.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b663 This is the law in Montana. <em>See Simonson v. McDonald, </em>131 Mont. 494, 311 P.2d 982 (1957). Notably, <em>Simonson </em>presents a factual scenario analogous to the case at hand. The Simonsons purchased from the Northern Pacific Railway in 1951 a parcel of land surrounded on three sides by mountains and on the fourth by land the McDonalds had previously purchased from the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1930s. All of this land was chiefly valuable for timber and grazing purposes. The Simonsons contended that their only means of ingress to and egress from their land was across the McDonalds\u2019 land, and they claimed an easement by necessity based on the theory (like the Ashbys\u2019 theory here) that when the Northern Pacific Railway conveyed the land to the McDonalds in the 1930s, it by implication reserved an easement by necessity over the conveyed land. <em>See id. </em>at 495-96, 311 P.2d at 982-83. This Court, however, agreed with the view that \u201c \u2018the law will not imply [a way of necessity] where it has provided another method for obtaining the same at a reasonable expense to the landowner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 311 P.2d at 985 (quoting <em>Backhausen v. Mayer, </em>234 N.W. 904, 905 (Wis. 1931)). The Court noted that the existence of the power of eminent domain \u201c \u2018would seem to negative the strict necessity on which the implication of the reservation of the right of way * * * must be grounded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 311 P.2d at 985 (asterisks in <em>Simonson) </em>(quoting <em>State v. Black Bros., </em>297 S.W. 213, 219 (Tex. 1927)). Thus, the Court held that there is no necessity for an easement where the right of condemnation provides the owner of the landlocked parcel with an \u201cadequate remedy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 500-01, 311 P.2d at 985-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b664 Unfortunately, some of the language used by the Court in <em>Simonson </em>was unnecessarily broad in light of the facts of the case and the earlier reasoning in the opinion. Specifically, Justice Angstman wrote: \u201cWe conclude therefore that in this state there can be no implied reservations or implied grants of easement by necessity. They may be obtained in eminent domain proceedings if proper showing be made of the necessity therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 311 P.2d at 985-86. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>basis for abolishing the easement-by-necessity doctrine outright; and for this reason, the Court subsequently limited <em>Simonson\u2019s </em>holding. In <em>Thisted v. Country Club Tower Corp., </em>146 Mont. 87, 405 P.2d 432 (1965), the Court found that an \u201cimplied equitable servitude\u201d restricting the use of apartments to residential purposes was included in the transfers of the apartments in question. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 405 P.2d at 440. In addition, although it arguably was not essential to this holding (since <em>Simonson </em>dealt with easements, not equitable servitudes), the Court nevertheless took the opportunity to overrule <em>Simonson </em>insofar as <em>Simonson </em>completely abolished easements by necessity and insofar as <em>Simonson </em>precluded the sort of privately held \u201cimplied equitable servitudes\u201d recognized in <em>Thisted. See id. </em>at 103, 405 P.2d at 440. But <em>Thisted </em>did not disturb the principle that \u201cstrict necessity\u201d fails where the retained, landlocked parcel is held by a public entity with the power to condemn a right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b665 Analysis. Clearly, then, in light of the foregoing undisputed facts and law, there is no way that an easement by necessity over the Maechling Property in favor of the Ashby Property can exist. Such an easement would have arisen, if at all, when these properties were severed from common ownership in July 1934. Yet, the common owner (Ravalli County) had the power to condemn an easement for the benefit of its retained and (supposedly) landlocked parcel. Hence, no \u201cstrict necessity\u201d existed and no easement by necessity came into existence. Again, it is important to emphasize that an implied easement by necessity is created, if at all, <em>at the time of severance. Schmid, </em>199 Mont. at 237-38, 649 P.2d at 433; <em>Big Sky Hidden Village Owners Assn. v. Hidden Village, </em>276 Mont. 268, 277, 915 P.2d 845, 850 (1996). Contrary to the Ashbys\u2019 contentions, such an easement does <em>not </em>suddenly spring into existence 70 years after the severance because the passage of time, changed circumstances, and other parties make that a more palatable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b666 The Court\u2019s attempts to impugn this analysis are wholly unavailing. First, the Court contends that <em>Leo Sheep </em>is inapposite because \u201cthe Ashbys are not a governmental entity with the power of eminent domain.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 25. But this contention plainly misses the point made by the Supreme Court in its discussion of easements by necessity-namely, that where a governmental entity conveys a portion of its lands, an easement by necessity does not arise in favor of a retained landlocked parcel because the government has the power to condemn a right-of-way. <em>See </em>\u00b6 62, <em>supra; Leo Sheep, </em>440 U.S. at 679-80, 99 S. Ct. at 1410. Here, as the Court itself states in \u00b6 22, strict necessity must exist \u201cat the time the tracts are severed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>original ownership Obviously, strict necessity did not exist at the time the Ashby Property and the Maechling Property were severed from the original ownership for the simple reason that Ravalli County had the power of eminent domain. Whether the <em>present </em>owner of the Ashby Property has the power of eminent domain is entirely beside the point, given that the requisite strict necessity did not exist <em>at the time the tracts were severed from the original </em>ownership-which, again, the Court states in \u00b6 22 is a requirement to establish an easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b667 Second, the Court notes that <em>Simonson </em>was overruled in part by <em>Thisted. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 25 n. 5. As explained above, however, the critical point of <em>Simonson </em>and <em>Thisted </em>(as they are relevant to the present case) is that <em>Thisted </em>did not disturb <em>Simonson\u2019s </em>holding that \u201cstrict necessity fails where the retained landlocked parcel is held by a public entity with the power to condemn a right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b668 Based on the foregoing analysis, the Ashbys\u2019 easement-by-necessity claim fails as a matter of law on the undisputed facts they have marshaled in support of it. Strict necessity did not exist at the time of severance, and Maechling and Alcosser were entitled to summary judgment on this basis alone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b669 For reasons not explained in the record, Ravalli County failed to condemn an easement before it sold the Ashby Property to McKenzie in 1935. That does not necessarily leave the Ashbys without options, however. For one thing, they could try to purchase for just compensation the easement which, in this litigation, they have demanded for nothing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Ashbys could also try to acquire an easement through a private condemnation action. <em>See Godfrey v. Pilon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>165 Mont. 439, 448, 529 P.2d 1372, 1377 (1974); \u00a7\u00a7 70-30-102, -107, MCA. But they are not entitled to summary judgment on their claim of an easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b670 Indeed, even setting aside the fact that this claim is invalid as a matter of law under the analysis above, the record before us is woefully underdeveloped due to the shoddy pleading, research, briefing, and argument referred to in \u00b6 50, <em>supra. </em>For one thing, this Court held in <em>Leisz v. Avista </em>Corp., 2007 MT 347, \u00b6 48, 340 Mont. 294, 174 P.3d 481, that \u201cstrict necessity\u201d does not exist at the time of severance if \u201cno one was living on the [landlocked property].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet, the Ashbys have provided no evidence that someone was living on or using the Ashby Property in 1934. But more significantly, the record fails to answer important questions about alternative routes to the Tax Parcel in 1934, as well as the status and ownership of the remaining tracts in the Tax Parcel and the properties adjacent to the Tax Parcel following the sale to Jones. The Ashbys, therefore, have wholly failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, as a purely factual matter, that strict necessity existed at the time of severance. Consequently, even under the Court\u2019s approach, which ignores the eminent domain issue, the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the Ashbys should be reversed and this case should be remanded for further development of the record and, if necessary, a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b671 That being said, however, I would follow the procedural exception recognized in <em>Leichtfuss. </em>We should resolve this case on the basis of the antecedent and ultimately dispositive issue raised (albeit, belatedly) by Maechling, Alcosser, and Dalton. In so doing, we would preserve the well-established legal principles underlying the doctrine of easement by necessity; we would uphold Meachling\u2019s and Alcosser\u2019s rights to the ownership and enjoyment of their real property free of an implied easement that has no basis in law or fact; and we would avoid publishing, in an important easement case, a decision that is contrary to decades of easement law, that will introduce inconsistency into our easement-by-necessity jurisprudence, and that is grounded in an underdeveloped record characterized by bad lawyering.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00b672 I would reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of Maechling, Alcosser, and Dalton on the Ashbys\u2019 claim of an easement by necessity. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-12\"> In this regard, it is only fair to point out that Maechling, Alcosser, and Dalton replaced their first attorney during the litigation in the District Court, after the court had entered summary judgment in favor of the Ashbys establishing the implied easement by necessity. Accordingly, most of the significant damage done to Maechling, Alcosser, and Dalton\u2019s case was under their first attorney and not caused by their current counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> The Court states that this issue should not be considered because it was not raised in the District Court and was noted only \u201cin passing\u201d on appeal. Opinion, \u00b6 25. The fact is, however, that the validity of the easement alleged by the Ashbys depends on whether \u201cstrict necessity\u201d existed at the time the alleged dominant and servient properties were severed from common ownership. Consequently, whether Ravalli County could reserve an easement by necessity is an antecedent issue which we must address in order to determine the easement\u2019s validity. In my view, the <em>Leichtfuss </em>exception clearly applies on the facts at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-10\"> Notably, the Ashbys\u2019 purchase agreement contains a provision which cautions them: \u201cThere is a question of access to the 120 acre parcel. Buyer has been fully informed of such access issue and accepts title to the 120 acre parcel \u2018AS IS\u2019....\u201d This provision further states that the seller will cooperate with the Ashbys to address the access issue by, among other things, providing evidence \u201cregarding use of <em>the existing access </em>by Seller and members of the Seller\u2019s family\u201d (emphasis added). This certainly calls into question the Ashbys\u2019 claim that a present necessity exists for an easement to access their property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> It is highly doubtful that strict necessity exists at the present time either. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 22 (\u201cStrict necessity must exist at the time the [unified] tracts are severed from the original ownership <em>and </em>at the time the easement is exercised.\u201d (citing <em>Watson v. Dundas, </em>2006 MT 104, \u00b6 32, 332 Mont. 164, 136 P.3d 973)). At best, the evidence in the record indicates that genuine issues of material fact exist on this issue. The problem for Maechling, Alcosser, and Dalton, however, is that because of a discovery sanction (resulting from their first attorney\u2019s admitted failure to properly manage the case), they have been saddled with an admission that \u201c[n]o practical access to a public road currently exists from the Ashby Property.\u201d In other words, contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion that the District Court \u201creviewed the evidence\u201d on this issue, Opinion, \u00b6 23, the fact is that the existence of a present \u201cstrict necessity is based solely on a discovery sanction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\"> Prior to commencing the instant lawsuit, the Ashbys\u2019 counsel mailed Maechling and Alcosser a letter indicating that the Ashbys intended to log the Ashby Property and offering to purchase an express easement over the Maechling Property for $10.00 \u2014 hardly \u201cjust compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\"> I cannot agree with the Court that this statement in <em>Leisz </em>was \u201cdicta.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22 n. 4. It was part of our holding; and until the Court expressly overrules it, it is extant law applicable to the question of whether the Ashbys have shown a strict necessity. For that matter, <em>Leisz </em>is consistent with our observation in <em>Godfrey </em>that the term \u201cstrict necessity\u201d means \u201cessential to use and enjoyment of the premises <em>as permanently improved at the time of the conveyance of the servient estate.\u201d </em>165 Mont. at 445, 529 P.2d at 1375 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
