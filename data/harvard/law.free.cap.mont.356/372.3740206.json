Launa challenges the modification on numerous grounds, including that the court violated her due process rights, entered clearly erroneous factual findings and abused its discretion. Because we conclude Launa\u2019s due process argument is dispositive, we do not reach her other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court violated Launa\u2019s due process rights by modifying the parenting plan without proper notice to Launa that John sought primary residential custody of their daughter, K.S.?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\u00b63 Launa and John are the biological parents of three children: their son, T.J., who is 22, and their daughters J.S., age 19, and K.S., age 9. This appeal concerns a change to the parenting plan for 9-year-old K.S., modifying the primary residential parent from Launa, who resides in Utah, to John, who resides in Montana. The District Court modified the parenting plan after receiving testimony that the family\u2019s son T.J. had subjected J.S. to repeated sexual abuse, and that K.S. was in danger of the same abuse. Some background regarding these unfortunate circumstances is pertinent to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">\u00b64 In 1999, while Launa and John were married, the family learned that J.S. had been sexually abused by the children\u2019s uncle, Chase, on numerous occasions when she was five or six years of age. Launa and John sought counseling for J.S., and separated the family from Chase. Launa and John subsequently divorced in 2002 and, pursuant thereto, a parenting plan designating Launa as the primary residential parent of K.S was adopted by the court. In 2007, with the court\u2019s approval, Launa moved to Utah with K.S. and T.J. and, pursuant to the parenting plan, John maintained continuous contact with the children after Launa\u2019s move.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">\u00b65 In the early fall of2008, the family learned that T.J. had also been sexually abused by Chase in 1999, and that, in turn, T.J. had also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sexually abused J.S. when she was 9 years old and T.J. was 12 years old. These events had occurred while Launa and John were still married and living together, before K.S. was born. No evidence that K.S. has been sexually abused has been offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b66 After learning of the abuse between T.J. and J.S., John contacted the Davis County Sheriffs Office in Utah. Detective West of that office conducted a forensic interview of K.S. to determine if she had been harmed by T.J. Detective West noted that K.S. exhibited a consistent reaction while discussing each member of her family, although she indicated that T.J. asked her to hug him about ten times a day and that he did not hug her back. Detective West noted in his report that this behavior \u201ccould be the beginning of the grooming process,\u201d but that he could not presently make that determination. Given K.S.\u2019s reactions and the lack of an indication of abuse, Detective West concluded that T.J. had not abused K.S. and ended his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"AWH\">\u00b67 On September 24,2008, John filed an emergency ex parte motion requesting the District Court temporarily place K.S. in his care pending a hearing on the matter, given T. J.\u2019s history of sexual abuse. John\u2019s motion did not include Detective West\u2019s report, but provided his affidavit which stated that K.S. told him that T.J. would be babysitting her, and that she had recently been left alone to watch television with T.J. at Launa\u2019s home in Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b68 The District Court granted John\u2019s ex parte motion the day it was filed, ordering K.S. placed in John\u2019s custody pending a hearing. Pursuant thereto, John took K.S. from her school in Utah the following day and returned with her to Montana. The next day, September 26, 2008, Launa filed a motion for immediate rescission of the ex parte order, and return of K.S. to her. On October 1, 2008, after reviewing Detective West\u2019s incident report attached to Launa\u2019s motion, the District Court vacated the ex parte order. The court found insufficient evidence to amend the parenting plan on an emergency, ex parte basis, and indicated it would hold a hearing upon receipt of a joint parental custody evaluation. K.S. returned to Utah, where she continued to maintain her primary residence with Launa and her step-father.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b69 On December 4, 2008, Launa and John stipulated to Dr. Heather Walker conducting the parenting evaluation. The District Court accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation and ordered Dr. Walker to perform the evaluation. After traveling to both parties\u2019 homes in Utah and Montana and interviewing individuals who had meaningful contact with K.S., Dr. Walker met with both John and Launa, and discussed her recommendations. Dr. Walker\u2019s parenting evaluation affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Launa as the primary residential parent of K.S., but recommended that John be granted more parenting time in the summer with K.S.</p>\n<p id=\"AM0\">\u00b610 Following Dr. Walker\u2019s evaluation, John\u2019s attorney drafted a revised parenting plan which he provided to Launa and her lawyer on August 26,2009. John\u2019s proposed parenting plan stated that it was \u201cin accordance with the evaluators [sic] August 2009 recommendations,\u201d and provided that Launa would have \u201cprimary physical custody\u201d and that K.S. \u201cshall reside primarily at her mother\u2019s residence.\u201d On September 17,2009, John requested a hearing regarding modification of the parenting plan. In his motion, John stated that he had \u201csent his proposed modifications to the parenting plan <em>incorporating Dr. Walker\u2019s recommendations\u201d </em>to Launa. (Emphasis added.) A hearing was set for October 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b611 At the hearing, Launa\u2019s counsel raised an initial objection about the pleadings, noting that no motion to amend the parenting plan had actually been filed and that the order vacating the ex parte order was the only suggestion of a modification to the parenting plan in the record. The court responded that the order had put the parties on notice and that, given time restraints, the court did not want to address procedural aspects of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b612 John\u2019s counsel began by submitting his proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and parenting plan, and stating that John was requesting a \u201cswitch in primary custodial parents from mother to father and to protect [K.S.] from the potential of more sexual abuse[,] based on the recommendations of Donna Hale.\u201d Following counsel\u2019s comment regarding Donna Hale, the District Court disclosed that it had received a letter from Ms. Hale on October 26, 2009, which it provided to the parties. Hale\u2019s letter to the court stated that Hale wanted to \u201crefresh some of [their] conversations and add additional information regarding the Steab case,\u201d and asked the court to \u201ckeep this case and allow [the] hearing to occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b613 John called Ms. Hale, a licensed clinical social worker who had treated various members of the family. Ms. Hale admitted that she was not an expert on sex offenders \u201cby choice,\u201d but the night before the hearing she had read \u201cabout four hours of literature research\u201d on the internet about sex offenders in preparation for her testimony about T.J.\u2019s potential dangerousness to K.S. Ms. Hale provided numerous recommendations regarding the best interests of K.S. and testified in support of John\u2019s request to change the primary residential parent. Ms. Hale based her opinion on the likelihood of T. J. reoffending and sexually assaulting K.S., particularly given that K.S. was the same age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>as J.S. when T.J. began sexually abusing J.S, and opined that Launa was seemingly indifferent to the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b614 Launa\u2019s counsel objected during Hale\u2019s testimony that there had \u201cnot been a request that the Court provide a parenting plan that gives primary custody to John. Only parenting plan that was presented along with the motion [did] not suggest a change of custody.\u201d John\u2019s counsel admitted that the first time a change of custody had been suggested was within the findings of fact submitted that day. The court stated, \u201cWell now we know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b615 Cross-examining Hale, Launa\u2019s counsel addressed the letter Hale had sent to the court and asked, \u201cHave you had out of court conversations regarding this case with Judge McCarter?\u201d The District Court responded that \u201cI think [Ms. Hale] may have had some with me but nothing of substance because we are friends and we go to lunch occasionally and she talks about things, so the answer for her, she may have mentioned something about the case ....\u201d After some additional dialogue, the court responded that Ms. Hale \u201cdoesn\u2019t talk a lot about substance of these cases,\u201d and that they try to talk about other things.</p>\n<p id=\"AeZ\">\u00b616 In Launa\u2019s case-in-chief, she called Dr. Walker, who had performed the court-ordered custody evaluation, and Rick Bashaw, T.J.\u2019s current treating therapist. Based on her investigation, Dr. Walker believed it would be in KS.\u2019s best interest to remain primarily with Launa, but spend additional parenting time with John during the summer. Bashaw testified that T.J. was progressing well through his treatment program, and posed no threat to K.S. as long as their contact was supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b617 The District Court adopted Hale\u2019s recommendations and ordered that John would be the primary residential parent. Launa filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings with prejudice, arguing a lack of notice of the request to change the primary custodial parent and other due process violations. The District Court denied Launa\u2019s motion. Launa appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b618 We will reverse a district court\u2019s decision to modify custody or visitation only where an abuse of discretion is clearly demonstrated. <em>Arneson-Nelson v. Nelson (In re </em>Arneson-Nelson), 2001 MT 242, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 60, 36 P.3d 874 (citations omitted). Our review of conclusions of law is plenary. <em>Guffin v. </em>Plaisted-Harmon, 2009 MT 169, \u00b6 6, 350 Mont. 489, 209 P.3d 225 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b619 <em>Did the District Court violate Launa\u2019s due process rights by modifying the parenting plan without proper notice to Launa that John sought primary residential custody of their daughter, K.S.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b620 Launa contends that the District Court violated her constitutional due process rights by proceeding on John\u2019s request to change the primary residential custodian without proper notice to her. Launa argues that she was disadvantaged and denied an opportunity to meaningfully prepare for the hearing and defend against the request.</p>\n<p id=\"AUQ\">\u00b621 John responds that Launa had notice that he was seeking a modification to the parenting plan which would grant him primary residential custody of K.S. He explains that, a week after filing his ex parte motion, the court held a conference with the parties regarding the ex parte order it had issued and thus, Launa was aware of his desire to obtain a permanent change in the primary residential custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b622  The United States and Montana Constitutions ensure that \u201c[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 17; U.S. Const, amend. V. A natural parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of his or her child is a \u201cfundamental liberty interest\u201d that must be protected by \u201cfundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In re A.S.A., </em>258 Mont. 194, 197, 852 P.2d 127, 129 (1993) (citing <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753-54, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 1394-95 (1982)); <em>In re J.N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 524, 977 P.2d 317 (citations omitted). Due process requires notice and the opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Mont. Power Co. v. Public Serv.

Ct. 1187, 1190 (1965)); <em>In re Marriage of Fishbaugh, </em>2002 MT 175, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 519, 52 P.3d 395 (citation omitted).

Power Co., </em>206 Mont. at 368, 671 P.2d at 609 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b623  We have previously considered due process challenges in cases involving modifications to parenting plans. In <em>In re Marriage of Huotari, </em>we held the father of a minor child was denied procedural due process by the district court\u2019s modification of the parenting plan when he was not provided notice or the opportunity to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>modification. 284 Mont. 285, 291, 943 P.2d 1295, 1299 (1997). In <em>State ex rel. Shelhamer v. Dist. Ct., </em>we held the district court erred by modifying the custody provisions of the parenting plan when the proceeding before the court was noticed for nonsupport and contempt issues. 159 Mont. 11, 12-15, 494 P.2d 928, 929-30 (1972). We explained that \u201cif a permanent change in custody appears to the court to be necessary then due process requires that an application be made for that purpose and proper notice of such application be given.\u201d <em>Shelhamer, </em>159 Mont. at 15, 494 P.2d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b624 We pause to note that a number of our cases have, unfortunately, also identified this problem as one of \u201cissue jurisdiction,\u201d and we have held, in circumstances similar to those of <em>Shelhamer </em>and <em>Huotari, </em>that the district court lacked \u201cissue jurisdiction\u201d to modify the parenting plan where the issue of a modification to the final parenting plan was not pleaded or noticed before the hearing. <em>See In re Marriage of Pasquale, </em>220 Mont. 497, 499, 716 P.2d 223, 224-25 (1986); <em>In re Custody of C.S.F., </em>232 Mont. 204, 209, 755 P.2d 578, 581-82 (1988); <em>In re Custody of C.J.K., </em>258 Mont. 525, 527-28, 855 P.2d 90, 91 (1993); <em>In re Marriage, of Boyer, </em>274 Mont. 282, 286-87, 908 P.2d 665, 667-68 (1995); <em>In re Marriage of Bradshaw, </em>270 Mont. 222, 231-32, 891 P.2d 506, 512 (1995). In recent years we have sought to correct the misuse of the term \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d <em>see Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186, and we take this opportunity to clarify that the reversible error in cases'such as <em>Pasquale, C.S.F., C.J.K., Boyer, </em>and <em>Bradshaw </em>concerning the lack of notice and opportunity for a meaningful hearing was one of constitutional due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b625  As in the above cases, we likewise conclude here that Launa was not provided adequate notice and opportunity to be heard regarding the request to remove her as primary residential parent for K.S. After the District Court rescinded its ex parte order, the parties stipulated to a joint parenting evaluation by Dr. Walker, which was ordered by the court. Dr. Walker recommended that Launa continue as primary residential parent, and John\u2019s pre-hearing pleadings-his proposed revised parenting plan and request for hearing-endorsed that recommendation. John\u2019s proposed parenting plan was \u201cissued in accordance with the evaluators [sic] August 2009 recommendations,\u201d stating that Launa would have \u201cprimary physical custody\u201d and that K.S. \u201cshall reside primarily at her mother\u2019s residence.\u201d John\u2019s request for hearing indicated that he had \u201csent his proposed modifications to the parenting plan <em>incorporating Dr. Walker\u2019s </em>recommendations\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Launa and asked that this parenting plan be approved. (Emphasis added.) John acknowledged during the hearing that he first sought the primary residential custody change by his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were submitted to the court and Launa at the hearing. To Launa\u2019s objection, the court responded by stating \u201cWell now we know.\u201d This was unfortunately true, but Launa should have been given notice prior to the hearing that her status as primary residential parent was going to be challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b626 Further, we are troubled by the possible implications to Launa\u2019s due process rights of Ms. Hale\u2019s ex parte communications with the District Court. We have previously expressed concern regarding ex parte communications \u201cdesigned to influence judicial action\u201d as a potential violation of a litigant\u2019s constitutional due process rights. <em>State v. Champagne, </em>245 Mont. 147, 150-52, 800 P.2d 154, 156-57 (1990). Ms. Hale\u2019s letter was written to the court \u201cto refresh some of [their] conversations and add additional information regarding the Steab case (ADR-2002-082).\u201d The letter expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about T. J. potentially abusing K.S, stated that K.S. expressed a \u201cstrong desire to spend more time with her father,\u201d and that \u201cit is imperative that this case remain in Montana, in [the] court.\u201d Ms. Hale\u2019s letter concluded by asking the District Court to \u201ckeep this case and allow Friday\u2019s hearing to occur.\u201d The letter and its reference to previous communications raise the potential of an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"AGo\">\u00b627 Given the procedural history of this case, we do not believe Launa was adequately notified of John\u2019s request for a change of the residential custodian prior to the hearing. Thus, Launa was denied due process of law. We reverse the judgment and remand for a new hearing and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b628 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
