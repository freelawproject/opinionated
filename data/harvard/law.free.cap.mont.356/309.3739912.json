Hanson, M.D. (Dr. Hanson) was not negligent in his treatment and care of Cooper. Cooper argues that her right to a fair and impartial trial was prejudiced in the course of the proceedings below, and that her motion for a new trial was improperly denied by the District Court. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the verdict of the jury and remand this matter to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">\u00b62 Cooper had been suffering from arthritis in her left knee, and conservative treatment measures had failed to alleviate the condition. On December 1,2005, Dr. Hanson performed a total knee arthoplasty surgery (TKA) on Cooper\u2019s left knee. During surgery, complications arose due to damage to the popliteal artery in Cooper\u2019s left knee. Cooper alleged that she suffered various permanent injuries to vessels and nerves in her left leg as a result of the complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">\u00b63 On December 7,2007, Cooper filed a negligence action against Dr. Hanson in the First Judicial District Court. Cooper alleged that Dr. Hanson was negligent in his use and placement of surgical tools during the operation, and that he was responsible for severing the popliteal artery in her left leg. Dr. Hanson denied he was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">\u00b64 Prior to trial, Cooper sought a motion in limine to prohibit defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>counsel from presenting improper argument to the jury on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">1. That the defendant could or would be financially affected by any adverse verdict;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">2. That the defendant could face consequences concerning the right to practice medicine, continuing licensure, hospital privileges, or loss of limitation of business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">3. That the defendant may be forced to close or limit his services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">4. That the defendant could have his professional reputation or standing damaged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">5. That the defendant needs special protection or that there could be unspecified effects or consequences of the malpractice claims, this trial, or medical malpractice verdicts against a doctor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">6. That the jury should put itself in the shoes of the defendant or analyze the case and its potential consequences from the defendant\u2019s perspective;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">7. That the defendant feels bad or similar comments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">\u00b65 The District Court denied the motion, concluding that the request to exclude these arguments was \u201cvague and overbroad.\u201d Counsel for Dr. Hanson, Daniel Hoven (Hoven), expressed offense at the suggestion that he would violate the Rules of Evidence, and assured the court that he would not engage in improper argument. The District Court noted that counsel for both parties should be \u201cfully aware of their ethical obligations and what is proper argument at trial,\u201d and further noted that any issues related to the above-mentioned arguments should be dealt with by a proper objection at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">\u00b66 Jury selection began on April 20, 2009. During voir dire, Cooper elicited responses from several jurors on the topic of the plaintiffs burden of proof in a civil medical malpractice case. For instance, in response to a question about whether any members of the panel would require proof greater than the preponderance of the evidence in a medical malpractice case, juror Chris Silvonen (Juror Silvonen) stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-13\">A. In this particular matter, I would. I think that for the very little I know about it, if we were to say he was in the wrong, it could be career damaging. I think all those things-I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m-I know very little about what\u2019s going on at this point, but it\u2019s almost like a criminal sentence for a doctor that\u2019s got a malpractice, you know, type of deal. So I would like to see quite a bit of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-14\">Q. More than just-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>A. More than just a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">Q. You\u2019re pretty strong on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">Q. Pretty hard to change? Hard for me to change your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">A. Seems like a life sentence to a medical doctor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b67 Another member of the panel, Frederick Demato, also stated that he was \u201cagainst preponderance of the evidence\u201d in this type of case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other jurors expressed similar sentiments implying that the preponderance of the evidence standard would be insufficient in a medical malpractice case. In exploring this issue with the jury, Cooper\u2019s trial counsel Erik Thueson (Thueson) had the following exchange with Juror Wayne Waters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">A. Well, without knowing the facts, I can\u2019t say that, but it would have to be a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">Q. Okay. So you could go 51/49?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">A. Nope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">Q. Well if this were a basketball game, how much would Joyce have to win the basketball game in your mind before you have enough doubts set aside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">A. Let\u2019s say it would have to go a lot more than 51 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">\u00b68 Thueson also questioned Waters about his feelings on awards for pain and suffering. Waters indicated that he could not make such an award unless there was \u201ca deliberate act or deliberate negligence on the part of the doctor.\u201d When questioned further, however, Waters also agreed that he could award such damages if it was shown that a doctor made a mistake that was below the standard of care, but unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">\u00b69 Thueson also questioned Juror Richard Ellwein about his ability to award damages for pain and suffering if proven at trial. On this point, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">Q. Okay. Mr. Ellwein?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">A. I believe I want to hear what the facts are and make a determination on the whole picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-18\">Q. You could award\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-19\">A. I could award damages, but I\u2019m not going to discuss any amounts or anything like that. I will not go into detail about any amounts or anything like that. The cause of it-if we deem it necessary, we\u2019ll-I\u2019ll figure that out when I make a decision on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">Q. Well-I mean, so you don\u2019t have a problem with the concept?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAS\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">Q. If the evidence shows, you could award two or three hundred thousand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">A. I said, sir, don\u2019t mention an amount. I won\u2019t-I\u2019ll just say-1\u201911 just say that what the-whatever the instructions are, I\u2019ll base it on the instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b610 In response to Thueson\u2019s examination, Juror Dave Miller indicated that there should be a greater burden of proof in a medical malpractice case. When asked by Thueson if he could be convinced of anything different in the next couple of days, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d When questioned, Juror Michael Eby stated that he \u201cwould need a lot more proof ... beyond a reasonable doubt to decide,\u201d and further indicated that he \u201cwould need a lot more than, say, 75 percent to decide one way or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u00b611 During this questioning, some members of the jury panel expressed uncertainty about what burden of proof is legally required since none of the potential jurors had actually been instructed by the court on this issue. Sensing the jury\u2019s confusion on this point, the District Court interjected and reminded Thueson that there were no assigned percentages to a preponderance, and told counsel that he was confusing the court and jury pool. Shortly thereafter, Thueson then went on to explore other topics with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b612 During a break and outside the presence of the jury panel, Thueson raised concerns with the court that many panel members had indicated their inability to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard in a civil malpractice case. Counsel indicated his belief that if a juror demonstrated such a bias, he or she should be excused for cause. Defense counsel responded that Thueson was confusing the jury and that, in any event, defense counsel should be given the opportunity to rehabilitate any jurors who were challenged for cause. The District Court reiterated its concerns that Thueson\u2019s discussion of the burden of proof was confusing the jury, and allowed Thueson to read to the jurors the pattern jury instruction on the preponderance of the evidence standard in order to clarify the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\u00b613 Thueson continued to examine the jury panel after the break and discussion in chambers. He challenged several potential jurors for cause on grounds not related to the burden of proof question, and the District Court granted some of those challenges. Thueson then returned to examining Juror Waters and questioned him about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ability to be fair in a medical malpractice case. Waters, whose job required him to decide disability determinations on a regular basis, indicated that he could be fair, but wanted to \u201cknow the evidence and see the medical evidence.\u201d Thueson questioned whether \u201cmalpractice information\u201d would creep into his decision-making process regarding a doctor\u2019s liability, to which Waters responded \u201cIf he\u2019s not doing his job, then-but I don\u2019t know that at this point.\u201d When pressed further if he would require a high burden of proof in a medical malpractice case, Waters responded \u201cDoctors can make mistakes like anybody else.\u201d Thueson then challenged Waters for cause. Hoven was given the opportunity to examine Waters, who stated that he would not be biased in judging the evidence presented to him. The District Court subsequently denied Thueson\u2019s challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b614 Voir dire continued. However, Jurors Silvonen and Eby were not specifically challenged for cause based on their inability to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard, or their general bias in a medical malpractice suit. As Thueson had been instructed by the District Court to finish his examination before a noon-hour lunch break, Thueson stopped his examination and thanked the jury for their time. Thueson did not expressly inform the District Court at this time that he was passing the jury for cause, although he did conclude his examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b615 After the lunch break, but before the jury panel was reconvened, Thueson specifically challenged jurors Silvonen, Eby, and Ellwein for cause, arguing that these three jurors were unable or unwilling to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard to the case. Thueson also reminded the court of Silvonen\u2019s statement that a malpractice verdict was like a \u201clife sentence\u201d to a doctor. Hoven objected, claiming that Thueson had already passed the jury for cause prior to lunch. Thueson stated that he had not passed the jury for cause before lunch, but finished his questioning solely because the District Court wanted him to conclude his voir dire by noon. At the same time, Thueson conceded that Hoven was probably \u201ctechnically right\u201d on this point, but nonetheless requested an opportunity to make a record of his challenges to these jurors. With respect to Silvonen, the District Court denied the challenge for cause on the grounds that Silvonen had been questioned after his initial statements and indicated he could be fair. With respect to Juror Eby, the District Court denied this challenge on similar grounds, noting that there was significant discussion about the preponderance of the evidence standard after his initial statements. Finally, with respect to Juror Ellwein, the District Court denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>challenge as well, agreeing with Hoven\u2019s claim that Ellwein did not demonstrate a bias, but rather simply resisted attempts to assign a monetary figure to pain and suffering damages without seeing or hearing any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b616 Cooper used her preemptory challenges for jurors Waters and Ellwein and two other potential jurors, but Eby and Silvonen served on the jury. Trial then commenced. During the trial, both sides presented expert and lay testimony on various aspects of the case, and the court received numerous exhibits into evidence. During his closing statements, Thueson presented the jury with some information about his personal biography, and how he became a trial lawyer. In this connection, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">And I didn\u2019t go the route that Dan [Hoven] went. I didn\u2019t want to represent companies, businesses, corporations. I wanted to represent individuals. People. And I\u2019m proud of that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b617 Later, during Hoven\u2019s closing statement, he made the following statement to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">And when Mr. Thueson suggested that I represent companies and corporations, I represent Pete Hanson. A person. Dr. Hanson is just as entitled to justice in this courtroom as Ms. Cooper. He\u2019s a person. He\u2019s a member of this community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">He didn\u2019t even have to come back here. He could have stayed in Akron. We\u2019re lucky to have him. We\u2019re lucky to have a trained orthopedic surgeon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">MR. THUESON: May I? I think there\u2019s a case called Wellcome [sic]. I would make an objection on the Wellcome case, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">\u00b618 Then, at the end of his closing statement, Hoven stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">So it\u2019s been kind of a long week. And when you do these trials, I feel like I know some of you people now. And we\u2019ll probably see each other on the street someday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">But I want to make sure you guys are proud of your verdict. And I don\u2019t think putting a black mark on Dr. Hanson in this case is going to make you proud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">Cooper did not object or ask the court to admonish the jury or counsel at the time this statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">\u00b619 After roughly one hour, the jury returned a defense verdict, finding that Dr. Hanson was not negligent in his treatment of Cooper. After the jury was dismissed, Cooper made a record in support of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>motion for a new trial. Cooper argued that counsel for Dr. Hanson made several improper comments to the jury during closing statements. Cooper objected to comments thatthejury should consider the effect of its verdict on Dr. Hanson\u2019s reputation, in particular to the fact that it would put a \u201cblack mark\u201d on him. Cooper pointed out that she sought to prohibit such argument in her motion in limine, and noted that the timing of the comments put her in a difficult position. Cooper argued that this was an appeal to passion and prejudice which should not have been permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b620 Cooper subsequently filed a written motion for a new trial, arguing in part that the bias of the jury, the District Court\u2019s failure to grant her challenges for cause, and improper arguments by Dr. Hanson during closing, prejudiced her right to a fair trial. The District Court denied the motion in a written order dated July 10, 2009. The District Court noted that \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, provides that a verdict may be vacated, and a new trial granted, upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of the party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9R\">(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">(3) accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">(7) error in law occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b621 Addressing Cooper\u2019s argument concerning jury bias and the denial of challenges for cause, the District Court noted that Thueson\u2019s voir dire of the jury had continued beyond its allotted time, and reiterated its view that Thueson was confusing the jury and trying to get them to commit to positions before they had heard any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u00b622 After reviewing the transcript, the District Court concluded that the challenge to Juror Waters was properly denied and that he did not express an unqualified belief as to the merits of the case, nor did he exhibit a bias in favor of either party. Similarly, the District Court concluded that challenges to Eby, Ellwein, and Silvonen were properly denied. With respect to each of these jurors, the District Court determined that the challenges were untimely and that a review of the entire examination failed to show that there was a bias in these jurors affecting Cooper\u2019s substantial right to a fair trial. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>noted that Cooper\u2019s challenges to Eby, Silvonen, and Ellwein occurred after lunch recess, well after the actual exchanges with the jurors, and that Cooper failed to follow up with these jurors on the burden of proof question after Thueson was allowed to read the instruction on burden of proof to the jury. The District Court noted that Cooper placed the court in a difficult position by lodging her challenges after lunch recess, since it did not have a transcript of the voir dire at the time and was left to attempt to recollect the statements of the panel members.</p>\n<p id=\"ATs\">\u00b623 The District Court further concluded that there was nothing in the responses of Ellwein which required that he be excused for cause. Regarding Eby and Silvonen, the District Court noted that their challenged statements \u201cwere made early in the <em>voir dire </em>process, prior to a reading of the instruction on the preponderance of the evidence and prior to, literally, hours of additional discussion of the issues with the jury panel.\u201d Based on this, the District Court concluded that Cooper had failed to establish that the denial of her challenges for cause resulted in the seating of a biased jury. Additionally, the District Court also concluded that Cooper\u2019s challenges were untimely under M. R. Civ. P. 47(b), and found it \u201cinconceivable\u201d the Cooper\u2019s failure to challenge Eby, Silvonen, or Ellwein could be blamed on a lack of time to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b624 The District Court also addressed Cooper\u2019s contentions that Hoven\u2019s remarks during closing statements substantially affected her right to a fair trial. The District Court began its analysis here by noting that it had previously denied Cooper\u2019s motion in limine regarding improper argument. It reiterated its ruling that the motion was \u201cvague and overbroad,\u201d and its direction that Cooper address issues of improper argument with a proper objection at trial. In this connection, the District Court observed that Cooper did not object to Hoven\u2019s \u201cblack mark\u201d comments at trial, and therefore waived her right to appeal them in the post-judgment context. Cooper did object to Hoven\u2019s remarks that the jurors were \u201clucky\u201d to have Dr. Hanson in Helena. However, the District Court characterized the remarks as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKy\">[an] invited response to Cooper\u2019s closing argument indicating defense represents corporations. While defense counsel\u2019s statements that we were lucky to have Hanson in Helena may have gilded the lily, the Court does not believe that this statement at the end of a week-long jury trial denied Cooper\u2019s right to a fair trial. Cooper\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis of improper closing argument by defense counsel should be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b625 Cooper now appeals from the jury\u2019s verdict and the rulings of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>District Court. Cooper presents three separate issues on appeal. First, Cooper argues the District Court abused its discretion in denying her motion in limine. Second, Cooper claims the District Court abused its discretion in denying her challenges to jurors for cause. Third, Cooper claims it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to refuse to grant a new trial based upon juror bias in voir dire and Hoven\u2019s improper comments during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b626 Although Cooper presents three separate issues on appeal, we find the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion for a new trial to be dispositive. Thus, we state the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b627 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Cooper\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b628 We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a new trial on the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Willing v. Quebedeaux, </em>2009 MT 102, \u00b6 19, 350 Mont. 119, 204 P.3d 1248. \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion. The standard requires that the abuse of discretion be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the complaining party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willing, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 446, 30 P.3d 326). A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine, and its ruling denying a challenge to a juror for cause, are both reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Schmidt, </em>2009 MT 450, \u00b6 27, 354 Mont. 280, 224 P.3d 618; <em>State v. Hart, </em>2009 MT 268, \u00b6 9, 352 Mont. 92, 214 P.3d 1273. A district court abuses its discretion if it makes a ruling arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without employing conscientious judgment, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b629 In order to determine whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Cooper\u2019s motion for a new trial, we must examine the various errors which Cooper alleges combined to deny her a fair trial. First, Cooper argues that the District Court\u2019s denial of her challenges to cause, amounts to structural error requiring reversal and a new trial under <em>State v. Hausauer, </em>2006 MT 336, 335 Mont. 137, 149 P.3d 895. Cooper claims that Silvonen\u2019s comment that a plaintiffs verdict is like a \u201clife sentence\u201d to a doctor, and the comments of Eby, Waters, and Ellwein, demonstrating a reluctance to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>preponderance of evidence standard and bias towards the defendant, demonstrated bias sufficient to have them removed for cause. Cooper contends that these jurors were not sufficiently rehabilitated to allow them to serve impartially on the jury, and that the District Court committed reversible error by denying her challenges for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b630 Additionally, Cooper disputes the District Court\u2019s determination that her challenges for cause to jurors Eby, Ellwein, and Silvonen were untimely under M. R. Civ. P. 47(b). This rule reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">Rule 47(b). Manner of selection and order of examination of jurors. From the entire jury panel, an initial panel of 20 jurors shall be called in the first instance, and before any voir dire examination of the jury shall be had. Examination of all jurors in the initial panel shall be completed by the plaintiff before examination by the defendant. If challenges for cause are allowed, an additional juror shall be called from the entire panel immediately upon the allowance of challenge, and the juror called to replace the juror excused for cause shall take the number of the juror who has been excused, to provide a full initial panel of 20 jurors, whose examination shall be completed before any peremptory challenges are made. When the voir dire examination has been completed, each side shall have four peremptory challenges, and they shall be exercised by the plaintiff first striking one, the defendant than striking one, and so on, until each side has exhausted or waived its right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Here, Cooper\u2019s challenges were made before examination by the defendant commenced; thus, she argues her challenges were not untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b631 Cooper also claims that Hoven\u2019s improper comments during closing prejudiced her right to a fair trial and constituted additional grounds for reversal. Cooper argues that Dr. Hanson\u2019s \u201cblack mark\u201d comments in closing statements were not supported by the evidence, were highly prejudicial, and constitute grounds for a new trial under <em>Kuhnke v. Fisher, </em>210 Mont. 114, 683 P.2d 916 (1984) and <em>Havens v. State, </em>285 Mont. 195, 945 P.2d 941 (1997). Cooper also argues that Hoven\u2019s statements that the jury was \u201clucky\u201d to have Dr. Hanson in Helena constituted improper argument which prejudiced her right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b632 In this connection, Cooper notes that the purpose of her motion in limine was to place her objection to such comments on the record before trial, without requiring her counsel to repeatedly object to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>improper argument and draw the jury\u2019s attention to these types of prejudicial comments. Cooper notes that Dr. Hanson specifically represented to the District Court that he would he would refrain from improper argument and respect the rules of evidence. For instance, in Dr. Hanson\u2019s brief in opposition to the motion in limine, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">Plaintiffs request to exclude \u201cimproper argument\u201d is vague and overbroad, and should not be granted unless and until it becomes necessary in the context of trial. Defense counsel is an experienced trial attorney and recognizes and respects the Rules of Evidence. Defense counsel resents Plaintiffs suggestion that he would flagrantly violate those rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">Defense counsel further submits that several of the specific items Plaintiff lists as \u201cirrelevant\u201d and \u201cinflammatory\u201d should not be categorically excluded from trial, particularly in the context of closing argument. Defense counsel is cognizant of his duties and responsibilities in doing his part to facilitate a fair trial for all parties. However, he is confident in his ability to refrain from improper argument, and, more importantly, he is confident in the Court\u2019s abilities to rule properly in the context of trial on what is and is not relevant and proper argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b633 Cooper argues the \u201cblack mark\u201d comments to the jury were particularly prejudicial given the statements by the panel members during voir dire reflecting a predisposition in favor of the defendant, and concerns about the consequences a verdict against the doctor could have. Cooper argues that a new trial is warranted under <em>Havens </em>since Hoven represented to the District Court he would not engage in the prohibited conduct and then engaged in the very conduct itself. Cooper argues that her substantial right to a fair trial was materially affected by these irregularities, and that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion when it denied her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b634 Dr. Hanson urges us to affirm, and contends that any claimed irregularities in the proceedings did not prejudice Cooper\u2019s right to a fair trial. First, Dr. Hanson argues that the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion in limine was not an abuse of discretion. Dr. Hanson claims that the motion in limine was vague and overbroad and notes that the District Court specifically instructed Cooper to raise any objections based on the arguments noted in the motion at trial. However, Cooper objected only to the comments that the Helena jurors were \u201clucky\u201d to have Dr. Hanson, and did not raise an objection to the \u201cblack mark\u201d comments. Dr. Hanson argues the \u201clucky\u201d comments were not prejudicial, and that Cooper waived her objections to the \u201cblack mark\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>comments, which were not prejudicial at any rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b635 Second, Dr. Hanson argues the District Court acted within its discretion when it denied Cooper\u2019s challenges for cause. Dr. Hanson asserts that Cooper\u2019s examination of the jury was confusing and was simply an attempt to pin potential members of the jury to a specific position before they had a chance to see evidence and hear argument. Dr. Hanson further contends that none of the potential jurors evinced bias or enmity in favor of either party. Dr. Hanson notes that Cooper failed to question jurors Eby and Silvonen about any potential bias after the preponderance of the evidence instruction was read, and failed to challenge them while in the presence of the jury. Thus, whether any of the jurors were actually biased or would not apply the preponderance of the evidence standard at trial is not known. Dr. Hanson further argues that Ellwein did not evince bias or enmity, but was simply reluctant to define an amount of damages without hearing any evidence. With respect to Waters, who was challenged in the jury\u2019s presence, Dr. Hanson contends that he did not evince any bias, and was properly rehabilitated. Additionally, Dr. Hanson argues that the District Court correctly concluded that Cooper waived her right to challenge the jurors for cause under M. R. Civ. P. 47(b), by failing to bring such challenges at the conclusion of her examination before the lunch recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b636 With regard to the denial of the motion for a new trial, Dr. Hanson contends there was sufficient evidence to support the defense verdict and that the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion in limine and challenges for cause did not constitute irregularities since they were made within the District Court\u2019s discretion. Further, Dr. Hanson disputes that Hoven\u2019s comments during closing statements materially affected Cooper\u2019s substantial right to a fair trial. Dr. Hanson faults Cooper for failing to object to the challenged comments during trial, and also contends that \u201cDr. Hanson\u2019s counsel did not break his word during his closing argument,\u201d and that <em>Havens </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b637  As noted by the District Court, \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, sets forth the bases upon which a verdict may be vacated and a new trial granted. Irregularities in the proceedings on behalf of the court, jury, or adverse party may constitute a grounds for reversal and a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA. Upon a careful review of the record in this case, we conclude that Dr. Hanson\u2019s \u201cblack mark\u201d statement during closing, in combination with juror Silvonen\u2019s \u201clife sentence\u201d statement and expressed concerns of the other jurors about the preponderance of the evidence standard, and Hoven\u2019s assurances to the court that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>would not engage in improper argument, constitute irregularities in the court proceedings which materially prejudiced Cooper\u2019s substantial right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b638 As noted above, several of the jury panel members were overtly reluctant to apply a preponderance of the evidence standard to the case before them. One juror voiced his belief that a plaintiffs verdict would be tantamount to a life sentence. This being so, Cooper\u2019s pretrial motion in limine, seeking to preclude improper argument on these sensitive issues, was prescient. Cooper sought a pretrial ruling precisely to guard against appeals to passion or prejudice-and the voir dire indeed revealed that such passions and prejudices were in the air. Understandably, Cooper wanted to avoid objecting to improper arguments in front of the jury, as such objections only underscore the inappropriate points made by opposing counsel. We have historically encouraged the filing of motions in limine for precisely this reason. <em>See State v. Ingraham, </em>1998 MT 156, \u00b6 36, 290 Mont. 18, 966 P.2d 103 (\u201cA motion in limine has special advantages in situations such as this. A party may not wish to register an objection in the presence of the jury for tactical reasons, yet may wish to preserve the objection on appeal.\u201d); <em>State v. Krause, </em>2002 MT 63, \u00b6 32, 309 Mont. 174, 44 P.3d 493 (quotations omitted) (\u201cThe purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent the introduction of evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, or unfairly prejudicial. Accordingly, the authority to grant or deny a motion in limine rests in the inherent power of the court to admit or exclude evidence and to take such precautions as are necessary to afford a fair trial for all parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b639  The \u201cblack mark\u201d comment must be considered in the context of the anxieties expressed by the jurors. The remark was timed and intended to remind the jurors that the doctor\u2019s reputation would be tarnished by a verdict against him, and to let them know it was alright-indeed, important-for them to take account of that prospect when deciding the outcome of the case. This suggestion that reputation should be taken into consideration during deliberations was improper and highly prejudicial, especially under the circumstances presented by voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b640  In <em>Kuhnke </em>we expressly held that reputation argument was improper. <em>Kuhnke, </em>210 Mont. at 122, 683 P.2d at 920-21. Cooper specifically cited <em>Kuhnke </em>to the District Court as a basis for her motion in limine. <em>See also Rush v. Hamdy, </em>627 N.E.2d 1119, 1123 (Ill. App. 4 Dist. 1994) (\u201cThe impact of a verdict against a defendant upon the defendant\u2019s reputation is irrelevant and should not be considered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the jury in resolving the issue of defendant\u2019s negligence. A reference to the impact of a verdict upon defendant\u2019s reputation is an appeal to the passions and sympathy of the jury.\u201d). Further, the prospect of Hoven meeting the jurors \u201con the street\u201d and their feeling ashamed of their verdict is highly improper and prejudicial. Such comments can play no legitimate role in the context of a civil jury trial. These comments were \u201cwell placed\u201d in a manner which maximized their prejudicial effect on the jury and deprived Cooper of a meaningful opportunity to respond. <em>See Willing, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b641 In light of the timing and circumstances present here, after Hoven made his \u201cblack mark\u201d comments, the District Court\u2019s previous rulings should have been reexamined in conjunction with Cooper\u2019s motion for a new trial. An analogous situation was presented to this Court in <em>Havens. </em>In that case, plaintiff Steven Havens (Havens) was struck by an automobile at an intersection in Butte, Montana, and sued the state of Montana for negligence in failing to install a traffic light at that intersection. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 196, 945 P.2d at 941. After the collision, the motorist who struck Havens was issued a citation. However, Havens had been consuming alcohol the day of the accident, and a subsequent toxicology report showed a blood alcohol concentration of .068 and yielded a positive result for marijuana. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 196, 945 P.2d at 941. Havens filed a motion in limine to prohibit the introduction of this evidence, which was denied by the district court. The State asserted that it would present this evidence at trial. In order to blunt the effect of such evidence on the jury, Havens himself introduced it in his case-in-chief. However, the State did not offer evidence that Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption contributed to the accident. Furthermore, the investigating officer testified at trial that the other motorist pulled in front of Havens so quickly that there was nothing Havens could have done to avoid the accident, and that his alcohol consumption did not play a part in the accident. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 198, 945 P.2d at 942. The jury subsequently returned a verdict in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b642 After the verdict, Havens moved for a new trial. Havens argued that evidence of his alcohol consumption and the results of the toxicology report had no relevance and caused him severe prejudice. The district court denied the motion for a new trial, and Havens appealed. First, this Court agreed with Havens that the evidence concerning his alcohol consumption and the toxicology report was prejudicial and irrelevant since it was not alleged that his consumption of alcohol or marijuana in any way contributed to the accident. <em>Havens, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>285 Mont. at 200, 945 P.2d at 943-44. Second, while the Court concluded that the district court did not err when it originally denied the motion in limine based on the State\u2019s assurances, we nonetheless held that the district court should have reconsidered its ruling in the post-trial context \u201cin light of the State\u2019s failure to fulfill its promise to elicit testimony establishing Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption as a factor in causing the collision.\u201d <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 201, 945 P.2d at 944. We prefaced this holding with the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">Although we rarely find a manifest abuse of discretion in the denial of a motion for a new trial, there are certain instances in which the prejudicial matter at issue undermines the fairness to such a degree that a new trial is the only remedy. In <em>Kuhnke v. Fisher </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 114, 683 P.2d 916, we addressed the question of improper argument to the jury and noted that \u201cthe only way to be sure which, if any, of the defendants should be exonerated or whether plaintiff should recover at all is to grant a new <em>trial Kuhnke, </em>683 P.2d at 922. In <em>Putro v. Baker </em>(1966), 147 Mont. 139, 410 P.2d 717, we were confronted with a situation wherein jurors had been exposed to a prejudicial newspaper article about the case under consideration. The district court denied both a motion for a mistrial and a motion for a new trial. We reversed and held that \u201cthe guiding principle of our legal system is fairness. We must tenaciously adhere to the ideal that both sides of a lawsuit be guaranteed a fair trial. Sec. 27, Art. III, Montana Constitution [now Sec. 17, Art. II].\u201d <em>Putro, </em>410 P.2d at 722. We also reasoned \u201cthat unexplained prejudicial references to important matters in litigation may have a \u2018natural tendency\u2019 to infect the proceedings with an unfairness that can be corrected only by starting anew the legal contest.\u201d <em>Putro, </em>410 P.2d at 722.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au9\"><em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 200-01, 945 P.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b643  In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in failing to grant Plaintiffs motion for a new trial. Because cumulative prejudice, culminating in the Defendant\u2019s unlawful appeal to the passions and prejudices of the jury, denied the plaintiff a fair trial, the only way this unfairness can be corrected is \u201c \u2018by starting anew the legal contest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 201, 945 P.2d at 944 (quoting <em>Putro, </em>147 Mont. at 149, 410 P.2d at 722). Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b644  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude this is one of those rare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>cases in which it is manifest that a district court has abused its discretion in failing to grant a motion for a new trial. We therefore reverse the jury\u2019s verdict and remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-4\">JUSTICES RICE, WHEAT and NELSON cocnur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-20\"> Unlike the other members f the panel discussed in this Opinion, Demato was ultimately not selected to serve on the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b345-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ahod\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b645 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion and the Court\u2019s reversal on the issues involving the challenges for cause and defense counsel\u2019s closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b646 I would also reverse and remand for a new trial, however, on the matter of the trial court\u2019s denial of Cooper\u2019s motion in limine. The District Court erred in its determination that Cooper\u2019s motion was \u201cvague and overbroad.\u201d It was not; the motion was specific in requesting the court to exclude certain categories of clearly inadmissible evidence. Granting it should have been a no-brainer. Indeed, the motion turned out to be prescient as to at least two categories of the specified evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b647 Cooper properly requested the court to prohibit references to Hanson\u2019s professional reputation or standing; that Hanson needed special protection; or that there could be unspecified effects or consequences of the malpractice claims, this trial, or a malpractice verdict against Hanson-Numbers 4 and 5 in Cooper\u2019s motion. Opinion, \u00b6 4. As the Court\u2019s Opinion states, that sort of evidence and argument is improper in a professional negligence case; it is irrelevant to the question of whether the professional person breached the applicable standard of care and, in so doing, caused the plaintiff damages. It does nothing but appeal to the passions, sympathies and biases of the jurors. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39, 40. Any professional person can make a mistake, and this State\u2019s tort system is designed to compensate the injured party for the professional\u2019s negligence-regardless of what sort of \u201cmark\u201d or effect that may have on his or her reputation, standing, practice or personal finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\u00b648 Even defense counsel recognized the impropriety of these types of comments and arguments-he feigned offense at even the suggestion that he would violate the Rules of Evidence and he assured the court and counsel that he would not engage in the very sort of improper comment and argument that he, eventually, did. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 32. \u00b649 Therefore, independently of any other error committed by the trial court in this cause, I would hold that the trial court erred in denying Cooper\u2019s motion in limine, and I would reverse and remand for a new trial on that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u00b650 Finally, while I concur with the Court\u2019s Opinion generally in its resolution of the challenges for cause issue, I do not necessarily extend my agreement to the manner in which Cooper\u2019s challenges for cause were made in this case. However, since we do not actually interpret the language of M. R. Civ. P. 47(b), I am satisfied to leave the proper construction of this Rule for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b651 I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b346-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"AWA\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b652 I concur in the result reached by the Court. The refusal of the District Court to remove the disputed jurors for cause warrants reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b653 However, I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusions regarding defense counsel\u2019s statements in closing argument. The comments did not deny plaintiff a fair trial when considered in the context of the entire argument. The District Court correctly noted that counsel\u2019s remarks were an \u201cinvited response to Cooper\u2019s closing argument\u201d and an appropriate reply. Nor was the \u201cblack mark\u201d comment sufficiently improper or prejudicial within the context of the proceeding. That statement by defense counsel is different in character and degree from those in <em>Kuhnke, </em>the opinion cited by the majority where the remarks of counsel in closing caused the trial judge to describe them as terribly disturbing. <em>Kuhnke, </em>210 Mont. at 125, 683 P.2d at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u00b654 The jurors were admonished by the court that statements by the attorneys are not evidence. Juries are certainly capable of parsing argument from evidence and, thus, attorneys are generally given some latitude in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\u00b655 I do not join with the Court\u2019s opinion regarding cumulative prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
