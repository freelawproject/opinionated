We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b62 Roberts presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Whether the District Court was authorized upon revocation of a suspended sentence to impose a 15-year commitment to the Department of Corrections with no time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Whether the District Court improperly considered Roberts\u2019 marijuana use in the dispositional proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">\u00b65 In October, 2005, Roberts was charged by information with felony DUI (his eleventh DUI offense), felony criminal endangerment, expired registration, and driving with a suspended or revoked license. At the time of the offenses Roberts was on probation from his tenth DUI conviction, a felony. In March, 2006, Roberts pled guilty to the charges, and in April, 2006, the District Court sentenced him to the Department of Corrections for 5 years suspended on the DUI charge; 10 years suspended on the criminal endangerment to run consecutively to the sentence for the DUI; a $500 fine for the expired registration, suspended; and 6 months suspended on the driving with a suspended license to run concurrently with the other sentences. Those sentences were consecutive to Roberts\u2019 then-outstanding sentence on his tenth DUI conviction. On December 17, 2008, Roberts discharged the sentence from the tenth DUI and began serving the 15-year suspended sentence imposed in April, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>\u00b66 In April, 2009 the State filed a petition for revocation of Roberts\u2019 2006 suspended sentence, based upon the affidavit of his probation officer that Roberts submitted an adulterated urine sample and admitted to drinking alcohol. Roberts appeared and denied the allegations of the petition. The probation officer filed an additional affidavit of probation violation alleging that Roberts\u2019 urine sample had tested positive for marijuana use. The State did not file a separate petition to revoke based upon that conduct. In June, 2009, the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the petition to revoke and found that Roberts had committed the violations as alleged. On June 24, 2009, the District Court conducted a disposition hearing, revoked Roberts\u2019 probation, and committed him to the Department of Corrections for 15 years, with no time suspended. The District Court filed written judgment on July 9, 2009, and Roberts appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b67 This Court reviews a criminal sentence greater than one year for legality only. <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>2009 MT 341, \u00b6 3, 353 Mont. 111, 220 P.3d. 25. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s construction of a statute de novo to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. Brown, </em>2009 MT 452, \u00b6 6, 354 Mont. 329, 223 P.3d 874. Issues of constitutional law are subject to plenary review. <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683. A district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine whether they are correct. <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636. A decision to revoke a suspended sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Boulton, </em>2006 MT 170, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 538, 140 P.3d 482; <em>State v. Burke, </em>2005 MT 250, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 1, 122 P.3d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b68 <em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court was authorized upon revocation of a suspended sentence to impose a 15-year commitment to the Department of Corrections with no time suspended. </em>Roberts contends that because the District Court committed him to the Department of Corrections for the probation violations, all but the first 5 years of the commitment should have been suspended as provided in \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA. That statute provides that \u201c[wjhenever a person has been found guilty of an offense\u201d upon a verdict or a plea, the sentence may include commitment to the Department of Corrections but that \u201call but the first five years of the commitment... must be suspended....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u00b69 The State contends that \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA, only applies to the original sentence following a verdict or plea of guilty, and that sentencing options following a finding that the offender has violated the terms of a suspended sentence are governed by \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA. That section allows the district court, after finding a violation of the terms of a suspended sentence, to continue the suspended sentence without change; to continue the suspended sentence but with modified or additional terms; or to \u201crevoke the suspended sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not require a longer imprisonment or commitment term than the original sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b610 We construe statutes to ascertain legislative intent, and interpret a statute by first looking to its plain language. If the language is clear and unambiguous no further interpretation is required. <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 178, 152 P.3d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b611 The two statutes at issue apply to two distinct situations. Section 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA applies to the initial sentence imposed after conviction of a crime upon a verdict or plea. <em>State v. Strong, </em>2009 MT 65, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 349 Mont. 417, 203 P.3d 848. That statute \u201cgoverns the form of a criminal sentence.\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b612 By contrast, \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, applies later when the district court has found that the offender has violated the terms of the original suspended sentence imposed under \u00a7 46-18-20l(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA. The revocation of a suspended sentence is \u201cparticularly and expressly governed\u201d by \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, <em>State v. Seals, </em>2007 MT 71, \u00b6 15, 336 Mont. 416, 156 P.3d 15, and that statute defines the district court\u2019s options in a revocation proceeding. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. A district court has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d under the revocation statute. <em>Burke, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b613  Unlike the initial criminal proceedings against an accused, a probation violation proceeding is civil. <em>Boulton, </em>\u00b6 16. Probation revocation is not based upon the conduct that constituted the original crime, but upon later conduct that constitutes a violation of the conditions of a suspended sentence. <em>State v. Walker, </em>2001 MT 170, \u00b6 15, 306 Mont. 159, 30 P.3d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b614  Sections 46-18-201 and -203, MCA, are distinct statutory provisions applying to two distinct situations. There is nothing in the terms of either statute that makes \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA, applicable to probation revocation proceedings under \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA. Therefore, we conclude that a district court determining the sanction to be imposed after a revocation of probation is governed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, and not by \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court was within its discretion to commit Roberts to the Department of Corrections for 15 years with no time suspended after finding that he had violated the conditions of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court improperly considered Roberts\u2019 marijuana use in the dispositional proceeding. </em>Roberts contends that the District Court improperly revoked his suspended sentence based upon the evidence of marijuana use contained in the probation officer\u2019s second affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b616 Minimal requirements of due process apply to revocation hearings, which must afford \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819; <em>State v. Kingery, </em>239 Mont. 160, 167, 779 P.2d 495, 499 (1989). Roberts has not shown that there was a failure to follow any specific requirement of \u00a7 46-18-203(4), (5), or (6), MCA, which provides the outline of the procedure to be followed in probation revocation proceedings. <em>Kingery, </em>239 Mont. at 167, 779 P.2d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b617 Here the State filed a written petition to revoke the suspended sentence, and Roberts appeared in court to ask for additional time to respond. He subsequently appeared in court and denied the allegations of the petition. After an evidentiary hearing the District Court found that Roberts committed the acts alleged in the petition to revoke, and found that he was in violation of the conditions of his probation. The actual petition for revocation was based upon the probation officer\u2019s allegations in an affidavit that Roberts provided an adulterated urine sample and that he admitted to alcohol use. It is clear from the record that the District Court, after hearing, based the decision to revoke upon a finding that the State had proven those two grounds as alleged in the petition. The District Court so stated in open court on the record and there is no showing that the decision to revoke was based on any other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b618 There was a subsequent dispositional hearing at which time Roberts received the sentence he complains of. The revocation proceedings therefore met the applicable requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"AzO\">\u00b619  The allegation that Roberts tested positive for marijuana was not a ground for the State\u2019s petition to revoke, but was contained in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>subsequent affidavit filed in the District Court record by the probation officer. Roberts had notice of the marijuana allegation for over five weeks prior to the hearing on the petition. Roberts did not ask for additional time to respond. More importantly, even though the allegation was in the record, the evidence of marijuana use was not used as a basis for finding a violation of the conditions of the suspended sentence. The two violations alleged in the State\u2019s petition and found by the District Court were sufficient in themselves to revoke the suspended sentence and impose the new sentence. <em>State v. Gillingham, </em>2008 MT 38, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 341 Mont. 325, 176 P.3d 1075. The fact that the District Court mentioned the allegation of marijuana use at the dispositional hearing does not affect the conclusion that the proceedings met the requirements of fundamental fairness and there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b620 The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> Roberts relies upon <em>State v. Quesnel, 2009 </em>MT 388, 353 Mont. 317, 220 P.3d 634, to support his argument. However, that case did not involve a probation revocation and did not consider the underlying issue in this case as to whether \u00a7 46-18-201 or -203, MCA, applied to revocation proceedings. And, the ultimate result of <em>Quesnel </em>was to uphold a 15-year DOC commitment with no time suspended</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
