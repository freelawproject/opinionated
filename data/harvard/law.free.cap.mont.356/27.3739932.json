(hereinafter, Ameriprise). A jury in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, found that Davis had offered or sold unregistered securities to Gregg and Joy Farrell Mosley (the Mosleys) and Fred and Deborah Fellows (the Fellows). The jury awarded $70,000 to the Mosleys. (The Fellows had previously settled with Davis.) However, following the jury\u2019s verdict, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>dismissed the Mosleys\u2019 claim against Davis based on his statute-of-limitations defense. As for the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 claims against Ameriprise, the jury found that Ameriprise was not a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of Davis with respect to any of the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 purchases of unregistered securities. The Mosleys and the Fellows now appeal, and Ameriprise cross-appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b62 The Mosleys and the Fellows articulate seven appeal issues, while Ameriprise articulates four cross-appeal issues. We conclude, however, that the following two issues, restated here, are dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">1. Did the District Court err in dismissing the Mosleys\u2019 claim against Davis based on his statute-of-limitations defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">2. Was Ameriprise liable as a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of Davis with respect to the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 purchases of unregistered securities?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u00b63 This story begins with the advent of what the Mosleys and the Fellows term a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> known as Wex Wheels, Inc. Under this scheme, Gary Wexler, who owned car dealerships in San Diego, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada, sold automobiles by way of installment sales contracts, which he then sold as assignments to third parties. In November 1998, Davis, who at the time worked for Ameriprise as a financial advisor, persuaded the Fellows to make an initial investment of roughly $33,000 in Wexler\u2019s automobile-financing scheme, indicating that the investments would yield rates of return in excess of 12 percent. The Fellows\u2019 first investment went well and they received the promised return. In January 2000, Davis retired from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Ameriprise. In May 2000, the Fellows sold their home in Montana for around $900,000 and invested all but $80,000 of the proceeds in Wex Wheels assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b64 The Mosleys also invested in Wex Wheels. Gregg Mosley, a boyhood friend of Davis, invested $70,000 in Wex Wheels during a Thanksgiving visit with Davis in 1999. While this was the only investment the Mosleys made in Wex Wheels before Davis retired from Ameriprise, they continued to invest after Davis\u2019s retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b65 As it turned out, Wexler was selling assignments to third parties, including the Fellows and the Mosleys, which were backed by fictitious automobile loans. The scheme collapsed and the Fellows, the Mosleys, and other investors lost millions of dollars. When Davis discovered Wexler\u2019s unlawful actions, he turned Wexler in to the FBI. Wexler ultimately pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Nevada to wire fraud (for faxing 41 fraudulent vehicle loan contracts to Davis in Montana).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b66 On March 14, 2002, the Mosleys and the Fellows commenced the present action in District Court. Their Third Amended Complaint, filed March 7,2003, alleged seven counts; however, as trial approached, the Mosleys and the Fellows began dismissing some of their claims. Ultimately, they maintained claims against Davis and Wexler for the sale of unregistered securities (in the form of Wex Wheels assignments) and claims against Ameriprise based on the theory that the company had \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability for Davis\u2019s sale of unregistered securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b67 In May 2006, the District Court entered a default judgment against Wexler in the amount of $3,162,103.00. In November 2008, the case against Davis and Ameriprise proceeded to a seven-day jury trial. Ultimately, the jury found that Davis\u2019s sales of Wex Wheels assignments to the Mosleys and the Fellows constituted the sale of unregistered securities, but that Ameriprise was not a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of Davis for any of those sales. As noted, the District Court dismissed the Mosleys\u2019 claim against Davis post-verdict, based on his statute-of-limitations defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the District Court entered judgment as follows: the Mosleys take nothing against Davis, and the Mosleys and the Fellows take nothing against Ameriprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b68 Additional facts are set forth below where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">\u00b69 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in dismissing the Mosleys\u2019claim against Davis based on his statute-of-limitations defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b610 We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute. <em>In re J.D.N., </em>2008 MT 420, \u00b6 8, 347 Mont. 368, 199 P.3d 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b611 In their Third Amended Complaint, the Mosleys alleged that Davis had sold them an unregistered security in violation of \u00a7 30-10-202, MCA, and that Davis had sold them a security by means of fraud or misrepresentation. These claims were premised on \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">Any person who offers or sells a security in violation of 30-10-202 or offers or sells a security by means of fraud or misrepresentation is liable to the person buying the security from him, who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration paid for the security, together with interest at 10% per annum from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security. Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">(a) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">(b) interest at 10% per annum from the date of disposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u00b612 The applicable statute of limitations for these claims is set forth in \u00a7 30-10-307(5), MCA, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">(a) No action may be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on a violation of 30-10-202 unless it is brought within 2 years after the violation occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">(b) No action may be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on fraud or misrepresentation unless it is brought within 2 years after discovery of the fraud or misrepresentation on which the liability is founded or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">(c) In no event may an action be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on fraud or misrepresentation unless it is brought within 5 years after the transaction on which the action is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b613 The Mosleys dismissed their fraud/misrepresentation claim before trial, which left their claim that Davis had sold them an unregistered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>security in violation of \u00a7 30-10-202, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell any security in this state, except securities exempt under 30-10-104 or when sold in transactions exempt under 30-10-105, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">(1) the security is registered by notification, coordination, or qualification under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">(2) for a federal covered security, the security has been filed with the commissioner pursuant to 30-10-211 and the fee prescribed in 30-10-209 has been paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b614 The District Court dismissed this \u201c30-10-202 claim\u201d based on \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(a), MCA (quoted above). The jury had found that the Mosleys purchased a number of unregistered securities in 1999, 2000, and 2001; however, the jury had also found that of these purchases, the only one in which Davis was an \u201cofferor\u201d or \u201cseller\u201d occurred on November 27, 1999.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, because the Mosleys filed their initial complaint on March 14, 2002, nearly two years and four months after Davis\u2019s violation of \u00a7 30-10-202, MCA, the District Court concluded that their 30-10-202 claim was untimely and dismissed it with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b615 The Mosleys contend that the District Court erred because their 30-10-202 claim did not accrue until August 2001. They rely on \u00a7 27-2-102(1), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">For the purposes of statutes relating to the time within which an action must be commenced:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">(a) a claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">(b) an action is commenced when the complaint is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">The Mosleys also rely on <em>Uhler v. Doak, </em>268 Mont. 191, 885 P.2d 1297 (1994), where we held that a claim of professional negligence by an attorney did not accrue, and the statute of limitations did not begin to run, until the client sustained damages. Based on these authorities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the Mosleys argue that there can be no cause of action for a violation of \u00a7 30-10-202, MCA, and thus the statute of limitations does not begin to run, until damages have occurred. Here, they maintain, there were no damages until Wex Wheels collapsed in August 2001, making the filing of their complaint on March 14, 2002, well within the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b616 We disagree with this approach for two reasons. First, as Ameriprise points out, \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(a), MCA, specifically requires a claim founded on a violation of \u00a7 30-10-202, MCA, to be brought \u201cwithin 2 years <em>after the violation </em>occurs\u201d (emphasis added). The violation occurs when a person offers or sells an unregistered security-not, as the Mosleys argue, when the unregistered security loses its presumed value or stops paying the expected returns. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-10-202, MCA. Second, and along these same lines, \u00a7 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA, states that a claim or cause of action accrues \u201cwhen all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action.\u201d As just noted, a claim under \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA, that a person offered or sold a security in violation of \u00a7 30-10-202, MCA, is complete when the offer or sale occurs-again not, as the Mosleys claim, years later when the purchaser decides that she made a bad investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b617 The Mosleys argue, however, that where there has been a \u201cconcealment of injury,\u201d the limitations period does not begin until the injury is discovered. Here, they contend, Wexler concealed the fact that the assignments were based on fictitious auto-loan contracts and the Mosleys did not discover this concealment until July 2001. As support for this theory, the Mosleys rely on \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">The period of limitation does not begin on any claim or cause of action for an injury to person or property until the facts constituting the claim have been discovered or, in the exercise of due diligence, should have been discovered by the injured party if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">(a) the facts constituting the claim are by their nature concealed or self-concealing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">(b) before, during, or after the act causing the injury, the defendant has taken action which prevents the injured party from discovering the injury or its cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u00b618 There are two problems with the Mosleys\u2019 reliance on this provision. First, while the Mosleys assert that \u201c[t]he trial evidence revealed that neither Davis nor the Mosleys knew that Gary Wexler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>was providing phony contracts to investors until July of 2001,\u201d they have failed to explain why the facts constituting their 30-10-202 claim could not have been discovered \u201cin the exercise of due diligence.\u201d Section 27-2-102(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b619 Second, and more fundamentally, the statutory scheme set out in \u00a7 30-10-307(5), MCA, precludes application of \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, to 30-10-202 claims. As Ameriprise points out, an action founded on a 30-10-202 violation must be brought \u201cwithin 2 years <em>after the violation occurs.\u201d </em>Section 30-10-307(5)(a), MCA (emphasis added). Yet, in contrast, an action founded on fraud or misrepresentation must be brought \u201cwithin 2 years <em>after discovery of the fraud or misrepresentation on which the liability is founded or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,\u201d </em>though not later than \u201c5 years after the transaction on which the action is based.\u201d Section 30-10-307(5)(b), (c) (emphasis added). In light of this differing treatment of 30-10-202 claims and fraud/misrepresentation claims, Ameriprise argues that the Legislature specifically intended that the limitations period for 30-10-202 claims <em>not </em>be based on the date of discovery of the 30-10-202 violation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b620  When a general statute and a specific statute are inconsistent, the specific statute governs, so that a specific legislative directive will control over an inconsistent general provision. <em>Mercury Marine v. Monty\u2019s Enters., Inc., </em>270 Mont. 413, 417, 892 P.2d 568, 571 (1995). Here, we conclude that the specific statute (\u00a7 30-10-307(5)(a), MCA) controls over the general statute (\u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA). The Legislature addressed the statutes of limitation for 30-10-202 claims and fraud/misrepresentation claims within the same statutory provision-namely, \u00a7 30-10-307(5), MCA. The Legislature included a \u201cdiscovery\u201d clause for fraud/misrepresentation claims in subsection (5)(b) but did not include a \u201cdiscovery\u201d clause for 30-10-202 claims in subsection (5)(a). The implication of this is clear: The Legislature did not intend for the limitations period on 30-10-202 claims to run from the date of discovery of the 30-10-202 violation. Under these circumstances, we will not apply \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, to 30-10-202 claims. Nor may we insert a \u201cdiscovery\u201d clause into \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>MCA, for 30-10-202 claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b621  The Mosleys\u2019 30-10-202 claim was not brought within two years after Davis offered or sold them an unregistered security. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in dismissing their claim against Davis based on his statute-of-limitations defense. Section 30-10-307(5)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b622 <em>Issue 2. Was Ameriprise liable as a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of Davis with respect to the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 purchases of unregistered securities?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b623 The Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 claims against Ameriprise were premised on \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability. A \u201ccontrol person\u201d shares the liability for violations of securities laws with the primary violator it controlled. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-10-307(2), MCA. This statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Every person who directly or indirectly controls a seller liable under subsection (1), every partner, officer, or director (or person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) or employee of such a seller, and every broker-dealer or salesperson who participates or materially aids in the sale is liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the seller if the nonseller knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care could have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Section 30-10-307(2), MCA. Thus, to prevail on this claim, the Mosleys and the Fellows had to show both (1) that Ameriprise directly or indirectly controlled Davis and (2) that Ameriprise knew, or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>exercise of reasonable care could have known, of the existence of the facts upon which Davis\u2019s liability is premised. Generally, status as a control person is a question of fact. <em>See Sanders Confectionery Prods., Inc. v. Heller Fin., </em>Inc., 973 F.2d 474, 485-86 (6th Cir. 1992); <em>Harrison v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>974 F.2d 873, 881 (7th Cir. 1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the jury ultimately found that Ameriprise was not a \u201ccontrol person\u201d for any of Davis\u2019s sales of Wex Wheels assignments to the Mosleys and the Fellows.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b624 The Mosleys and the Fellows contend, however, that the jury was not adequately instructed on the meaning of \u201ccontrol person.\u201d For that matter, they argue that whether an entity is a \u201ccontrol person\u201d is a matter of law and that the status of Ameriprise as the broker-dealer for Davis was sufficient to establish it as the \u201ccontrol person\u201d for him. As support for this argument, they cite <em>Martin v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., </em>986 F.2d 242 (8th Cir. 1993). In <em>Martin, </em>the court held that Shearson Lehman Hutton\u2019s status as employer of the investment broker, who had unlawfully solicited the purchase of a security by the plaintiff, was sufficient to establish it as a controlling person. <em>Id. </em>at 244. In so doing, the court cited <em>Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., </em>914 F.2d 1564, 1573-78 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc), for the proposition \u201cthat a brokerage house is, as a matter of law, a controlling person for purposes of the securities laws, but that the brokerage house is not liable if it can prove good faith and a lack of inducement.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>986 F.2d at 244. In response, Ameriprise argues that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 control-person liability claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Citing <em>Hauser v. Farrell, </em>14 F.3d 1338 (9th Cir. 1994), Ameriprise contends that the Wex Wheels assignments were outside of its knowledge and control and that no reasonable juror could have reached a different conclusion. For the reasons which follow, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>reject the per se rule suggested by the Mosleys and conclude that on the record here, Ameriprise was not liable as a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of Davis regarding sales of Wex Wheels assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b625 In <em>Hauser,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Ninth Circuit analyzed control-person liability for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">[ejvery person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The Court of Appeals noted that under its holding <em>hi Hollinger, supra, </em>a broker-dealer is, as a matter of law, \u201ca controlling person under that provision with respect to its registered representatives,\u201d since \u201cthe securities laws impose on broker-dealers a duty to supervise their registered representatives, and the representatives need the dealers to gain access to the securities markets.\u201d <em>Hauser, </em>14 F.3d at 1341 <em>(citing Hollinger, </em>914 F.2d at 1573). However, the court also noted that \u201ca broker-dealer is not necessarily liable Tor all actions taken by its registered representatives,\u2019 and is not an insurer of its representatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hollinger, </em>914 F.2d at 1575). In this connection, the court observed that some actions by a stockbroker may be outside the firm\u2019s control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201cThe broker-dealer may also, of course, rely on a contention that the representative was acting outside of the broker-dealer\u2019s statutory \u2018control.\u2019 For example, [the broker-dealer] could argue that when appellants entrusted their money to [the representative] they were not reasonably relying upon him as a registered representative of [the broker-dealer], but were placing the money with [the representative] for purposes other than investment in markets to which [the representative] had access only by reason of his relationship with [the] broker-dealer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\"><em>Id. </em>(brackets <em>hiHauser) (quoting Hollinger, </em>914 F.2d at 1575-76 n. 26). Ultimately, the court affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>judgment against the plaintiffs (Hauser and Acosta) on their control-person claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">Considering all the circumstances of the transactions, Mr. Hauser and Mr. Acosta were not reasonably relying upon the stockbrokers as registered representatives of [the securities brokerage firm] Rauscher, Pierce. They were placing the money with the stockbrokers for purposes other than investment in markets to which stockbrokers had access only by reason of their relationship with Rauscher, Pierce. As the district court pointed out, the brokers did not need Rauscher, Pierce to promote [New Technologies in Energy (NTE)], it was not the kind of investment for which a customer typically relies on a broker with access through his firm to a stock exchange, and Hauser bought into NTE before the brokers even went to work for Rauscher, Pierce. Acosta knew that the brokers were planning to quit working for Rauscher, Pierce so that they could devote more of their efforts to NTE [which was not a Rauscher, Pierce promotion and which the two stockbrokers owned themselves]. Rauscher, Pierce had no knowledge of or financial interest in the NTE venture. In addition to the evidence expressly alluded to by the district judge, we note that Mr. Hauser\u2019s and Mr. Acosta\u2019s statements from Rauscher, Pierce did not list the NTE investments. Mr. Hauser and Mr. Acosta did not, in the deposition excerpts provided to the district court, contradict the brokers\u2019 representations that they told the customers that the NTE investment would not be through Rauscher, Pierce and had nothing to do with Rauscher, Pierce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4b\"><em>Id. </em>at 1342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b626  Although the language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a) is not identical to \u00a7 30-10-307(2), MCA, the two provisions involve a similar approach: liability is imposed for directly or indirectly controlling the primary violator, but the controlling person avoids liability under \u00a7 30-10-307(2), MCA, if he did not know, or in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the facts upon which the violator\u2019s liability is premised, and the controlling person avoids liability under \u00a7 78t(a) if he acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action. With respect to the first element (whether the person directly or indirectly controlled the primary violator), we conclude that the approach of the court in <em>Hauser </em>is appropriate for analysis under \u00a7 30-10-307(2), MCA. In other words, as a general rule a broker-dealer controls its registered representatives, whether directly or indirectly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>But at the same time, certain actions by a stockbroker may be outside the firm\u2019s control. <em>Hauser </em>presented one such scenario, and we agree with Ameriprise that this case presents another such scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b627 Here, Ameriprise argues, and the record confirms, that Davis did not act in his role as a representative of Ameriprise when he sold the Wex Wheels assignments to the Mosleys and the Fellows. Wex Wheels had no relationship with Ameriprise and was not an Ameriprise product-facts of which the Mosleys and the Fellows were aware. The sale of Wex Wheels assignments did not require access to a stock exchange or other market through Ameriprise, and the assignments were not the kind of investment for which a customer typically relies on a broker with access through his firm to a stock exchange. The Mosleys and the Fellows never received an Ameriprise statement indicating that Wex Wheels was condoned by Ameriprise, and they did not place their money with Davis for investment in markets to which Davis had access only by reason of his relationship with Ameriprise. In fact, the Mosleys were not Ameriprise investment clients and never made a single investment with Ameriprise. Furthermore, Davis told the Mosleys and the Fellows that Wex Wheels was not an Ameriprise product, and Fred Fellows told Davis that this was what he found \u201cattractive\u201d about Wex Wheels. In short, neither the Mosleys nor the Fellows relied on Davis\u2019s relationship with Ameriprise to gain access to the Wex Wheels assignments, Davis did not rely on Ameriprise to promote these investments, and neither the Mosleys nor the Fellows based their decision to invest in Wex Wheels on the fact that Davis was affiliated with Ameriprise. Rather, the record establishes that the assignments were separate arrangements between Davis and the Mosleys and between Davis and the Fellows. Lastly, Ameriprise had no knowledge of, or financial interest in, Wex Wheels.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b628  A broker-dealer \u201cis not an insurer of its representatives.\u201d <em>Hauser, </em>14 F.3d at 1341. On the facts and evidence presented here, we conclude that Ameriprise was not a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of Davis with respect to the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 purchases of Wex Wheels assignments. It appears that Davis was engaged in these sales as an entirely distinct and separate venture from his employment with Ameriprise. Given this conclusion, we hold that irrespective of whether the jury was adequately instructed on the meaning of \u201ccontrol person,\u201d the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 control-person liability claims against Ameriprise fail as a matter of law. This holding, in turn, renders moot the remaining issues raised by the Mosleys and the Fellows and by Ameriprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b629 The District Court did not err in dismissing the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 30-10-202 claim against Davis based on his statute-of-limitations defense. Ameriprise was not liable as a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of Davis with respect to the Mosleys\u2019 and the Fellows\u2019 purchases of unregistered securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\">A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment arrangement in which returns to investors are paid not from any \u201cprofits\u201d of an underlying business venture, but from monies obtained from later investors. The fraud consists of funneling proceeds received from new investors to previous investors in the guise of profits from the alleged business venture, thereby cultivating an illusion that a legitimate profit-making business opportunity exists and inducing further investment. As a result of the absence of sufficient (or any) assets able to generate funds necessary to pay the promised returns, the success of such a scheme guarantees its demise because the operator must attract more and more funds, which thereby creates a greater need for funds to pay previous investors, all of which ultimately causes the scheme to collapse. <em>See In re Taubman, </em>160 B.R. 964, 978 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1993); <em>In re United Energy </em>Corp., 944 F.2d 589, 590 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1991); <em>Cunningham v. Brown, </em>265 U.S. 1, 7-8, 44 S. Ct. 424, 425 (1924).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> Davis first raised this defense in his answer to the complaint, but the District Court did not issue a final ruling on the defense until after trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-13\"> The Mosleys assert that the jury was wrong on this point. They claim that \u201c[n]o evidence whatsoever exists\u201d that Wexler offered or sold them Wex Wheels assignments. Thus, because \u201c[t]he only other person that could have was Davis,\u201d the Mosleys reason that the jury\u2019s verdict (finding that Davis sold to them only once, in November 1999) is contrary to the evidence. As Ameriprise points out, however, there is evidence in the record that the Mosleys\u2019 subsequent purchases in 2000 and 2001 did not involve Davis, but rather were from Wexler. The jury resolved this factual matter against the Mosleys, based on the evidence, and the Mosleys have presented no factual or legal basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s verdict in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b55-9\"> This interpretation of the statutory scheme could potentially lead to harsh or inequitable results where, for example, the purchaser had no reasonable basis for knowing or discovering that the security was unregistered. Indeed, \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(a), MCA, as presently written, may allow unscrupulous brokers to escape liability for violating \u00a7 30-10-202, MCA, if the consumer fails to discover the illegal nature of the transaction until several years later. However, it is up to the Legislature, not this Court, to address this issue. In this regard, the statute defining the underlying causes of action and the available remedies (\u00a7 30-10-307, MCA) is exceedingly convoluted and may warrant reexamination by the Legislature and the Commissioner of Securities. For instance, it is not clear whether a fraud/misrepresentation claim is in addition to, or mutually exclusive of, a 30-10-202 claim, and it is likewise unclear whether the remedy for both claims is exactly the same. Given that the Securities Act of Montana \u201cis intended to protect the investor, persons engaged in securities transactions, and the public interest,\u201d <em>Knowles v. State ex rel. Lindeen, </em>2009 MT 415, \u00b6 1, 353 Mont. 507, 222 P.3d 595 (citing \u00a7 30-10-102(1), MCA), clarifying this provision (and others in the Securities Act, <em>see e.g. Knowles, </em>\u00b6 37 n. 3) would be beneficial to sellers and investors alike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b56-5\"> First enacted in 1961, the Securities Act of Montana is a substantial adoption of the major provisions of the Uniform Securities Act promulgated by the Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, though it contains some variations, omissions, and additional matter. <em>See </em>Chapter Compiler\u2019s Comments, Title 30, chapter 10, MCA (Annotations 2008).
