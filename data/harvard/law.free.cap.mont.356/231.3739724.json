The Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, granted the Conways\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding that the plain language of the plat clearly restricted the building\u2019s location, and ordered Miller to remove a portion of her garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b62 John and Hazel Conway own Lots 5 and 6 of Redgate Vista, a platted subdivision in Lake County, Montana. Anita Miller owns the adjoining Lots 7 and 8. The plat of the Redgate Vista subdivision shows a line running north and south across Miller\u2019s Lot 7 labeled \u201cbuilding restriction line.\u201d The following figure is a copy of the plat showing the configuration of the lots and the building restriction line.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b63 In 1973, Red Gate Inc. surveyed and platted the Redgate Vistasubdivision. All of the deeds in the chain of title for Lots 5, 6, 7, and 8 expressly referred to the plat depicted above. None of the deeds in the Conways\u2019 chain of title mention any easements or the building restriction line. The building restriction line is mentioned in Miller\u2019s chain of title. The deed from Red Gate, Inc. to Leland and Judy Hylsop and the deed from the Hylsops to the Walls contain the language: \u201cAlso, subject to a building restriction line on Lot Seven (7) according to the Plat of Red Gate Vista.\u201d The deed from the Walls to Smudge, Inc. conveys the property in fee simple, \u201cexcept easements, restrictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>reservations and conditions of record.\u201d The deed from Smudge, Inc. to the Youngs has no mention of an easement or building restriction line. The deed from the Youngs to Alvie and Anita Miller conveys the property \u201csubject to and together with rights of way and easements established or of record.\u201d Finally, the quitclaim deed from Alvie Miller to Anita Miller does not mention an easement or a building restriction line.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b64 Exception 11 in Miller\u2019s title insurance policy to Lots 7 and 8 is the \u201cbuilding restriction line across said Lot 7, as shown on the Plat of Redgate Vista on file in the office of the Clerk and Recorder of Lake County, Montana.\u201d Miller admitted that the closing documents made her aware of the building restriction line prior to purchasing Lot 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b65 In April 2008, Miller began constructing a garage located on both sides of the building restriction line. In May, the Conways filed their complaint, requesting in pertinent part that the court enjoin Miller from finishing construction of her garage and order her to remove the portion that violated the building restriction line. In November, the Conways filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that a reasonable interpretation of the plain language \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d on the plat led to the conclusion they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it was undisputed that the garage was located on both sides of the building restriction line.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b66 Miller filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and asserted that, although the Conways failed to frame their argument as enforcement of an easement, this is in fact what they sought from the court. Miller argued that because the Conways were strangers to the deed, an easement was not created because it failed to have express language of the grantor\u2019s intent to create an easement. Relying on <em>Blazer v. Wall, </em>2008 MT 145, 343 Mont. 173, 183 P.3d 84, Miller also asserted that the language \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d did not create an easement because it did not identify the dominant and servient tenement nor did it give the servient tenement knowledge of its use and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b67 The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Conways. Without addressing whether an easement was created, the court adopted the Conways\u2019 arguments and concluded that, \u201c[Miller] herself is charged with knowledge of the building restriction by virtue of the recorded plat and the special exception to the title policy obtained upon the purchase of her Lot 7.\u201d The court rejected Miller\u2019s argument regarding identification of the dominant and servient tenement because it was not supported by authority. The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>rejected her argument regarding the use and necessity of the building restriction line because it had \u201cno difficulty concluding from the face of the plat that the restriction is to prohibit buildings on that portion of Lot 7 west of [the building restriction] line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b68 On appeal, Miller reasserts her argument that the language \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d is not adequate to create an easement because it does not identify a dominant and servient tenement and does not give her knowledge of the use and necessity of the easement. She also claims that the Conways extinguished the easement when they built their privacy fence because the fence obstructs their view, and the Conways contend the purpose of the building restriction is to protect their view. Finally, Miller argues that removing her garage is an idle act prohibited by \u00a7 1-3-223, MCA, because the Conways\u2019 view would still be obstructed by her house even if her garage was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4h\">\u00b69 The Conways argue that <em>Blazer </em>is distinguishable and the language \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d clearly gives Miller notice that she cannot build on that portion of Lot 7 and that the District Court\u2019s ruling and order to remove the garage was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b610 We restate the issues on appeal as:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b611 Issue 1: Did the plat\u2019s depiction of the \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d create a negative easement?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b612 Issue 2: Did the Conways extinguish the negative easement by building a privacy fence?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b613 Issue 3: Did the District Court err in ordering removal of Miller\u2019s garage because it would be a waste of resources?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s denial of motions for summary judgment de novo. <em>Tacke v. Energy West, Inc., </em>2010 MT 39, \u00b6 16, 355 Mont. 243, 227 P.3d 601. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>JTL Group, Inc. v. New Outlook, LLP, </em>2010 MT 1, \u00b6 29, 355 Mont. 1, 223 P.3d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1: Did the plat\u2019s depiction of the \u2018building restriction line\u201d create a negative easement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">\u00b616 Miller\u2019s argument that the description on the plat was insufficient to create an easement is two-fold. First, she asserts that no easement was created because the language \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d does not clearly and unmistakably communicate the grantor\u2019s intent to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>an easement, according to our easement-by-reference rules set forth in <em>Blazer. </em>Second, she contends that the Conways are strangers to the deed and, as such, the easement-by-reference doctrine does not apply. Miller claims that because the deed did not have any language creating an easement, none was created.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">\n<em>A. The developer\u2019s intent to create a negative easement is clear and unmistakable.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b617 An easement by reservation must arise from the written documents of conveyance. <em>Halverson v. Turner, </em>268 Mont. 168, 172, 885 P.2d 1285, 1288 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">A \u201cnegative easement\u201d is one the effect of which is not to authorize the doing of an act by the person entitled to the easement, but merely to preclude the owner of the land subject to the easement from doing that which, if no easement existed, he would be entitled to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\"><em>Northwestern Improvement Co. v. Lowry, </em>104 Mont. 289, 301, 66 P.2d 792, 794 (1937). A grantor may expressly reserve an easement over granted land in favor of retained land by using appropriate language in the instrument of conveyance. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 27. An easement may be expressly reserved by referring in the instrument of conveyance to a recorded plat or certificate of survey on which the easement is adequately described. <em>Id. </em>When land is sold with reference to a properly recorded plat, the plat becomes part of the document conveying the interest in land. Section 76-3-304, MCA; <em>Benson v. Pyfer, </em>240 Mont. 175, 179, 783 P.2d 923, 925 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u00b618 None of the deeds at issue contain language creating a negative easement. The parties do not dispute this matter. The parties also do not dispute that the deeds expressly refer to a recorded plat. Thus, we look to the description on the plat rather than the language of the deed to determine if an easement was created and is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\u00b619 An easement created by reference in an instrument of conveyance to a plat is an express easement. The intent to create an easement must be clearly and unmistakably communicated on the referenced plat using labeling or other express language. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 43. For an easement to be created by reference to a plat, it must be adequately described by being clearly depicted and labeled on the plat. <em>Id. </em>An easement has not been adequately described \u201cwhen the identity of the dominant tenement has been omitted and cannot be ascertained from the documents of conveyance.\u201d <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 51. In other words, an easement is not adequately described if the identities of the dominant and servient tenements are not ascertainable with \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>certainty\u201d from the referenced plat or certificate of survey. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b620 An adequate description of an easement also gives the servient tenement knowledge of its use or necessity. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 36. For example, we held that the depiction and labels of a \u201cpublic utility easement\u201d and a \u201cprivate roadway easement\u201d on a certificate of survey was adequate to create an easement by reference. <em>Bache v. Owens, </em>267 Mont. 279, 286, 883 P.2d 817,822 (1994). And again in <em>Halverson, </em>we held that an easement labeled \u201c30-foot road easement\u201d between two tracts of land depicted on a certificate of survey was sufficient to create an easement by reference. <em>Halverson, </em>268 Mont. at 174, 885 P.2d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b621 On the other hand, an easement may not be inferred or implied from an unlabeled or inadequately described depiction appearing on a plat or certificate of survey. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 43. For example, in <em>Tungsten Holdings, Inc. v. Parker, </em>the plat depicted a narrow, meandering tract of land labeled \u201clot 34.\u201d <em>Tungsten Holdings, Inc. v. Parker, </em>282 Mont. 387, 388-89, 938 P.2d 641, 641-42 (1997). We reversed the district court\u2019s conclusion that a road easement was created, explaining that \u201ceasements by reservation must be created or reserved in writing.\u201d <em>Tungsten Holdings, </em>282 Mont. at 390, 938 P.2d at 643. Because nothing specifically identified lot 34 as a roadway, we held no easement was created. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b622 Finally, while a plat\u2019s or certificate of survey\u2019s description are strong considerations in determining the grantor\u2019s intent to create an easement, we must consider the entire instrument, including both the deed and the entire plat. \u201cThe modern conception of conveyancing, however, seeks to ascertain the intent of the grantor from a consideration of the entire instrument, without regard to the position of the several clauses ....\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Mix, </em>123 Mont. 365, 370, 214 P.2d 212, 215 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b623 While Miller admits she knew about the existence of the building restriction line before she bought Lot 7, she contends that the description is inadequate to create an easement because no dominant and servient tenement is identified nor can she decipher the use or necessity of the negative easement. She claims the language is too ambiguous to determine what type of building is restricted and the description fails to give the purpose of the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b624 Citing <em>Pearson v. Virginia City Ranches Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 12, 298 Mont. 52, 993 P.2d 688, the Conways respond that because the subdivision plat of Redgate Vista was incorporated into all of the deeds in Miller\u2019s and the Conways\u2019 chain of title, Miller is bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>building restriction line. According to the Conways, the right to enforce the negative easement created by the building restriction line belongs to all affected owners of lots in Redgate Vista.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b625 Miller\u2019s reliance on and interpretation of <em>Blazer </em>is misplaced. Nothing in <em>Blazer </em>stands for the proposition that the dominant and servient tenement must be expressly labeled as such for the easement to be adequately described. And while <em>Blazer </em>presents a thorough review of the easement-by-reference rules and pertinent case law, we cannot rely solely on <em>Blazer </em>for our analysis because it is factually distinguishable. Not only was a portion of the purported dominant tenement in <em>Blazer </em>not even included on the certificate of survey, the alleged road easement terminated off the certificate of survey. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 9. These facts weighed heavily in reaching the conclusion that neither the use or necessity of the easement could be determined nor could the dominant and servient tenements. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 53,57. Another important distinction between <em>Blazer </em>and the case at hand is that the parcels of land in <em>Blazer </em>were not in a platted subdivision. <em>See Blazer, </em>\u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b626 The process surrounding subdivisions is controlled by the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act. Section 76-3-304, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">The recording of any plat made in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall serve to establish the identity of all lands shown on and being a part of such plat. Where lands are conveyed by reference to a plat, the plat itself or any copy of the plat properly certified by the county clerk and recorder as being a true copy thereof shall be regarded as incorporated into the instrument of conveyance and shall be received in evidence in all courts of this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We determined this statute stood for the proposition: \u201c[W]here land is sold with reference to a map or plat showing a park or like open area, the purchaser acquires a private right, generally referred to as an easement, that such area shall be used in the manner designated.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>\u00b6 19. In addition, we said that \u201can easement arises when a purchaser\u2019s deed refers to a plat where an easement is depicted and labeled.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b627 Considering all of the instruments of conveyance, the easement-by-reference rules from <em>Blazer, </em>\u00a7 76-3-304, MCA, and <em>Pearson, </em>we determine that Red Gate, Inc. intended to create a negative easement restricting building on the western portion of Lot 7. We reach this conclusion after examining a number of factors. First, when Red Gate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Inc. platted the subdivision, not only did it draw and label the building restriction line on the plat of Redgate Vista, it referenced it in its deed to the Hylsops. While we agree that \u201csubject to\u201d does not create an easement by itself, see <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-29, we cannot ignore it as evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent to restrict building.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b628 Second, at the very least, the plat provided sufficient information to put Miller on inquiry notice. \u201cKnowledge of the existence of a claim will be imputed to a party who has sufficient information to put it on inquiry notice of that claim <em>.\u2019\u2019Halverson, </em>268 Mont. at 173, 885 P.2d at 1288. It was Miller\u2019s responsibility to conduct an official inquiry into the extent of the negative easement rather than simply ignore the building restriction line on the plat and proceed with construction, giving rise to litigation to determine the extent of the restriction after she had expended money and resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b629 Third, the description of the building restriction line was express enough to give Miller knowledge of the negative easement\u2019s use and necessity. The only interpretation of the plain language of \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d is that the servient tenement owner cannot construct any structure on the western portion of Lot 7. We reject Miller\u2019s argument that the plat must provide a purpose for the easement. The use-or \u201cnon-use\u201d in the case of a negative easement-is that building in that location is prohibited, whether to protect a view or to prevent building on a steep slope. If Red Gate, Inc. wanted to only restrict the building of two-story homes, six foot fences, or dog runs, it would have said as much on the plat. Nonetheless, from the label on the plat we conclude that Red Gate, Inc. intended to restrict any and all building in that area, for whatever reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b630 Finally, we can determine to a reasonable certainty the dominant and servient tenements of the Redgate Vista subdivision from the instruments of conveyance. All of the properties in question were sold with reference to a plat that included the building restriction line. According to our interpretation of \u00a7 76-3-304, MCA, in <em>Benson </em>and <em>Pearson, </em>the purchasers of the lots in the Redgate Vista subdivision acquired a private right to have Lot 7 used in the manner designated. Thus, the negative easement was created for the benefit of all of the lot owners. Moreover, we can see no logical reason that negative easements should be treated differently than improvements on the property, such as parks and open areas, if the purpose of the statute is to ensure that purchasers of the properties in the subdivision essentially get what they pay for. <em>See Benson, </em>240 Mont. at 179, 783 P.2d at 925-26 (interpreting \u00a7 76-3-304, MCA, to create an easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>for the benefit of purchasers of subdivision lots so they could recover for fraudulent misrepresentations made by sellers).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b631  In sum, the description \u201cbuilding restriction line\u201d on the plat of the Redgate Vista subdivision clearly created a negative easement in favor of the Conways that restricts any building on the western portion of Miller\u2019s Lot 7. The District Court did not err in concluding that Miller was prohibited from building in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>B. The Conways are not strangers to the deed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b632 Miller also argues that because the Conways are not parties in any conveyance to Miller or any conveyance in her chain of title, they are strangers to the deed. According to Miller, as strangers to the deed, the Conways failed to carry their burden to show the developer\u2019s intent to create an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b633 Strangers to the deed are those who are not parties to it. <em>Loomis v. Luraski, </em>2001 MT 223, \u00b6 29, 306 Mont. 478, 36 P.3d 862.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">A reservation of an interest in real property, to be good, must be made to all, some, or one of the grantors, and not to a stranger to the deed. The basis for this view is the ancient rule that words of reservation, (or exception), are not words of a grant and are ineffective to convey a right or interest to a stranger to a deed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">23 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Deeds </em>\u00a7 68 (2002). Although transactions involving a stranger to the deed are disfavored, where the intent of the grantor to reserve an interest in property to a stranger is clearly shown, we will give effect to the grantor\u2019s intent. <em>Loomis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\u00b634 When Red Gate, Inc. conveyed the lots at issue in 1973, it reserved the negative easement restricting building on Lot 7. Red Gate, Inc. conveyed its interest in Lot 7 to the other owners in the subdivision. At no point were any rights conveyed to an unrelated party. The Conways are not strangers to the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">\u00b635 Miller\u2019s last two issues-whether the Conways extinguished the easement by building a privacy fence and whether destruction of Miller\u2019s garage is a waste of resources-are based on the presumption that the purpose of the easement is to protect the Conways\u2019 view. Nothing in the record shows that the purpose of the easement is to protect the view. We will not address arguments that are not supported by the record. <em>Richards v. JTL </em>Group, <em>Inc., </em>2009 MT 173, \u00b6 38, 350 Mont. 516, 212 P.3d 264 (citing M. R. App. P. 12(1)). The District Court did not err when it ordered Miller\u2019s garage removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">\u00b636  The instruments of conveyance clearly and unmistakably show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Red Gate, Inc.\u2019s intent to create a negative easement that restricts building on the western portion of Miller\u2019s Lot 7 for the benefit of the lot owners of the Redgate Vista subdivision. The easement is enforceable by the Conways and the District Court did not err in ordering Miller\u2019s garage removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b260-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b638 I dissent. While the Court recites the correct standards for creating an easement under our easement-by-reference doctrine (see Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21), I believe the Court misapplies those standards in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b639 It is a fundamental tenet of property law that an intention to convey or create a particular interest in real property must be clearly expressed in writing (except where the interest arises by operation of law, which is not the case here). <em>Blazer v. Wall, </em>2008 MT 145, \u00b6 69, 343 Mont. 173, 183 P.3d 84; \u00a7 70-20-101, MCA. Typically, a seller of land grants or reserves an easement by the use of express words, such as \u201cThe Seller hereby reserves an easement 30 feet in width along the northern boundary of the Buyer\u2019s property for purposes of ingress to and egress from the Seller\u2019s retained property identified as follows ....\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-20-103, MCA. Our easement-by-reference doctrine, however, is premised on the notion that a seller may express her intent to grant or reserve an easement through the use of a depiction on a plat or certificate of survey referenced in the instrument of conveyance. We have emphasized, though, that the intent to create an easement burdening particular property for the benefit of another must be \u201cclearly and unmistakably communicated.\u201d <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>Broadwater Development, LLC v. Nelson, </em>2009 MT 317, \u00b6 27, 352 Mont. 401, 219 P.3d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b640 In this regard, even though it may appear from the referenced plat or certificate of survey that the seller intended to create some sort of easement, the critical issue is whether the seller actually accomplished that result under the law. In point of fact, a seller <em>must </em>comply with certain requirements for establishing an easement. Indeed, that was the primary point of our decisions in <em>Blazer </em>and <em>Tungsten Holdings, Inc. v. Parker, </em>282 Mont. 387, 938 P.2d 641 (1997). In <em>Blazer, </em>the certificate of survey depicted a strip labeled \u201c30' EASEMENT ROAD,\u201d which indicated an intent to create a 30-foot-wide easement road. The problem was that the use or necessity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>open-ended road and the intended dominant and servient tenements were not ascertainable with reasonable certainty from the certificate of survey. Accordingly, the depiction failed to create the purported easement. <em>See Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54, 57, 75. Likewise, in <em>Tungsten Holdings, </em>the plat depicted a meandering strip of land 40 feet wide and approximately 2,700 feet long, which was identified as \u201clot 34.\u201d This parcel resembled a roadway, and the district court found that there was \u201cno other conceivable purpose\u201d a parcel of this configuration could reasonably serve. The court also found that without a roadway in this location, a number of lots would be landlocked and inaccessible. Notably, the tax deed for lot 34 contained the notation \u201cROAD\u201d in the property description. Nevertheless, this Court, speaking through Justice Leaphart, held unanimously that the mere fact that a depiction on a plat may appear to be a roadway, or that the developers may have intended it to be a roadway, is simply <em>not </em>sufficient to establish the easement. The developers had to express this intent <em>in writing. Tungsten Holdings, </em>282 Mont. at 390, 938 P.2d at 642-43. Thus, in both cases, we held that whatever the sellers or developers may have intended, their depictions were inadequate to establish a valid and enforceable easement because the depictions did not adequately impart the requisite information for creating an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b641 To create an express easement, the documents of conveyance must identify the grantor and the grantee, adequately describe what is being conveyed, contain language of conveyance, and be signed. <em>Broadwater Development, </em>\u00b6 27. Focusing on the second of these requirements, a property description is a necessary inclusion in the instrument conveying title so that the extent of the claim to the property may be determined. <em>Halverson v. Turner, </em>268 Mont. 168, 172, 885 P.2d 1285, 1288 (1994). Consequently, an inadequate or defective property description is ineffective to create or transfer a property interest. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70-71. Under our easement-by-reference doctrine specifically, a property description is inadequate (and thus ineffective) if an individual examining the referenced plat or certificate of survey cannot ascertain, with reasonable certainty, (1) the identities of the dominant and servient tenements (i.e., what property the depicted easement benefits and what property it burdens), and (2) what the easement\u2019s use or its necessity is. <em>Broadwater Development, </em>\u00b6 38. We agreed unanimously in <em>Blazer </em>that these two requirements must be satisfied in order to create the easement. <em>See Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51,67 (opinion of the Court); <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 80 (dissenting opinion) (\u201cThe Court correctly determines that an easement-by-reference fails if it does not depict and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>identify both the dominant and servient tenements, as we have held repeatedly that \u2018it is necessary that the grantee of the property being burdened by the servitude have knowledge of its use or its necessity.\u2019 \u201d). Neither of these requirements is satisfied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b642 First, as to the identity of the dominant tenement, the Court relies on <em>Benson v. Pyfer, </em>240 Mont. 175, 783 P.2d 923 (1989), and <em>Pearson v. Virginia City Ranches </em>Assn., 2000 MT 12, 298 Mont. 52, 993 P.2d 688, for the proposition that the alleged building restriction on Lot 7 was \u201ccreated for the benefit of all of the lot owners.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 30. The issue in <em>Benson, </em>however, concerned the installation of water and sewer facilities and paved streets, and there was no dispute that these were intended for the benefit of all lots in the subdivision. Likewise, <em>Pearson </em>concerned a bridle path easement crossing the subdivision, and we had no difficulty in determining from the depiction on the plat that this easement was intended for the use of all lot owners. But the same clear intent is not shown on the Redgate Vista plat, which simply depicts a line across Lot 7 labeled \u201cBuilding restriction line\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\">[Publisher\u2019s Note: Please see plat on page 247]</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">There is no indication on the plat as to what property or properties this restriction was intended to benefit-perhaps one or more subdivision lots, or maybe a neighboring property outside the subdivision. Nevertheless, the Court opines that in drawing the line across Lot 7, the developer intended one thing, and one thing only: to create legally enforceable rights in all other lot owners within Redgate Vista subdivision. Opinion, \u00b6 30. However, if that is what was intended, I cannot agree that it is conveyed clearly and unmistakably on the plat. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b643 The Court suggests that we should treat the building restriction line no differently than improvements such as parks and open areas because the purpose of \u00a7 76-3-304, MCA, is \u201cto ensure that purchasers of the properties in the subdivision essentially get what they pay for.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 30. But this statement assumes the very issue we are deciding: Did the purchasers of Redgate Vista lots pay for an easement on Lot 7? Or, more to the point, did the developer intend to create legally enforceable rights in the subdivision lot owners concerning the use of Lot 7? In this regard, the Court\u2019s attempted analogy between the building restriction line and parks, open areas, and bridle path easements is unavailing. The intent to benefit all subdivision lot owners is reasonably clear where a park, an open area, or a bridle path easement is shown on a subdivision plat, but the same cannot be said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>of a single building restriction line drawn across one of the subdivision lots as in this case. For these reasons, I would hold that the identity of the dominant tenement is not ascertainable with reasonable certainty from the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b644 Turning to the identity of the servient tenement, we likewise lack necessary information. In particular, we do not know from the plat which side of the line the building restriction applies to. The line is labeled \u201cBuilding restriction line\u201d with an arrow pointing to the line, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The Court repeatedly assumes-without any analysis-that because the label \u201cBuilding restriction line\u201d is on the left (west) side of the line, the restriction must apply to that side of Lot 7. But the Court has no basis for making this assumption. In fact, the Court manufactures this rule from whole cloth. We have been provided with no evidence whatsoever that surveyors actually follow such a rule when drafting plats and certificates of survey. <em>Cf. Our Lady of the Rockies, Inc. v. Peterson, </em>2008 MT 110, \u00b6 32, 342 Mont. 393, 181 P.3d 631 (referring to the 1890 <em>Manual of Surveying Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands of the United States and Private Land Claims, </em>provided by the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in that case, for purposes of interpreting the survey at issue). We have been given no guidance at all (not even in the form of an amicus curiae brief from a trade group or association) regarding the rules, customs, or practices, if any, that surveyors follow with regard to the positioning of labels on plats and certificates of surveys and whether the location of a line\u2019s label determines where a legally enforceable burden exists. What we have done, therefore, oblivious to the potential inaccuracy of our conclusion and to the utter absence of any supporting authority, is announce a rule that when the word \u201crestriction\u201d appears on a particular side of a line on a plat or certificate of survey, with an arrow pointing to that line, the restriction necessarily and only applies on that side of the line. I have no idea whether that was the practice followed by surveyors in 1973 when the Redgate Vista plat was created, and I have no idea whether that is the practice followed by surveyors today. What I do know is that our decision sets a dangerous precedent that may result in the creation or invalidation of untold easements based on this Court\u2019s new interpretational rule for which, as noted, there is neither any cited authority nor any foundation in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b645 Furthermore, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that there was a practice among surveyors in 1973 regarding the placement of line labels, how would an individual looking at the Redgate Vista plat know that? The Court suggests that the plat put Miller on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d and that she therefore had the responsibility \u201cto conduct an official inquiry into the extent of the negative easement.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. Of course, it is axiomatic that a person need not inquire into the <em>extent </em>of an easement unless the easement is first determined to be <em>valid, </em>and an ambiguous or nebulous line drawn on a plat or certificate of survey does not constitute a valid easement. <em>See Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 57-67; <em>Tungsten Holdings, </em>282 Mont. at 390, 938 P.2d at 642-43. Moreover, it is not clear what the Court means by an \u201cofficial inquiry\u201d (as opposed to an \u201cunofficial\u201d one) and to whom the \u201cofficial inquiry\u201d would be directed. But, in any event, the only inquiry Miller was required by law to conduct (official or otherwise) was to examine the public records. Recall that the notice provisions of the recording statutes are designed to enable a prospective purchaser to determine what kind of title he or she is obtaining <em>without having to search beyond public records. Blazer, </em>\u00b6 73. Miller was not required to track down extrinsic evidence about the meaning of the line over Lot 7. <em>See Blazer, </em>\u00b6 71 (extrinsic evidence may not be admitted to complete a defective property description or to show the intention with which it was made). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>documents of conveyance must impart the necessary information themselves, not only to satisfy the statute of frauds (\u00a7 70-20-101, MCA), but also because \u201c[g]ood-faith purchasers of real property . . . are entitled to rely on publicly recorded deeds, plats, and certificates of survey pertaining to the subject property to disclose accurately all encumbrances, easements, and impediments thereon.\u201d <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6 74. Thus, the validity of the easement depends on the adequacy of the depiction on the Redgate Vista plat itself; Miller had to go no further. And examining that plat, nothing on it enables a purchaser of Lot 7 to ascertain with reasonable certainty which side of the lot the building restriction applies to. Thus, the intent to create the restriction was not accomplished according to the requirements of law, and the negative easement fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b646 In addition to the plat\u2019s failure to identify adequately the intended dominant and servient tenements, the use or necessity of the building restriction is also not ascertainable with reasonable certainty from the plat. Indeed, although the Court claims that \u201cBuilding restriction line\u201d has \u201conly [one] interpretation,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 29, the fact is that the term is patently ambiguous. In fact, the Court\u2019s own analysis reflects this. Initially, the Court interprets \u201cbuilding\u201d as a noun that prohibits the construction of any structures, but then the Court interprets \u201cbuilding\u201d as a verb that prohibits the activity of building anything, including homes, fences, and dog runs. Opinion, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b647 In point of fact, a person examining the Redgate Vista plat simply cannot know whether \u201cbuilding restriction\u201d is a prohibition on \u201cbuildings,\u201d a prohibition on the activity of \u201cbuilding,\u201d a restriction on height or type, or some other restriction. Perhaps a one-story structure is okay but a multi-story structure is not. What about a garage, or a shed, or a playhouse? Are things like fences, retaining walls, and wells permissible in the restricted area? What about landscaping? Can one install a jungle gym, or abrickbarbeque, or a sandbox, or underground utilities?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b648 There are countless plausible interpretations of the term \u201cbuilding restriction.\u201d Yet, in order to create a valid and enforceable negative easement, the law specifically requires the seller to express his intent clearly and unmistakably in the documents of conveyance, so that the purchaser of the servient property is given knowledge of the easement\u2019s use or its necessity and does not have to resort to her \u201ccommon sense,\u201d subjective judgment, or inferences as to what the seller intended. <em>Blazer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51, 54; <em>Halverson, </em>268 Mont. at 172, 885 P.2d at 1288; <em>Ruana v. Grigonis, </em>275 Mont. 441, 447, 913 P.2d 1247, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>1251 (1996). The reason for this requirement is obvious: The purchaser has a right to know-again, without having to rely on \u201ccommon sense\u201d or guesswork-the precise nature and extent of the burden imposed on her property. Here, the developer\u2019s intent regarding the use or necessity of the \u201cBuilding restriction line\u201d is not clearly and unmistakably expressed on the Redgate Vista plat-the Court\u2019s seemingly confident pronouncements about what the developer meant notwithstanding. Because the building restriction\u2019s use or necessity is not described adequately on the plat, the intent to create the restriction was not accomplished according to the requirements of law and the negative easement fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b649 In sum, the \u201cBuilding restriction line\u201d on the Redgate Vista plat is ambiguous. As with the depictions in <em>Blazer </em>and <em>Tungsten Holdings, </em>the intended use or necessity of the alleged easement and the intended dominant and servient tenements are not ascertainable with reasonable certainty. The Court\u2019s contrary conclusion rests on sheer conjecture about what the developers intended and an interpretational rule that lacks any authority or foundation in the record. Where the requirements of the law are not met, as is the case here, the purported easement fails. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b650 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-6\">JUSTICES COTTER and RICE join in the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
