We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AnE\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court improperly issue a declaratory judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b64 Judy Marchwick (Judy) executed her last will and testament, and an unfunded pour-over revocable living trust, on July 23,2004. Judy\u2019s trust expressed her intent to distribute a portion of her estate to her then husband, Ronald Burgess (Ronald). Judy\u2019s trust distributed the remainder of her estate as follows: sixty percent to Kim Marchwick (Marchwick), her daughter from a previous marriage, and the remaining forty percent divided equally among Judy\u2019s stepchildren, Greg, Gary, Amy, and Brandy Burgess (collectively Burgess children). Judy divorced Ronald on May 5, 2006. Judy died unexpectedly on February 17,2007, without having re-published her will since the July 23, 2004, version.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b65 Marchwick filed an application of informal probate of will and appointment of personal representative on April 27,2007. The District Court named Marchwick personal representative of Judy\u2019s estate. Marchwick filed a petition for a formal order acknowledging revocation of probate and non-probate transfers by divorce on June 13, 2008. Marchwick sought declaratory relief under \u00a7 27-8-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b66 Marchwick argued that \u00a7 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA, had revoked the Burgess children\u2019s interests as a matter of law when Ronald and Judy were divorced. The Burgess children filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for more definite statement on September 5, 2008. The court converted the proceeding to formal probate on October 25, 2008, and held a hearing on all pending matters on March 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b67 The District Court granted Marchwick\u2019s petition on August 5, 2009. The court declared Marchwick the sole lineal descendant of Judy. The court named Marchwick the sole devisee under the trust. The court further granted the Burgess children\u2019s motion to direct entry of judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) from which the Burgess children appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">\u00b68 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation of law pertaining to a declaratory judgment ruling. <em>Roe v. City of Missoula, </em>2009 MT 417, \u00b6 15, 354 Mont. 1, 221 P.3d 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court improperly issue a declaratory judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u00b610 The Burgess children argue that the District Court violated their due process rights by issuing its declaratory judgment. The Burgess children contend the court issued a \u201csummary judgment in the form of a declaratory judgment, even though no civil action had been commenced by the filing of a complaint.\u201d The District Court determined that it had authority to issue a declaratory judgment \u201cas requested by Marchwick pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-204(3), MCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b611  Section 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA, of the Uniform Probate Code voids any revocable disposition, or appointment, created by law, or in a governing instrument, \u201cto a relative of the divorced individual\u2019s former spouse.\u201d The Burgess children are the biological children of Ronald. Ronald is \u201cthe divorced individual\u2019s\u201d-Judy\u2019s-\u201cformer spouse.\u201d Section 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA, automatically revokes appointments, such as Judy\u2019s pour-over living trust, that had named the Burgess children as devisees in light of Ronald\u2019s and Judy\u2019s divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b612 The Burgess children nevertheless argue that the court should have dismissed Marchwick\u2019s petition. The Burgess children contend that the court should have required Marchwick to file a pleading and properly serve the Burgess children as parties. The Burgess children suggest that this filing and proper service would have allowed them to conduct discovery under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. As the District Court pointed out, however, requiring Marchwick to re-file \u201cwould not provide the Burgesses with any opportunity not already presented to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b613  We must determine whether \u00a7 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA, operated-as a matter of law-to revoke that portion of Judy\u2019s pour-over trust that had granted a forty percent distribution to the Burgess children. No further process afforded to the Burgess children by the District Court would have changed the fact that \u00a7 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA, revoked the interests of the Burgess children as a matter of law. Ronald\u2019s and Judy\u2019s divorce triggered application of \u00a7 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA. The District Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
