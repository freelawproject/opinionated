We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-26\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>denying Hornstein\u2019s motion for credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b63 On September 26,2008, at the Southgate Mall in Missoula, a mall employee recognized Hornstein as a previous shoplifter and notified mall security. A security officer responded to the call and found Hornstein in the parking lot, but as the officer approached, Hornstein fled and a chase ensued. The officer and the Missoula City Police eventually apprehended Hornstein, who had four baseball caps on his person, three of which still had store pricing tags.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b64 Police arrested Hornstein and impounded his vehicle, which was parked in the mall parking lot. After discovering Hornstein was on parole for a previous crime of aggravated assault, the police contacted his parole officer, who authorized a search of Hornstein\u2019s vehicle. This led to the seizure of additional items previously reported stolen from the mall and two syringes which tested positive for methamphetamine. \u00b65 The State filed four charges against Hornstein: Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA, and two counts of Theft, both misdemeanors in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA. Hornstein initially pled not guilty to these charges, and the District Court set bail in the amount of $50,000. Hornstein was unable to post bail and therefore remained at the Missoula County Detention Facility (County Jail) after his arrest on September 26, 2008. On September 28, 2008, Hornstein\u2019s parole officer reported that Hornstein had violated his parole and recommended that further action be taken with regard to his parole status.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b66 However, Hornstein was not returned to the Montana State Prison (State Prison) to face parole-related proceedings, but instead was kept at the County Jail under the $50,000 bail to face his new charges. On May 7, 2009, Hornstein pled guilty to the new charges pursuant to a plea agreement. The District Court sentenced Hornstein to three years with the Department of Corrections for the Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs and six months for each of the three misdemeanor counts to be served in the County Jail. The court ordered the four sentences to run concurrently with each other, but consecutively with Hornstein\u2019s previous sentence for aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>assault. The court did not grant Hornstein credit for the 224 days<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he had served in the County Jail while his new charges were pending, reasoning that the Board of Pardons and Parole (Parole Board) would instead apply a credit against his underlying offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b67 On May 13, 2009, Hornstein was transported to the State Prison. By letter of June 28,2009, Hornstein asked the District Court to credit the 224 days he had served in the County Jail to his new sentences: \u201c[E]ven though you ordered the [new] sentence to run consecutive to the previous cause, I must still be given credit for time served in county jail on the new charge ....\u201d Before the District Court could respond to Hornstein\u2019s request, the Parole Board, on June 30, 2009, revoked Hornstein\u2019s parole and ordered that no \u201cdead time\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would be charged, meaning that the entire time that Hornstein had been out of prison on parole, including the time spent in the County Jail, would be counted toward his initial aggravated assault sentence. On August 12, 2009, the District Court denied Hornstein\u2019s motion for credit for time served in the County Jail toward his new sentence, reasoning that because the Parole Board had already credited the 224 days toward the aggravated assault sentence, Hornstein \u201cis not entitled to credit against both sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b68 Hornstein appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b69 We review sentences beyond one year of incarceration for legality only. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 174, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815 (citation omitted); <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978 (citations omitted). We review \u201cwhether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 174 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Hornstein\u2019s motion for credit for time served?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b611 Hornstein argues that the District Court erred by refusing to apply credit for time served in the County Jail to his second, or new sentence. The State argues that because the Parole Board essentially credited that same time to Hornstein\u2019s first sentence by not assessing any \u201cdead time,\u201d and because Hornstein\u2019s new sentence was ordered to run consecutively to his first sentence, he is not entitled to a \u201cdouble credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b612  Pre-conviction jail time credit toward a sentence granted by statute is a \u201cmatter of right.\u201d <em>Murphy v. State, </em>181 Mont. 157, 160-61, 592 P.2d 935, 937 (1979) (citations omitted). Whether a district court properly credits time served is not a discretionary act, but a legal mandate. <em>State v. Hoots, </em>2005 MT 346, \u00b6 31, 330 Mont. 144, 127 P.3d 369 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b613 Section 46-18-403(1), MCA (2007), provides: \u201cA person incarcerated on a bailable offense against whom a judgment of imprisonment is rendered must be allowed credit for each day of incarceration prior to or after conviction, except that the time allowed as a credit may not exceed the term of the prison sentence rendered.\u201d We have explained that the underlying purpose of \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">to eliminate the disparity of treatment between indigent and nonindigent defendants. In other words, credit for time served is given so as not to penalize indigent defendants who are unable to post bail and must remain in custody until they are sentenced when nonindigent defendants may secure their release and remain free during that time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-9\"><em>State v. Kime, </em>2002 MT 38, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 341, 43 P.3d 290, <em>overruled on other grounds by Herman, </em>\u00b6 12 and n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">\u00b614 Hornstein\u2019s argument relies largely upon our analysis in <em>Kime, </em>which addressed the allocation of time to sentences arising from separate proceedings. <em>See Kime, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. David Kime (Kime) was serving a prison sentence for felony assault but had been released from the State Prison to participate in a supervised release program. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 3. On November 26, 2000, police arrested and jailed Kime for suspected theft and DUI offenses. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 3. The next day bail of $25,000 for the new charges was set. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 3. On December 5, 2000, Kime was transferred from the jail to the State Prison. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 4. Charges for the new offenses were filed on December 12, 2000. <em>Kime, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u00b6 5. Kime eventually pled guilty to the new charges and was sentenced on April 2,2001. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 5. Kime requested that the time between his arrest and his sentencing, about 127 days, be credited toward his new charges, but the District Court refused, crediting only the few days between his arrest and his transfer to the State Prison. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 5. We affirmed, reasoning that \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, mandated credit to the new sentence only if the \u201cdefendant [was] [] incarcerated on a bailable offense for which he or she receive[d] a sentence of imprisonment\u201d and the incarceration prior to sentencing was <em>\u201cdirectly related </em>to the offense for which the sentence [was] imposed.\u201d <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 16 (emphasis added). We concluded that most of the 127 days Kime claimed were \u201crelated to his prior felony conviction and not the charges of which he was convicted in the [new] case.\u201d <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 16. Here, Hornstein argues that his incarceration in the County Jail was directly related to his new charges and he is thus entitled to credit under <em>Kime\u2019s </em>reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b615 The State does not address Kime, but instead directs our attention to <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 150, 310 Mont. 320, 50 P.3d 530. Richard Lee Price (Price) was charged with one felony and four misdemeanors. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 1. While awaiting trial, Price spent eighteen days in jail. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 1. He was ultimately sentenced to twelve months with the Department of Corrections for the felony and twelve days in jail for the misdemeanors, with all sentences to run consecutively. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 22. To account for Price\u2019s eighteen days of service, the District Court credited twelve days against his misdemeanor sentences and the remaining six days against the felony sentence. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 22. Price appealed, arguing that he was entitled to eighteen days of credit toward <em>each </em>of the three charges against him. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 23. We affirmed the District Court, holding that \u201c\u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, entitles defendants to credit for presentence incarceration only once against the aggregate of all terms imposed when multiple sentences are imposed consecutively.\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b616 While <em>Price </em>remains instructive regarding credit to be granted when multiple sentences to be served consecutively are imposed, the issue before us does not involve the judicial imposition of such sentences. The District Court denied Hornstein credit for his jail time in consideration of the Parole Board\u2019s determination to not count Hornstein\u2019s time on parole as \u201cdead time,\u201d thus allowing that time to be credited to his first sentence. However, the Parole Board is an administrative agency and its determination about \u201cdead time\u201d on parole is an administrative matter within its broad discretion. Admin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>R. M. 20.25.202(3). Its discretionary actions with regard to parole time do not preempt the statutory requirement that credit be granted for time served which is \u201cdirectly related\u201d to a newly imposed sentence-whether to be served consecutively or concurrently with the previous sentence. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b617  Hornstein was arrested and jailed on the new charges on September 26, 2008. A probation violation report was made, but Hornstein was left in the County Jail to await resolution of his new charges. Bail was ordered, but because Hornstein was unable to pay, he remained incarcerated on his new charges for 224 days. Hornstein would not have been incarcerated in County Jail for this period but for the new charges, making that time \u201cdirectly related\u201d to those charges. Thus, under Nime, Hornstein was entitled to a 224-day credit against his new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b618 We are aware that Hornstein may, as a practical matter, receive a \u201cdouble credit\u201d toward his sentences for the time at issue here. However, that is ultimately a consequence of the Parole Board\u2019s discretionary determination about Hornstein\u2019s parole time. Regarding his jail time, the law required credit to be given for the time he served.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00b619 We reverse and remand for the entry of an amended judgment consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> The 224-day period spans the time served from Hornstein\u2019s arrest on September 26,2008, to his sentencing on May 7, 2009. The days after the May 7, 2009 sentencing are counted as time served pursuant to his imposed sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\"> \u201cDead time\u201d is \u201cthe time from the issuance of a parole violation warrant to the date a violator is arrested on that warrant, or the time a parole violator serves in a correctional facility for a separate felony offense committed on parole.\u201d Admin. R. M. 20.25.202(3). \u201cThe [Parole Board] has sole discretion to determine whether this time will be counted as time served under the term.\u201d Admin. R. M. 20.25.202(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> At the time of sentencing, the Parole Board had not yet determined how to treat Hornstein\u2019s parole time. The sentencing court\u2019s denial of the statutory credit for time served thus allowed the possibility, had the Parole Board discretionarily decided not to count the parole time, of the denial of any credit for the time Hornstein served.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
