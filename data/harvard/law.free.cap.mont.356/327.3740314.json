We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated L.M.\u2019s parental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b64 <em>Did L.M. receive effective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">\u00b65 The District Court terminated L.M.\u2019s parental rights to B.M. and P.M. on October 26, 2009. The children\u2019s mother, D.M., did not live with the children and already had voluntarily relinquished her parental rights. The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division (Department), removed B.M. and P.M. from L.M.\u2019s care on November 27, 2007, following a psychotic episode by L.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u00b66 L.M. called the Missoula Police Department on November 27, 2007. L.M. sought help due to a fear that people were following him and a concern that he had been \u201cimagining things.\u201d Jim Silva (Silva), social worker and investigator for Child Protection Services, responded to the call. Silva learned that L.M.\u2019s children were on their way home from school with their grandmother, N.S. Silva contacted N.S. to advise her to keep the children away from L.M.\u2019s house while law enforcement responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">\u00b67 Silva went to L.M.\u2019s house to conduct an interview. Silva found L.M. outside yelling and screaming. L.M. approached Silva. L.M. lifted up his shirt to show Silva that he was not wired or carrying a weapon. L.M. told Silva that \u201cthey\u201d were out to get him, that he was a targeted man, and that \u201cthey\u201d were going to execute him. L.M. appeared agitated, anxious, and paranoid during the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\u00b68 Officer Ben Woods of the Missoula Police Department responded to Silva\u2019s request for assistance. L.M. appeared frightened when Officer Woods contacted him. L.M. refused to leave his house and he expressed fear of the outside world. L.M. admitted to Officer Woods that he had not slept for the previous four days during which time he had been using methamphetamine. Both B.M. and P.M. were inside L.M.\u2019s house at this time. L.M. refused to take his children to school that morning due to his concern that the federal government and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>McDonald\u2019s corporation were involved in a conspiracy against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b69 Officer Woods described the interior of L.M.\u2019s house as in \u201cdisarray.\u201d Officer Woods discovered a large revolver on the living room table. Officer Woods spoke with B.M. and P.M. The children confirmed that L.M. would not take them to school due to his conspiracy fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b610 The State removed B.M. and P.M. from L.M.\u2019s care. L.M. voluntarily committed himself to the hospital for a psychological evaluation. L.M. tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana. The hospital discharged L.M. the same day. Officer Woods drove by L.M.\u2019s house later that day and saw that L.M. had painted \u201cit\u2019s not such a happy meal now\u201d on the front of his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b611 The Department eventually filed a petition seeking emergency protective services, adjudication of B.M. and P.M. as youths in need of care, and temporary legal custody. The court granted temporary legal custody to the Department and adjudicated B.M. and P.M. as youths in need of care. The District Court determined that L.M.\u2019s \u201cdrug abuse and apparent mental instability\u201d would place the children at an unreasonable risk of harm. L.M. stipulated to the Department\u2019s temporary legal custody of B.M. and P.M. for six months pending his completion of the State\u2019s proposed treatment plan. The Department eventually filed a petition for termination of L.M.\u2019s parental rights on April 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b612 The District Court held a termination hearing over two days in August and September 2009. The State presented testimony of social worker and child protection specialist Meredith Mehne (Mehne) and a report on L.M. prepared by the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA). Both Mehne\u2019s testimony and the CASA report recommended termination of L.M.\u2019s parental rights based on his failure to comply with his treatment plan. Mehne testified that L.M. had not attempted to perform the tasks in his treatment plan until after the Department filed the termination petition. L.M. admitted that he had failed to comply fully with the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b613 The District Court determined that L.M. had failed to meet the conditions of his treatment plan. L.M.\u2019s conduct and condition rendered him unfit to provide adequate parental care to his children and that this condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The District Court concluded that clear and convincing evidence supported termination of L.M.\u2019s parental rights. L.M. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b614 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights. <em>In re J.A.S., </em>2010 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 355 Mont. 302, 228 P.3d 1119. We determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re </em>2010 MT 4, \u00b6 14, 355 Mont. 23, 223 P.3d 921. This Court exercises plenary review of whether a parent was denied effective assistance of counsel. <em>In re </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated L.M.\u2019s parental </em>rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b616 Neither party disputes that the District Court properly adjudicated B.M. and P.M. as youths in need of care. L.M. admitted that he had not complied fully with his treatment plan. L.M. admitted that his house was \u201cnot suitable for children\u201d because of his remodeling work. L.M. further admitted that he had not completed a chemical dependency course. L.M. tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana \u201cmany\u201d times during his required urinalysis tests. L.M. failed to complete his psychological evaluation. L.M. never communicated with his children\u2019s therapists. Whether L.M.\u2019s conduct or condition rendering him unfit was likely to change within a reasonable time presents the only remaining issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u00b617 L.M. first argues that the District Court improperly adopted \u201cnearly verbatim\u201d the State\u2019s proposed findings of fact. A review of the termination hearing transcript reveals, however, that the District Court properly considered all the facts and testimony before it. <em>In re A.R., </em>2005 MT 23, \u00b6 29, 326 Mont. 7, 107 P.3d 457. The court exercised its independent judgment in terminating L.M.\u2019s parental rights. <em>In re </em>A.R., \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\u00b618 In determining whether the conduct or condition of the parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the district court must enter a finding that continuation of the relationship likely will result in continued abuse or neglect or that the parent is unfit to give the children adequate care. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. The court must give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the children. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">\u00b619 Section 41-3-604(1), MCA, provides that the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights if a child has been \u201cunder the physical custody of the state\u201d for 15 months of the most recent 22 months. L.M. argues that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>presumption should not apply because B.M. and P.M. were in the \u201cphysical custody\u201d of N.S., their grandmother, rather than of the State. L.M. neglects to mention that B.M. and P.M. lived with N.S. pursuant to a foster care agreement with the Department. N.S. cared for the children under a \u201cfoster care program,\u201d where \u201cthe ultimate decision is the State\u2019s.\u201d N.S. received $1,000 a month under the foster care agreement to support the children. B.M. and P.M. had been \u201cin foster care under the physical custody of the state for 15 months of the most recent 22 months.\u201d Section 41-3-604(1), MCA. The District Court correctly relied upon the statutory presumption that the best interests of B.M. and P.M. would be served by termination of L.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b620  The District Court further entered findings that continuation of the relationship likely would have resulted in continued abuse or neglect and that L.M. was unfit to give the children adequate care. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. L.M. admitted that his house had been unlivable for the children and that he was not financially stable. N.S., L.M.\u2019s own mother, similarly did not believe L.M. would be able to care for the children anytime soon \u201cbecause he has a lot of mending to do.\u201d The court\u2019s determination that L.M.\u2019s conduct was not likely to change required \u201ca predictive assessment based upon past and present conduct of the parent.\u201d <em>In re C.M.C., </em>2009 MT 153, \u00b6 25, 350 Mont. 391, 208 P.3d 809. Clear and convincing evidence supported the District Court\u2019s assessment. <em>In re A.R., </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b621 <em>Did L.M. receive effective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b622  L.M. argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to advocate for appropriate alternatives to termination rises to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. This Court reviews a trial counsel\u2019s 1) training and experience, and 2) advocacy skills, in determining whether assistance was ineffective. <em>In re A.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 26, 320 Mont. 268, 87 P.3d 408. Only if the parent suffered prejudice, however, will this Court determine that trial counsel\u2019s ineffective performance warrants reversal. <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6 31. Nothing in the record reveals that L.M.\u2019s counsel lacked adequate training and experience to represent L.M. or that his counsel\u2019s advocacy skills were ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b623  The District Court had to decide whether to grant the Department\u2019s petition for termination of L.M.\u2019s parental rights. L.M.\u2019s trial counsel argued against granting the petition. The question of alternatives to termination would have arisen only if the court had decided to deny the Department\u2019s petition to terminate. <em>In re C.M.C., </em>\u00b6 35. L.M. has not made any showing that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>argue for an alternative to termination materially prejudiced him, or that this failure would have affected whether the court decided to grant the petition to terminate. <em>In re C.M.C., </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
