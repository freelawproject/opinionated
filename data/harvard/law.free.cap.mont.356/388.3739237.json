We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-25\">\u00b62 Mary Jo is a disabled resident of Butte, Montana. She currently lives solely off Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits that total $691.00 per month plus Supplemental Security Income (SSI) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>benefits that total $4.00 per month. In June 2008, when the events at issue here occurred, Mary Jo was living off SSDI benefits totaling $653.00 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b63 On June 6, 2008, Mary Jo received a rebate under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 in the form of a $300.00 electronic deposit to her personal checking account with U.S. Bank. At this time, Bank of America held a default judgment against Mary Jo (obtained two years earlier in a collection action) in the amount of $3,036.95. On June 9, 2008, Bank of America executed upon and seized all of the funds in Mary Jo\u2019s checking account which, after the deduction of a $75.00 execution fee, consisted of $454.38. That same day, three previously written checks and a Visa CheckCard purchase were posted to Mary Jo\u2019s account, resulting in four $35.00 overdraft charges. Mary Jo became aware of the execution the following day (June 10) through a coincidental online balance inquiry and a call to the bank. She thereafter was served with a Notice of Execution Levy dated June 26, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b64 Mary Jo objected to the seizure of her funds and requested a hearing in Silver Bow County Justice Court (where the original default judgment had been entered). Bank of America ultimately acknowledged that her social security benefits were exempt from execution pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(b), MCA, and it therefore agreed to return $154.38 to Mary Jo. That left in dispute her $300.00 economic stimulus rebate and the $75.00 execution fee. Mary Jo argued that the $75.00 fee came out of her social security benefits and, thus, should be returned with the other $154.38. As for the $300.00 rebate, Mary Jo argued that a \u201chousehold bank account\u201d is a \u201chousehold good\u201d under \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA, and, as such, is exempt from execution up to $600.00. (Under this theory, the entire $529.38 in her account at the moment of execution would be exempt.) In addition, she argued that the Notice of Execution Levy was untimely and that executing on her economic stimulus money violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. The Justice Court disagreed with all three arguments and denied her claim for exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b65 Mary Jo then appealed to the District Court, raising the same three grounds. That court concluded as follows: Mary Jo\u2019s checking account is not a household good exempt from execution under \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA; while the Notice of Execution Levy was untimely under \u00a7 25-13-211(1), MCA, Mary Jo had not been prejudiced as a result; and Mary Jo had not established how Montana\u2019s execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>statute thwarts the purpose and objectives of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b66 Mary Jo now appeals to this Court, raising the single issue of whether a personal checking account used to pay household expenses is a \u201chousehold good\u201d protected up to $600.00 by \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA. This statute states that a judgment debtor is entitled to exemption from execution of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">the judgment debtor\u2019s interest, not to exceed $4,500 in aggregate value, to the extent of a value not exceeding $600 in any item of property, in <em>household </em>furnishings andgoods, appliances, jewelry, wearing apparel, books, firearms and other sporting goods, animals, feed, crops, and musical instruments. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU7\">As noted, the District Court disagreed with the proposition that a personal checking account is a \u201chousehold good.\u201d The court reasoned that while the statute lists many specific items, it does not list accounts or moneys. Conversely, the statute listing what property is subject to execution includes \u201cmoneys.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-13-501, MCA (\u201cAll goods, chattels, <em>moneys, </em>and other property, both real and personal, or any interest therein of the judgment debtor, not exempt by law, and all property and rights of property seized and held under attachment in the action are liable to execution. . . .\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b67 Of course, Mary Jo points out that \u00a7 25-13-501, MCA, refers to \u201cmoneys . . . not exempt by law,\u201d which thus brings us back to the exemption statutes and the question of whether \u201cmoneys\u201d held in a personal checking account are exempt from execution as a \u201chousehold good\u201d under \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA. Mary Jo offers a number of reasons why she believes her checking account-which she says contains the funds she uses to purchase household furnishings and goods, appliances, wearing apparel, and books-should itself be considered a \u201chousehold good.\u201d However, we are not persuaded by her arguments that the Legislature intended with the language \u201chousehold furnishings and goods, appliances, jewelry, wearing apparel, books, firearms and other sporting goods, animals, feed, crops, and musical instruments\u201d to include-by implication-the personal checking account containing the moneys with which such items might be purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b68 Mary Jo notes a number of policy considerations for why her checking account should be exempt from execution. She contends that as a result of Bank of America\u2019s actions here, she was left destitute, exposed to overdraft charges and mounting debt, and having to borrow money from acquaintances just to buy food. She points out that the exemption laws were enacted to preclude this sort of result; that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>laws were intended to shield the poor, <em>Ferguson v. Speith, </em>13 Mont. 487, 496, 34 P. 1020, 1022-23 (1893), and to prevent the debtor and his or her dependents from becoming public charges, <em>Hitt v. Glass, </em>164 B.R. 759, 764 (Bankr. App. 9th Cir. 1994); and that courts are .therefore to construe exemption statutes liberally, <em>In re Archer, </em>2006 MT 82, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 1, 136 P.3d 563. Mary Jo argues that a low-income debtor such as herself should have the funds which are used for household purchases protected from seizure up to $600.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b69 In response, Bank of America curtly dismisses these arguments as \u201cinapposite, especially in the context of a one-time economic stimulus payment.\u201d Bank of America brazenly characterizes Mary Jo\u2019s $300.00 economic stimulus payment as a \u201cwindfall\u201d and suggests that the seizure of this money did not harm her or leave her destitute because \u201cit is not part of her social security benefits nor is it regularly relied-upon income.\u201d These contemptuous remarks, however, are utterly unavailing in light of the fact that Bank of America abruptly seized <em>every last cent </em>in Mary Jo\u2019s account, including exempt social security benefits (which were not returned until after a hearing in Justice Court roughly eight weeks later), thus leaving her with a <em>negative </em>balance once the three previously written checks, the CheckCard purchase, and the four overdraft charges were posted to her account. They also suggest total indifference to Mary Jo\u2019s predicament following the seizure. In this regard, Mary Jo points out that as a result of its own dire predicament in 2008 (the same year it seized her $300.00 economic stimulus rebate), Bank of America received billions of dollars in bailout money from the federal government. But more to the point, Bank of America evidently fails to appreciate that exemption laws were indeed designed to shield the poor, not to strip them. <em>Ferguson, </em>13 Mont. at 496, 34 P. at 1022-23.</p>\n<p id=\"Aih\">\u00b610  The fundamental problem with Mary Jo\u2019s position is not that it necessarily lacks merit or is \u201cinapposite,\u201d but that it is being made to the wrong branch of government. While exemption statutes are to be construed liberally, such construction may not disregard plain legislative mandate. <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 15. Here, \u201chousehold checking account\u201d is not contained in the list in \u00a7 25-13-609(1), MCA, and we are not persuaded that the Legislature intended the term \u201cgoods\u201d to encompass \u201cmoneys\u201d that are contained in a \u201chousehold checking account.\u201d Thus, Mary Jo\u2019s policy arguments need to be made to the Legislature, since it is not this Court\u2019s prerogative to rewrite the statute in the manner she proposes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Asn\">\u00b611 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-4\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
