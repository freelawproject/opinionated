We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\u00b62 We state the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the Youth Court err by committing K.M.G. to the Department of Corrections for placement at Pine Hills pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513, MCA (2007)?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the Youth Court err by failing to specify how long K.M.G. could be placed at Pine Hills?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the Youth Court err by finding that K.M.G. admitted to failing to attend school in violation of his probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">\u00b66 Appellant K.M.G. is a fourteen-year-old boy currently placed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Pine Hills for committing a string of misdemeanor crimes, including assault, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and two counts of theft. K.M.G. also admitted to violations of probation previously imposed by the Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b67 On January 8, 2008, 12-year-old K.M.G. approached a fellow student at Meadow Hill School from behind and punched him in the back. The victim suffered discomfort and redness in his middle spine area and could not walk for some time without pain. When the responding officer called KM.G.\u2019s mother to set up a meeting regarding the assault, she yelled at the officer and eventually hung up on him. When the principal called K.M.G. into his office, K.M.G. was rude and refused to sit down as requested. KM.G.\u2019s mother displayed similar verbally-assaultive behavior to the principal as K.M.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b68 On January 21,2008, KM.G.\u2019s mother contacted law enforcement to report that K.M.G. had called her demeaning names and had left the residence without her permission, a problem she described as ongoing. On January 28, 2008, security officers caught K.M.G. stealing two laser pointers from a store in Southgate Mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b69 Citing these incidents, the State filed a Petition to declare K.M.G. a Delinquent Youth. Before the Petition was served, K.M.G. committed additional crimes. The State subsequently amended the petition to allege another assault, sexual intercourse without consent, misdemeanor sexual assault, criminal mischief, and disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b610 On April 9, 2008, K.M.G. admitted to the theft and assault charges alleged in the original petition. On July 16, 2008, K.M.G. admitted to the disorderly conduct charge as part of a deferred prosecution agreement under which the State agreed to dismiss, without prejudice, the remaining counts of the amended petition, which were then dismissed by the Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b611 The Youth Court held a dispositional hearing on November 12, 2008. The court assumed jurisdiction over K.M.G. until his eighteenth birthday, and ordered out-of-home placement for K.M.G. at the Dennis Radtke Home for Boys (Radtke Home) for treatment, followed by six months of formal probation. The court imposed probation conditions, including that K.M.G. obey all laws, attend school regularly, reside at the Radtke Home and keep the Home advised of his whereabouts at all times. After K.M.G. was taken to the Radtke Home, he immediately ran from the home without permission, violating his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b612 The next day, November 18, 2008, law enforcement responded to a report of a shoplifting in progress at a Shopko store. K.M.G. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>another individual had been temporarily detained by Shopko store security for theft of a backpack, but had fled. Law enforcement officers located the juveniles behind a shed, and detained them. Missoula Police Officer Erbacher instructed K.M.G. to sit on the ground while he gathered information. He learned that K.M.G. had run from the group home, and that the Youth Court had ordered that K.M.G. be detained. Officer Erbacher became concerned with KM.G.\u2019s behavior, believing that K.M.G. intended to run. Officer Erbacher instructed K.M.G. to stand up and place his hands behind his back. K.M.G. did so, but when Officer Erbacher attempted to grab his wrist, K.M.G. bolted and attempted to escape by running down an alley. Officer Erbacher stopped K.M.G., but K.M.G. resisted and caused injury to Officer Erbacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b613 In response to this criminal activity, the State filed a second petition to declare K.M.G. a Delinquent Youth. The Youth Court set a bond for detaining K.M.G., which KM.G.\u2019s mother posted. The release conditions required K.M.G. to abide by the previously imposed conditions, which he failed to do. Between his release on December 1, 2008, and December 11, 2008, K.M.G. failed to attend school, was allowed to remain unsupervised at home for several days, and tested positive for prescription narcotic benzodiazepines after a mandatory probationary urinalysis. School officials observed minor injuries on K.M.G., which they surmised were caused from a fight. The State also filed a petition to revoke K.M.G.\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b614 On January 9, 2009, K.M.G. admitted the second theft and resisting arrest charges and admitted leaving the Radtke Home without permission in violation of his probation. The Youth Court entered KM.G.\u2019s admissions, and scheduled a dispositional hearing. In the interim, K.M.G. continued to violate his probationary conditions. Instead of residing with his aunt in Helena, as ordered by the Youth Court, K.M.G. returned to his mother\u2019s home in Missoula. KM.G.\u2019s juvenile probation officer learned of his whereabouts when KM.G.\u2019s mother called three days before the disposition hearing to advise that K.M.G. was \u201cout in the alley ... intoxicated.\u201d The next day, after the juvenile probation officer told K.M.G. that he must remain with his mother at all times until the court hearing, K.M.G. told his mother he \u201cdidn\u2019t like those rules,\u201d and left home.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b615 K.M.G. was subsequently evaluated by Eileen C. Robbins, an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse with the Western Montana Mental Health Center, Child and Family Service Network. Robbins recommended that K.M.G. \u201cattend treatment at a facility where he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>receive long-term intensive treatment ....\u201d However, due to funding limitations, it became clear that out-of-home community placement for K.M.G. was not an option, and that he would either be placed at Pine Hills or returned to his mother\u2019s home. In light of this development, Robbins filed an addendum to her report, stating \u201c[if] treatment could be provided to [K.M.G.] while at Pine Hills Correctional Facility, that would be an option which could be helpful to [K.M.G.], certainly more helpful than returning him to his mother\u2019s home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b616 On April 8,2009, the Youth Court held a dispositional hearing on KM.G.\u2019s probation violations and the new theft and resisting arrest charges. The State recommended the Youth Court commit K.M.G. to the Department of Corrections for placement at Pine Hills. Defense counsel recommended that the court place K.M.G. on probation, and return him to his mother\u2019s care on the condition that he \u201ccomplete counseling with Eileen Robbins.\u201d Defense counsel stated that he understood Robbins\u2019s recommendation was to \u201csend [K.M.G.] straight to Pine Hills\u201d but, noting Robbins\u2019s willingness to treat K.M.G. if he was in Missoula, argued for probation, given that K.M.G. \u201cwould be under the understanding that if he is given probation, he is on a no-tolerance release. Any violation is going to send him to Pine Hills.\u201d \u00b617 The Youth Court adjudicated K.M.G. a Delinquent Youth. Concluding that the commitment requirements of \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b), MCA, had been satisfied, the court ordered K.M.G. \u201ccommitted to the custody of the Department of Corrections until he reaches the age of 18 years or sooner released by the Department of Corrections.\u201d Addressing K.M.G., the court stated that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">reason for the judgment is that you have demonstrated, from your prior behavior, that you cannot reside in the community while on a probationary status. You refuse to abide by the conditions of probation. Your mother refuses to make you abide by the rules of probation. We\u2019ve tried you with your aunt in Helena. She cannot be relied upon to have you under her control. There, virtually, is no further placement for you in the Missoula community. It\u2019s necessary that you be removed from the community, and placed at a secure facility for treatment. And, in that way, it\u2019s hopeful that you\u2019ll acquire some of the means necessary for your rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b618 K.M.G. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b619 We conduct de novo review of the youth court\u2019s conclusions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re C.D.H., </em>2009 MT 8, \u00b6 21, 349 Mont. 1, 201 P.3d 126 (citing <em>LHC, Inc. v. Alvarez, </em>2007 MT 123, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 294, 160 P.3d 502; <em>State v. Hastings, </em>2007 MT 294, \u00b6 8, 340 Mont. 1, 171 P.3d 726). We generally will not review an issue to which the appealing party failed to object in the trial court. <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892 (citing <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 341, 602 P.2d 997, 999 (1979)). However, an exception to the rule \u201callows appellate review of a criminal sentence that is alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates, even if the defendant raised no objection in the trial court.\u201d <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000). Generally, we review a sentence\u2019s legality to determine \u201cwhether it is within the statutory parameters.\u201d <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978 (citations omitted). A sentencing court\u2019s failure to abide by a statutory requirement may constitute an objectionable sentence, but not necessarily an illegal one permitting the <em>Lenihan </em>exception to be invoked on appeal. <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 20, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995); <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. 479, 482, 918 P.2d 296, 298 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b620 <em>1. Did the Youth Court err by committing K.M.G. to the Department of Corrections forplacement at Pine Hills pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b621 K.M.G. contends that the Youth Court did not have statutory authority to commit him to the Department of Corrections, for placement at Pine Hills, because none of the three statutory criteria for such placements were satisfied in his case. Section 41-5-1513(l)(b)(i)-(iii), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">The court may not place a youth adjudicated to be a delinquent youth in a state youth correctional facility for an act that would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">(i) the youth committed four or more misdemeanors in the prior 12 months;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">(ii) a psychiatrist or a psychologist licensed by the state or a licensed clinical professional counselor or a licensed clinical social worker has evaluated the youth and recommends placement in a state youth correctional facility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">(iii) the court finds that the youth will present a danger to the public if the youth is not placed in a state youth correctional facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\u00b622 We address KM.G.\u2019s arguments under each of the three criteria in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b623 <em>a. Did K.M.G. commit \u201cfour or more misdemeanors in the prior 12 months\u201d under subsection 1513(1)(b)(i)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b624 K.M.G. contends that he did not commit the requisite four misdemeanors \u201cin the prior 12 months.\u201d He argues that, under the language of the statute, the 12-month period \u201cruns from the date of the disposition hearing or the time at which the youth court commits the youth to the Department of Corrections.\u201d The Youth Court\u2019s disposition was not made until April 8, 2009, and K.M.G. thus argues that he cannot be placed at Pine Hills because he did not commit four misdemeanors during the 12 months preceding that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> K.M.G. also contends that his interpretation is consistent with the legislative intention to limit, not expand, the youth court\u2019s ability to incarcerate delinquent youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b625 The State responds that KM.G.\u2019s interpretation of the statute is \u201cpatently absurd\u201d because \u201c[i]t would allow a youth to control the disposition options available to the youth court by deliberately delaying the disposition of his case.\u201d The State offers that the \u201cprior 12 months\u201d requirement must be interpreted to mean the 12-month period prior to the State\u2019s filing of the adjudication petition charging the youth with committing the misdemeanors. Under this interpretation, the State argues that all five of KM.G.\u2019s misdemeanor crimes counted for purposes of \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b)(i), MCA, because K.M.G. committed them within the 12 months preceding the State\u2019s filing of the delinquency petition on November 26, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b626 When interpreting a statute, we seek to implement the intention of the legislature. Section 1-2-102, MCA; <em>Mont. Vending, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>2003 MT 282, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 1, 78 P.3d 499 (citations omitted). To determine legislative intent, we look first to the plain meaning of the words of the statute. <em>State v. Trull, </em>2006 MT 119, \u00b6 32, 332 Mont. 233, 136 P.3d 551 (citations omitted). We are to neither insert that which has been omitted, nor omit that which has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Druffel v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 220, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 57, 168 P.3d 640. Statutory construction should not lead to an absurd result if a reasonable interpretation can avoid it. <em>Van Der Hule v. Mukasey, </em>2009 MT 20, \u00b6 10, 349 Mont. 88, 217 P.3d 1019 (citing <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>178, 152 P.3d 1288). When the intent of the legislature cannot be determined from the plain language of the statute, we examine the statute\u2019s legislative history to determine its correct interpretation. <em>State v. Merry, </em>2008 MT 288, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 390, 191 P.3d 428 (citing <em>Stockman Bank of Mont. v. Mon-Kota, Inc., </em>2008 MT 74, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 115, 180 P.3d 1125); <em>see Montanans for Justice v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 60, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759, (\u201cWTien the legislative intent cannot be readily derived from the plain language, we review the legislative history and abide by the intentions reflected therein.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A7g\">\u00b627 Section 41-5-1513(l)(b)(i), MCA, provides that the youth court \u201cmay not place a youth adjudicated to be a delinquent youth in a state youth correctional facility for an act that would be a misdemeanor ... unless: (i) the youth committed four or more misdemeanors in the prior 12 months.\u201d K.M.G. reads this provision as requiring \u201cfour or more misdemeanors in the prior 12 months <em>preceding the final disposition.\u201d </em>The State reads it as requiring \u201cfour or more misdemeanors in the prior 12 months <em>preceding the filing of the delinquency petition.\u201d </em>Both suggestions, however, raise the specter of adding language to the statute. The provision raises further ambiguity: did the legislature intend to authorize facility placement of delinquent youth who commit at least four misdemeanors in a 12 month period, or only when youth commit at least four misdemeanors in the 12-month period \u201cprior to\u201d the current misdemeanor for which he is being disposed-in other words, requiring at least five misdemeanors?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b628 Because the provision is \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d to more than one interpretation, <em>Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. State, </em>2009 MT 5, \u00b6 27, 348 Mont. 333, 201 P.3d 132, we conclude that it is ambiguous and turn to the legislative history for assistance in determining the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Mont. Vending, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted). In the 2003 Legislative session, Representative Gary Matthews introduced H.B. 156 to amend \u00a7 41-5-1513, MCA, and the original intent, as explained by Representative Matthews, was to prevent the placement of youths who had committed a misdemeanor in a correctional facility. Matthews explained to the House Judiciary Committee that the bill\u2019s purpose was to \u201celiminate a court\u2019s ability to place a youth adjudicated delinquent, for an act that would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult, in a state youth correctional facility.\u201d He stated that \u201conce a juvenile gets into the system, it is hard for them to get out of the system.\u201d Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on HB 156, </em>58th Leg., Reg. Sess. 2 (Jan. 15, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b629 However, Representative Bob Clark inquired about what options <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>would be available \u201cfor youths who commit many misdemeanors.\u201d Steve Gibson, the Juvenile Probation Officer Division Administrator, suggested an amendment be made to the bill \u201cfor multiple misdemeanor offenders.\u201d Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on HB 156, </em>at 3-4. Thereafter, the language which would become subsection 1513(l)(b)(i) was first added to the bill by the House Judiciary Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b630 There was lively discussion about the multiple misdemeanor provision of the bill during the sessions of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Jerry O\u2019Neil questioned the propriety of incarcerating juvenile offenders who had committed \u201cmultiple shoplifting offenses.\u201d Representative Matthews responded that such minor offenders should not be placed in a facility, and suggested that Pine Hills be limited to juveniles such as \u201csex offenders, gang members,\u201d and youths that had committed \u201cmany felonies.\u201d He further explained that \u201cplacement dollars are available for shoplifters\u201d and juveniles committing minor offenses. Dick Meeker, of the Montana Juvenile Probation Officers Association, wrote that the \u201cAssociation originally opposed this legislation because it left the youth court with no discretion in dealing with multiple misdemeanor offenders.\u201d He commended the multiple misdemeanor amendment, noting that \u201cYouth Courts go to great lengths to keep juveniles from ever reaching a correctional facility but there are times when it is necessary because the community needs to be protected and the youth has not responded to other options.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b631 About the number of misdemeanors necessary to authorize facility placement, Committee Chairman Duane Grimes observed that \u201c[i]f a youth committed four misdemeanors, it may be necessary to have the youth sent to Pine Hills.\u201d Senator Dan McGee inquired whether \u201ca fifth misdemeanor in a 12 month period\u201d would \u201cresult in the youth being sent to Pine Hills.\u201d To this inquiry, Senator Mike Wheat stated his belief that \u201cthis could take place with the fourth misdemeanor\u201d in a 12 month period. Sen. McGee then noted that there are youth who offend routinely and regularly and it is necessary the state have a hammer to address this situation. The Committee subsequently approved the language. Mont. Sen. Jud. <em>Comm., Hearing on HB </em>156,58th Leg., Reg. Sess. 6-14 (Mar. 10, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b632  K.M.G. is correct that the legislative history reveals an intention by the Legislature to limit the number of juvenile offenders committed to Pine Hills for petty offenses.[However, the history also clearly reveals that an exception to this general goal was intended for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>juveniles who were multiple offenders \u2014 allowing facility placement, in the words of Senator Wheat, \u201cwith the fourth misdemeanor.\u201d This history reveals an intent to authorize, within the youth court\u2019s dispositional discretion, a facility placement of a juvenile brought before the court having committed four or more misdemeanors within a 12 month period of time. K.M.G. was brought before the Youth Court for disposition having committed his fourth and fifth misdemeanors within 12 months. As such, the Youth Court correctly determined that it was authorized, assuming the other criteria were met, to place K.M.G. within a youth facility for these offenses under subsection 1513(l)(b)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b633 6. Was <em>K.M.G. evaluated by an appropriate professional under subsection 1513(l)(b)(ii)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b634 K.M.G. asserts that the second prong of the statute has not been met because he was not evaluated by the proper mental health professional. The statute states that a youth is to be evaluated by \u201ca psychiatrist or a psychologist licensed by the state or a licensed clinical professional counselor or a licensed clinical social worker\u201d who must \u201crecommend[] placement in a state youth correctional facility.\u201d Section 41-5-1513(l)(b)(ii), MCA. K.M.G. was evaluated by Eileen C. Robbins, an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse, who provided the following recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">Specifically, the likely placement options for [K.M.G.] include Pine Hills Correctional Facility or return to his mother\u2019s home. I feel strongly that [K.M.G.] needs treatment rather than simply correctional intervention. If treatment could be provided to [K.M.G.] while at Pine Hills Correctional Facility, that would be an option which could be helpful to [K.M.G.], certainly more helpful than returning him to his mother\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">K.M.G. contends that Robbins does not satisfy the occupational requirements of the statute and, further, that she did not actually \u201crecommend\u201d KM.G.\u2019s placement at Pine Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b635 The State responds that K.M.G. waived these arguments by failing to object before the Youth Court, and in fact specifically acquiesced to the violations he now challenges. The State further argues that KM.G.\u2019s objections do not satisfy the <em>Lenihan </em>exception for raising issues on appeal without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b636 We generally will not review an issue to which a party has failed to object or otherwise preserve for appeal in the district court. The rationale is that the objecting party must give the trial court the opportunity to address and correct any perceived errors. We recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>an exception to this general rule in <em>Lenihan, </em>allowing appellate review of a criminal sentence that is alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates, even if the defendant raised no objection in the district court at the time of sentencing. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. We have explained that the <em>Lenihan </em>exception allows appellate review of a criminal sentence \u201cthat is alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates.\u201d <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 8. A criminal sentence is not illegal for purposes of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception \u201cif it falls within statutory parameters.\u201d <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6 9, 334 Mont. 1, 145 P.3d 946). Thus, \u201ca sentencing court\u2019s failure to abide by a statutory requirement rises to an objectionable sentence, not necessarily an illegal one that would invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception.\u201d <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 13 <em>(citing Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668; <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b637 K.M.G. asserts that his claim that the Youth Court failed to have him evaluated by a proper mental health professional under \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b)(ii), MCA, is a statutory violation which renders his disposition illegal and appealable despite having failed to object, pursuant to the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. However, KM.G.\u2019s argument runs counter to the parameters of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception explained above, because his disposition fell within statutory parameters, as we have held in several similar cases. In <em>Nelson, </em>the defendant claimed that the district court failed to follow the mandates of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(10), -225, MCA, before sentencing him to prison, and that his sentence was thus illegal and appealable under <em>Lenihan. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 17-18, 906 P.2d at 666-67. The statute required a sentencing court, prior to ordering incarceration, to first consider alternative placements. It provided that sentencing courts <em>\u201cshall first consider </em>alternatives to imprisonment of the offender in the state prison,\u201d <em>\u201cshall examine\u201d </em>the statutory criteria for sentencing nonviolent offenders, and <em>\u201cshall state </em>its reasons\u201d for rejecting alternatives to imprisonment. Section 46-18-201(11), MCA (1995) (emphasis added). We rejected Nelson\u2019s <em>Lenihan </em>argument, reasoning that the district court\u2019s failure to satisfy the prerequisites to incarceration made the sentence \u201csubject to challenge or objection,\u201d but did not render the sentence illegal because it was \u201cnot in excess of the maximum statutorily authorized.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668. We reached the same conclusion on a claim under the same statute in <em>Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b638 In <em>Kotwicki, </em>we relied upon <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Swoboda </em>to reject a broader application of the <em>Lenihan </em>rule we had approved, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>analysis, in <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348,313 Mont. 358,61 P.3d 126. <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-16. The statute at issue in <em>Kotwicki </em>mandated that the district court <em>\u201cmay not sentence </em>an offender to pay a fine\u201d unless the court determined the offender had the financial ability to do so. Section 46-18-231(3), MCA (emphasis added). Though failing to object, Kotwicki argued his fine was illegal and appealable because of the sentencing court\u2019s failure to comply with this statutory requirement. However, we held that the issue was not reviewable under the <em>Lenihan </em>rule, reasoning that \u201cKotwicki\u2019s fine of $25,000 falls within the parameters of that statute, and thus Kotwicki\u2019s sentence is not an illegal sentence for the purposes of invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>rule.\u201d <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b639 KM.G.\u2019s argument that the Youth Court could not place him in Pine Hills because it failed to obtain an evaluation by the proper professional under the statute, thus rendering his sentence illegal and appealable, is similar to Kotwicki\u2019s argument that his sentence was illegal because the court could not impose a fine upon him without determining he had the ability to pay as required by statute. It is also similar to Nelson and Swoboda\u2019s arguments that their sentences were illegal because the courts could not incarcerate them without considering alternatives as required by statute. While the Youth Court\u2019s failure to comply with a statutory procedural requirement \u201crises to an objectionable sentence,\u201d it does not constitute an illegal sentence for purposes of <em>Lenihan. Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b640 Beyond KM.G.\u2019s failure to object is his active acquiescence in the error during the sentencing hearing. K.M.G. understood Robbins\u2019s credentials, as well as her ultimate recommendation of placement and treatment at Pine Hills. Not only did he fail to object to Robbins\u2019s involvement, he embraced it, arguing that the Youth Court should grant him probation and order him to undergo treatment with Robbins. K.M.G.\u2019s counsel stated \u201cI, also, note in Ms. Robbins\u2019 report, that she\u2019s willing to treat [K.M.G.] if he is out, and here in Missoula\u201d and argued for the probationary treatment approach Robbins had initially recommended, prior to her learning that the approach would not be possible. \u201cWe will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, \u00b6 10, 314 Mont. 291, 65 P.3d 559 (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1-3-207, MCA (\u201cAcquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it.\u201d). This case well illustrates the reason for this rule. Allowing K.M.G. to challenge Robbins\u2019s involvement on appeal, after he had affirmatively embraced it before the Youth Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>to tactically support his argument for probation, would sanction gamesmanship of the judicial system. A litigant could pursue one strategy in the trial court, only, if unsuccessful, to reverse course on appeal and challenge the court\u2019s failure to follow the very statute he had ignored as part of his trial strategy. KM.G.\u2019s actions constituted a waiver of that issue, and we decline to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b641 c. <em>Was K.M.G. properly found to be a danger to the public under subsection 1513(1)(b)(Hi)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b642 K.M.G. acknowledges that the Youth Court found that he would present a danger to society in its written order, but contends that it did not discuss the evidence which supports this finding and, in fact, insufficient evidence existed to support the finding. The State again argues that K.M.G. waived this argument by failing to object and that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>the issue is properly before this Court, that substantial evidence supports the Youth Court\u2019s determination that K.M.G. was a danger to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b643  Even assuming no objection was necessary to preserve K.M.G.\u2019s arguments, we believe the Youth Court\u2019s order was supported by sufficient evidence and adequately demonstrated K.M.G.\u2019s dangerousness for purposes of the statute. When sentencing K.M.G., the Youth Court stated it was \u201cnecessary that [K.M.G.] be removed from the community, and placed at a secure facility for treatment.\u201d The Youth Court\u2019s amended dispositional order stated that the court had heard and considered the \u201crecommendations for disposition from the Youth Court\u2019s Report to the Court, the Deputy County Attorney, the Youth\u2019s attorney and the Youth\u201d and that it had \u201cspecifically reviewed the Report to the Court and attached Psychiatric Evaluation and Addendum to Psychiatric Evaluation\u201d as the bases for its determination to place K.M.G. in a secure facility. This evidence revealed that K.M.G. had a history of non-compliance with parental, school, law enforcement and probationary rules and authority and had exhibited criminal and violent behaviors. The Youth Court\u2019s finding that K.M.G was \u201ca danger to the public if not placed in a state youth correctional facility\u201d was supported by substantial evidence and adequately discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b644 <em>2. Did the Youth Court err by failing to specify how long K.M.G. could be held at Pine Hills?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u00b645 The Youth Court committed K.M.G. \u201cto the custody of the Department of Corrections until he reaches the age of 18 years or sooner released by the Department of Corrections.\u201d The Youth Court recommended that K.M.G. \u201cbe placed at Pine Hills School for Boys.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>K.M.G. argues that the disposition was illegal because it failed to limit the maximum period of time he could be placed in Pine Hills. Because K.M.G. can only be incarcerated for the maximum period that could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the same offenses, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1522(1), MCA, he argues that the court\u2019s disposition is illegal and must be reversed. The State agrees that K.M.G. cannot be held by the Department of Corrections beyond the period of time an adult could serve for the same offenses, but argues that there was nothing illegal in leaving the specific determination of how long K.M.G. would be placed to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b646 KM.G.\u2019s placement to the Department of Corrections is indeed subject to the limitation that he \u201cmay not be held... for a period of time in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the offense or offenses that brought the youth under the jurisdiction of the youth court.\u201d Section 41-5-1522(1), MCA. Procedurally, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1522, MCA, \u201c[w]hen a youth is committed to the department [of corrections], the department shall determine the appropriate placement and rehabilitation program for the youth after considering the recommendations made by the youth placement committee.\u201d The Department of Corrections\u2019s Length of Stay Committee establishes a youth\u2019s \u201clength of stay within 30 days of a youth\u2019s arrival at the facility.\u201d Admin. R. M. 20.9.703(l)(a) (2007). The committee determines the length of stay based upon several criteria, including the \u201cdelinquency history of the youthful offender; the severity and chronicity of the offenses committed by the youthful offender within the past 12 months; and mitigating or aggravating circumstances surrounding the act for which the youth has been adjudicated.\u201d Admin. R. M. 20.9.704(l)(a)-(c). Then, a youth must be discharged from a facility when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">(a) the youth [has] attained age 18;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">(b) the court order committing the youth to the department has expired;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">(c) the youth is being prosecuted in criminal court as an adult; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">(d) <em>the youth has served the maximum period of confinement pursuant to 41-5-1522. MCA.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Admin. R. M. 20.9.707(2)(a)-(d) (underlining in original, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\u00b647  As evident from these provisions, the Department of Corrections may not detain a youth beyond the maximum period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>confinement of the offenses he has committed. The Department of Corrections may not hold K.M.G. at Pine Hills Correctional Facility beyond the period of time an adult could serve for committing the same misdemeanor offenses for which he was disposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b648  The Youth Court\u2019s disposition order was consistent with both \u00a7 41-5-1522, MCA, and Admin. R. M. 20.9.703, 704, 707, and did not err by leaving the specific calculation of KM.G.\u2019s placement time to the Department of Corrections under these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b649 <em>3. Did the Youth Court err by finding that K.M.G. admitted to not attending school in violation of his probation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b650 The Youth Court\u2019s disposition order states that K.M.G. admitted the allegations in the State\u2019s Amended Petition to Revoke, including that he violated the condition that he attend school on a regular basis. K.M.G. argues that he only admitted to running away from the Radtke Home, not that he failed to attend school regularly. K.M.G. directs our attention to the January 9, 2009 hearing, where he orally admitted running from the Radtke Home, in violation of his probation, and notes the Youth Court did not address the school attendance violation. The State contends that K.M.G. admitted to the truancy violation by way of the Juvenile Admission and Waiver of Rights form filed with the Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b651  KM.G.\u2019s signed Juvenile Admission and Waiver Form indicates that K.M.G. admitted to violating the condition that he attend school. K.M.G. initialed every line of the document, indicating he understood his rights and making his admissions to the alleged probation violations. In open court, KM.G.\u2019s counsel presented the signed Admission and Waiver Form, as evidenced by the record: \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to enter admissions, today-both to two new charges filed against [K.M.G.], as well as the Petition to Revoke .... If I can approach, I have a Waiver of Rights for both matters.\u201d K.M.G.\u2019s written, voluntary acknowledgement of his rights and his admission, presented to the Youth Court during the disposition hearing, that he was admitting to the probation violations alleged in the Petition to Revoke, are sufficient bases for an admission in this case, and properly considered by the Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b652 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\"> Again, KM.G.\u2019s misdemeanors were committed on January 8,2008; January 26, 2008; March 5, 2008; and two on November 18, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b125-10\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Abi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\u00b653 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">\u00b654 As noted, \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b), MCA (2007), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">The court <em>may not </em>place a youth adjudicated to be a delinquent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>youth in a state youth correctional facility for an act that would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">(ii) a psychiatrist or a psychologist licensed by the state or a licensed clinical professional counselor or a licensed clinical social worker has evaluated the youth and recommends placement in a state youth correctional facility .... [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In this case, the use of the phrase <em>may not </em>is mandatory. <em>Van Der Hule v. Mukasey, </em>2009 MT 20, \u00b6 11, 349 Mont. 88, 217 P.3d 1019 (\u201c[C]ourts that have construed legislative use of the phrase \u2018may not\u2019 have consistently held that the phrase is mandatory.\u201d). In other words, under the plain language of the statute, the youth court had no authority to place K.M.G. in a state youth correctional facility for the commission of a misdemeanor absent compliance with \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(b)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b655 It is undisputed here that Eileen C. Robbins was not \u201ca psychiatrist or a psychologist licensed by the state or a licensed clinical professional counselor or a licensed clinical social worker.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, it follows that the plain and unambiguous statutory preconditions were not met in order to place K.M.G. in Pine Hills. In short, the court\u2019s sentence was illegal because the court exceeded its statutory authority to sentence. <em>Pena v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, \u00b6 24, 323 Mont. 347, 100 P.3d 154 (A district court \u201chas no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority,\u201d its authority to impose sentences in criminal cases \u201cis defined and constrained by statute,\u201d and a sentence that exceeds statutory authority or parameters is, therefore, \u201cillegal.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>overruled on other grounds,Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b656 The court\u2019s sentence being an illegal sentence, the <em>Lenihan </em>exception applies and we may review the sentence even in the absence of an objection by the defendant-or, in this case, the youth. <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979); <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892. The youth, therefore, did not waive objection to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b657 As for the Court\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, 314 Mont. 291, 65 P.3d 559, for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[acquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it\u2019 \u201d (Opinion \u00b6 40), I have and will continue to dissent from the use of the <em>Micklon </em>line of cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>See State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 391, \u00b6 45, 347 Mont. 113, 197 P.3d 977 (Nelson, J., specially concurring). This doctrine is more about soothing the hurt feelings of sentencing courts-whose own seeming inability or refusal to follow the law is the cause of the problem in the first place-than it is about following the law, requiring sentencing courts to follow the law, and doing justice for the defendant (youth).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b658 More to the point, the sentence at issue here is illegal because it is not statutorily authorized. As pointed out above, the statute clearly and unambiguously provides that the court \u201cmay not\u201d (i.e., lacks authority to) place a youth in a state youth correctional facility for commission of a misdemeanor unless \u201ca psychiatrist or a psychologist licensed by the state or a licensed clinical professional counselor or a licensed clinical social worker has evaluated the youth and recommends placement in a state youth correctional facility.\u201d Section 41-5-1513(l)(b)(ii), MCA. It is undisputed that this blackletter requirement of the law was not followed. Thus, absent compliance with the law, the District Court did not have authority-judicial power-to place K.M.G. in a state youth correctional facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b659 Ignoring this, however, our decision here takes our <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence from the sublime to the ridiculous. Now, if the defendant \u201cembraces\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 40) the trial court\u2019s refusal to follow the law-i.e., the illegality-then we pass the sentencing court\u2019s dereliction with a wink and a nod. Our rationale is that we prevent the defendant from \u201cgaming\u201d the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b660 The point missed in this silliness, though, is that if the District Court-which, theoretically, is in the business of making sure the law is followed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>-would simply do its job in the first instance, and enforce the law as written, then any \u201cgamesmanship\u201d would be nipped in the bud. Every criminal \u201cembraces\u201d the illegality of his conduct; and every defendant, if given a chance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> will attempt to \u201cgame\u201d the system to his or her advantage.
