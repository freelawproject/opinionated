Whether Worthan\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to produce Dr. Michael Scolatti for testimony at trial violated Worthan\u2019s constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether Worthan\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to ascertain the qualifications of expert witness David Stube violated Worthan\u2019s constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">\u00b65 This case arises out of Worthan\u2019s trial and convictions for two counts of sexual intercourse without consent, felonies, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, two counts of incest, felonies, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, and one count of tampering with a witness, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-206, MCA. For these convictions, the District Court sentenced Worthan to a total of 130 years in Montana State Prison with 60 years suspended. Worthan appealed his convictions alleging that his trial attorney Kelli Sather (Sather) provided ineffective assistance of counsel. With respect to his initial appeal, we concluded that Sather\u2019s questioning of a social worker did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel and that the record was insufficient to address Worthan\u2019s additional ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Accordingly, we deemed his additional claims appropriate for consideration in a petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">\u00b66 On January 29, 2007, Worthan filed the pro se petition for post-conviction relief that is the subject of this appeal. Among other things, Worthan claimed that his rights to effective assistance of counsel were violated by Sather\u2019s failure to adequately investigate expert witness David Stube\u2019s (Stube) credentials and by her promise and subsequent failure to call Dr. Michael Scolatti (Dr. Scolatti) to testify. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Worthan\u2019s petition concluding that he failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">\u00b67 Worthan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b68 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions law and fact which this Court reviews de novo. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b69 <em>1. Whether Worthan\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to produce Dr. Michael Scolatti for testimony at trial violated Worthan\u2019s constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b610 The right to effective assistance of \u201ccounsel in criminal prosecutions is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. When confronted with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim we apply the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), and adopted by this Court in <em>Whitlow. </em>Under this test, the defendant must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s representation was deficient and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficiency was prejudicial to the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>446 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064; <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. In order to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, we have explained that judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15. Accordingly, the defendant \u2018\u201cmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019\u201d <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 <em>(quoting Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065). Indeed, this presumption undergirds our conclusion that a defendant bears a heavy burden in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21. Having set out the appropriate analytical approach, we now turn to the first prong of our test which, as it applies to the case before us, requires that we determine whether Sather\u2019s failure to produce Dr. Scolatti as an expert witness was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b611 With respect to the first prong, the District Court concluded that \u201c[t]o the extent that Ms. Sather promised the jury that Dr. Scolatti would testify that [Worthan\u2019s Daughters] O.W. and/or K.W. were not credible, Ms. Sather\u2019s professional conduct was deficient ....\u201d On appeal, Worthan maintains that the District Court properly determined Sather\u2019s conduct to be deficient under the first prong of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Strickland </em>test. The State does not directly contest this conclusion. Rather, the State argues that, even assuming Sather acted deficiently by failing to call Dr. Scolatti after she promised the jury she would do so, this deficiency did not prejudice Worthan and therefore did not violate his rights to effective assistance of counsel. We agree with the State that, if Sather\u2019s conduct did not prejudice Worthan, the issue of whether her conduct was deficient becomes immaterial. Accordingly, we turn our attention to the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b612 Under the second prong, the District Court must determine whether the failure to call Dr. Scolatti as a promised expert witness prejudiced Worthan\u2019s defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. In its conclusion that Worthan\u2019s defense was not prejudiced the District Court reasoned that, rather than supporting Worthan, Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony would actually have damaged Worthan\u2019s case. Worthan maintains however, that this conclusion was in error. To make this argument, Worthan analogizes Sather\u2019s unfulfilled promise to call Dr. Scolatti to cases from other jurisdictions in which a defendant was deemed to have been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to produce promised evidence or testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b613 Worthan relies first on <em>Anderson v. Butler, </em>858 F.2d 16 (1st Cir. 1988), in which the First Circuit Court of Appeals held that a violation of the right to the effective assistance of counsel occurred because the defendant\u2019s attorney did not fulfill his promise to the jury that he would call a psychiatrist to testify that during the killing the defendant was acting \u201cwithout any appreciation of what was happening ...\u201d and \u201cwas like a robot programmed on destruction.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>858 F.2d at 17. Worthan next points to <em>State v. Moorman, </em>358 S.E.2d 502 (N.C. 1987), in which the Supreme Court of North Carolina held that it was a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel when counsel promised to produce evidence that the defendant was incapable of engaging in sexual acts but failed to produce such evidence. Finally, Worthan presents <em>People v. Davis, </em>677 N.E.2d 1340 (Ill. App. 1997), in which the Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that there was prejudice when the defense counsel failed to fulfill his promise to offer the defendant\u2019s testimony. Each of these cases however, can be distinguished from the facts presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b614 In <em>Anderson, </em>the defense counsel failed to call a promised expert witnesses whose testimony he claimed would show that on the night of the killing the defendant was \u201cwalking unconsciously toward a psychological no exit... [w]ithout any feeling, without any appreciation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of what was happening, [the defendant] on that night was like a robot programmed on destruction.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>858 F.2d at 17. In concluding that the defendant\u2019s rights were prejudiced, the <em>Anderson </em>court explained that \u201c[t]he promise was dramatic, and indicated testimony strikingly significant.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>858 F.2d at 17. By comparison, Sather explained to the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">[y]ou will also hear from Dr. Scolatti, who reviewed the forensic interviews of the three children that Dr. Miller did on the children. He has also done numerous forensic interviews and has worked with children and done this, and he comes to a little different conclusion than Dr. Miller. He may agree with some of the techniques she used; but in reviewing the videotapes and a lot of other information, he comes to a different conclusion on what he thinks the outcome of [O.W.\u2019s] interview was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Far from being dramatic and strikingly significant, Sather\u2019s rather generic description of Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony can hardly be said to have had the same prejudicial effect on the jury as the \u201cstrikingly significant\u201d statements in <em>Anderson. </em>Furthermore, in <em>Anderson </em>the impact of the defense counsel\u2019s unfulfilled promise was heightened because it occurred only one day before the defense rested. Whereas here, Sather\u2019s far less dramatic statement was made six days before Worthan\u2019s defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b615 <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Davis </em>are also distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Moorman, </em>in addition to reasoning that the defense counsel\u2019s unfulfilled promise to present \u201cone critical piece of evidence\u201d was deficient, the court also referred to the defense counsel\u2019s lack of credibility as a result of his abuse of prescription drugs, apparent inattentiveness and sleeping at trial. Here, Sather made no similar claim that Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony would unequivocally demonstrate Worthan\u2019s innocence and there is clearly no contention that Sather was inattentive. In <em>Davis, </em>defense counsel promised the jury that the defendant, who was charged with murder, would testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder. Ultimately, counsel failed to call the defendant and the court concluded that this violated the defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel. However, in contrast to Worthan\u2019s claims, the <em>Davis </em>court\u2019s conclusion that this deficiency was prejudicial turned on the fact that defense counsel had also failed to investigate the defendant\u2019s criminal history or to obtain a ruling on whether the defendant\u2019s prior drug conviction was admissible. In addition, the court noted that defense counsel\u2019s unfulfilled promise to have the defendant testify amounted to a failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to \u201cpresent the most important piece of evidence he had promised to produce ....\u201d Sather\u2019s generic comments regarding Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony are not comparable to the defense counsel\u2019s promise to produce the defendant in <em>Davis. </em>Thus, we do not find <em>Anderson, Moorman </em>and <em>Davis </em>to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b616  It is well established that in order to meet the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test the defendant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. Here, not only are the cases Worthan relies on distinguishable but the evidence does not support the conclusion that it is reasonably probable that, but for Sather\u2019s unfulfilled promise to present Dr. Scolatti, the result of the proceeding would have been different. In fact, as the District Court notes in its decision, far from punching holes in the State\u2019s case, Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony during sentencing actually supported the conclusion that the State forensic interviews were conducted in a professional and proper manner. Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Worthan\u2019s contention that he was prejudiced by reference to Sather\u2019s unfulfilled promise to call Dr. Scolatti in the State\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments. Having sifted through the transcripts we find no reference in the State\u2019s closing or rebuttal arguments to either Dr. Scolatti or Sather\u2019s unfulfilled promise to call him as an expert witness. For these reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Worthan has failed to demonstrate that Sather\u2019s statements regarding Dr. Scolatti prejudiced his defense. Accordingly, we conclude that Worthan\u2019s rights under the United States and Montana Constitutions to the effective assistance of counsel were not violated by Sather\u2019s unfulfilled promise to call Dr. Scolatti as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao5q\">\u00b617 <em>2. Whether Worthan\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to ascertain the qualification of expert witness David Stube violated Worthan\u2019s rights to the effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b618 On appeal, Worthan argues that Sather\u2019s failure to discover that \u201cDr.\u201d Stube had received his Ph.D. from an unaccredited school and that he was therefore not a Doctor, rendered her assistance ineffective and prejudiced his defense. The State counters that Sather\u2019s investigation of Stube\u2019s qualifications as an expert were sufficiently thorough so as to preclude the conclusion that Sather was ineffective. In its resolution of the issue the District Court concluded that, under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, Worthan failed to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>that Sather\u2019s performance was deficient. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b619 Turning once again to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, which requires a determination of whether the attorney\u2019s actions were deficient, we begin by reiterating that \u201c \u2018the proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 32 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2065). \u201c[A] reviewing court \u2018must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b620  Here, while Sather failed to ascertain that Stube\u2019s credential was invalid, that failure does not fall outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance in this instance. As the District Court notes, prior to Stube testifying at trial, Sather met with Stube, obtained and reviewed his curriculum vitae, discussed his Ph.D. degree with him and satisfied herself that Stube was a qualified expert witness. The record also indicates that Stube represented to Sather at the time of their meeting that he had been qualified as an expert witness on approximately fifty previous occasions. Furthermore, Stube\u2019s sworn testimony during the State\u2019s examination indicates that he glossed over or even mislead Sather as to the status of his Ph.D. While we are mindful of counsel\u2019s duty to conduct a reasonable investigation, <em>State v. Hagen, </em>2002 MT 190, \u00b6 26, 311 Mont. 117, 53 P.3d 885, we are satisfied that in this instance, Sather performed her duties in a manner consistent with her responsibilities as defense counsel. By meeting with Stube and reviewing what she thought to be his legitimate credentials, Sather performed her basic duties as defense counsel. Thus, we affirm the District Court and conclude that Worthan has failed to overcome the strong presumption that Sather\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Worthan\u2019s rights to the effective assistance of counsel were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
