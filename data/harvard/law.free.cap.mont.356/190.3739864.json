The District Court of the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, sentenced Brownback. Brownback now appeals the portion of his sentence requiring him to pay $739,312 in restitution to the State of Montana. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in requiring Brownback to pay restitution to the State for money embezzled by his mother and paid over to him.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in requiring Brownback to pay restitution without considering his ability to pay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">\u00b65 <em>3. Whether the District Court\u2019s restitution hearing violated Brownback\u2019s rights to assert civil defenses and to fundamental fairness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">\u00b66 In March 2008 the State filed an information charging Brownback with felony forgery by common scheme for delivering checks that he knew had been forged by his mother, Susan Campbell (Susan).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">\u00b67 In 2001 Susan, then an accountant and office manager for the Montana Department of Administration, began writing unauthorized checks to Brownback from the account of her husband, Jack Campbell (Jack), and the account of Jack\u2019s business, Jack\u2019s Technical Assistance (JTA). Susan would forge her husband\u2019s signature on the checks. Brownback knew that the checks were forged and unauthorized. In 2002 Susan began embezzling money from the State by issuing checks from the State to JTA. Over the next five years, Susan embezzled $739,312 from the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">\u00b68 Susan funneled all the money she stole from JTA and the State to Brownback, who had financial problems due to a gambling addiction. Susan said she did this out of motherly concern for her son. According to Susan, Brownback would come to her with \u201cdesperate plea[s] for help\u201d (i.e., money), insisting that \u201che would go to jail, lose his home, his family, etc.\u201d Susan stated that this amounted to emotional blackmail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Nevertheless, Susan continued to write checks to Brownback, drawing on Jack\u2019s and JTA\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b69 Brownback took the checks for his personal use and to support his addiction. He admitted knowing that Susan had no authority to sign the checks. Even though Susan deposited the money she embezzled from the State into JTA\u2019s account and from there passed it on to Brownback, both she and Brownback deny that Brownback knew that the money was embezzled from the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b610 In 2007 investigators discovered Susan\u2019s theft. She was prosecuted in federal court. Ultimately Susan pled guilty to scheming to defraud the State of Montana, and committing aggravated identity theft and income tax evasion. The court sentenced her to seventy-five months in prison and ordered her to pay approximately $1 million in restitution, including $739,312 to the State of Montana (and its insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b611 The investigation into Susan\u2019s embezzlement led to the charges against Brownback. Eventually Brownback and the State reached a plea agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, Brownback pled guilty to theft by common scheme for exercising \u201cunauthorized control over monies belonging to his step-father, Jack Campbell, d/b/a Jack[\u2019s] Technical Assistance.\u201d Brownback admitted that this conduct occurred continuously from 2001 to 2007. However, Brownback also specifically denied knowing that any of the money had been embezzled from the State and denied participating in the embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b612 The District Court accepted Brownback\u2019s guilty plea and set a sentencing hearing. Brownback filed a sentencing memorandum, arguing among other things that he should not be required to pay restitution to the State for the $739,312 that Susan embezzled. At the close of business on the Friday before sentencing, the State filed its sentencing memorandum, responding that the State was a victim of Brownback\u2019s crime and, consequently, was entitled to restitution from him for the $739,312 that Susan embezzled and funneled to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b613 Both the State and Brownback presented testimony and evidence at the sentencing hearing. The principal dispute between the parties at the hearing was whether Brownback should be required to pay restitution to the State. On three occasions, Brownback, through counsel, informed the District Court that he had only received the State\u2019s sentencing memorandum at the end of the day on the preceding Friday. In response, the District Court asked Brownback if he wanted to continue the sentencing hearing. Brownback declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u00b614 Following the hearing, the District Court issued its judgment, sentencing Brownback to the Montana Department of Corrections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(DOC) for ten years with five suspended, subject to various conditions. The District Court also ordered Brownback to pay nearly $1 million in restitution, including $739,312 to the State (which Brownback now challenges). In setting restitution, the District Court did not consider Brownback\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b615 Brownback appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b616 We review a sentence that includes at least one year of incarceration or, as here, commitment to DOC for legality only. <em>State v. Perkins, </em>2009 MT 150, \u00b6 8, 350 Mont. 387, 208 P.3d 386; <em>State ex rel. Holt v. District Court, </em>2000 MT 142, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10, 300 Mont. 35, 3 P.3d 608; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-18-903(1), MCA. In conducting such review, we consider whether \u201cthe sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable statute, and whether the court followed the affirmative mandates of the sentencing statute.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u00b617 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in requiring Brownback to pay restitution to the State for money embezzled by his mother and paid over to him.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u00b618 Brownback challenges the District Court\u2019s order requiring him to pay restitution to the State for the money that Susan embezzled and eventually passed on to him. Brownback first contends that he should not be responsible for restitution to the State for this money because he neither knew about nor participated in the embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\u00b619 When a criminal defendant, as here, pleads guilty to a criminal offense, the sentencing court must impose restitution if the offender\u2019s criminal conduct resulted in pecuniary loss to a victim. Sections 46-18-201(5), -241(1), -243(1), (2), MCA. Restitution \u201cengraft[s] a civil remedy onto a criminal statute,\u201d creating a procedural shortcut for crime victims who would be entitled to a civil recovery against the offender. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>195 F.3d 961, 968 (7th Cir. 1999) (interpreting similar federal restitution statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-18-249(1), (3), MCA (providing that restitution award does not limit victim\u2019s right to recover damages in subsequent civil suit, but that restitution must offset any civil award for same pecuniary loss).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\u00b620 The required restitution must be full, yet it is limited to special damages that the victim could recover from the offender in a civil action. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-243(1) (defining \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d). Victims entitled to restitution include persons or governmental entities that suffer loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>of property \u201cas a result of\u2019 the offender\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a)(i), (iii). Thus, a causal relation between the offender\u2019s criminal conduct and the pecuniary loss is the touchstone for determining whether a person or entity is a victim entitled to restitution. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 13, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313 (noting \u201ccausal standard\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b621 Here, Brownback does not specifically deny that the State suffered pecuniary loss for which it could recover special damages in a civil action against Brownback. Nor does He specifically deny the causal relation between his criminal conduct and the State\u2019s loss. Instead, Brownback asserts that he should not be required to pay restitution to the State because (1) he did not know about and (2) he did not participate in Susan\u2019s embezzlement. These arguments miss the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">\u00b622 Contrary to Brownback\u2019s suggestion, there is no statutory requirement that a defendant must know about a specific loss caused by his criminal conduct before it can be the basis of an order for restitution. In fact, our case law suggests just the opposite: that a criminal defendant may be responsible for restitution for pecuniary loss that he did not know about at the time of the criminal offense, but which resulted therefrom. <em>See State v. Perkins, </em>2009 MT 150, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 9-13, 350 Mont. 387, 208 P.3d 386 (affirming restitution for child-care expenses incurred by third party after defendant assaulted minor, leading to removal of minor child from custody of mother and placement of child in care of third party); <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7,22 (affirming restitution to towing and ambulance services called by police after defendant drunk driver rolled his car and injured himself).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b623  Similarly, the fact that Brownback did not participate in Susan\u2019s embezzlement does not preclude an order of restitution. Restitution is not limited to only those victims who suffer pecuniary loss as a direct result of a criminal offense. <em>See LaTray, </em>\u00b6 14. As stated above, restitution turns on the familiar elements of loss and causation. Here, there is no question that the State suffered pecuniary loss \u201carising out of the facts or events constituting\u201d Brownback\u2019s criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>activities. Section 46-18-243(l)(a). And, although Brownback did not participate in the embezzlement, there was a causal relation between his criminal offense and the State\u2019s pecuniary loss. Brownback pled guilty to theft by common scheme for a continuing course of conduct that spanned more than six years. Brownback\u2019s continuing criminal conduct consisted of manipulating his mother, Susan, into writing him unauthorized checks drawn from the accounts of her husband, Jack, and Jack\u2019s business, JTA. According to Susan, it was because of Brownback\u2019s \u201cdesperate plea[s] for help\u201d that she began embezzling money from the State and funneling it from the JTA account to Brownback. The evidence and testimony presented at the sentencing hearing showed that all of the $739,312 that Susan embezzled from the State went, ultimately, to Brownback. Given this record, we conclude that but for Brownback\u2019s continuing course of criminal conduct, the State would not have lost $739,312. This satisfies the causation standard of \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA. Therefore, because the State was a victim that suffered pecuniary loss, it was entitled to full restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">\u00b624 Breeding, cited by Brownback, does not compel a different conclusion. In that case, the defendant\u2019s friend stole a car and drove it to pick up the defendant. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 2. At first the defendant, Breeding, did not know that the car was stolen because his friend told him that the car belonged to his uncle. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. With Breeding and another character as passengers, the friend drove the car into a haystack, damaging the car. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. The friend subsequently revealed that the car was stolen, and he and Breeding decided to drive the car to California. <em>Id. </em>They were arrested <em>en route, </em>and Breeding eventually pled guilty to felony theft. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. The district court ordered Breeding to pay restitution for the damage to the car, and Breeding appealed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. We held that the district court erred in requiring Breeding to pay restitution for the damage to the car. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20. We applied the rule that an offender is responsible for restitution for harm caused by his offense. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13. It was only after the car was damaged that Breeding discovered it had been stolen and drove to California <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 15-17. Consequently, there could be no causal connection between Breeding\u2019s offense and the earlier damage to the car-and, therefore, \u201cno basis for requiring Breeding to pay restitution for that damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b625  Unlike <em>Breeding, </em>here the harm for which Brownback was required to pay restitution first occurred in 2002, one year after he began knowingly to receive forged checks from his mother. As mentioned above, testimony and evidence presented at the sentencing hearing demonstrated a causal connection between Brownback\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ongoing criminal conduct and the State\u2019s loss. It matters not that Brownback was unaware the money he received from Susan originated in the State\u2019s coffers. Nor is it relevant that Brownback might not have taken the money had he known it was embezzled from the State. The question is about causation, not counterfactual scenarios. In <em>Breeding, </em>the defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge that the car was stolen-at the time the car was damaged-negated the required mental state for theft (\u201cpurposely or knowingly\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17; <em>see also </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 5.6(a), 395 (2d ed., Thompson West 2003) (\u201c[IJgnorance or mistake of fact or law is a defense when it negatives the existence of a mental state essential to the crime charged.\u201d). As Breeding only met all the elements of theft after his friend had damaged the car, his criminal conduct could not have <em>caused </em>the damage (causation does not operate retrospectively). <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 18. In contrast to <em>Breeding, </em>Brownback\u2019s ignorance that the money he was receiving originally belonged to the State does not negate the required mental state for theft. He knew all along that he was obtaining \u201cunauthorized control over property of the owner\u201d-he just thought he was taking money from his step-father, not the State. Section 45-6-301(1), MCA. This is no defense: it is no less theft because the victim\u2019s name is unknown. One may not steal property from strangers with impunity. Thus, Brownback\u2019s mistake as to the identity of the source of the money he stole did not affect the causal relation.</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">\u00b626 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in requiring Brownback to pay restitution without considering his ability to pay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b627 The District Court required Brownback to pay restitution without considering his financial means. Brownback avers that this was error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b628  The principal authority on which Brownback premises his argument is \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(h), MCA, which reads: \u201cSentencing practices must emphasize restitution to the victim by the offender. A sentence must require an offender who is financially able to do so to pay restitution ....\u201d This is a general principle of the State\u2019s correctional and sentencing policy. While the specific restitution statutes formerly required sentencing courts to consider an offender\u2019s ability to pay, the legislature removed this requirement in 2003. 2003 Mont. Laws 940-41; <em>State v. McMaster, </em>2008 MT 268, \u00b6 45, 345 Mont. 172, 190 P.3d 302. Now district courts are expressly mandated to require offenders to pay full restitution. Sections 46-18-201(5), -241(1), MCA. \u201cWhen a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d Section 1-2-102, MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Accordingly, \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(h), MCA, does not trump the mandate for district courts to order full restitution. Thus, the District Court did not err in requiring Brownback to pay full restitution without considering his ability to pay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b629 3. <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s restitution hearing violated Brownback\u2019s rights to assert civil defenses and to fundamental fairness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AP\">\u00b630 Last, Brownback directs us to the fact that the State filed its sentencing memorandum at the close of business on the Friday before the sentencing hearing, which was the following Monday. The State\u2019s sentencing memorandum asserted that the State was a victim entitled to restitution. Brownback argues that he did not have adequate time to assess the accuracy of the loss claimed by the State. This, Brownback submits, violated his right to present any civil defense under \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA, as well as fundamental fairness. Brownback asserts that the District Court should have continued the sentencing hearing until the State completed its civil case against him. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b631 As we stated in <em>McMaster, </em>we will not allow a party \u201cto decline the District Court\u2019s offers for additional time during the hearing and then argue on appeal that he had\u201d inadequate time to prepare. <em>State v. McMaster, </em>2008 MT 268, \u00b6 43, 345 Mont. 172, 190 P.3d 302. This is precisely what happened here. At the sentencing hearing, Brownback repeatedly complained that the State had filed its brief at the end of the day on the preceding Friday. Consequently, the District Court asked Brownback if he wanted to continue the hearing. He declined. Had \u25a0 the District Court denied a request for a continuance by Brownback, we would consider the implications of \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA, and fundamental fairness as regards orders of restitution. <em>See e.g. South Dakota v. Tuttle, </em>460 N.W.2d 157, 159-60 (S.D. 1990) (considering application of procedural due process to orders of restitution). That, however, is not the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b632 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the sentence of the District Court ordering Brownback to pay restitution to the State.</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> We have recognized that some pecuniary losses may he so attenuated as to no longer be considered \u201ca result of the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Ness, </em>2009 MT 300, \u00b6 20, 352 Mont. 317, 216 P.3d 773 (quoting <em>State v. LaTray, </em>2000 MT 262, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 11, 11 P.3d 116); <em>see also State v. Morgan, </em>198 Mont. 391, 401, 646 P.2d 1177, 1183 (1982) (recognizing disagreements about limits of a \"pure\u201d causal standard). Other courts have also recognized the problem of requiring restitution for attenuated harms. <em>E.g. Minnesota v. Palubicki, </em>727 N.W.2d 662, 667 (Minn. 2007); <em>Washington v. Enstone, </em>974 P.2d 828, 830-31 (Wash. 1999); <em>Colorado v. Deadmond, </em>683 P.2d 763, 773-74 (Colo. 1984) <em>(citing Morgan); Utah v. Johnson, </em>224 P.3d 720, 732 (Utah. App. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> The principle from \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(h), MCA, is not inconsistent with the amended restitution statutes. A district court may consider an offender\u2019s ability to pay restitution, but only in response to a subsequent petition to adjust or waive the ordered restitution. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-246, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
