(Alside) did not breach its warranty to Derek Stebner and Stebner Real Estate, Inc. (Stebner). After the trial, Stebner filed a motion for a new trial, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59, claiming juror misconduct. The District Court denied Stebner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b62 The sole issue Stebner raises on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the alleged jurors\u2019 misconduct did not warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u00b63 Stebner, the owner of Riverside Apartment Complex, brought a breach of warranty action against Alside. Stebner had made a claim for replacement of the apartment complex\u2019s steel siding under the Limited Warranty. Alside denied his claim because, according to Alside, the damage to the siding was not covered under the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u00b64 A jury trial was held from September 15, 2009, to September 18, 2009. After hearing the evidence, the jury began deliberations at approximately 4:00 p.m. on September 17. Before any deliberations, five jurors voted in favor of Alside, six voted in favor of Stebner, with one abstention. After about an hour of deliberations, the jurors voted six in favor of Stebner and six in favor of Alside. The jury was excused at 5:00 p.m. to allow one juror to pick up a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u00b65 The jury reconvened at 8:30 a.m. the next day. Within five minutes, they voted eleven to one in favor of Alside and delivered the verdict accordingly. After the verdict, Stebner learned from a juror that some of the jurors were allegedly talking about the case outside of the jury room and that one juror had researched the definition of \u201cpreponderance\u201d on the internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\u00b66 Stebner filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that a new trial was warranted to avoid manifest injustice due to juror misconduct. Stebner attached the affidavit of Juror Christine Strukel to his motion, in which Juror Strukel testified she heard three jurors discussing the case as they were walking outside of the courthouse. She said the jurors stopped discussing the case when they saw she was listening to the conversation. Juror Strukel also testified in her affidavit that \u201c[djuring the course of deliberations, the jury used an outside resource to help determine the definition of the term \u2018preponderance.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u00b67 Alside attached three juror affidavits to their response brief. In the first affidavit, Juror Laurie Schneider testified that \u201c[a]fter we took our vote, I commented that I thought the verdict was correct based on my understanding of\u2018preponderance.\u2019 I previously looked up the word \u2018preponderance\u2019 on the internet. My understanding of\u2018preponderance\u2019 matched the jury instruction that was submitted to us.\u201d She also testified that she based her decision on the evidence presented at trial and that she voted in favor of Alside because the evidence submitted during the trial did not support a verdict in favor of Stebner.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b68 The other two jurors testified in their affidavits that Juror Schneider made her comment about her research on \u201cpreponderance\u201d after they voted in favor of Alside and her comment had no effect on their decision. They also testified that they based their decision on the evidence presented at trial and they voted in favor of Alside because the evidence submitted during the trial did not support a verdict in favor of Stebner.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b69 The District Court denied Stebner\u2019s motion, stating simply that it did so \u201cunder the reasoning of <em>[Erickson v. Perrett, </em>175 Mont. 87, 572 P.2d 518 (1977)], which requires [that] the alleged jury misconduct must affect a material matter that is in dispute and must prejudice the complaining party sufficiently enough to render the jury\u2019s verdict manifestly unjust to warrant the granting of a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b610 Stebner appeals, reiterating his argument that the only remedy to cure the juror misconduct and to \u201cuphold the sanctity of the judicial process\u201d is to reverse the District Court and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b611 Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial depends on the basis of the motion. <em>Fish v. Harris, </em>2008 MT 302, \u00b6 8, 345 Mont. 527, 192 P.3d 238. When the basis of a motion for a new trial is alleged jury misconduct, this Court will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision absent a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Id. A </em>manifest abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable. <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources, Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 132, 82 P.3d 912. \u2018We will give considerable weight to the determination of the district court because it is in the best position to observe the jurors and determine the potential for prejudice when allegations of jury or bailiff misconduct are raised, and the district court will have significant latitude when ruling on these matters.<em>Allers </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>273 Mont. 1, 4, 901 P.2d 600, 602 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the jurors\u2019 misconduct did not warrant a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b613 Stebner contends thatM. R. Civ. P. 59(a), (g), and \u00a7 25-11-102(2), MCA, allow a district court to grant a new trial for juror misconduct to prevent manifest injustice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that because Juror Schneider used outside resources during the course of deliberations, he did not receive a fair trial. According to Stebner, the evidence proving he was prejudiced are the allegations in Juror Strukel\u2019s affidavit and that six jurors voted in favor of him on the first day of deliberations and then, the next morning, voted eleven to one in favor of Alside \u201cwithout further deliberation other than a report on the Juror\u2019s independent research.\u201d Stebner contends that this evidence proves he was prejudiced by the juror\u2019s internet research and the jurors\u2019 discussions outside the courthouse. Stebner argues that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b614 Alside contends that because internal influences of a jury cannot be used to impeach a jury verdict under M. R. Evid. 606(b), Juror Schneider\u2019s comment regarding her internet research cannot be considered. Alside argues that the information was internal, as opposed to external, because no hardcopy was brought into the jury room, because Juror Schneider based her comments on her own subjective understanding of the term \u201cpreponderance,\u201d and because Juror Schneider\u2019s internet definition matched the court\u2019s jury instruction. Alternatively, Alside argues that Stebner has failed to show he was prejudiced by both instances of the alleged juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b615 M. R. Civ. P. 59(a) allows the court to grant a new trial on \u201call or part of the issues for any of the reasons provided by the statutes of the state of Montana.\u201d Section 25-11-102(2), MCA, provides that a new trial may be granted for misconduct of the jury. Not every act of jury misconduct mandates a new trial. The alleged jury misconduct must affect a material matter that is in dispute and must prejudice the complaining party sufficiently enough to render the jury\u2019s verdict manifestly unjust. <em>Erickson, </em>175 Mont. at 91, 572 P.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u00b616 Juror misconduct may be proven by the affidavit of any one of the jurors. Section 25-11-102(2), MCA. M. R. Evid. 606(b) governs the use of juror testimony and affidavits to inquire into the validity of a jury verdict and generally prohibits juror affidavits from being used if they concern any matter or statement made during deliberations. In other words, juror affidavits may not be used to impeach the verdict based upon internal influences on the jury. <em>Harry v. Elderkin, </em>196 Mont. 1, 8, 637 P.2d 809, 813 (1981). \u201cJurors are expected to bring to the courtroom their own knowledge and experience to aid in their resolution of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Kelman, </em>276 Mont. 253, 262, 915 P.2d 854, 860 (1996). Some examples of internal influences are: a juror commenting to the other jurors about one of the plaintiffs witnesses, <em>McGillen v Plum Creek Timber Co., </em>1998 MT 193, \u00b6 16, 290 Mont. 264, 964 P.2d 18; a juror\u2019s comment that she knew the defendant owned a strip bar with a bad reputation, <em>Kelman, </em>276 Mont, at 261, 915 P.2d at 859; and a juror\u2019s report to the other jurors about observations he made while on a lunch break, <em>Williams Feed, Inc. v. Dept. of Transp., </em>2007 MT 79, \u00b6 25, 336 Mont. 493, 155 P.3d 1228, <em>overruled on other grounds, Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, 338 Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134. In all of these cases, we held that the influence on the jury was internal, thus, the juror\u2019s affidavit could not be used to impeach the jury verdict. <em>Williams Feed, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>McGillen, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Kelman, </em>276 Mont, at 262-63, 915 P.2d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b617 However, a juror affidavit may be used to impeach the verdict if it involves any matter concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention. M. R. Evid. 606(b). Where extraneous prejudicial information is brought to the jury\u2019s attention, \u201cjuror affidavits can be the basis for overturning the judgment if either party was thereby deprived of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Harry, </em>196 Mont. at 8, 637 P.2d at 813. A rebuttable presumption of prejudice exists when jury misconduct stems from extraneous influence; however, the presumption is not absolute and the misconduct must show a \u201cnatural tendency\u201d to prejudice. <em>Allers, </em>273 Mont. at 8, 901 P.2d at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b618 In <em>Alters, </em>a bailiff brought a dictionary into the jury room at a juror\u2019s request. The dictionary definition of \u201cproximate cause\u201d differed from the court\u2019s jury instruction in that it did not include the element of foreseeability. <em>Allers, </em>273 Mont, at 2-3, 901 P.2d at 601. We said that because \u201cthe jury used extraneous materials-two dictionaries-to redefine a critical element of this negligence case... Riley\u2019s substantial rights were compromised along with his constitutional right to a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>trial.\u201d <em>Alters, </em>273 Mont, at 8, 901 P.2d at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">\u00b619 In <em>Brockie v. Omo Constr., </em>255 Mont. 495, 500, 844 P.2d 61, 61 (1992), the jury foreperson went to the library and conducted research on a theory of physics in hopes of clarifying an expert\u2019s testimony. While the foreperson\u2019s affidavit stated he did not mention his research during deliberations, two other juror affidavits stated that he did mention his research to the other jurors. <em>Id. </em>We held that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Brockie\u2019s motion for a new trial because the foreperson\u2019s actions constituted misconduct that prejudiced Brockie. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b620 Here, Juror Schneider\u2019s actions are more like the jurors\u2019 actions in <em>Allers </em>and <em>Brockie', </em>thus, we conclude that her internet research constituted an external influence. Because her affidavit concerns whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to a jury\u2019s attention, we may use her affidavit to determine if the jury\u2019s verdict should be impeached. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 606(b). Keeping in mind the presumption of prejudice that arises when juror misconduct stems from an external influence, we must now determine whether Stebner was prejudiced sufficiently enough to render the jury\u2019s verdict manifestly unjust. <em>See Erickson, </em>175 Mont. at 91, 572 P.2d at 520. \u00b621 We agree with Alside that Stebner was not prejudiced by Juror Schneider\u2019s comment regarding her research and subsequent understanding of the term \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The comment did not affect the verdict because the jurors had already voted eleven to one in favor of Alside when the comment was made. Also, two jurors testified that they based their vote on the evidence, not on Juror Schneider\u2019s comment. Three jurors testified that they based their vote on the evidence presented at trial. Moreover, no new information was presented on the definition of \u201cpreponderance.\u201d <em>See Erickson, </em>175 Mont. at 92, 572 P.2d at 520 (holding no prejudice occurred because no new information was presented on the material matter in dispute). According to the affidavits, the internet definition matched the jury instruction. The presumption of prejudice is rebutted by the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b622  In addition, Stebner was not prejudiced by the extraneous juror discussions. Without passing judgment on the truthfulness of Juror Strukel\u2019s testimony regarding jurors discussing the case outside of the courthouse, we must consider that three other jurors contradicted her testimony. Nothing in the affidavits show that any juror\u2019s vote was influenced by anything other than the evidence presented at trial. Stebner fails to show how the jurors\u2019 discussions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>prejudiced him. That some jurors changed their minds overnight is not, by itself, evidence of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b623  The District Court concluded that the alleged juror misconduct did not prejudice Stebner sufficiently enough to render the jury\u2019s verdict manifestly unjust to warrant the granting of a new trial, and we give considerable weight to the District Court\u2019s determination. The District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it denied Stebner\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b624 While we hold that Stebner was not prejudiced by the juror conducting internet research in this case, we recognize that this issue is an emerging and increasing problem that we need to make every effort to thwart. Therefore, we encourage district courts to include and emphasize a prohibition on internet research in their cautionary instructions to the jury if they have not already done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b625 The District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it denied Stebner\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> Stebner extensively discusses Rule 59(g), motion to alter or amend a judgment, and the supporting precedent in his briefs in the District Court and this Court. However, his motion in the District Court was for a new trial, which is governed by Rule 59(a), and not a motion to amend the judgment. We therefore decline to address Stebner\u2019s arguments regarding Rule 59(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
