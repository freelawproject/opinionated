(Boyne), concluding that Lone Moose Meadows, LLC and Lone Moose Meadows Condominiums Unit Owners\u2019 Association, Inc. (collectively referred to as \u201cLone Moose\u201d) were obligated under the terms of a \u201cLift Operations Agreement\u201d to pay Boyne for depreciation payments beginning in the 2002-2003 ski season. Lone Moose appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b62 Boyne operates Big Sky Ski Resort. Lone Moose is a privately-owned residential development on the eastern boundary of the resort. Lone Moose constructed the Lone Moose ski lift to provide ski access from its condominiums to Big Sky\u2019s ski area. In 1999, Boyne and Lone Moose entered into a \u201cLift Operations Agreement\u201d in which Boyne agreed to operate the Lone Moose ski lift and Lone Moose agreed to pay Boyne to operate the lift. Section 1(a) of the agreement discusses the terms of payment. It states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">The method of determining the amount due m [sic] shall be in accordance with the cost outline attached as Exhibit D and incorporated by reference. The amount of such payment is $78,250 for the 1999-2000 ski season. This amount does not include any amount for depreciation. [Lone Moose] shall not be required to pay any depreciation dollar component of the operating expenses until the 2002-2003 ski season.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Exhibit D, titled \u201cLone Moose Lift Expenses,\u201d listed the expenses as:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The contract stated that \u201c[Replacement lifts will be constructed and owned by Boyne.\u201d The contract also provided that if any dispute arose under the contract, the prevailing party would be entitled to reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b63 In December 2002, Boyne gave Lone Moose a Notice of Lift Operation Expenses for the 2002-2003 ski season. The Notice stated that Lone Moose was required to pay the depreciation operating expense set forth in Exhibit D. Lone Moose refused to pay the depreciation dollar component of the operating expenses. For the next several years, the parties attempted to resolve the handling of the depreciation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b64 Boyne filed its complaint in February 2008 for breach of contract because Lone Moose had not made any depreciation payments. Lone Moose moved for summary judgment, contending the contract had unambiguously stated that Lone Moose was not obligated to reimburse Boyne for depreciation on a lift it did not own. Boyne responded and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the contract had unambiguously established Lone Moose\u2019s obligation to make annual depreciation expense payments of $50,000 beginning with the 2002-2003 ski season, and Lone Moose had breached the contract by failing to make payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b65 In May 2009, the District Court held a hearing on the summary judgment motions. Noting that the sole issue was the determination of when Lone Moose must start paying $50,000 annually for depreciation, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">What I parse out when I read [Section 1(a)] is that these are, in essence, two negatives. One is \u201cnot required,\u201d and the second is \u201cuntil.\u201d Two negatives, as we are advised by mathematical calculation, reads positive. It reads then, as I interpret it, [Lone Moose] shall start paying in 2002-2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Ruling from the bench, the District Court granted Boyne\u2019s summary judgment motion and denied Lone Moose\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">\u00b66 On appeal, both parties reiterate their arguments from the District Court. Both parties agree that the facts are not disputed and the contract is unambiguous, but disagree about what event triggers payment of the depreciation dollar component of Section 1(a). Boyne asserts that depreciation payments should have begun in the 2002-2003 ski season. Lone Moose asserts that depreciation payments are not due until Boyne owns the lift. Lone Moose also contends on appeal that no proper judgment was entered because the court did not give a specific dollar amount and, as a result, the matter should be remanded to the District Court to determine the specific amount of the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>In its response, Boyne requests its attorney fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">\u00b67 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">\u00b68 Issue 1: Did the District Court err when it determined that the contract required Lone Moose to pay Boyne for \u201cdepreciation\u201d beginning with the 2002-2003 ski season?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b69 Issue 2: Was a money judgment ever properly entered against Lone Moose when the District Court failed to specify the amount of the judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b610 Issue 3: Is Boyne entitled to its attorney fees incurred on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"A7M\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b611 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, employing the same standards utilized by the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>PPL Mont., LLC v. State, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 84, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421. Because we review a grant of summary judgment de novo, we need not defer to the judgments and decisions of the district court. <em>PPL Mont., </em>\u00b6 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\u00b612 <em>Issue 1: Did the District Court err when determined that the contract required Lone Moose to pay Boyne for \u201cdepreciation\u201d beginning with the 2002-2003 ski season </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u00b613 Lone Moose argues that \u201cdepreciation\u201d should be applied under its technical tax definition-meaning that depreciation is only available to a taxpayer who has suffered an economic loss and erosion in the value of its own property-and because Boyne does not own the lift, it is not entitled to payments for depreciation. Lone Moose asserts that the contract\u2019s language that it \u201cshall not be required to pay <em>any </em>depreciation dollar component of the operating expenses until the 2002-2003 ski season\u201d means that, if Boyne had to replace the lift before the 2002-2003 ski season and the value of the lift depreciated, Lone Moose would not have to pay Boyne for depreciation until the 2002-2003 ski season. (Emphasis added.) That is, Lone Moose would have to pay Boyne for depreciation only after the 2002-2003 ski season and only if Boyne had replaced the lift and owned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\u00b614 \u201cWhere the language of an agreement is clear and unambiguous and, as a result, susceptible to only one interpretation, the duty of the court is to apply the language as written.\u201d <em>Carelli v. Hall, </em>279 Mont. 202, 209, 926 P.2d 756, 761 (1996). If the terms of the contract are clear, \u201cthere is nothing for the courts to interpret or construe and the court must determine the intent of the parties from the wording of the contract alone.\u201d <em>Doble v. Bernhard, </em>1998 MT 124, \u00b6 19, 289 Mont. 80, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>959 P.2d 488 (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 28-3-303, MCA. Because we concur with the parties that the contract is unambiguous, our task is to determine the intent of the parties from the wording of the contract as to whether depreciation payments were triggered in the 2002-2003 ski season regardless of whether Boyne owned the lift at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b615 We reject Lone Moose\u2019s contention that depreciation should be applied as a technical term under its tax definition. If the parties intended the term \u201cdepreciation\u201d to have a specific definition, the definition should have been included in the contract. Further, we are not convinced by Lone Moose\u2019s contention that no legal basis exists for Boyne to receive depreciation payments because it did not own the lift. The legal basis arises from the contract that Lone Moose signed agreeing to make payments for depreciation beginning in the 2002-2003 ski season.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b616 Boyne asserts that because the lift began depreciating the day it was put into use, the depreciation payments were to offset the wear and tear on the lift and to facilitate Boyne\u2019s ability to construct a replacement lift when needed. However, the reasons why the parties agreed that Lone Moose would make \u201cdepreciation\u201d payments are irrelevant. The contract is unambiguous. Thus, we simply ascertain and declare the terms of the contract. <em>Deschamps v. Treasure State Trailer Court, </em>2010 MT 74, \u00b6 28, 356 Mont. 1, 230 P.3d 800 (citing \u00a7 1-4-101, MCA). The wording of the contract shows that the parties agreed Lone Moose would make $50,000 annual payments, which the parties agreed to call \u201cdepreciation.\u201d Lone Moose was \u201cnot required\u201d to make these payments \u201cuntil the 2002-2003 ski season.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b617  Moreover, if we adopted Lone Moose\u2019s argument that the depreciation payment was not due until Boyne replaced the lift, we would have to insert language into the contract that is not present. Our job is to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in the contract, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. <em>Deschamps, </em>\u00b6 28. The District Court did not err when it concluded that Lone Moose was obligated under the contract to pay $50,000 annually in depreciation beginning in the 2002-2003 ski season.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b618 <em>Issue 2: Was a money judgment ever properly entered against Lone Moose when the District Court failed to specify the amount of the judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b619 Lone Moose argues that no judgment was entered into the docket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>by the Clerk of Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It asserts that the District Court\u2019s judgment from the bench was improper because it did not include a specific dollar amount, as is required by \u00a7 25-9-203, MCA, which provides that judgments must be computed and stated as near as may be in dollars and cents. Lone Moose states that the purpose of this statute is so the \u201cparties are certain of the final and accurate amount of the judgment.\u201d It points out that while it has stipulated to the dollar amount of prejudgment interest and attorney fees, the amount outstanding on the contract has not been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">\u00b620 In its ruling in May, the District Court clarified that the depreciation payments were to be made annually and for $50,000. The parties did not dispute this. The court then stated, \u201c[the contract] reads then, as I interpret it, [Lone Moose] shall start paying in 2002-2003.\u201d After the hearing, the parties stipulated to the amount of attorney fees and prejudgment interest based on a $350,000judgment. Boyne, concerned about Lone Moose\u2019s unwillingness to pay the judgment, filed for partial summary judgment on the request for attorney fees and prejudgment interest. Lone Moose opposed this motion, acknowledging that the matter had already been settled by the stipulation. The District Court, in an attempt to clarify the confusing procedural posture of the case at this point, entered an order confirming the amount of prejudgment interest and attorney fees. The court also ordered that the judgment was final unless Lone Moose requested a hearing before September 18, 2009. Lone Moose did not request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b621 The District Court stated that Lone Moose must pay Boyne $50,000 annually beginning in the 2002-2003 ski season. Lone Moose knew the specific amount owed under the contract when it calculated the prejudgment interest for the stipulation and failed to raise its objection regarding the entry of a specific money judgment at that time and for the next five months. We will not put a district court in error for a procedure in which the appellant acquiesced or participated, or to which the appellant made no objection. <em>Garrison v. Averill, </em>282 Mont. 508, 514, 938 P.2d 702, 706 (1997); <em>see also State v. Burke, </em>2005 MT 250, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 1, 122 P.3d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b622 <em>Issue 3: Is Boyne entitled to its attorney fees incurred on appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00b623 Boyne requests an award of its reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal because the agreement included a provision awarding attorney fees for disputes arising from the contract. Lone Moose responds that Boyne\u2019s request is improper because it did not cross-appeal the issue and, regardless, the matter has already been resolved by stipulation. We disagree. Because our case law regarding the award of attorney fees incurred on appeal is somewhat inconsistent, we take this opportunity to clarify the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b624 We have previously recognized the confusion between two lines of cases regarding the award of appellate attorney fees. <em>See R.C. Hobbs Enter., LLC v. J.G.L. Distrbg., Inc., </em>2004 MT 396, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50, 325 Mont. 277, 104 P.3d 503. On one hand, we have occasionally examined whether it was clear from the language in a contractual provision whether the parties \u201cobviously contemplated\u201d awarding attorney fees on appeal. <em>Transaction Network v. Wellington Techs., </em>2000 MT 223, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 301 Mont. 212, 7 P.3d 409; <em>Majers v. Shining Mountains, </em>230 Mont. 373, 381, 750 P.2d 449, 454 (1988); <em>Hoven v. Amrine, </em>224 Mont. 15, 18-19, 727 P.2d 533, 535 <em>(1986); Diehl &amp; Assocs. v. Houtchens, </em>180 Mont. 48, 53, 588 P.2d 1014, 1017 (1979). Most recently, in <em>Peschel Family Trust v. Colonna, </em>2003 MT 216, \u00b6 45, 317 Mont. 127, 75 P.3d 793, we went so far as to state that \u201c[a]n award of fees on appeal is not automatic.\u201d We said that awarding attorney fees \u201carising out of a contract dispute are only appropriate when the contract contemplated that attorney\u2019s fees would be charged by the prevailing party on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b625 However, more often than not, we have awarded appellate attorney fees without discussing whether the contractual provision obviously contemplated awarding attorney fees on appeal. <em>E.g. Eschenbacher v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 206, \u00b6 51, 306 Mont. 321, 34 P.3d 87; <em>Quigley v. Acker, </em>1998 MT 72, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 288 Mont. 190, 955 P.2d 1377; <em>Chamberlin v. Puckett Constr., </em>277 Mont. 198, 210, 921 P.2d 1237, 1244 (1996); <em>Wise v. Sebena, </em>248 Mont. 32,40, 808 P.2d 494, 499 (1991); <em>Smith v. Johnson, </em>245 Mont. 137, 145, 798 P.2d 106, 111 (1990); <em>Lauderdale v. Grauman, </em>223 Mont. 357, 359, 725 P.2d 1199, 1200 (1986); <em>In re Marriage of Bolstad, </em>203 Mont. 131, 135, 660 P.2d 95, 97 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b626  Today we clarify that if a contract includes a provision stating that a prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney fees arising from litigation under the contract, appellate attorney fees are included under the provision. An appeal is simply another step in litigation and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>as such, it is presumed that the contracting parties contemplate that an award of attorney fees would include fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">\u00b627 Thus, because the contract between Boyne and Lone Moose provided, \u201c[i]f any dispute arises under this Agreement the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d Boyne is entitled to its reasonable attorney fees incurred on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b628 The District Court correctly concluded that the contract obligated Lone Moose to pay Boyne $50,000 annually beginning in the 2002-2003 ski season. We remand to the District Court to determine and award Boyne\u2019s appellate attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b629 Affirmed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-6\"> We note that the record contains a notice of entry of judgment from October 2008, stating judgment was entered on May 11,2009, for the ruling from the summary judgment hearing, and on August 31,2009, when the court entered its order regarding prejudgment interest and attorney fees.

The Court \u201crejects Lone Moose\u2019s contention that depreciation should be applied as a technical term under its tax definition.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. There is, however, nothing technical about Lone Moose\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cdepreciation.\u201d Even though we can assume that both these parties are familiar with the nuances of tax law, we need not turn to some arcane tax code to comprehend the meaning of the word \u201cdepreciation.\u201d As defined in the <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>502 (3rd Ed. Houghton Mifflin Co. 1992), it simply means \u201ca decrease or loss on value, as because of age, wear or market conditions. An allowance made for a loss in value of property.\u201d The issue is whether it is reasonable or logical to interpret a contract in such a way that party A is deemed to have agreed to pay party B depreciation on property that party A owns.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">\u00b631 The Court reasons that \u201c[t]he parties agreed that Lone Moose would make $50,000 annual payments, which the parties agreed to call \u2018depreciation.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. \u201cIf the parties intended the term \u2018depreciation\u2019 to have a specific definition, the definition should have been included in the contract.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. Although the Court tells us what depreciation is not, it fails to give us a positive and unambiguous definition of what it is. Apparently it is a meaningless label the parties arbitrarily chose to use. They could just as easily have called it \u201clandscaping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">\u00b632 One has to assume that since the labeling under the contract has no intrinsic meaning, other aspects of Exhibit D (Lone Moose Lift Expenses) would be subject to the same \u201cmere label\u201d treatment. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>example, the list of expenses includes 2.5 operator days for 130 days at 9 hours a day. If the ski season were cut short at 120 days by an early spring, the Court\u2019s approach would dictate that Lone Moose would still have to pay the agreed upon 130/day figure of $35,100. The fact that the actual expense was only for 120 days would be of no consequence since the 130/day description was merely a label that they agreed upon. All that matters is that one party, using one rubric or another, agreed to pay a sum of money to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b633 I disagree. Depreciation is not a meaningless label. It has a commonly accepted meaning and that meaning is not consistent with requiring Lone Moose to pay depreciation money to an entity which does not own the asset in question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-5\">JUSTICE MORRIS joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
