John also appeals the District Court\u2019s award of rent and attorneys fees to Amber. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that John forfeited his right to use the dealership property by violating anti-assignment clauses contained in the parties\u2019 settlement agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in requiring John to pay rent to Amber for using her property after the date of the alleged transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"A7z\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in determining that John should pay Amber monthly rent of $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in awarding Amber attorneys fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">\u00b67 Amber and John married in Dillon, Montana, in 1964. In 2001 Amber petitioned to dissolve the marriage. The dissolution, Amber testified, was acrimonious. In 2003 the District Court dissolved the marriage. The decree of dissolution incorporated two settlement agreements, which divided the parties\u2019 property and debts. Amber, believing John to be in violation of the settlement agreements, initiated the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">\u00b68 In 1983 John started an automobile dealership, Country Ford Inc. (\u201cCountry Ford\u201d or \u201cdealership\u201d), in Plains, Montana. John at all relevant times has owned all shares of Country Ford. The dealership consisted of new- and used-car sales departments and a repair shop. John and Amber jointly owned the land and building where Country Ford is located (dealership property). When they divorced, John was awarded the dealership, and Amber received the dealership property. This arrangement is the center of the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">\u00b69 In July 2002 the parties signed their initial settlement agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(Settlement Agreement), which allocated the dealership property to Amber</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">subject to husband[\u2019]s right to possession and use of this property as a Ford dealership (continuation of existing operation) for a maximum of 5 years. Husband[\u2019]s use right shall require husband to keep the improvements and fixtures and property in good repair, normal wear and tear excepted and capital improvements excepted. Husband shall pay all taxes, SIDS or other assessments during his period of use. Husband shall pay all costs of insurance (at current levels). Should husband sell, assign, transfer or otherwise divest himself of his dealership his use right shall terminate without compensation or abatement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The Settlement Agreement allocated the dealership to John. The Settlement Agreement contains a provision for attorney\u2019s fees: \u201cShould either party be required to enforce the terms of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to his or her attorney[\u2019]s fees and costs incurred in such enforcement action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b610 Apparently dissatisfied with the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to an addendum (Addendum) a year later. The Addendum dealt mainly with the dealership and the dealership property. It reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">On page 3 of the Settlement Agreement, it was agreed that husband would be entitled to possession and use of the property as a Ford dealership for a maximum of five (5) years. The parties have agreed to modify this understanding and provide husband and his company, Country Ford, Inc., with the right to possess and use the property, rent free, through the 24th day of July, 2008. No rent or other consideration is to be paid to wife or her assignee or successor in interest for husband\u2019s possession or use except as provided herein. Such lease relationship is subject to the following terms:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Any additional terms set forth in the original Settlement Agreement dated July 24, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">The commitment set forth herein is non-assignable and personal to husband. If husband sells his interest in Country Ford, Inc., in whole or in part, or if he sells all of the assets of Country Ford, Inc., or otherwise ceases to continue the existing businesses, the operation of the Ford dealership and the used car dealership, the lease relationship shall immediately terminate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The Addendum also provided for attorney\u2019s fees: \u201cTo the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the wife finds it necessary to retain an attorney to assist her in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of the agreement (lease), then husband agrees to reimburse wife for said attorney\u2019s fees at the hourly rate of $175.00 per hour.\u201d The present question is whether John violated the anti-assignment clauses of the Settlement Agreement and Addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b611 Prompted by a series of events occurring in early 2006, Amber moved the District Court to order John to remove Country Ford from her property for violating the anti-assignment provisions of the Settlement Agreement and Addendum (collectively, \u201csettlement agreements\u201d). The standing master assigned to the case held a hearing in October 2007, and the parties and witnesses presented testimony. While only a partial transcript of this hearing (which includes none of the exhibits admitted) has been presented to this Court, the dispositive facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b612 In November 2005 John and Wade Rehbein (Wade) began discussing the possibility of Wade\u2019s purchasing Country Ford. Wade owned Outback Automotive Company (Outback Automotive), an automobile repair business in Plains. Upon John\u2019s suggestion, Wade asked Amber about leasing or purchasing the property. Amber allowed Wade to inspect the dealership building. Amber consulted other renters in Plains to determine an appropriate rent. She offered to rent the property to Wade for $3,300 per month, then lowered the offer to $2,500. Since Wade stated that he could only afford $1,000 per month, they did not reach a rental agreement. Wade then offered to buy the dealership property, but he and Amber again failed to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b613 In March 2006 Wade contacted Ford Motor Company (Ford) about acquiring the Country Ford franchise. He was advised that Ford required applicants to have two years of experience as a general manager. Wade could not meet this prerequisite. Undeterred by these setbacks, Wade hired an attorney to draft an asset purchase agreement (Asset Purchase Agreement). Under this agreement, Wade would buy the dealership for approximately $180,000, and the sale would close in July 2008 (conveniently, the same date that John\u2019s rent-free lease with Amber would end).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b614 In the meantime, Wade would work as the general manager of Country Ford, gaining the experience necessary to acquire the franchise from Ford. The Asset Purchase Agreement provided that Wade would move the employees and equipment of Outback Automotive into the Country Ford building, leasing both to Country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Ford in exchange for one-hundred percent of Country Ford\u2019s profits. The sale was to be contingent on various conditions, including that Wade acquire the franchise from Ford and that Wade, as general manager of the dealership, not be fired by John. Though the agreement was originally dated May 2006, Wade and John did not sign the agreement until over a year later, after the current proceedings began.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b615 Coincidentally, in the spring of 2006 the mechanics who worked in the repair shop at Country Ford quit. Shortly thereafter Outback Automotive moved into the dealership building. Wade financed a number of modifications of and improvements to the dealership building to accommodate his mechanics and equipment. In June 2006 Country Ford hired Wade to serve as the general manager of the dealership. As general manager, Wade earned a monthly salary of $4,500 and received one-hundred percent of Country Ford\u2019s profits. Wade would work twelve-hour days at the dealership, overseeing day-to-day operations. John decreased his time there to only a few hours each week. Wade also paid John $40,000 for what he and John described as an earnest money down payment towards the purchase of Country Ford. Still, John remained the sole stockholder in Country Ford, at no time transferring stock to Wade. At the hearing, both John and Wade testified that Wade was only the general manager of Country Ford, not an owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b616 Following the hearing, the standing master issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and an order. The standing master concluded, \u201cBy transferring control, management and profits of Country Ford Inc., to Wade, John sold, transferred or assigned his interest in the Country Ford, Inc., to Wade within the meaning of the Settlement Agreement and Addendum as of June 19, 2006.\u201d Consequently, the standing master reasoned, John\u2019s right to use the property terminated. The standing master ordered John to pay Amber rent of $2,500 per month from June 19, 2006, through July 24, 2008. Finally, pursuant to the settlement agreements, the standing master awarded Amber attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The District Court adopted the standing master\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b617 John appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b618 The District Court\u2019s order adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the standing master. We review findings of fact for clear error. <em>Leichtfuss v. Dabney, </em>2005 MT 271, \u00b6 20, 329 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>129, 122 P.3d 1220. Under this deferential standard of review, we will reverse a district court if its findings of fact are not based on substantial evidence, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Interstate Prod. Credit Assn. of Great Falls v. DeSaye, </em>250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287 (1991)). We review conclusions of law de novo, according no deference to the district court. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. We will uphold a district court\u2019s decision that reaches the correct result, though for the wrong reason. <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Talmage, </em>2007 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 336 Mont. 125, 152 P.3d 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b619 We generally review awards of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6 42, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230. However, when contractual language requires an award of attorney\u2019s fees and the contract is conscionable, a district court lacks discretion to deny attorney\u2019s fees. <em>In re Marriage of Caras, </em>263 Mont. 377, 385, 868 P.2d 615, 620 (1994). We review a district court\u2019s construction and interpretation of a contract de novo. <em>Kruer v. Three Creeks Ranch of Wyo., L.L.C., </em>2008 MT 315, \u00b6 37, 346 Mont. 66, 194 P.3d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b620 <em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred in concluding that John forfeited his right to use the dealership property by violating anti-assignment clauses contained in the parties\u2019 settlement agreements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b621 The District Court determined that John and Wade\u2019s business relationship was too \u201cconvenient\u201d-so convenient that it violated the anti-assignment provisions of the settlement agreements. John contends that since he retained all the dealership stock and that the dealership sale was not scheduled to close until 2008, the District Court\u2019s conclusion was in error. We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b622 The business relationship between John and Wade likely established a partnership in fact. <em>See MacArthur Co. v. Stein, </em>282 Mont. 85, 88-92, 934 P.2d 214, 216-19 (1997) (presenting and applying test to determine whether a partnership formed). The evidence may also be sufficient to establish Wade as a shareholder of Country Ford, even though he did not formally purchase stock. <em>See Bump v. Stewart, Wimer &amp; Bump, P.C., </em>336 N.W.2d 731, 735-36 (Iowa 1983) (finding third parties to be shareholders in professional corporation even though they were not formally issued stock); <em>cf. Hanson Sheep Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Farmers &amp; Traders\u2019 St. Bank, </em>53 Mont. 324, 338-39,163 P. 1151, 1155 (1917) (looking past ownership of stock to find third party\u2019s \u201cposition as stockholder was only nominal\u201d). Neither the parties nor the District Court attempted to complete this portion of the John-Wade-business-relationship jigsaw puzzle. Nevertheless, the language of the settlement agreements is sufficient to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b623 Construction and interpretation of the settlement agreements is a question of law. <em>Edwards v. Cascade Co. Sheriffs Dept., </em>2009 MT 451, \u00b6 38, 354 Mont. 307, 223 P.3d 893. The Settlement Agreement allocated the dealership property to Amber, but allowed John to use it to run the dealership for five years, a right which would terminate should John \u201csell, assign, transfer or otherwise divest himself of his dealership.\u201d The Addendum clarified this relationship by granting John a rent-free lease of the dealership property until July 24, 2008, to run the dealership. Again this right to use the dealership property was subject to an anti-assignment provision that would terminate the lease if John \u201csells his interest in Country Ford, Inc., in whole or part, ... or otherwise ceases to continue the existing businesses.\u201d The lease in the Addendum remained subject to the \u201cadditional terms set forth in the original Settlement Agreement.\u201d The apparent purpose of these provisions was to allow John to operate the dealership to earn his livelihood, but allow Amber to use the property for her own advantage (through rent or sale) if John ceased operating the businesses. This purpose is reflected in the catchall phrases in the Settlement Agreement (\u201cor otherwise divest himself of his dealership\u201d) and in the Addendum (\u201cor otherwise ceases to continue the existing businesses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AdO\">\u00b624  Here, the District Court did not err in concluding that John\u2019s right to use the dealership property terminated. While the District Court focused on the \u201csell, assign, [or] transfer\u201d language from the Settlement Agreement, we conclude that the clause \u201cotherwise ceases to continue the existing businesses\u201d from the Addendum is dispositive. The intention of the settlement agreements was to allow John, personally, to earn profits from the dealership without having to pay rent to Amber. John did not formally sell shares in the dealership to Wade. However, John transferred his right to use the dealership property rent-free to Wade. John \u201cotherwise cease[d] to continue the existing businesses\u201d by allowing Wade to assume management and control of the dealership, receive all profits from the dealership, move his repair business (Outback Automotive) onto the dealership property, and finance modifications to the dealership building. Effectively, John used his free-rent arrangement from the settlement agreements as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>bargaining chip to negotiate the sale to Wade. Assuming that $2,500 was a reasonable monthly rent for use of the dealership, Wade stood to save $60,000, not an insignificant sum, by taking over the remaining period of John\u2019s rent-free lease of the dealership property. However, because John\u2019s right to use the property without paying rent was personal to him, he could not transfer it to Wade. By doing so, John forfeited his right to use the dealership property.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b625 John argues that he did not transfer any interest in the dealership to Wade because he did not sell him any stock in Country Ford. This argument is an attempt to elevate form over substance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-3-219, MCA (\u201cThe law respects form less than substance.\u201d). Further, because we conclude that operation of the dealership is the dispositive issue, whether John formally transferred his stock in Country Ford to Wade is immaterial. For these same reasons, John\u2019s arguments that he did not transfer his interest in the dealership because of the Asset Purchase Agreement and because of Wade\u2019s inability to meet statutory requirements are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b626 John also argues that the District Court erred by concluding generally that he \u201csold, transferred or assigned his interest\u201d in Country Ford. Citing <em>Ballenger v. Tillman, </em>133 Mont. 369, 324 P.2d 1045 (1958), John asserts that the District Court should have specified whether he sold or transferred or assigned his interest in the dealership. Because we conclude that John forfeited his right to use the dealership property by ceasing to personally operate Country Ford, we need not address this argument. Even assuming that the District Court erroneously concluded that John transferred an interest in Country Ford, it still reached the correct result (that John forfeited his use right). <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Talmage, </em>2007 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 336 Mont. 125, 152 P.3d 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b627 <em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred in requiring John to pay rent to Amber for using her property after the date of the alleged transfer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b628 John next argues that the District Court erred in requiring him to pay rent to Amber from June 2006 through July 2008. John argues that if he transferred his interest in the dealership, he should not be liable for the dealership\u2019s rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b629 John\u2019s argument misstates the District Court\u2019s conclusion. The District Court did not conclude that John had transferred all of his interest in Country Ford. Furthermore, the testimony presented indicated that John retained some vestigial interest in the dealership: he retained nominal ownership of stock and, ostensibly, the ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>fire Wade.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b630  Here, John\u2019s actions violated the settlement agreements. For such breach of contract, the appropriate remedy is damages in an amount \u201cwhich will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby.\u201d Section 27-1-311, MCA. John\u2019s breach of the settlement agreements prevented Amber from earning a reasonable rent for the use of the dealership property. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in requiring John to pay Amber rent for using the dealership property after June 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b631 <em>Issue 3: Whether the District Court erred in determining that John should pay Amber monthly rent of $2,500.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b632 Next, John contends that the District Court factually erred in finding that $2,500 was a reasonable rental value. John asserts that this finding was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b633  At the hearing, Amber presented uncontradicted testimony that she consulted various renters in Plains to determine the rental value of the dealership. She testified that the monthly market rental value of the dealership would be $4,000 and that she originally offered to rent the dealership to Wade for $3,300 per month. Eventually, she offered to rent the dealership to Wade for $2,500 per month, but Wade refused. John presented no similar estimate of the rental value of the dealership. Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the District Court\u2019s finding that $2,500 was a reasonable monthly rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b634 <em>Issue 4: Whether the District Court erred in awarding Amber attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u00b635 Finally, John argues conditionally that pursuant to the settlement agreements and \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, Amber should not be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees unless she prevails in all aspects of her case. Because Amber has prevailed in all aspects of her case, an award of attorney\u2019s fees is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-11\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
