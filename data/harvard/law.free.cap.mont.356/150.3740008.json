We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the State\u2019s counsel and a State witness impermissibly vouch for the complaining witness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court properly instruct the jury on the definition of without consent in the context of the sexual intercourse without consent charge?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Thorp\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court impose a sentence on Thorp that amounted to cruel and unusual punishment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">\u00b67 The State of Montana (State) filed an information on January 24, 2008, charging Thorp with sexual intercourse without consent and incest. The State\u2019s affidavit alleged that Thorp had raped M.A., his fifteen year old niece, on January 23, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">\u00b68 Dawn Thorp, M.A.\u2019s mother, reported the incident to the Miles City Police Department on December 26,2007. M.A. told Deputy Dave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Power of the Custer County Sheriffs Office that Thorp had taken her to Pirogue Island in the Yellowstone River. M.A. related to Deputy 1 Power that Thorp had a hobby of making dream catchers. Thorp had persuaded M.A. to drive him to Pirogue Island so that he could look for sticks to make the dream catchers.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b69 Thorp and M.A. initially looked for sticks on Pirogue Island. Soon after arriving, however, Thorp pushed M.A. to the ground. He removed her pants and underpants, and forcibly penetrated her vagina with his penis. M.A. ran away after the incident and hid from Thorp for an unknown amount of time. M.A. eventually returned to the car where Thorp was waiting for a ride back to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b610 Dawn Thorp applied for an order of protection against Thorp immediately after M.A. had revealed to Deputy Power what had happened on Pirogue Island. Dawn contacted Deputy Power again a few days later after she had received a phone call from her brother Dean Thorp. Dean told Dawn that he had received text messages from Thorp regarding the incident with M.A. Deputy Power contacted Dean and viewed the text messages on Dean\u2019s phone. Deputy Power obtained numerous text messages sent by Thorp. The text messages contained admissions regarding Thorp having had sexual contact with M.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b611 The State admitted the text messages between Dean and Thorp as exhibits during trial. Thorp had texted statements to Dean such as \u201cshe initiated everything that ever happened. The only thing I am guilty of is not stopping her. Bad judgment.\u201d Dean responded to Thorp in one message, asking \u201cwho was the adult?\u201d Thorp responded, \u201call right. Then I\u2019m guilty. Well, then I guess there is only one thing left to do and that is time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b612 Sara Hucking (Hucking), M.A.\u2019s close friend, testified at trial. Hucking testified that M.A. did not tell anyone about the incident because she worried that her family would not believe her. Hucking testified that M.A. had become withdrawn and quiet after the attack. Hucking was certain something had happened to M.A. Hucking pressed M.A. until M.A. confided that Thorp had raped her. Hucking testified, however, that the rape had occurred at Dawn\u2019s house during the summer of 2006, just two or three days before M.A. had confided in Hucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b613 Hucking testified further that she kept M.A.\u2019s secret until December 2007, when she decided to tell Mary Battin (Battin). Battin was a long-time friend of Dawn Thorp. Battin asked Hucking about M.A.\u2019s odd behavior. Hucking told Battin that Thorp had raped M.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Battin, in turn, informed Dawn that she needed to talk to M.A. because Thorp had done something to M.A. M.A. told Dawn of the attack. Dawn immediately took M.A. to report the incident to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b614 Deputy Power testified regarding his interview of M.A. and his subsequent investigation. The State asked Deputy Power \u201cwhat was your reaction to hearing this news [the alleged rape] from M.A.?\u201d Deputy Power responded, \u201cmy reaction?\u201d The State proceeded, \u201cyour reaction as an investigator?\u201d Deputy Power then answered, \u201cit seemed credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b615 Thorp\u2019s trial counsel did not object or move to strike Deputy Power\u2019s answer. Thorp\u2019s trial counsel later told the court outside the presence of the jury that he believed Deputy Power\u2019s testimony had amounted to vouching for the credibility of M.A. Thorp\u2019s counsel claimed that he had made a strategic decision not to object to Deputy Power\u2019s statement because he had not wanted to \u201cdraw attention to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABO\">\u00b616 Nineteen year-old Jordana England also testified at trial. Jordana had been engaged to Thorp at the time that law enforcement had served Thorp with the order of protection. Jordana had met Thorp through her mother, Barbara. Jordana and Thorp were living with Barbara in North Dakota. Thorp and Barbara previously had been in a relationship together. Jordana testified that Thorp had told Jordana and Barbara that the order of protection might have resulted from an encounter with M.A. in 2006 in which M.A. had initiated a \u201cblow job\u201d and he had failed to stop it. Barbara also testified that she had heard Thorp admit to this alleged incident with M.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b617 Jordana broke off her engagement to Thorp after the State charged Thorp with sexual intercourse without consent and incest. Barbara then resumed her relationship with Thorp. In fact, Barbara visited Thorp in jail and helped him attempt to obstruct the investigation. Barbara retrieved Thorp\u2019s cell phone and deleted text messages between Thorp and his brother Dean. The State managed to retrieve the text messages and a photo of M.A. on Thorp\u2019s phone that Barbara had deleted. Barbara also testified that Thorp had requested that Barbara ask T.C., a fourteen year old boy, to leave a threatening note on M.A.\u2019s car. T.C. testified that he had written the note as a favor to Barbara, but he did not know who had placed it on M.A.\u2019s car. The note stated \u201ccome forward with the truth or your family will be sued for everything that your family has. That means drop this lie.\u201d M.A. testified that she had been frightened when she found this note.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b618 The State\u2019s counsel noted to the jury during closing argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>M.A. was 15 years old at the time of the attack and thus was unable to consent. The State\u2019s counsel further highlighted his belief that M.A.\u2019s testimony contained all of the elements necessary to convict Thorp of sexual intercourse without consent. The State\u2019s counsel suggested that the only question remaining for the jury was \u201cwhether you believe her.\u201d The State\u2019s counsel urged the jury to believe M.A.: \u201cI think you will find that M.A. is a very credible witness .... She has no reason to lie, and I think you will believe her. I think you should.\u201d The State offered similar statements during the rest of its closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao3\">\u00b619 Thorp\u2019s counsel waited until the conclusion of the State\u2019s closing argument before raising an objection. Thorp argued that the State impermissibly had vouched for M.A. Thorp asked for a cautionary instruction for the jury rather than requesting a mistrial. The District Court read the jury a cautionary instruction regarding the State\u2019s alleged vouching for M.A.\u2019s credibility. The instruction advised the jury that it is impermissible for a lawyer to vouch for a witness, and if the jurors believe the State indeed had vouched for M.A.\u2019s credibility, they were to \u201cdiscard those comments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b620 Thorp later objected to the State\u2019s proposed jury instruction that defined \u201cwithout consent\u201d for sexual intercourse without consent. The State offered a definition of \u201cwithout consent\u201d that read \u201cthe victim is incapable of consent because she is less than 16 years old.\u201d Thorp argued that all of the allegations in the information, and the evidence presented by the State during trial, claimed that Thorp\u2019s forcible rape had rendered M.A. incapable of consenting. The court accepted the State\u2019s instruction defining \u201cwithout consent\u201d based upon age.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b621 The jury convicted Thorp of one count of sexual intercourse \u25a0without consent. The District Court sentenced Thorp to life in the Montana State Prison without the possibility of parole. Thorp filed a motion for a new trial under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA. Thorp argued that the State\u2019s alleged vouching for M.A.\u2019s credibility, the court\u2019s use of the State\u2019s age instruction for \u201cwithout consent,\u201d and improperly admitted other acts evidence warranted a new trial. The District Court denied Thorp\u2019s motion. Thorp appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b622 <em>Did the State\u2019s counsel and a State witness impermissibly vouch for the complaining witness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b623 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 345 Mont. 252, 190 P.3d 1091. We generally will not review issues not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>raised before the district court. We may undertake review of such an issue, however, under the plain error doctrine. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 17. This Court invokes plain error review sparingly. We apply plain error review only in situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b624 This Court consistently has held that the determination of the credibility of witnesses and the weight given to their testimony rests solely within the province of the jury. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 26. A witness may not comment on the credibility of another witness\u2019s testimony and it is improper for a prosecutor to \u201coffer personal opinions\u201d as to witness credibility. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26, 28. The Court in <em>Hayden </em>determined that a police officer impermissibly had vouched for two witnesses at trial. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 31. The prosecutor in <em>Hayden </em>went so far as to ask the officer directly whether he believed the two complaining witnesses had told the truth when the officer interviewed them. Further, the prosecutor had proceeded with an entire line of questioning regarding the witnesses\u2019 credibility and the officer\u2019s training in assessing witness believability. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b625 We decline to exercise plain error review based upon the record before us. The State asked Deputy Power the open-ended question, \u201cwhat was your reaction to hearing this news from M.A.?\u201d The State immediately moved on to other questions after Deputy Power responded that \u201cit seemed credible.\u201d The record does not reveal, as it did in <em>Hayden, </em>that the State was attempting to elicit a certain response from Deputy Power regarding M.A.\u2019s credibility. Deputy Power\u2019s response does not rise to the level of impermissible vouching that would warrant plain error review. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b626 We turn to the State\u2019s comments during closing arguments. A prosecutor may comment during closing argument on the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 33, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798. A prosecutor may not offer personal opinions on witness credibility. <em>Green, </em>\u00b6 33. A prosecutor may comment, however, on \u201cconflicts and contradictions in testimony, as well as to comment on the evidence presented and suggest to the jury inferences which may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Green, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b627 The jury heard conflicting testimony at Thorp\u2019s trial regarding the place of the alleged attack, the date of the alleged attack, and the type of sexual contact between Thorp and M.A. It appears that neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>State, nor Thorp, anticipated some of the testimony that surfaced for the first time during trial. For example, M.A. testified that Thorp had raped her in January of 2006 on Pirogue Island. Hucking testified, by contrast, that Thorp had raped M.A. sometime in the late summer of 2006 at Dawn\u2019s house, only days before M.A. had confided in her. The State seemed surprised at this answer, and asked Hucking whether she had ever told anyone before trial that she believed Thorp had raped M.A. at Dawn\u2019s house sometime in the summer of2006. Hucking responded that she had never mentioned this fact in earlier interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b628 Likewise, Jordana and Barbara England both testified that Thorp had admitted to them that the order of protection may have arisen from an unsolicited \u201cblow job\u201d sometime during 2006. Both Jordana and Barbara also conceded that neither of them had mentioned the alleged \u201cblow job\u201d incident to investigators before trial. Jordana testified that she had failed to tell Thorp\u2019s investigator that Thorp had said the order of protection likely had arisen from the \u201cblow job.\u201d Barbara similarly testified that at a previous hearing she had failed to mention this incident. The State\u2019s comments must be viewed in light of this contradictory testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b629 Moreover, Thorp informed the court at the end of the State\u2019s closing argument that he did not want to move for a mistrial and that he preferred that the court provide a cautionary instruction to the jury. This Court considers the effect of a cautionary instruction in light of the other evidence presented against the defendant. <em>State v. Wing, </em>2008 MT 218, \u00b6 34, 334 Mont. 243, 188 P.3d 999. We generally deem cautionary instructions sufficient if the defendant does not object further or move for a mistrial. <em>Wing, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b630  Thorp\u2019s counsel specifically told the court he did not want to move for a mistrial. The District Court even noted in its order that Thorp actively had been involved with his counsel in making the \u201ccarefully thought out tactical decision\u201d to request a curative instruction instead of a mistrial. We deem the court\u2019s cautionary instruction sufficient under the circumstances to remedy any alleged infringement on Thorp\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b631 <em>Did the District Court properly instruct the jury on the definition of without consent in the context of the sexual intercourse without consent charge?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b632 Thorp argues that the State\u2019s jury instruction of \u201cwithout consent\u201d prevented the jury from reaching a unanimous decision. We review for abuse of discretion whether a district court correctly instructed the jury. We consider whether the jury instructions \u201cfully and fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>instructed the jury on the law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>State v. Cybulski, </em>2009 MT 70, \u00b6 34, 349 Mont. 429, 204 P.3d 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b633 The State initially offered two instructions to define sexual intercourse without consent. Jury instruction #16 defined \u201cwithout consent\u201d as the victim being compelled to submit by force. Jury instruction #17 defined \u201cwithout consent\u201d as the victim being incapable of consent based upon being under the age of 16. The State finally submitted, and the District Court accepted, jury instruction #17 that defined \u201cwithout consent\u201d based upon age. Thorp argues, however, that the information filed by the State alleged force. Thorp argues further that the State offered conflicting testimony that prevented the jury from reaching a unanimous verdict based upon similar factual elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b634 Thorp compares his claim to <em>State v. </em>Hardaway, 2001 MT 252, 307 Mont. 139, 36 P.3d 900, where this Court determined that the district court\u2019s improper jury instructions had denied Hardaway his right to a unanimous verdict. <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 71. The State had charged Hardaway with burglary. The State alleged in its amended information that Hardaway \u201cintended to commit either a theft or a sexual crime against the victim.\u201d <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 68. The court failed to instruct Hardaway\u2019s jury that it had to reach a unanimous decision on whether Hardaway intended to commit a theft or whether he intended to commit a sexual crime. <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 71. This Court reversed Hardaway\u2019s conviction on the basis that the jury \u201cmust be in agreement as to the principal factual elements underlying a specified offense.\u201d <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b635 Unlike <em>Hardaway, </em>however, the State proceeded against Thorp under the single theory that Thorp had raped M.A. on Pirogue Island in January of 2006. Sexual intercourse without consent involves knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse without the consent of another person. Section 45-5-503(1), MCA. Sexual intercourse means the penetration of the vulva, anus, or mouth of one person by the penis or body member of another person, or by foreign instrument, knowingly or purposefully to cause bodily injury or arouse either party. Section 45-2-101(68), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b636 The statute defines \u201cwithout consent\u201d either as the victim being compelled to submit by force or being incapable of consent for a variety of circumstances, including age. Section 45-5-501(l)(a), MCA. Thorp does not dispute that M.A. was fifteen years old in January of 2006. The court properly instructed the jury that M.A. could not consent to any sexual contact with Thorp due to the fact that she was under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>age of sixteen at the time of the attack. M.A.\u2019s age settled the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element of the offense. Section 45-5-501(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b637  The State\u2019s satisfaction of the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element of the offense left the jury to resolve any dispute about whether any sexual contact had taken place between Thorp and M.A. in January of 2006. Thorp does not challenge the court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the knowing or intentional element of the offense or the sexual intercourse element. Section 45-5-503(1), MCA. The court\u2019s jury instructions \u201cfully and fairly instructed the jury on the law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Cybulski, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b638 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Thorp\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b639 Thorp raises three separate issues with respect to his claim that the District Court improperly denied his motion for a new trial. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial. <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 14, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213. We already have determined that the District Court did not abuse its discretion regarding the State\u2019s alleged vouching for M.A.\u2019s credibility and the granting of the jury instruction regarding \u201cwithout consent.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 25, 30 and 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b640  Thorp also argues that the District Court impermissibly admitted other acts evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b) when it allowed Jordana and Barbara England to testify regarding Thorp\u2019s admission of an alleged \u201cblow job\u201d by M.A. at some point during 2006. This Court may review the verdict or decision and \u201cany alleged error objected to\u201d that involves the merits or affects the judgment. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA. The purpose of stating an objection is to allow the district court to correct itself and to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>State v. Price, </em>2007 MT 269, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 399, 171 P.3d 293. Thorp\u2019s trial counsel did not object to either Jordana\u2019s or Barbara\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged \u201cblow job.\u201d Thorp\u2019s trial counsel actively participated in the line of questioning that elicited Jordana\u2019s and Barbara\u2019s unexpected testimony. Thorp waived his right to challenge this testimony on appeal. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b641 <em>Did the District Court impose a sentence on Thorp that amounted to cruel and unusual punishment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b642 We review criminal sentences for legality to determine whether they are within the parameters set by statute. <em>Makarchuk, </em>\u00b6 14. A sentence that falls within the statutory guidelines generally does not violate the constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>State v. Shults, </em>2006 MT 100, \u00b6 30, 332 Mont. 130, 136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>P.3d 507. This Court recognizes an exception to the general rule only when a sentence is \u201cso disproportionate to the crime that it shocks the conscience and outrages the moral sense of the community or of justice.\u201d <em>Shults, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b643  The jury convicted Thorp of sexual intercourse without consent under \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(c)(ii), MCA. Thorp previously had been convicted of sexual intercourse without consent in another state. Section 45-5-503(3)(c)(ii), MCA, requires that offenders with previous convictions for sex offenses \u201cshall be\u201d punished as provided in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA. Section 46-18-219, MCA, allowed for Thorp\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Thorp\u2019s sentence falls within the statutory guidelines set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(c)(ii), MCA. We also decline to recognize an exception to the general rule regarding legal sentences. The court\u2019s sentence neither \u201cshocks the conscience,\u201d nor \u201coutrages the moral sense of the community or of justice\u201d in light of Thorp\u2019s previous conviction for sexual intercourse without consent and the nature of the offense underlying Thorp\u2019s conviction here.</p>\n<p id=\"A9UL\">\u00b644 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b179-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AFr\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b645 I agree that we should decline to exercise plain error review of Deputy Power\u2019s comment. Opinion, \u00b6 25.1 would, therefore, leave it at that and not go on, as the Court does, to conduct plain error review. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. <em>See State v. </em>Jackson, 2009 MT 427, \u00b6 75, 354 Mont. 63, 221 P.3d 1213 (Nelson, J., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u00b646 \u201c[P]lain error\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">An error that is so obvious and prejudicial that an appellate court should <em>address it </em>despite the parties\u2019 failure to raise a proper objection at trial. \u2022 A plain error is often said to be so obvious and substantial that failure <em>to correct it </em>would infringe a party\u2019s due-process rights and damage the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqC\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>622 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009) (emphases added). Plain error review is a matter of judicial discretion. <em>See State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. Thus, if we decide not to exercise plain error review, as we have decided in the instant case, Opinion, \u00b6 25, then we should <em>not </em>discuss the merits of the appellant\u2019s claim. Indeed, by discussing the merits, we necessarily conclude that, on the basis of the issue and argument raised by the appellant, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>is no error. By discussing the merits, we have in fact \u201creviewed\u201d or \u201caddressed\u201d the claim and found no error. In short, we effectively and necessarily have decided that plain error review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b647 While there are cases in which I may believe that the claim of error is, in fact and in law, meritorious-/iaai <em>it been objected </em>to-1 may also believe that this Court should not address the claim of error because our plain error review criteria have not been met. Specifically, the error must implicate a fundamental constitutional right. Additionally, we use the plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, and <em>only </em>where failing to review the claimed error \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 23, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b648 The question of whether the alleged error is in fact error, and the question of whether the claim should be reviewed under the plain error doctrine, are two completely separate inquiries involving different criteria and considerations. Thus, by discussing the merits of the claimed error in explanation of why we are not engaging in plain error review-as we do here and as we did in <em>Jackson </em>and numerous other cases-we simply collapse the claim of error, plain error review, and the merits arguments into one unrecognizable hodgepodge. We have, in fact, \u201creviewed\u201d or \u201caddressed\u201d the claim and found there to be no error. And, worse, in doing so, we have appeared to set precedent on the merits with what is, essentially, dicta-which of course, one side or the other is always happy to cite as the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b649 While I agree that we should not exercise plain error review here, I do not agree with our approach which goes beyond declining plain error review and, in fact, addresses and resolves the claim of error on the merits, merely giving lip service to the plain error doctrine itself and the rule that we use that doctrine sparingly. A request for plain error review should be denied or granted on the basis of the criteria for plain error review, not on the merits of the underlying argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b650 With that caveat, I otherwise concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
