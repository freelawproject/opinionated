He appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b62 <em>1.

Did the District Court err by instructing the jury that it could infer Stanczak was under the influence of alcohol because he refused to perform a field sobriety tests before consulting with an attorney?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b64 On the evening of March 31,2008, Montana Highway Patrolman Chris Hoyt (Trooper Hoyt) responded to a single vehicle crash. After a brief investigation, Trooper Hoyt identified the driver as Joseph Stanczak, placed him under arrest for suspicion of DUI and transported him to the Lake County Detention Center for further DUI investigation. Upon arrival at the Detention Center, and throughout the DUI processing, Stanczak repeatedly requested the presence of counsel before he would engage in field sobriety tests. Nevertheless, Hoyt insisted that Stanczak perform the \u201cwalk and turn\u201d maneuver, which he did with mixed results, as well as the horizontal gaze nystagmus test and the \u201cone leg stand\u201d (collectively \u201cfield sobriety tests\u201d), both of which Stanczak refused to perform without a lawyer present. Stanczak also refused to submit a breath sample without consulting an attorney. Ultimately, Hoyt charged Stanczak with DUI based on the report that Stanczak was driving erratically and Hoyt\u2019s observations that Stanczak was unsteady on his feet, emitted the odor of an alcoholic beverage, had glassy eyes, slurred speech, performed poorly on the \u201cwalk and turn\u201d test, and refused to submit a breath sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b65 At trial, the State proposed five jury instructions, which were later given as Jury Instructions Nos. 9-13. After Stanczak objected, the District Court amended Jury Instruction No. 13 and provided it to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">You are instructed that if a person under arrest for the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol refuses to submit to a test which detects the presence of alcohol, proof of that refusal is admissible in a trial of that offense. The jury may infer from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>refusal that the person was under the influence. That inference is rebuttable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">At the close of evidence, the State proposed an additional instruction, which was given as Jury Instruction No. 14 and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">In Montana, a defendant has no right to speak with an attorney before a sobriety test or to have an attorney present during a test. He must decide whether to submit to a [blood alcohol test] BAC test before he has the right to an attorney. A continual request to speak to an attorney before submitting to a BAC test is deemed a refusal to take the test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Stanczak objected to this instruction\u2019s reference to a \u201csobriety test,\u201d arguing that a defendant has a right to consult with an attorney before submitting to a field sobriety test. The District Court overruled Stanczak\u2019s objection and the jury found him guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(l)(a), MCA. Stanczak appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b66 This Court reviews jury instructions in a criminal case to determine whether, as a whole, they fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 16, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636. Recognizing that the district courts have broad discretion in instructing the jury, we review a district court\u2019s decision regarding jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Field, </em>2005 MT 181, \u00b6 16, 328 Mont. 26, 116 P.3d 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b67 <em>1. Did the District Court err by instructing the jury that Stanczak had no right to consult with an attorney before performing a field sobriety test?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">\u00b68 Stanczak argues that Jury Instruction No. 14 did not, as a whole, correctly instruct the jury on the applicable law. While conceding that he did not have the right to consult with counsel prior to submitting a breath sample, Stanczak argues he had the right to consult with counsel prior to performing the field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\u00b69 A defendant\u2019s right to counsel in a custodial interrogation derives from the defendant\u2019s right against compelled self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. We noted in <em>Van Kirk </em>that this right applies only to custodial interrogation and that \u201c[a] mere request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that the suspect perform a series of sobriety tests, done without any interrogation of the suspect, does not constitute a custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b610  Trooper Hoyt merely requested that Stanczak perform field sobriety tests, without conducting an interrogation. Therefore, as explained in <em>Van Kirk, </em>there was no custodial interrogation and Stanczak had no constitutional right to obtain counsel before completing the tests. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s instruction that \u201ca defendant has no right to speak with an attorney before a sobriety test or to have an attorney present during a test\u201d fully and fairly instructed the jury on the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b611 <em>2. Did the District Court err by instructing the jury that it could infer Stanczak was under the influence of alcohol because he refused to perform a field sobriety test before consulting with an attorney?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b612 Stanczak argues that Instruction No. 14\u2019s \u201cerroneous recitation\u201d of his rights, coupled with Instruction No. 13\u2019s directive that the jury may infer from a person\u2019s refusal \u201cto submit to a test which detects the presence of alcohol\u201d that the person was under the influence of alcohol, was reversible error. The State counters that Stanczak\u2019s attack on Jury Instruction No. 13 should not be reviewed because he did not preserve an objection to this instruction. Alternatively, the State argues that Stanczak\u2019s challenge should be rejected because Instruction No. 13 correctly instructed the jury that it could infer that a person was under the influence based on that person\u2019s refusal to submit to a test which detects the presence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b613 As a general rule, a party may raise on appeal only issues that were properly preserved before the district court. <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683. Stanczak initially objected to Instruction No. 13 as proposed, but he accepted the District Court\u2019s amendment to the instruction by indicating that, as amended, he had \u201cno objection\u201d to the instruction. However, as Stanczak points out in his reply brief, he is not simply challenging Instruction No. 13. Rather, he contends that based on the District Court\u2019s decision to give Instruction No. 14, the jury likely inferred, because of Instruction No. 13, that he was under the influence of alcohol based on his demand to speak with an attorney before agreeing to perform the sobriety tests. Thus, to the extent Stanczak\u2019s discussion of Instruction No. 13 is linked to his challenge to Instruction No. 14, we conclude his argument is properly made on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u00b614 As we have already explained, Instruction No. 14 was proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>because, without custodial interrogation, a defendant generally does not have a Fifth Amendment or Article II, Section 25 constitutional right to consult with an attorney prior to performing field sobriety tests. Thus, the remaining issue is whether the permissible inference provisions of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, as set forth in Instruction No. 13, apply to persons who refuse to perform field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b615 Stanczak contends that permitting the jury to infer that \u201che was under the influence based upon his request to speak with an attorney prior to performing the [field sobriety tests]\u201d contravenes \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA, because the only \u201ctests\u201d enumerated in the statute are tests of a person\u2019s blood or breath-not field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b616 The statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201ca report of the facts and results of one or more tests of a person\u2019s blood or breath is admissible in evidence ...,\u201d as is \u201ca report of the facts and results of a physical, psychomotor or physiological assessment ....\u201d Section 61-8-404(l)(b)-(c), MCA (2007). The statute further provides that \u201c[i]f the person under arrest refused to submit to one or more tests as provided in this section, proof of the refusal is admissible ...\u201d and \u201c[t]he trier of fact may infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence.\u201d Section \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b617 Our purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent and to give effect to the legislative will. Section 1-2-102, MCA. In ascertaining legislative intent, we look first to the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Van Der Hule v. Mukasey, </em>2009 MT 20, \u00b6 10, 349 Mont. 88, 217 P.3d 1019. The statute applies to a person who \u201crefuses to submit to one or more tests as provided in this section ....\u201d Section 61-8-404(2), MCA. Stanczak correctly notes that \u00a7 61-8-404(l)(a) and (b), MCA, refer only to \u201cblood or breath\u201d tests, and that \u00a7 61-8-404(l)(c), MCA, refers to \u201ca physical, psychomotor, or physiological assessment ....\u201d However, despite the fact that Legislature used the term \u201cassessment\u201d rather than \u201ctest\u201d in describing the physical, psychomotor, or physiological methods of determining intoxication, we cannot reasonably conclude that these \u201cassessments\u201d are not \u201ctests\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA. Clearly, the physical, psychomotor, and physiological assessments referenced by the Legislature are the very field sobriety tests Stanczak refused to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b618 In our discussion of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA (2005), in <em>State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 16, 342 Mont. 355, 181 P.3d 625, we mentioned that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood, breath, physical, psychomotor, or physiological test\u201d is admissible in a DUI trial under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the statute. In State <em>v. Hudson, </em>2005 MT 142, \u00b6 21, 327 Mont. 286, 114 P.3d 210, we generally referenced field sobriety tests as falling within the meaning of \u00a7 61-8-404(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b619  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s instructions correctly instructed the jury on the applicable law and did not raise an inappropriate inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
