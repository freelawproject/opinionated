Bill died in their home from a single gunshot wound to the head on June 9,2007, between 10:00 p.m. and midnight. Anne and Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>had been alone in the house that evening until their younger son returned home about midnight. Bill planned to go horseback riding with a friend the next day, and at about 10:00 p.m. talked to the friend by phone about the outing. Stout claimed that she spent the night of June 9 with Bill in their bedroom and that he was not feeling well the next morning. When Bill\u2019s friend called the next morning about the ride, Stout told him Bill was ill and was not going to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b69 On June 10, Stout and the younger son drove to Missoula for a shopping trip, returning home late in the afternoon. The younger son did not see his father the prior evening, or before leaving for Missoula with Stout the next morning. She and the son arrived home from the shopping trip to find Bill\u2019s body in bed. She called 911 about 4:30 p.m. \u00b610 The murder weapon was a pistol owned by Bill. Ten days before his death he reported to the Ravalli County Sheriff that the pistol, holster and ammunition were missing. Ambulance personnel and officers who responded to the 911 call from Stout confirmed that Bill was dead and that no gun was found in the room with him. Officers applied for and obtained a search warrant. The gun was subsequently located in the saddlebag of Bill\u2019s motorcycle in the garage of the house. The holster was found in a laundry hamper under washed but wet clothing, and the ammunition was found on top of Bill\u2019s gun safe. Three rounds were missing from the center of the box, so that unless the box was completely opened it appeared upon opening from the end that it was full.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b611 Officers found what appeared to be a laundry washing project that was never finished. Wet laundry, smelling strongly of bleach, was in the hamper but had not been dried. A neighbor whose window faced Bill and Anne\u2019s house reported seeing lights on in the bedroom area in the middle of the night, on the night before Anne and the son went to Missoula. The neighbors felt that seeing the light on at that time and location was unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b612 The bullet that killed Bill and the spent shell casing were recovered from the bed where he was found. A spent shell casing from the pistol was found in the yard, and an un-fired round was in the chamber of the pistol, accounting for the three rounds missing from the ammunition box. Expert botanical examination of a plant blossom found in the ammunition box showed it came from a bush in the yard that had first bloomed for the season at least six days after Bill reported the gun missing. Expert analysis showed that the two spent shell casings came from Bill\u2019s gun, as did the bullet that killed him. Stout testified that she did not know anything about the blossom in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ammunition box, but that she assumed that the expert\u2019s analysis of it was correct. At the time of the search both Stout and her son told officers that Bill\u2019s gun was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b613 The search also revealed a latex glove imbedded with gunshot residue on the outside and Stout\u2019s DNA on the inside. The glove was located in the same laundry hamper as the holster and wet laundry, but Stout testified that she did not know how her DNA got inside the glove. She later testified that she often used rubber gloves around the house, which would explain her DNA, but that she still had no idea how gunshot residue got onto a glove with her DNA in it. Stout testified that she had nothing to do with the gun or the holster and did not know how they ended up in the locations where officers found them. Investigating officers recovered no fingerprints from the gun or ammunition. There was no gunshot residue on Bill\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b614 The search also revealed a note in Stout\u2019s handwriting in her nightstand that contained apparent instructions on how to fire a pistol like the one used in the crime. She claimed that the note was actually a guide for their college-age son for using the clothes washer. Her computer showed 56 internet searches for such topics as how to kill someone, how to poison someone and get away with it, and how to put a person to sleep. Stout testified that she believed that these were Bill\u2019s searches and showed that he planned to commit suicide. Stout was the beneficiary of a $500,000 term life insurance policy that Bill had taken out two years before his death, and was co-owner of their real estate with equity over $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b615 The investigation also revealed that during a 2005 trip to Arkansas, Bill had a brief affair with a woman he had known years before named Barbara Miller. Bill and Miller continued to communicate after Bill returned to Montana, and he bought a plane ticket for her to fly into Kalispell, Montana, although that trip and meeting never happened. Miller testified that she and Bill had discussed getting married and that she planned to move to Montana when that happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b616 Stout later found out about the relationship between Bill and Miller through a phone call from a female person who Stout said she did not recognize. She had a confrontation with Bill over the affair and he agreed to terminate contact with Miller. Shortly thereafter (still in 2005), Bill, Anne, their sons, and a number of their friends began receiving emails or letters postmarked in Arkansas purporting to be from Miller or from Miller\u2019s daughter. The communications deprecated Anne Stout, touted the relationship between Bill and Miller and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>claimed that it was an ongoing affair. They claimed that Miller was pregnant with Bill\u2019s child, and claimed that Miller was going to move to Montana to take Anne Stout\u2019s place in the family. The communications claimed that Miller was going to bring Bill\u2019s baby to Montana. Other communications, including letters postmarked in Arkansas, purported to invite the family and friends to a barbecue in Montana to celebrate the relationship between Bill and Miller. Bill reported the purported Miller harassment to law enforcement in Ravalli County. Stout told a number of people about Bill\u2019s relationship with Miller, and it was a source of intense shame and embarrassment for him. These purported communications from Miller continued sporadically until June, 2006. None of the communications ever went to members of Stout\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b617 The investigation showed that the email accounts from which the purported Miller messages were sent were created on Stout\u2019s work computer, and that some of the emails had been sent from her home computer. Investigators were able to duplicate a Ft. Smith, Arkansas postmark like the ones found on letters purporting to be from Miller by mailing a stamped and addressed letter in a manila envelope from Hamilton, Montana to the postmaster in Ft. Smith, Arkansas. During the search immediately after Bill\u2019s death in 2007, officers found two letters with Arkansas postmarks in Anne\u2019s car in the garage, one sealed and one un-sealed, like the others that had started appearing in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b618 Stout\u2019s was the only DNA found on the adhesive of an envelope postmarked from Arkansas, purporting to be from Miller and inviting Bill\u2019s work partner to the barbecue. The sealed Ft. Smith, Arkansas envelope found in Stout\u2019s car during the search contained printed-out emails purporting to be from Miller. Those print-outs contained Stout\u2019s fingerprints and palm print. She testified that she did not dispute that her DNA was on the adhesive of the Arkansas envelopes but that she had no idea how it got there. She testified that she could have unknowingly handled the contents of the Arkansas mailings because she sometimes helped Bill with paperwork. During the search after Bill\u2019s death, officers found in the Stouts\u2019 bedroom a copy of a purported invitation to the barbecue addressed to their sons. Handwriting on the invitation, purportedly from Miller in Arkansas, was identified as Stout\u2019s by handwriting analysis, to a high probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b619 In addition to the mailings and emailings, there were several acts of petty vandalism such as eggs or feces smeared on Bill\u2019s truck and broken potted plants on the porch of the house. Bill and Anne reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>receiving numerous hang-up phone calls. The subsequent investigation showed that those calls had been made from a pay phone in the hall of the business where Stout worked. Bill also reported that a credit card and some financial information were missing from the house and stated that he feared that Miller had come to Montana and had broken in. Bill received emails purporting to be from Miller stating that she was going to come to Montana, and reported his fears about Miller to the sheriffs office. Investigating officers found no evidence that Miller ever came to Montana prior to testifying at Stout\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b620 As recently as seven months before Bill\u2019s death, Stout conducted internet searches related to Miller and to Bill on her work computer and used that computer to create an online account in Miller\u2019s name. Stout and Miller also periodically talked by phone in conversations initiated by Stout. She also called and emailed Miller\u2019s boss about the affair, and Miller became concerned that she would lose her job if Stout obtained a restraining order against her as Stout threatened. Stout testified that she never sought a restraining order against Miller and never told anyone that she had. Other witnesses testified that she had told them about a restraining order. As recently as six months before Bill\u2019s death, Stout called Miller to report that she was divorcing Bill. Miller concluded that Stout was very angry about Bill\u2019s relationship with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b621 Shortly after Bill\u2019s death, Stout and her two sons named Miller to investigating officers as a person who had an affair with Bill and who had been stalking the family. Stout told officers that Miller\u2019s harassment was a great concern to Bill and that not long before his death he believed that a car that turned into their driveway during the night was Miller or one of her family members. Acquaintances of Bill also told officers about the purported Miller stalking, having heard about it repeatedly from Stout. Miller was eliminated as a suspect based upon a store surveillance video that showed that she was in Arkansas at about the same time that Bill was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b622 A central theme of the prosecution was that Stout deliberately and methodically created the illusion, beginning in 2005 and continuing up until the investigation of Bill\u2019s death, that the family had been victimized and stalked by Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b623 Stout testified that she never made the phone calls that Miller reported, that she never sent mailings to anyone with Arkansas postmarks, that she had no idea how her DNA got onto the envelopes, and that she never created any of the purported Miller emails traced to her computer. She testified that after she found out about the Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>affair she discovered that Bill had bought an airline ticket for Miller to come to Montana; that Bill and Miller were talking by phone; that Bill had bought phone calling cards she did not know about; that Bill had registered with an on-line dating service in 2004; and that Bill had obtained a post office box that she did not previously know about. She testified that she was angry and humiliated. Investigating officers found a list Anne had kept, apparently for years, of all the \u201creally mean things\u201d Bill had ever said to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b624 Stout was charged by information with deliberate homicide on June 26,2007. She presented expert testimony that the circumstances of Bill\u2019s death were consistent with either suicide or homicide. After a three-week trial, a jury found her guilty in June, 2008. The District Court committed her to prison for life in September, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b625 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court properly allowed the expert reports that had been admitted into evidence into the jury room during deliberations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b626 At the conclusion of the evidence and closing arguments, the trial judge and attorneys met to organize the several hundred pieces of evidence that had been admitted during the trial and to resolve any issues of which exhibits could be taken into the jury room during deliberation. There was no objection from either side to sending the vast majority of the exhibits with the jury during deliberations. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on exhibits that may be taken to jury deliberations for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bales, </em>1999 MT 334, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 25, 297 Mont. 402, 994 P.2d 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b627 The record of these discussions shows that the District Court excluded several exhibits from the jury deliberations upon objection by the defense. For example, the defense successfully objected that a photograph that a witness had marked during testimony placed undue emphasis on that witness and should be excluded in favor of an unmarked copy of the same image. The defense successfully excluded two drawings done during testimony by prosecution experts on the ground that they had been admitted \u201cjust for demonstrative purposes.\u201d At the same time the defense argued that the audio recordings of several witness interviews that had also been transcribed should be given to the jury. The prosecution and District Court agreed and the recordings went with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u00b628 The defense objected to Exhibits 226 through 238, characterized as \u201cvarious reports from the laboratories\u201d on the ground that allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the jury to see the reports would put \u201cundue emphasis\u201d on them or the witnesses. Each of the exhibits had previously been admitted into evidence. The only report the defense specifically objected to was the \u201cAutopsy Report,\u201d but only to the extent that it contained the conclusion that Bill\u2019s death was a homicide. The District Court concluded that there was no \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d in sending the reports with the jury, and that the homicide conclusion in the autopsy report was \u201cmade clear in testimony, so it\u2019s no surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b629 Stout contends that the expert reports were \u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d that should have been excluded from jury deliberations. She does not contend that the reports were erroneously admitted into evidence during the trial. When jurors retire for deliberation, they may take with them \u201call exhibits that have been received as evidence in the cause that in the opinion of the court will be necessary.\u201d Section 46-16-504, MCA. At the same time, this Court has recognized the common law rule against submission of \u201ctestimonial materials\u201d to the jury for \u201cunsupervised and unrestricted review.\u201d <em>State v. Herman, </em>2009 MT 101, \u00b6 38, 350 Mont. 109, 204 P.3d 1254. That rule applies both as to materials sent with the jury at the start of deliberations, and to requests from the jury to re-hear testimony during deliberations as provided in \u00a7 46-16-503(2), MCA. <em>Bales, </em>\u00b6 23. A district court\u2019s decision under \u00a7 46-16-504, MCA, on evidence that may be taken by the jury during deliberations is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Bales, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"A20\">\u00b630 This Court has tended to identify \u201ctestimonial materials\u201d for purposes of the common law rule by analogy. In <em>Bales, </em>\u00b6 16, we quoted a definition of the phrase \u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. The current Ninth Edition of that work defines \u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d as a \u201cperson\u2019s testimony offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted; esp., evidence elicited from a witness. Also termed communicative evidence; oral evidence.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>640 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009). Therefore for purposes of this rule, the terms \u201ctestimonial materials\u201d and \u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d have been treated as equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b631 Further illustration of the intent and meaning of these terms comes from the cases in which this Court has considered issues of what materials can be provided to a jury during deliberations. The disputed testimonial evidence in <em>Bales </em>was the tape recording of a police interview with a defendant. Similarly, in <em>Herman </em>the disputed testimonial evidence was the written statement by a witness; in <em>State v. Mayes, </em>251 Mont. 358, 825 P.2d 1196 (1992), it was a tape recording of witness statements; in <em>State v. Morse, </em>229 Mont. 222, 746 P.2d 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(1987), it was a surveillance tape record of the defendant; and in <em>State v. Harris, </em>247 Mont. 405, 808 P.2d 453 (1991), it was the entire transcript of the victim\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b632 Stout asserts that expert witness reports admitted into evidence in her case were testimonial evidence that should have been excluded from jury deliberations by the common law rule noted above. However, Stout fails to provide anything more than conclusory contentions that the expert witness reports in her case constituted \u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d as that phrase has been defined and as it has been applied in case law. She really only argues that the exhibits relate to and are consistent with testimony from various State witnesses. That, of course, would be true for most pieces of evidence admitted in most trials and forms no basis for excluding items of evidence from the jury deliberations. This is no ground for error. Nevertheless we have reviewed the State\u2019s exhibits that she complains about and conclude that none of them is testimonial materials or testimonial evidence for purposes of the common law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b633 State\u2019s Exhibits 226, 227, 228, 229, 231, 232, 236, and 238 are brief laboratory reports, most of them a single page, from the Forensic Science Division of the Montana Department of Justice, commonly referred to as the \u201cState Crime Lab.\u201d The reports briefly and summarily list technical and scientific facts resulting from the examination of evidence relating to the prosecution. Exhibit 230 is a longer report from a laboratory in Florida concerning the results of various DNA tests of evidence such as the Arkansas envelopes and the rubber glove. Like the Forensic Science Division reports, the DNA report lists and summarizes the technical and scientific facts resulting from the examination of evidence potentially containing DNA residue. Exhibits 233 and 234 were investigative reports written by Deputy Wagner of the Cascade County Sheriffs Office concerning his examination of and conclusions about the handwriting found on one of the Arkansas mailings. Exhibit 237 was a one-paragraph letter from the Assistant Herbarium Curator at the University of Montana tentatively identifying some of the plant material found in the box of ammunition for the pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b634 Exhibit 235 was the report of the postmortem examination (autopsy) of Bill\u2019s body. This is the only exhibit that Stout specifically objected to during the exhibit conference at the end of the trial. At that time Stout contended that she was prejudiced by the exhibit, but only by the line \u201cat the very end\u201d of the report that said \u201cManner of Death: Homicide.\u201d The District Court allowed the exhibit to go to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>because the conclusion was consistent with the author\u2019s testimony and was \u201cno surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b635  The author of each of the reports testified and was cross-examined at trial. The defense either stipulated to or did not contest the expert qualifications of each of the witnesses. The jury was instructed on its power and duty to evaluate the testimony of each witness and to determine the weight it should be given. The jury was instructed specifically that expert testimony should be given the weight it deserves, and may be entirely rejected if the reasons given to support it are unsound. Trial court judges are given broad discretion to determine which exhibits would be necessary to help the jury in deciding the case. The District Court did not err by allowing these reports to accompany the jury during deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b636 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court properly admitted evidence at trial concerning Stout\u2019s attempts to falsely implicate Miller as the source of a campaign to harass and intimidate Stout\u2019s husband and family.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b637 Stout contends that the District Court improperly admitted evidence of her campaign to create the illusion that Miller was stalking and harassing Bill and the family. She contends that the evidence was not related to any fact in dispute, and was inadmissible because the events did not occur immediately prior to the charged offense. This Court reviews rulings on the admissibility of evidence to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Paoni, </em>2006 MT 26, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 86, 124 P.3d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b638 The State contends that the Miller evidence is admissible under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, referred to as the transaction rule. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">Where the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATq\">The transaction rule allows admission of evidence of acts that are \u201cinextricably or inseparably linked to,\u201d <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2010 MT 6, \u00b6 31, 355 Mont. 31, 224 P.3d 1247, and are explanatory of the charged offense, <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 41, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. The rule is based upon the premise that it is difficult to subdivide a course of conduct into discrete criminal acts and \u201cother\u201d conduct, as it is difficult for a witness to testify coherently about an event if the witness is only allowed to reference minutely defined elements of the crime. <em>State v. Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, \u00b6 27, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152. The rule allows admission of evidence that is necessary to \u201cprovide a comprehensive and complete picture of the commission of a crime.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 36. All Federal circuits recognize the legitimacy of admitting properly limited relevant evidence that is intrinsic to or inextricably intertwined with a charged crime. <em>Guill, \u00b6 </em>28.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b639 We have cautioned that the transaction rule should not be used to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts to \u201cprove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith\u201d as prohibited by Rule 404(b), M. R. Evid. <em>State v. Barosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 46, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776, without following the requirements explained in <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52 (1991). Application of the transaction rule should not be used to avoid Rule 404 and the notice and instruction requirements it specifies. <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b640 Stout first argues that the evidence of her campaign to make it appear that Miller was stalking the family was inadmissible because it did not happen \u201cimmediately prior\u201d to Bill\u2019s murder. The phrase \u201cimmediately prior\u201d is found in several decisions from this Court, in passages explaining the theory and purpose of the \u201ctransaction rule.\u201d It appears to have first been used in <em>State v. Moore, </em>254 Mont. 241, 246, 836 P.2d 604, 607 (1992), and was adopted from a Texas case, <em>Cruz v. State, </em>645 S.W.2d 498 (Tex. App. 1982). The disputed evidence in <em>Moore </em>involved acts by the defendant after the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b641 The use of the phrase \u201cimmediately prior\u201d in cases explaining the transaction rule is not a substantive temporal limitation on evidence admissible under the rule. We have never held that evidence admissible under the rule is limited to evidence of acts occurring immediately prior to the crime. <em>See e.g. State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, 308 Mont. 99, 39 P.3d 689. Adoption of such a narrow interpretation would reward the plodding and methodical criminal who is capable of planning her crime over a span of months or years. The ability to do so should not be rewarded by excluding the evidence. The issue under the transaction rule is whether the evidence is inextricably linked to and explanatory of the crime. The issue is not whether the acts occurred immediately prior to the crime or at some other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b642 Moreover, contrary to Stout\u2019s characterization, her campaign to paint Miller as a dangerous stalker was not an isolated incident that occurred two years before the crime. While the campaign began in 2005, it was continuing up until the moment of Bill\u2019s death and afterwards. Within months before Bill\u2019s death, Stout had created another internet account in Miller\u2019s name. She had done internet searches involving Bill and Miller. She called Miller and told her she was divorcing Bill. Copies of the spurious emails and letters that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>part of the campaign were found in Stout\u2019s car during the search after the murder. When investigating officers interviewed Stout, she and her sons named Miller as someone with whom Bill had trouble. Stout\u2019s plan did not stop in 2005 but continued up to and after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">\u00b643 Second, Stout argues, very briefly, that the harassment evidence was inadmissible because it was not related to any fact in dispute, as required by the transaction rule. She contends that evidence of a campaign in 2005 to embarrass her husband about the affair was not evidence of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b644 The prosecution\u2019s theory of the case was that Stout became enraged by the affair and Bill\u2019s apparent plan to divorce her and take up with Miller. In reaction to her anger she manufactured the Miller harassment campaign to embarrass both Bill and Miller. Stout\u2019s anger with Bill caused the events that eventually led to the murder, and the manufactured perception that Miller had harassed the family could ensure that Miller would be the suspect in the crime. This plan worked. Stout and both her sons told investigating officers immediately after Bill\u2019s death that Miller had been stalking the family. Officers investigated Miller as a suspect. Had she not coincidentally appeared on a store surveillance video in Arkansas at the time of the murder, Stout\u2019s plan to drag a red herring across the trail of the investigation could have lasted much longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b645 Stout\u2019s efforts to paint Miller as a deranged stalker and murder suspect were clearly an integral part of her planning of the crime. Stout could not act on her anger toward Bill until she sufficiently indoctrinated everyone involved, including Bill and her sons, to the belief that Miller was a threat to them. She did this thoroughly and precisely. It was part of her planning of the crime itself and was clearly inextricably linked to her role in Bill\u2019s death. The evidence that Stout manufactured the harassment campaign to implicate Miller was not evidence of \u201cother\u201d crimes, acts or wrongs, and thus M. R. Evid. 404(b) is not implicated. It was evidence of the crime itself and provided the essential context to prove to the jury how and why the crime occurred. \u00b646 Contrary to the suggestion by the dissent, use of the transaction rule in this manner does not allow prosecutors to seek victory at the expense of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The prosecution is required to disclose to the defendant in discovery the witnesses it intends to call and the evidence it intends to introduce. Section 46-15-322, MCA. Moreover, the prosecutor is required to disclose evidence that tends to be exculpatory. <em>State v. Licht, </em>266 Mont. 123, 129, 879 P.2d 670, 673-74 (1994). Finally, the prosecutor is required to conform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>to the Montana Rules of Evidence and the defendant has the right to challenge proposed evidence throughout the trial process. No constitutional rights of the defendant are limited by the holding in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b647 We are not persuaded by the dissent\u2019s argument that the \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d requirement should be further constrained by a requirement that the transaction rule be limited to the evidence that is essential to secure a conviction. There are clear difficulties determining at trial and on appeal the line to be drawn between the evidence without which the conviction could not occur and all other evidence offered by the prosecution. Adoption of an \u201cevidence required to convict\u201d standard risks requiring all evidence in a criminal case apart from the narrow ultimate issues-such as who pulled the trigger-to require pretrial notice and cautionary instructions as the evidence is presented. Clearly such an obligation would present difficult and often unclear choices to the trial judge, increasing the risk of error and jury confusion, and more appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b648 Finally, the dissent misconstrues our ruling in <em>State v. Henson, </em>2010 MT 136, 356 Mont. 458, 235 P.3d 1274. Rather than creating a double standard for application of the transaction rule to the prosecution and defense, <em>Henson </em>adopts the identical limitation on use of the rule for both. <em>Lacey </em>imposed restrictions on the prosecution\u2019s use of evidence concerning conduct of or with witnesses not part of the crime being prosecuted. <em>Henson </em>applied that ruling to the use of such evidence by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b649  We hold that evidence of Stout\u2019s campaign to portray Miller as a stalker was inextricably linked to proving that she murdered Bill and was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b650 <em>Issue Three: Whether the District Court properly admitted opinion testimony from a police officer concerning blood evidence at the scene. </em>This Court reviews rulings on the admissibility of evidence to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Paoni, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa1Q\">\u00b651 Stout contends that the District Court erred in allowing Matt Cashell, one of the investigating detectives, to offer his opinion that Bill\u2019s body was moved after he was shot, based in part upon the blood stains found on and around the body. Cashell was an officer with the Ravalli County Sheriffs Department and Deputy Ravalli County Coroner. He participated in the initial crime scene investigation and testified on several separate occasions at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b652 When Cashell first appeared on June 2 early in the trial, he testified that he had a four-year degree in justice studies, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>graduate of the Montana Law Enforcement Academy, and was Deputy Ravalli County Coroner. He generally described what he saw at the scene and identified the photographs he took. On cross-examination, the defense asked him a series of questions about the location and appearance of blood spots and stains on and around the body. He was also cross-examined about his examination of the body for rigor mortis and whether he came to any conclusions as a result. There was no objection during any of this testimony. He testified on subsequent occasions that are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b653 On June 5 Cashell was called to testify again. He testified about specialized training he received in blood stain pattern analysis, including impact stains, transfer stains and drying times. He described that the course included lab work using human blood to evaluate the effects of blood stains and drying times. He then testified that at the scene of Bill\u2019s death he found a large volume of blood that had substantially coagulated, explaining the difference between dried and coagulated blood. Cashell testified that in his opinion based on the coagulation and drying he saw, Bill had been dead \u201cfor some time\u201d when he examined the body. He also described in some detail the meanings of rigor mortis and lividity, and his observations of Bill\u2019s body that led him to conclude that Bill had been dead 8 to 12 hours or longer at the time of his observations. There was no relevant objection during any part of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b654 Cashell testified again on June 6. He testified that based on his observations he concluded that the body, the covers and the pillow had been moved after death. He testified that the blood stains indicated to him that the body had been moved after death. At this point the defense asked to voir dire the witness and asked him about his blood stain analysis workshop. He testified that he completed a week-long course at the State Crime Lab, taught by officials from the Kansas City Police Department and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Cashell indicated that he had not testified on blood stain analysis before and had authored no articles in the area. The defense then objected that Cashell was not qualified to give expert testimony because his workshop was only a week long. The District Court ruled that Cashell could state his opinion, and that the \u201cjury can give it such weight as they feel it deserves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b655 He testified that with the body as they found it, the bullet could not have traveled through Bill\u2019s head to the position in the pillow where it was located. Therefore, he concluded that the body must have been moved after Bill was shot. He testified that as the body was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>found, there was blood that was \u201cactually above or against gravity from the wound\u201d again indicating that the body had been moved. He testified that there was a defined margin or line in the blood stain on the left hand as if it had been partially in a pool of blood, but that the hand was not in a pool of blood when the body was found. The same was true in other areas of the body. He testified that there were coagulated deposits on top of blood stains, indicating that the blood had coagulated before it was deposited on the stain, again indicating body movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b656 Cashell described other blood stains that were deposited when the blood was already coagulated because the blood had not run. He described the position the body would have to be in at the time of death to create the blood patterns he found. He then testified about lividity and the purple discoloration in the body, and his conclusion that the lividity had become fixed with the body in the position in which it was found. Cashell concluded that Bill had been lying on his right side when he was shot, that the body had stayed in that position long enough for blood to begin to coagulate, and that it had then been rolled over onto the back in the position in which it was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b657 Cashell also testified that there was a pillow over Bill\u2019s head when the body was found, covering the entrance wound in the head, indicating that the pillow had been moved. He testified that there were drops of blood found under the sheet, indicating that the sheet had been moved. He testified that fingerprints in the blood were left by someone other than Bill, based upon the position of the bedding and his conclusion that Bill could not have moved his hand to make the prints after he was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b658 On cross-examination, defense counsel stated that \u201cit\u2019s obvious, without going through any blood stain analysis, that things were moved in the room because, as you first started to testify, the one green pillow was over the entrance wound....\u201d Defense counsel further stated that \u201cwhen we look at the photos, it\u2019s obvious someone put the bed covers over his right arm, too. ...\u201d During closing argument, defense counsel mentioned Cashell\u2019s testimony only once, observing: \u201cI don\u2019t care who moved the body. We know somebody did something because the pillows are there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b659 A district court may allow expert testimony if the witness has the requisite knowledge, skill, experience, training or education to testify. Rule 702, M. R. Evid.; <em>State v. Russette, </em>2002 MT 200, \u00b6 14, 311 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>188, 53 P.3d 1256.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The witness must have specialized knowledge that would distinguish him from a lay person. <em>State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, \u00b6 89, 293 Mont. 403, 977 P.2d 298. The district court has great latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony, and the ruling will not be disturbed without a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, \u00b6 30, 315 Mont. 480, 68 P.3d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b660 Stout contends that Cashell should not have been allowed to state his opinion that the body had been moved because that was \u201ckey circumstantial evidence that Bill\u2019s death was not a suicide because someone had moved his body after death.\u201d However, at the trial itself,' it was clear that the defense did not contest the fact that the body and bedding had been tampered with after Bill was shot. Indeed, they could not have taken any other position under the facts because a pillow was found over the entrance wound and blood was found under the sheet. Under these circumstances Stout cannot demonstrate any prejudice arising from Cashell\u2019s testimony that the body and bedding had been moved.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b661  Further, the District Court had great latitude in assessing the qualifications of the witness as an expert. While Stout argues now that Cashell was not an expert because he lacked a college degree in blood spatter analysis, had not testified as an expert in other trials and had not published papers on the topic, those are not pre-requisites to qualification to provide expert testimony. Cashell had a four-year degree in law enforcement, was a Law Enforcement Academy graduate, had experience as a detective and coroner, and had completed a week-long course in blood spatter evidence. This training and experience adequately qualified him to give the testimony he gave, especially in light of the fact that much of his testimony was intuitive. Much of his testimony involved propositions such as blood flows down, a discrete line in a blood stain is significant, and a pillow over the entrance wound is significant. In addition, he testified extensively and without objection as to his observations and conclusions on rigor mortis and lividity.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b662 Last, as noted earlier, the jury was instructed that they could give expert testimony the weight they thought it deserved, and could reject it entirely if the reasons given for it were unsound. And, of course, the defense was free to present expert testimony from other witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>contesting the opinions offered by Cashell. The District Court did not abuse its discretion allowing Cashell to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b663 <em>Issue Four: Whether the District Court erred in refusing to suppress evidence seized from a motorcycle saddlebag under the authority of a search warrant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b664 Stout appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress the pistol that was used to kill Bill. This Court reviews denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Marks, </em>2002 MT 255, \u00b6 10, 312 Mont. 169, 59 P.3d 369. Stout contends that the investigating officers exceeded the scope of the search warrant by seizing the gun from the saddle bag of the motorcycle in the garage. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and the interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Marks, </em>2002 MT 255, \u00b6 10, 312 Mont. 169, 59 P.3d 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b665 When officers arrived at the Stout residence and determined that Bill had been shot, they sought and obtained a search warrant. The warrant authorized the officers to search for \u201cany firearm that could be related to the death of William Lee Stout.\u201d The warrant described the places to be searched as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">in and upon the premises residence, outbuildings and vehicles of William Lee Stout and Anne Marie Stout, located at 266 Trapper Meadow Road, Darby, MT 59840 and described as a single story single family dwelling of frame construction with natural wood colored siding and having brown asphalt shingle roofing with a partial basement and an attached garage. The residence has a \u201cGone Fishing\u201d sign on the east side of the door. The vehicles of William Stout and Anne Marie Stout are one red 2000 Ford truck ..., one 1995 green Chevrolet Suburban ..., one 2000 White Trails West Horse Trailer ..., and one black Honda passenger car ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au5\">The warrant concluded that the Justice of the Peace was \u201csatisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the property described [i.e., the gun and other items that were the object of the search] is in the said premises residence, outbuilding, and vehicles of William Stout and Anne Marie Stout described above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b666 Stout contends that the officers could not search the saddlebags of the motorcycle found inside the garage because the motorcycle was not specifically listed in the search warrant as a one of the Stout vehicles. Stout does not contend that there was not probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>issue the search warrant or that the items to be seized were not properly described. Her contention is that the officers exceeded the scope of the warrant by looking into the motorcycle saddlebag. The District Court denied Stout\u2019s motion to suppress, holding that the premises to be searched were described with particularity as including the attached garage, and that \u201ca search of the garage and whatever containers and receptacles were located in the garage that might hold a firearm related to the death of Bill Stout was permissible.\u201d The District Court also concluded that the warrant authorization to search the \u201cvehicles of William Lee Stout and Anne Marie Stout\u201d was \u201csufficiently particular to include the motorcycle at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b667 Stout cites and quotes only marginally relevant cases dealing with warrantless searches, but her primary contention is that since the warrant lists several specific vehicles, the general authorization in the warrant to search \u201cvehicles\u201d must be read to apply only to the ones specifically listed. She contends that the \u201cwarrant\u2019s plain language excluded [the motorcycle] from the authorized search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b668  We cannot adopt Stout\u2019s cribbed reading of the warrant. The warrant authorized a search of the premises, specifically including the garage and vehicles. Under established law that alone would be sufficient to permit the search of any vehicles found on the premises. U.S. <em>v. Percival, </em>756 F.2d 600, 612 (7th Cir. 1985); <em>U.S. v. Duque, </em>62 F.3d 1146, 1151 (9th Cir. 1995); <em>U.S. v. Gamboa, </em>439 F.3d 796, 807 (8th Cir. 2006). The fact that the warrant went on and described four particular vehicles does not alter the conclusion that the motorcycle bags were subject to search. While Stout argues that the warrant should be construed to allow a search of the listed vehicles and only the listed vehicles, the warrant does not say that. We see no reason to add language to an otherwise valid and particular warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b669 The District Court properly denied the motion to suppress and properly admitted the evidence of the pistol at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b670 <em>Issue Five: Whether the District Court had jurisdiction to order that the sentence be modified after conclusion of the appeal to include costs of appellate counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b671 Following Stout\u2019s conviction, the District Court entered an Amended Judgment and Commitment sentencing her to life in prison. The District Court also ordered her to pay the costs of her public defender in the amount of $57,127. That amount of reimbursement was stipulated between the prosecution and Stout, and she does not contest this order. Five days later the District Court entered a second order re-stating the stipulated amount and further ordering that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>amount \u201cshall be increased, if her conviction is affirmed, on appeal, by assessing all hours incurred by the Montana Office of Public Defender attorneys from January 1,2009, until completion of the appeal.\u201d Stout contends on appeal that the District Court lacked power to order the sentence to be so modified in the future. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b672 This Court reviews sentence conditions for legality. <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, \u00b6 13, 347 Mont. 95, 197 P.3d 966. Section 46-8-113, MCA, allows a court to impose repayment of the costs of assigned counsel as a condition of a sentence, limited to \u201ccosts incurred by the office of state public defender ... for providing the defendant with counsel in the criminal proceeding.\u201d The District Court was within its power under this statute ordering Stout to reimburse the defense costs of $57,127 incurred through the trial. However, the subsequent order that the amount could be increased if there were an appeal and if the conviction were affirmed failed to specify the amount of reimbursement required. It also failed to specify how disputes over the reimbursement amount would be resolved and how the amount of reimbursement would be memorialized in a sentencing document.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajj\">\u00b673 Therefore, it is clear that at some point in the future the District Court would have to modify the sentence as to reimbursement of defense costs. However, \u201cno statutory authority exists for the District Court to reserve authority for itself to modify the sentence regarding reimbursement of court-appointed counsel once it has been imposed. The District Court lacks the authority to revisit the matter at a latter hearing.\u201d <em>State v. Hirt, </em>2005 MT 285, \u00b6 20, 329 Mont. 267, 124 P.3d 147. It is evident that the portion of the order requiring reimbursement of appeal costs would require the District Court to revisit the matter in the future. Therefore any portion of the sentence below that requires Stout to pay reimbursement for \u201call hours incurred by the Montana Officer of Public Defender attorneys from January 1, 2009, until completion of the appeal\u201d is hereby vacated. However, the District Court could, upon a proper record and by specifying the amount, order restitution for future costs. <em>See e.g. State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495.

Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b675 I disagree with the Court\u2019s broad application of the transaction rule (\u00a7 26-1-103, MCA) in this case and therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s decision as to Issue Two. But rather than simply concede that the transaction rule has finally swallowed Rule 404(b) of the Montana Rules of Evidence, I have elected to critically evaluate this Court\u2019s interpretation of Rule 404(b) to determine if our jurisprudence is consistent with the rule\u2019s language and its historical underpinnings. Based on my research, I have concluded that <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957 (1979), <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52 (1991), and their progeny have strayed far afield from the narrow purpose of Rule 404(b). Moreover, this Court\u2019s approach to Rule 404(b) has unnecessarily cabined the admission of a broad range of evidence that Rule 404(b) actually allows-including, as here, evidence of plan, preparation, and identity. My research has led me to conclude that the most necessary and salutary requirements of <em>Just </em>and <em>Matt </em>are the procedural ones-notice to the defense and cautionary instructions when evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is or has been offered. These requirements ensure that the defendant is not blindsided at trial and that the jury is clearly instructed that the evidence is being admitted, not to prove that the defendant acted in conformity with her character, but rather to prove some other material issue in the case. If the Attorney General and the courts adopt the approach suggested below, I believe that prosecutors will be more inclined to use Rule 404(b). And I am hopeful that this Court will be more inclined to enforce Rule 404(b), in lieu of permitting expansion of the transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b676 Accordingly, my arguments herein are twofold. First, I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence of Stout\u2019s so-called harassment campaign was admissible under the transaction rule. This is not to say that the evidence was not admissible under any legal theory at all. To the contrary, I believe this evidence could have been admitted under Rule 404(b), not \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. This is a critical distinction. Evidence admitted under Rule 404(b) is subject to certain substantive and procedural safeguards, <em>see Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142-43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>814 P.2d at 56, which the prosecution flagrantly disregarded in this case. In contrast, evidence admitted under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, is not subject to these same safeguards. In fact, this statute has been used by prosecutors with increasing frequency as a virtual free pass to introduce evidence of uncharged misconduct without having to contend with the inconveniences of notice, a reasoned legal argument explaining the purpose for which the evidence is being offered, and cautionary instructions-all of which are required by <em>Matt. </em>A prosecutor need only recite the talismanic phrase, \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the criminal transaction,\u201d and the perceived Red Sea of obstacles to the admission of the uncharged misconduct evidence miraculously parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b677 Yet, recognizing the dangers posed by such unrestrained use of the transaction rule, we have cautioned that \u201c[t]he transaction rule must not be expanded to the point that the prohibition of character evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b) is swallowed,\u201d <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 46, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776, and we have accordingly limited the admission of evidence under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, to evidence that is \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to a fact in dispute, <em>State v. Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, \u00b6\u00b6 25-30, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152. My disagreement with the Court\u2019s approach in this case, therefore, is its distortion of the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d standard. In my view, it is absurd and totally disingenuous to maintain, as the Court does, that the evidence of Stout\u2019s harassment campaign met this standard simply because it was \u201cevidence of the crime.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 45. All probative evidence offered by the prosecution is \u201cevidence of the crime.\u201d Thus, it appears that we are simply pretending to require an \u201cinextricable\u201d connection between the proffered transaction evidence and \u201ca fact in dispute\u201d and that we have no intention of consistently enforcing actual compliance with this standard\u2019s true meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b678 Second, as alluded to above, this case highlights an even bigger problem with our jurisprudence under Rule 404(b) and the transaction rule-namely, that we have utterly confounded the distinctions between Rule 404(b) and \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Indeed, today\u2019s decision effects the most substantial encroachment ever by \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, on the evidentiary realm of Rule 404(b). In holding that the evidence of Stout\u2019s harassment campaign-which is classic Rule 404(b) evidence-is admissible under the transaction rule, the Court treats these two rules as coextensive, applying to the very same categories of evidence. Of course, given the choice, the proponent of the uncharged misconduct evidence will always choose the transaction rule-the path of least resistance-over Rule 404(b). Thus, the Court has effectively consigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Rule 404(b) to obscurity and dealt a fatal blow to the safeguards of <em>Matt. </em>Henceforth, a prosecutor seeking to present evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident (the purposes expressly recognized in Rule 404(b)) may simply bypass Rule 404(b) altogether and, citing today\u2019s decision, get the evidence admitted under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. This approach is intolerable, not only because it promotes sloppy practice by prosecutors, but also because it encourages juries to convict on the improper basis of the accused\u2019s bad character and supposed propensity for unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b679 Yet, as noted, a critical analysis of our jurisprudence under <em>Just </em>and <em>Matt </em>reveals that the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule is partly to blame for this untenable situation. As I explain below, this rule creates certain barriers to the legitimate use of uncharged misconduct evidence and, thus, actually encourages prosecutors and courts to resort to alternative schemes-such as the transaction rule-in order to get the evidence admitted, even though Rule 404(b) clearly governs. Therefore, since it is not only preferable but mandatory that safeguards be followed when evidence of uncharged misconduct is admitted, I would revise the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule so that it conforms to the actual purpose and scope of Rule 404(b). This presumably would make Rule 404(b) more accessible to proponents of uncharged misconduct evidence and would eliminate the intellectually dishonest approach of admitting such evidence under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA-a statute that was effectively supplanted, in any event, when the Rules of Evidence were adopted. \u00b680 I address these points below, first discussing Rule 404(b) and the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, and then discussing the Court\u2019s approach today under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II. Rule <em>404(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b681 Again, my primary disagreement with the Court\u2019s decision is our increasing propensity to allow more and more evidence to be admitted under the transaction rule at the expense of Rule 404(b) and its safeguards. I completely agree with the Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[ajpplication of the transaction rule should not be used to avoid Rule 404 and the notice and instruction requirements it specifies.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 39.1 also agree with the statement that \u201cthe prosecutor is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>to conform to the Montana Rules of Evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Opinion, \u00b6 46. To this end, I believe that any evidence which falls within the scope of Rule 404(b) <em>must </em>be admitted pursuant to the requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule (with two exceptions, noted below) and that the proponent of the evidence may not circumvent those requirements by way of the transaction rule. In other words, the transaction rule and Rule 404(b) do <em>not </em>overlap, but rather apply to mutually exclusive categories of evidence-something we have already suggested in prior cases. <em>See e.g. State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 26, 85 P.3d 753 (noting that there is a \u201cdistinction\u201d between Rule 404(b) evidence and transaction rule evidence). Thus, my argument is not that we must draw a line between \u201cthe evidence without which the conviction could not occur and all other evidence offered by the prosecution.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47. Rather, the line to be drawn is between Rule 404(b) evidence and transaction rule evidence. We must make that line clear, and we must consistently enforce compliance with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b682 In this regard, I noted in my <em>Guill </em>concurrence that \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, is actually a mid-1800s statute that applied in <em>civil </em>litigation, not <em>criminal </em>prosecutions. It originated in David Dudley Field\u2019s <em>The Code of Civil Procedure of the State of New York, </em>Part IV (published in 1850). <em>See Guill, </em>\u00b6 50 (Nelson, J., concurring). In the 1990s, this Court attributed the doctrines of res gestae and corpus delicti (from which the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d standard originates) to \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, and began applying this statute in <em>criminal </em>cases. <em>See State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. In so doing, however, we completely overlooked the fact that Rule 404(b), as the later provision (it was adopted in 1976), prevails over \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, to the extent of any inconsistency or overlap. <em>Cf. Oster v. Valley County, </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 76, 140 P.3d 1079 (statutes relating to the same subject must be harmonized as much as possible, giving effect to each); <em>Ross v. City of Great Falls, </em>1998 MT 276, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 377, 967 P.2d 1103 (where the terms and necessary operation of a later statute cannot be harmonized with the terms and effect of an earlier statute, the earlier statute is impliedly repealed). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Indeed, the Montana Rules of Evidence supplanted all common law doctrines and statutory provisions governing evidentiary matters to which the Rules of Evidence applied. This Court adopted the Rules of Evidence pursuant to the authority granted by Article VII, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution. <em>See </em>Chapter Compiler\u2019s Comments to Title 26, chapter 10, MCA, at 163 (2008 Annotations). And, acting under that same authority, this Court declared various statutory sections to have been superseded by the Rules of Evidence. <em>See id. </em>We noted that upon the adoption of the Rules of Evidence, these statutory sections were \u201crendered obsolete, unnecessary and redundant,\u201d and we explained that \u201cthe continued presence of said sections as a part of the law of Montana tends to lead to confusion, uncertainty and conflict in the law, all of which are contrary to the spirit and purpose of the Montana Rules of Evidence and the ends of justice.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Given the \u201cconfusion, uncertainty and conflict in the law\u201d created by \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, it is unfortunate that we did not include this provision in the list of superseded statutes. But the clear implication of not declaring this statute to have been superseded by the Rules of Evidence is that the statute must apply to a category of evidence to which the Rules of Evidence do <em>not </em>apply. In other words, as suggested at the outset, Rule 404(b) and \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, may be harmonized by interpreting them as applying to mutually exclusive categories of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b683 What the Court fails to recognize or accept in the present case is that the evidence in question (Stout\u2019s harassment campaign) is Rule 404(b) evidence and, therefore, cannot be admitted pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Rule 404(b) controls. The problem, and the reason for much of the confusion in our Rule 404(b)/transaction rule jurisprudence, is that the Court has lost sight of Rule 404(b)\u2019s scope and purpose. Thus, it is necessary to review the function of this rule and the evidence to which it applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">A. Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b684 The fundamental purpose of Rule 404 is to prohibit a party from introducing evidence of a person\u2019s character to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. Specifically, Rule 404(a) states that \u201c[e]vidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.\u201d Likewise, Rule 404(b) states that \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Evidence of character, disposition, or propensity is prohibited not because it is irrelevant, but because \u201cit is said to weigh too much with the jury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.\u201d <em>Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 476, 69 S. Ct. 213, 218 (1948). Experience has taught that the introduction of character evidence creates an unacceptable risk that the trier of fact will be tempted, at least on a subconscious level, to penalize the defendant for his or her past misdeeds. <em>See </em>Edward J. Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 1:03, 9 (rev. ed., West 1998); <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 180-81, 117 S. Ct. 644, 650-51 (1997) (the risk of propensity evidence is that the jury will convict for crimes other than those charged or that, uncertain of guilt, the jury will convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment); Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 4:28, 746 (3d ed., Thomson/West 2007) (\u201cThe risk [is] that a jury will draw a deadly and decidedly improper three-step inference, from bad act to bad person to guilty person, or give way to the emotional impulse to punish because the other act alone shows that punishment is deserved.\u201d). This conflicts with the basic tenet of our system of justice that a defendant may be convicted and punished only for the criminal act charged, not for his or her character or for other, uncharged acts. <em>See </em>Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 1:03, 9, \u00a7 2:19, 104-05.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u00b685 At the same time, however, Rule 404(a) acknowledges certain exceptions to the general rule barring character evidence. For example, Rule 404(a)(1) states that evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, may be admissible. (Rule 405, in turn, governs the methods of proving character.) Similarly, while Rule 404(b) bars evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts \u201cto prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,\u201d the rule states that such evidence may be admissible \u201cfor other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d The term \u201csuch as\u201d indicates that this list is illustrative, not exhaustive. <em>See Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 141-42, 814 P.2d at 55-56; Commission Comments to Title 26, chapter 10, Rule 404, MCA, at 278-79 (2008 Annotations); Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 3:01, 2 (it is \u201cvirtually impossible to completely catalogue all the permissible theories of independent relevance\u201d for which other-acts evidence may be offered under Rule 404(b)); Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 4:28, 744 (the list in Rule 404(b) is \u201cnonexclusive\u201d); <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 190, 753 (Kenneth S. Broun, 6th ed., Thomson/West 2006) (there are numerous uses to which evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be put, and those enumerated in the rule \u201care neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive\u201d). And the critical point of Rule 404(b), therefore, is that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible for various purposes <em>except </em>to show action in conformity with character. In other words, \u201cRule 404(b) bars not evidence as such, but a theory of admissibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Crowder, </em>141 F.3d 1202, 1206 (D.C.Cir. 1998). Indeed, Rule 404(b) is \u201csimply a special application of the doctrine of multiple admissibility,\u201d under which \u201cevidence that is inadmissible for one purpose is not to be excluded if it is admissible for some other purpose unless the judge, in his discretion, determines that the danger of its prejudicial use for the improper purpose outweighs its legitimate probative value.\u201d Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence </em>vol. 22, \u00a7 5239, 435-36 (West 1978). Rule 404(b) admits evidence of other acts \u201cwhenever it is relevant without using the inference of character anywhere in the chain of inference,\u201d i.e., if the evidence \u201cproves a material issue without requiring any inference to the defendant\u2019s criminal disposition.\u201d <em>Id., </em>2010 Supp., \u00a7 5239, 540; <em>see also </em>David P. Leonard, <em>The New Wigmore: Evidence of Other Misconduct and Similar Events </em>\u00a7 4.4,231-32 (Aspen Publishers 2009) (explaining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>other-acts evidence may be admitted under a theory that avoids any character-based propensity inference).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">B. Scope</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b686 Turning to the question of scope, Rule 404(b) provides, in full, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Other crimes, wrongs, acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In determining the category of evidence to which this rule applies, the following three facets of its language and underlying policies are instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u00b687 First, Rule 404(b) refers to \u201cother\u201d crimes, wrongs, or acts, which \u201c[i]n this context... means acts \u2018other than\u2019 the act(s) specified in the pleading: crimes other than those alleged in the indictment and torts other than those averred in the complaint.\u201d Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 2:11, 57; <em>accord </em>Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239, 445; <em>see also People v. Gordon, </em>212 Cal. Rptr. 174, 188 (Cal. App. 3d Dist. 1985) (an act is uncharged if it falls outside the accusatory pleading, which can happen when the act testified to either involves a different actus reus or occurred at a time different than the charged offense), <em>disapproved on other grounds, People v. Frazer, </em>982 P.2d 180, 198 (Cal. 1999). It makes no difference whether the uncharged act took place before or after the charged act-although for some evidentiary purposes, a subsequent act would be irrelevant while a prior act would not (e.g., to show knowledge at a particular point in time). <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239, 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u00b688 Second, Rule 404(b) refers to \u201ccrimes, wrongs, or acts.\u201d These three terms \u201care obviously not coextensive. The last term is the broadest and includes the prior two concepts.\u201d Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 2:02,4. Hence, \u201cit would have been more precise if the drafters of Rule 404(b) had used the language, \u2018other acts, including crimes and civil wrongs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that \u201cthe act need not be either a crime or a civil wrong such as a tort or breach of contract.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 4:28,747 (\u201c[W]e are talking about <em>acts, </em>so it does not matter whether they were criminal or not, and certainly it does not matter whether they led to charges or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>convictions.\u201d); Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 404.20[2][a], 404-42 (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed., Matthew Bender &amp; Co. 2010) (\u201cRule 404(b)\u2019s terminology \u2018other crimes, wrongs, or acts\u2019 includes conduct that is neither criminal nor unlawful if it is relevant to a consequential fact.\u201d). Indeed, Rule 404(b) applies to any conduct, criminal or noncriminal, that \u201ceffectively impugns\u201d or \u201creflects negatively\u201d on the defendant\u2019s character. <em>See </em>Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 2:15, 81; Leonard, <em>The New Wigmore: Evidence of Other Misconduct and Similar Events </em>\u00a7 4.6,270; <em>see also Huddleston v. United States, 485 </em>U.S. 681, 685, 108 S. Ct. 1496, 1499 (1988) (Rule 404(b) \u201cgenerally prohibits the introduction of evidence of extrinsic acts that might adversely reflect on the actor\u2019s character\u201d); Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure:Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239,456-57 (\u201cother acts\u201d includes \u201cany conduct, good or bad, that tend[s] to show the character of the person involved\u201d). This is so because the policies underlying Rule 404(b)\u2019s general prohibition come into play \u201cwhenever, as a practical matter, the evidence amounts to an attack on the defendant\u2019s character,\u201d which in turn \u201cmight tempt the jury to decide the case against the defendant on an improper basis.\u201d Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 2:15, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b689 Third, although it may seem self-evident, it is important to stress that the purpose of offering evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts under Rule 404(b) is (from the prosecutor\u2019s perspective) to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt of the charged act. <em>See </em>id., \u00a7 6:18, 46-47 (\u201c[T]he prosecutor ordinarily offers uncharged misconduct as evidence on the historical merits of the case,\u201d i.e., \u201cto prove essential elements of the charged crime\u201d or \u201cto rebut affirmative defenses on the merits.\u201d). In this regard, Professor Imwinkelried explains that a crime, under the conventional definition, consists of an actus reus, a mens rea, and proof of the defendant\u2019s identity as the person who committed the actus reus and possessed the mens rea. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 3:01, 3. Other-acts evidence, in turn, may be used to establish each of these elements. <em>See generally id., </em>chs. 3, 4, and 5; <em>accord </em>Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239, 460 (evidence may be offered under Rule 404(b) to prove \u201cthat the allegedly criminal act took place,\u201d \u201cthat the accused was the actor,\u201d and \u201cthat the accused had the requisite mental state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b690 With respect to identity, for example, other-acts evidence may be used to show that the defendant attempted to cast suspicion on a third party, which indicates consciousness of guilt, which in turn is evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>that the defendant is the person who committed the crime. Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 3:04,10-11. Likewise, proof that the defendant entertained a plan that included the commission of the charged crime is logically relevant to show the defendant\u2019s identity as the criminal, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 3:21, 112, as well as the doing of the criminal act and the defendant\u2019s intent, <em>see McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 190, 755. Thus, the prosecutor may prove any uncharged act by the defendant which shows that the defendant in fact and in mind formed a plan that included the charged and uncharged acts as stages in the plan\u2019s execution. Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, </em>\u00a7 3:22,115.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For instance, the defendant\u2019s theft of a car can be used to show the defendant\u2019s plan to use the car as a getaway vehicle in a kidnapping or a robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 115-16. Or, in the present case, the uncharged acts that made up Stout\u2019s harassment campaign (spurious emails and letters, hang-up phone calls, and acts of petty vandalism) show Stout\u2019s plan to kill her husband-apparently for financial gain, or for retribution for Bill\u2019s affair with Barbara Miller, or for both-and \u201cdrag a red herring across the trail of the investigation\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 44). They are also evidence of \u201cpreparatory acts\u201d Stout took to commit the homicide and cast suspicion on a third party (Miller), which is logically relevant to the issue of Stout\u2019s identity as the perpetrator of the crime, <em>see </em>Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, </em>\u00a7 3:25,137, and to the issue of whether she shot Bill purposely or knowingly, <em>see id., </em>\u00a7 5:37,112 (\u201cIf the defendant has prepared to commit the charged crime, the preparation raises the probability that the defendant committed the act with mens rea.\u201d). These are legitimate \u201cother purpose\u201d uses of other-acts evidence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Rule 404(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b691 The Court contends that evidence which serves to \u201ccomplete the picture\u201d or \u201cprovide essential context\u201d of the offense is admissible under the transaction rule. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 45. It is noteworthy, therefore, that among the various permissible purposes for admitting other-acts evidence <em>under Rule 404(b) </em>(such as plan, motive, and opportunity), Professor McCormick lists first: \u201cTo complete the story of the crime on trial by placing it in the context of nearby and nearly contemporaneous happenings,\u201d which he notes is often referred to as \u201csame transaction\u201d or \u201cres gestae\u201d evidence. <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 190, 754. McCormick states that this rationale for admission should be applied only when reference to the uncharged acts is \u201cessential\u201d to \u201ca coherent and intelligible description of the offense at bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under this interpretation, evidence <em>may be </em>offered under Rule 404(b) for contextual purposes (so long as it does not involve drawing an impermissible propensity inference based on character).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b692 In summary, Rule 404(b) covers a wide array of evidence but serves a very narrow purpose. It applies to all \u201cother\u201d crimes, wrongs, and acts, which are crimes, wrongs, and acts-whether criminal, noncriminal, wrongful, or nonwrongful-that have not been charged as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>an offense (i.e., are not charged in the information). But Rule 404(b) does not come into play unless the proffered evidence has a tendency to impugn the defendant\u2019s character. Recall that \u201cRule 404(b) bars not evidence as such, but a theory of admissibility.\u201d <em>Crowder, </em>141 F.3d at 1206. The rule prohibits using evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to show action in conformity with character on a particular occasion, but the rule provides that such evidence may be admissible for various other purposes, \u201csuch as\u201d proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. Restated, Rule 404(b) \u201cgenerally provid[es] for the admission of all evidence of other acts that is relevant to an issue in trial, excepting only evidence offered to prove criminal propensity.\u201d Weinstein &amp; Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 404.20[3], 404-46.11. Thus, the critical issue is whether the proffered other-acts evidence \u201cproves a material issue without requiring any inference to the defendant\u2019s criminal disposition.\u201d Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence, </em>2010 Supp., \u00a7 5239, 540. If it does, then Rule 404(b) allows (i.e., does not exclude) the evidence, though the evidence must then be subjected to balancing under Rule 403. <em>See </em>Weinstein &amp; Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 404.21[l][a], 404-46.15 (to be admissible, the evidence \u201c(1) must be relevant to an issue other than character or the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the charged offense; and (2) must satisfy the balancing test imposed by Rule 403\u201d). Conversely, \u201cif the necessary logical steps [in the proponent\u2019s theory of admissibility] include an inference of general character or propensity, or if it seems likely that the proof will be <em>used </em>to support such an inference,\u201d then the principle of exclusion applies. Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 4:28, 746-47. What all this boils down to is that other-acts evidence is admissible if it is relevant (Rules 401 and 402), if its probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence (Rule 403), and so long as its use at trial does not involve an inference of propensity based on character (Rule 404(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">C. The Modified <em>Just </em>Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b693 The State argues that the evidence of Stout\u2019s harassment campaign was admissible to show plan and preparation. For the reasons discussed above, the State is correct. The spurious emails and letters, the hang-up phone calls, and the petty vandalism are classic evidence of plan and preparation, which went to show Stout\u2019s identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>as the perpetrator of Bill\u2019s death, as well as her intent to cause the death purposely or knowingly. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA (a person commits deliberate homicide if the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being). Also for the reasons discussed above, this evidence falls squarely within the parameters of Rule 404(b). The spurious emails and letters, the hang-up phone calls, and the petty vandalism are all crimes, wrongs, or acts that were not charged as offenses in this case and, as such, are \u201cother\u201d crimes, wrongs, or acts. Moreover, they tend to impugn and reflect negatively on Stout\u2019s character, thus implicating Rule 404(b)\u2019s proscription on using the evidence to prove that she acted in conformity with a bad character on the night in question. The prosecution thus was required to show that the evidence was being offered for some other permissible purpose; and, as just noted, other permissible purposes exist here, such as plan, preparation, and identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b694 The problem is that the admission of other-acts evidence in Montana is presently governed by the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, which would not have allowed the evidence of Stout\u2019s harassment campaign to be admitted. Indeed, there are problematic aspects of this rule which have created misconceptions regarding the scope of Rule 404(b), and I believe that we therefore should revise the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule in the manner suggested below.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b695 This Court articulated the original <em>Just </em>Rule in <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957 (1979). The defendant (Just) was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent based in part on evidence of his prior, uncharged acts against the victim. All of those acts were sexual in nature, all of them involved the same victim, most of them involved exactly the type of sexual contact with which Just had been charged, and they all occurred on a \u201cregular\u201d basis during the three-year period prior to the charged act. On appeal, Just challenged the introduction of this evidence, which prompted this Court to articulate \u201ca four element test to determine the admissibility of evidence of other crimes or acts [in] criminal prosecutions such as the one here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268-69, 602 P.2d at 961. The test contained four substantive requirements for admissibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">1. The similarity of crimes or acts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">2. nearness in time; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">3. tendency to establish a common scheme, plan or system; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">4. the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by the prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 268-69,602 P.2d at 961. The Court also adopted three procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">(a) Evidence of other crimes may not be received unless there has been notice to the defendant that such evidence is to be introduced. The procedures set forth in section 46-18-503 MCA should serve as guidelines for the form and content of such notice. Additionally, the notice to the defendant shall include a statement as to the purposes for which such evidence is to be admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">(b) At the time of the introduction of such evidence, the trial court shall explain to the jury the purpose of such evidence and shall admonish it to weigh the evidence only for such purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">(c) In its final charge, the court should instruct the jury in unequivocal terms that such evidence was received only for the limited purposes earlier stated and that the defendant is not being tried and may not be convicted for any offense except that charged, warning them that to convict for other offenses may result in unjust double punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 274, 602 P.2d at 963-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00b696 Of particular concern here are the first three substantive requirements of this test (similarity, nearness in time, and tendency to establish a common scheme, plan, or system). These criteria were derived from this Court\u2019s other-crimes-or-acts cases decided prior to the adoption of Rule 404(b). <em>See id. </em>at 267-68, 602 P.2d at 960. And while the <em>Just </em>Court characterized Rule 404(b) as a recent codification of these criteria,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>see id. </em>at 268, 602 P.2d at 960, the fact is that the <em>Just </em>Rule was much narrower than Rule 404(b). Whereas Rule 404(b) provides that other-acts evidence may be admissible for various nonpropensity purposes, \u201csuch as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident,\u201d the <em>Just </em>Rule allowed the introduction of such evidence for only one purpose: \u201cto establish a common scheme, plan or system.\u201d It should also be noted that unlike the <em>Just </em>Rule, there is no express requirement in Rule 404(b) that the uncharged act must always be \u201csimilar\u201d and \u201cnear in time\u201d to the charged act.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u00b697 Not surprisingly, 12 years after deciding <em>Just, </em>we observed that application of the <em>Just </em>Rule had \u201cresulted in an apparent narrowing of the purposes listed in Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>State v. Matt. </em>249 Mont. 136, 141, 814 P.2d 52, 55 (1991). As an example of this, we cited <em>State v. Brown, </em>242 Mont. 506, 791 P.2d 1384 (1990), where the Court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>other-acts evidence at issue was inadmissible because the prosecution had failed to establish a common scheme, plan, or system. We noted in <em>Matt </em>that the <em>Brown </em>Court had failed to address the dissent\u2019s argument that the evidence was admissible to show the defendant\u2019s opportunity, motive, and intent. <em>See Matt, </em>249 Mont, at 141-42, 814 P.2d at 56. In this regard, we acknowledged that other-acts evidence \u201cmay be admissible for many other purposes, including those specifically listed in Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. Consequently, while observing that \u201cthe four element rule of <em>Just </em>was proper under the facts of that case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 141, 814 P.2d at 55, we modified the rule\u2019s third substantive criterion to \u201cincorporate! ] the various purposes described in Rule 404(b), and therefore eliminate! ] the limitation that evidence is admissible only if it shows a common scheme, plan or system,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. Hence, that criterion now states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">(3) The evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. We similarly revised the fourth substantive criterion to conform to the language of Rule 403. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b698 Yet, while we modified <em>Just\u2019s </em>third substantive criterion to make it consistent with the scope of Rule 404(b), the <em>Matt </em>Court wholly failed to consider whether requiring compliance with the first two substantive criteria for <em>all </em>other-acts evidence is consistent with the purpose of Rule 404(b). I conclude that it is not. Indeed, \u201cthe prevailing view in the United States is that even dissimilar acts can be logically relevant and admissible on an uncharged misconduct theory.\u201d Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 2:13, 77. Notably, Professor Imwinkelried cites Montana as a jurisdiction that is out of sync with the rest of the country on this issue. <em>See id. </em>at n. 2 (citing <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52). He notes that there is an extensive body of caselaw admitting dissimilar acts for such purposes as proving the defendant\u2019s identity, intent, and motive. <em>Id. </em>at 77. He then goes on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">It is true that in some cases, dissimilar acts are properly excluded. For example, one of the permissible uses of uncharged misconduct evidence is to identify the defendant by showing that the defendant committed an uncharged act with a modus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>operandi strikingly similar to that of the charged act. When offered for this purpose, the uncharged act must be similar in the extreme to the charged act. The uncharged act is logically irrelevant for that purpose unless there is a high degree of similarity between the two acts. But in such cases, the act is excluded because it is logically irrelevant and not merely because it is dissimilar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">The test should be logical relevance rather than similarity. The better view is that the judge should demand proof of similarity only if the proponent\u2019s theory of logical relevance assumes similarity. There are numerous situations in which dissimilar crimes are logically relevant. In some jurisdictions, the defendant\u2019s narcotics abuse is admissible to establish the motive for theft offenses such as robbery; the expensive drug habit supplies the financial need that motivates the theft. Other courts would unhesitatingly admit evidence of the defendant\u2019s theft of a car to be used in a subsequent kidnap attempt; the prior theft is logically relevant to show the defendant\u2019s overall plan. If a defendant on trial for murder attempts to suborn pexjury, the attempted subornation is admissible to prove the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt of the charged crime. In none of these cases is the uncharged act \u201csimilar\u201d to the charged act. However, in all these cases, the uncharged act is logically relevant and may qualify under the uncharged misconduct doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 77-78 (footnotes omitted); <em>accord </em>Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 4:35, 842 (\u201cOther crimes or acts can suggest a plan to commit the charged crime even though they are different in nature from the charged offense. Stealing weapons or a car can indicate a plan to commit bank robbery, for example, since the weapons may be needed for the robbery and the car may be intended for use in making a getaway.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b699 This approach is clearly correct and consistent with the purpose of Rule 404(b), which is not to admit or exclude evidence of uncharged acts based on similarity, but rather is to preclude using evidence of other acts (whether similar or dissimilar) to establish a propensity inference based on character. Recall that Rule 404(b)\u2019s first sentence has two components. Under the first component, uncharged acts may not be used \u201cto prove the character of a person.\u201d Thus, the prosecutor may not prove that the defendant is inclined to wrongdoing in general or that the defendant tends to commit a particular type of wrongdoing (such as rape or burglary). Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2:19, 103. But the prohibition on this type of proof is not total. According to the sentence\u2019s second component, proof of a person\u2019s character is barred only when, in turn, character is used \u201cin order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Thus, the prohibition comes into play only when the prosecutor uses character as \u201ca way station on the road to an ultimate inference of conduct in conformity with character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103-04. Stated differently, Rule 404(b) expressly prohibits only one theory of logical relevance, which may be depicted as follows: the defendant\u2019s uncharged act -&gt; the defendant\u2019s subjective character, disposition, or propensity -&gt; the defendant\u2019s conduct in conformity with his or her character. <em>See id. </em>at 104. Rule 404(b) is implicated whenever the other-acts evidence has a tendency to lead the jury into this forbidden propensity inference. But that can happen from both similar and dissimilar uncharged acts. On one hand, the prosecutor might offer evidence that the defendant previously committed a crime <em>similar </em>to the charged offense, which could lead the jury improperly to infer that because she did it once, she did it again. On the other hand, the prosecutor might offer evidence that the defendant previously committed a crime <em>dissimilar </em>to the charged offense, which likewise could lead the jury improperly to infer that because she committed the previous crime, the defendant is inclined to wrongdoing or is generally a criminal and, as such, is more likely to have committed the charged offense. But in both instances, the evidence would be admissible under Rule 404(b) for a nonpropensity purpose. For example, the similar crime might be admissible to show absence of mistake or accident; and the dissimilar crime (e.g., a catjacking) might be admissible to show the defendant\u2019s overall plan to use the car in the charged offense (e.g., a kidnapping), which in turn shows that he is the perpetrator of that offense and had the requisite mens rea.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b6100 Likewise, in the present case, Rule 404(b) prohibited the State from offering evidence of the spurious emails and letters, the hang-up phone calls, and the petty vandalism to prove that Stout had a bad character and acted in conformity with that character on the night in question. But Rule 404(b) allowed the State to present this evidence for another purpose, such as proof of Stout\u2019s plan. Indeed, under the State\u2019s theory in this case, these uncharged acts were all part of Stout\u2019s plan to kill Bill and escape responsibility by shifting suspicion and blame to Barbara Miller. The fact that the acts of harassment were not \u201csimilar\u201d to the act of homicide should not have precluded the State from introducing this evidence under Rule 404(b). Whether similarity is required between the uncharged act and the charged act depends on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the particular purpose for which the evidence is offered and the proponent\u2019s theory of logical relevance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Similarity is not an inherent requirement of all purposes for which other-acts evidence might be offered, and we have muddled up our Rule 404(b) jurisprudence by suggesting in <em>Just, </em>and again in <em>Matt, </em>that Rule 404(b) only applies to or is concerned with evidence of \u201csimilar\u201d uncharged acts. A blanket rule that other-acts evidence must always be similar to the charged act is simply incorrect and should be overruled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b6101 There also is no basis in Rule 404(b) for requiring the uncharged act to be \u201cnear in time\u201d to the charged act in every case. With respect to plan, for example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">[a] master criminal may devise a long-term plan including stages separated by extended periods of time and great distances. It is true that the longer the period of time, the more difficult it is to infer a nexus between the charged and uncharged crimes. But, as a matter of logical relevance analysis, it makes no sense to adopt a categorical rule that the crimes be proximate to each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-z\">Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 3:22,116 (footnotes omitted). Indeed, the question of whether the uncharged act is too remote in time is ultimately addressed by Matt\u2019s fourth substantive requirement, which states that the evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56; <em>see also </em>M. R. Evid. 403. Thus, whether an uncharged act is truly too remote in time will depend on the particular purpose for which the evidence is offered and the proponent\u2019s theory of logical relevance; and if it has little probative value, relative to its prejudicial effect, it should be excluded on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b6102 When it comes to introducing other-acts evidence, it is preferable that prosecutors and courts comply with Rule 404(b), Rule 403, and the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule\u2019s procedural criteria (notice and cautionary instructions), rather than circumventing those requirements by way of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Yet, we have encouraged the latter approach by making the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule totally unworkable with respect to many legitimate Rule 404(b) purposes. Conditioning admissibility under Rule 404(b) on the similarity and nearness in time of the uncharged acts-criteria which, it should be recalled, originated in our pre-Rule 404(b) other-crimes-or-acts caselaw-is, in many cases, legally unsupported and only encourages the intellectually dishonest approach of resorting to the largely unrestricted transaction rule in cases where Rule 404(b) clearly governs. We therefore should jettison the first two substantive requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule and simply require the following criteria in order to admit other-acts evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">1. advance notice, as required by statute <em>(see </em>\u00a7 46-13-109, MCA);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">2. compliance with Rule 404(b): the evidence must be offered for a purpose other than to show action in conformity with character;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">3. compliance with Rule 402: the evidence must be relevant to a material issue in light of the purpose for which it is offered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">4. compliance with Rule 403: the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">5. compliance with Rule 105: the court, upon request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury that the evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted <em>(see also </em>\u00a7 46-16-401(1), MCA).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\"><em>Cf. Huddleston, </em>485 U.S. at 691-92, 108 S. Ct. at 1502 (concluding that the last four of these criteria provide appropriate protection against the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence under Rule 404(b)). This approach is faithful to our Rules of Evidence, which is certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>preferable to the arbitrary approach of <em>Just </em>and <em>Matt. </em>Furthermore, it should be noted that in meeting the second, third, and fourth of these requirements, the prosecution would have to establish the other act\u2019s similarity and nearness in time only if the prosecutor\u2019s theory of logical relevance required these showings.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">D. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b6103 To conclude this discussion, Rule 404(b) applies to any uncharged act offered into evidence that has a tendency to impugn the defendant\u2019s character. Rule 404(b) does not bar the evidence as such; rather, it bars a certain theory of admissibility. Specifically, the evidence is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith, but it may be admissible for other logically relevant purposes that do not require an inference of the defendant\u2019s criminal disposition. In the present case, for example, evidence of Stout\u2019s harassment campaign could have been admitted (if it also satisfied Rule 403, which I believe it would have) to show plan, preparation, and identity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule would have incorrectly precluded this result, and because the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule is inconsistent with Rule 404(b)\u2019s purpose and scope, I would revise this rule in the manner suggested above.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">III. Section 26-1-103, MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b6 104 Before addressing the Court\u2019s approach under the transaction rule in this case, I note two initial matters that bear on this discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">A. Inseparable, Intrinsic, or Inextricably Intertwined Acts</p>\n<p id=\"AxC\">\u00b6105 Various commentators discuss the notion of \u201cintrinsic\u201d crimes, wrongs, or acts and whether these are covered by Rule 404(b). For instance, Professors Wright and Graham offer the example of a victim who testifies in a rape prosecution that the defendant broke into her apartment and forced her to have sexual relations at gunpoint. <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239, 445. This testimony can be said to describe incidents of burglary, malicious destruction of property, assault, false imprisonment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>violations of firearms regulations. Wright and Graham note that the common law device for dealing with the admissibility of these uncharged acts was the doctrine of \u201cinseparable crimes,\u201d which Wigmore would have codified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">\u2018Whenever the doing of a criminal act charged appears to have been accompanied by the doing of one or more other criminal acts, so that it is not practicable to separate them in the course of producing evidence, the other acts may be proved by virtue of the principle of Multiple Admissibility * * * but not for the purpose of using them evidentially against the defendant\u2019s moral character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3r\"><em>Id. </em>at 446 (quoting Wigmore, <em>Code of Evidence, </em>81 (3d ed. 1942), and citing Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 218 (3d ed. 1940)). Wright and Graham observe that this doctrine seems justifiable when used to cover such situations as where the seller of contraband must necessarily be shown to have possessed it, or where the band of robbers is shown to have seized hostages to make good their escape from the scene of the crime, but not to admit evidence that the car used in the robbery was stolen or that the defendant in a rape prosecution pilfered his victim\u2019s jewels on the way out, and certainly not to admit evidence that merely serves to \u201cexplain\u201d the charged crime. <em>Id. </em>at 446-47.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Notably, Wigmore\u2019s approach seems to contemplate that proof of \u201cinseparable\u201d crimes is a permissible purpose for introducing uncharged misconduct evidence under Rule 404(b). Wright and Graham, however, suggest that when an uncharged act is \u201cso interwoven with the charged crime that it is impossible to prove one without revealing the other,\u201d it is simply not an \u201cother\u201d crime, wrong, or act within the meaning of Rule 404(b). <em>Id. </em>at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b6106 Somewhat similarly, Professor Imwinkelried explains that where the uncharged act occurred simultaneously with the charged act and the two acts are \u201crealistically inseparable\u201d or \u201cindivisible\u201d (e.g., because the witness testifying to the charged act cannot avoid mentioning the uncharged act), the uncharged act is exempt from the regular rules for the admission of other-acts evidence. <em>See </em>Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>\u00a7 6:30, 87-90. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Professors Mueller and Kirkpatrick, in contrast, argue that \u201cputting proof of inseparable crimes beyond reach of [Rule 404(b)] is unwise and wrong.\u201d Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 4:33, 818. Still, they acknowledge that when proof of the charged offense \u201ccannot avoid\u201d revealing an \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d uncharged act, it makes sense enough to say that the uncharged act is not an \u201cother\u201d crime, wrong, or act under Rule 404(b). <em>See id. </em>at 815, 818. Thus, for example, an eyewitness would be allowed to testify that the defendant struck the teller in the course of demanding the money, even though the defendant was not charged with assault or battery. <em>See id. </em>at 817-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b6107 Professor Leonard discusses the notion of \u201cintrinsic\u201d or \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d acts at some length. <em>See </em>Leonard, <em>The New Wigmore: Evidence of Other Misconduct and Similar Events, </em>ch. 5. Ultimately, he concludes that the use of these terms \u201cinvites sloppy, nonanalytical decision-making.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 5.2, 327. He argues that \u201cdescribing uncharged misconduct as either \u2018intrinsic\u2019 or \u2018extrinsic\u2019 neither provides a predictable way to determine admissibility nor conduces to the sort of analysis that needs to be undertaken to determine admissibility.\u2019\u2019/^, at 330. Indeed, he notes that courts which follow this approach \u201coften fail to take seriously the dangers associated with misconduct evidence,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5.4, 365, and \u201chave lost sight\u201d of the purposes of the limitations on the admissibility of such evidence, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5.2, 327. Leonard suggests that courts should approach intrinsic or inextricably intertwined evidence in the same way they approach extrinsic evidence: \u201cby measuring its probative value for a legitimate purpose and comparing that value to the tendency of the evidence to cause unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>See id., </em>\u00a7 5.1, 320, \u00a7 5.2, 330. In effect, all other-acts evidence would be subject to analysis under Rule 404(b) and Rule 403, regardless of whether it is categorized as \u201cintrinsic\u201d or \u201cextrinsic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b6108 The courts in <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>522 F.3d 731 (7th Cir. 2008), and <em>United States v. Bowie, </em>232 F.3d 923 (D.C. Cir. 2000), also take a dim view of the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction and the \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d formula, characterizing the latter as \u201cunhelpfully vague.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>522 F.3d at 734; <em>accord Bowie, </em>232 F.3d at 928. They note that in one respect the standard is circular (\u201cinextricably intertwined evidence is intrinsic, and evidence is intrinsic if it is inextricably intertwined\u201d), while in another respect it is overbroad (\u201c[t]he \u2018complete the story\u2019 definition of \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 threatens to override Rule 404(b)\u201d). <em>Bowie, </em>232 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>928; <em>Taylor, </em>522 F.3d at 734. Furthermore, the standard\u2019s vagueness, in turn, \u201cinvites prosecutors to expand the exceptions to [Rule 404(b)] beyond the proper boundaries of the exceptions,\u201d <em>Taylor, 522 </em>F.3d at 734, and creates \u201ca danger that finding evidence \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 may too easily slip from analysis to mere conclusion,\u201d <em>Bowie, </em>232 F.3d at 928. The critical problem with this approach, of course, is that \u201ctreating evidence as inextricably intertwined not only bypasses Rule 404(b) and its attendant notice requirement, but also carries the implicit finding that the evidence is admissible for all purposes notwithstanding its bearing on character, thus eliminating the defense\u2019s entitlement, upon request, to a jury instruction.\u201d <em>Bowie, </em>232 F.3d at 928. The <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Bowie </em>courts acknowledge that in \u201ca narrow range of circumstances,\u201d the evidence of the charged crime may \u201cunavoidably reveal\u201d the uncharged act, but they conclude that most \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d evidence properly can and should be admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b). <em>See Taylor, 522 </em>F.3d at 734-35; <em>Bowie, </em>232 F.3d at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b6109 There seems to be, then, a general recognition that in some situations, proof of the charged act will unavoidably reveal an uncharged act because the uncharged act is so interwoven with the charged act that it is simply impossible to separate them in the course of producing evidence. And much of the controversy, in turn, appears to center on whether the \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d formula is an appropriate standard for determining if the uncharged act falls into this category. Professor Leonard and the <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Bowie </em>courts make persuasive arguments for rejecting the \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d test; however, the fact is that in Montana we have a statute on the books (\u00a7 26-1-103, MCA) that must be given whatever limited meaning it deserves relative to Rule 404(b), and I recently agreed with the Court that the \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d formula is an appropriate standard for applying this statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, \u00b6\u00b6 49-55, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152 (Nelson, J., concurring). Moreover, I believe that the problem is not so much the standard itself as it is this Court\u2019s repeated manipulations of it in order to reach the desired result in the given case. Rather than continue that approach, we instead should revise the Modified <em>Just </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Rule in the manner suggested above to make Rule 404(b) more accessible and require that all but a very narrow category of other-acts evidence be admitted pursuant to the rule as revised. As suggested by our decision in <em>Guill </em>(discussed in Section C below), the authorities cited above, and the language of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, I would limit the transaction rule to uncharged crimes, wrongs, or acts that truly cannot be separated from the charged act in the course of producing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">B. The Attorney General\u2019s Double Standard</p>\n<p id=\"A8u\">\u00b6110 In this connection, the State argues for an exceptionally broad interpretation of the transaction rule in this case. Specifically, the State takes the position that evidence of \u201cthe Barbara Miller Story\u201d was admissible under the transaction rule because Bill\u2019s death \u201cleft perplexing circumstances that required explanation.\u201d Although the State recognizes that this evidence was admissible for a variety of Rule 404(b) purposes-to establish the perpetrator\u2019s \u201cidentity\u201d and \u201cmotive,\u201d and to show that Stout engaged in a long-term and persistent \u201cpreparation or planning\u201d of her husband\u2019s murder-the State maintains that the evidence was properly admitted instead as transaction evidence under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, to \u201cexplain the puzzling circumstances\u201d of Bill\u2019s death and answer the \u201cstupefying question\u201d of \u201cwhy\u201d he died and \u201cwho\u201d killed him-basically, \u201cto complete the story of murder.\u201d Thus, under the State\u2019s theory in <em>this </em>case, which the Court adopts wholesale, evidence that is merely explanatory of some facet of the charged offense-that answers the \u201cwho\u201d or the \u201cwhy\u201d of the crime, that explains any \u201cpuzzling circumstances\u201d in the case, or that \u201ccompletes the story\u201d-is admissible under the transaction rule, even if (as here) the evidence falls squarely within the parameters of Rule 404(b) and even if (as here) the evidence is of separate incidents that occurred years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b6 111 However, notwithstanding this broad interpretation, the State takes the position in <em>State v. Henson </em>(No. DA 09-0189), 2010 MT 136, 356 Mont. 458, 235 P.3d 1274, that the transaction rule should be interpreted very narrowly so as not to allow evidence of uncharged acts merely for contextual purposes, particularly if the acts were \u201cseparate incidents at different times and places.\u201d <em>See </em>Brief of Appellee at 19-22. In <em>Henson, </em>the defendant (Henson) raised the defense of justifiable use of force in the shooting death of Larry Kingsley; and in order to prove that defense, she sought (unsuccessfully) under the transaction rule to introduce \u201ccontextual evidence\u201d of Kingsley\u2019s hostile interactions with various persons on the day of his death and during the weeks preceding his death. On appeal, Henson argues that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>erred in excluding this evidence because Kingsley\u2019s interactions were \u201cvital to context\u201d and \u201cprovided an explanation for behavior which was out of the ordinary.\u201d In other words, she claims the evidence was admissible to explain \u201cwhy\u201d she shot Kingsley: \u201cWithout access to Kingsley\u2019s continuing and escalating pattern of bizarre and threatening conduct, it was difficult for Henson to provide the jury with an explanation of the bizarre and threatening situation in which she found herself with Kingsley.\u201d Henson asserts that evidence of Kingsley\u2019s prior conduct \u201cwas necessary for the jurors to evaluate Kingsley\u2019s death in its true and full context.\u201d <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 17-23; Reply Brief of Appellant at 8-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b6112 Thus, the Attorney General\u2019s Office now finds itself, ironically, having to defend against the broad interpretations of the transaction rule which it has argued, and this Court has adopted, in previous transaction rule cases. Indeed, Henson finds support for her argument in <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>2009 MT 211, \u00b6 20, 351 Mont. 282, 210 P.3d 694 (evidence that \u201cprovides context to the criminal act\u201d and \u201cserve[s] to explain\u201d why the defendant would engage in the conduct in question is admissible under the transaction rule), <em>State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 345 Mont. 469, 191 P.3d 451 (evidence of \u201cthe context in which the criminal act occurred\u201d is admissible under the transaction rule), and <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 34, 322 Mont. 350, 96 P.3d 722 (evidence illustrating the defendant\u2019s behavior subsequent to his arrest is admissible under the transaction rule \u201cin order to provide context to the criminal act\u201d). As Justice Rice notes in his <em>Henson </em>concurrence, Kingsley\u2019s threatening interactions are similar to the incidents we affirmed under the transaction rule in <em>Mackrill </em>and <em>McCaslin. Henson, </em>\u00b6 39 (Rice, J., concurring). Moreover, Henson\u2019s argument certainly would prevail under the standard articulated by the Court today. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 45 (evidence that \u201cprovidefs] the essential context to prove to the jury how and why the crime occurred\u201d is admissible under the transaction rule). And it likewise would satisfy the \u201cwhy\u201d standard argued by the State in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u00b6113 Yet, despite advocating for that broad interpretation of the transaction rule in this case, and despite arguing that classic Rule 404(b) evidence is admissible under the transaction rule in this case, the Attorney General hypocritically argues in <em>Henson </em>that there is a \u201cdistinction\u201d between transaction rule evidence and Rule 404(b) evidence and that \u201c[t]he transaction rule should not be expanded to the point that the prohibition of character evidence under Rule 404(b) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>swallowed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, in an even greater display of chutzpah, the Attorney General contends that the transaction rule is reserved for prosecutors to prove a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts and is not available to defendants to prove the acts of a third party. Defendants, rather, must follow \u201cthe applicable rules of evidence\u201d-an assertion which prompted Henson to respond that, \u201c[i]n essence, the State argues that what is good for the gander is not good for the goose.\u201d In point of fact, the double standard proffered by the Attorney General has absolutely no support in the language of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b6114 The State\u2019s inconsistent positions in <em>Henson </em>and the present case are disingenuous, if not outright duplicitous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And the State\u2019s double standard is all the more mind-boggling in light of its recent recognition in <em>State v. Knowles </em>(No. DA 09-0558) that \u201cthe \u2018role of the prosecutor is special-it is not to act as a zealous advocate, rather it is to protect the rights of citizens, including citizens accused of crime.\u2019 \u201d Brief of Appellee at 18 (quoting <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 19, 300 Mont. 381, 6 P.3d 453, in turn citing Rule 3.8 of the Montana Rules of Professional Responsibility). Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that the State was able to find support for its differing arguments (here and in Henson) in the widely varying statements this Court has made in its discussions of the transaction rule in past cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, the blame for the morass of conflicting rules and standards falls squarely on the shoulders of this Court, which continually applies the transaction rule in an inconsistent, confusing, and ad hoc manner. The State\u2019s arguments in <em>Henson </em>and the present case show that it is possible to argue diametrically opposing views regarding the breadth and use of the transaction rule in two separate cases and to support those opposing views with citations to this Court\u2019s cases. The problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>is that, with very few exceptions, we routinely pay lip service to the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d requirement and then affirm the admission of the evidence at issue because it is \u201cevidence of the crime\u201d or \u201cprovides context\u201d or is \u201cexplanatory of\u2019 something in the case. Today\u2019s decision is yet another example of this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">C. The Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b6115 Indeed, turning to the Court\u2019s decision, we recently clarified the purpose of the transaction rule and the exacting requirements for admitting evidence under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, in <em>Guill. </em>We explained that \u201c[t]he rationale for admitting transaction evidence is, first, that it is theoretically difficult to subdivide a course of conduct into discrete criminal acts and \u2018other\u2019 conduct and, second, practically speaking it is difficult for a witness to testify coherently to an event if the witness is only permitted to reference the minutely defined elements of the crime.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239,446). Thus, based on the \u201cconfluence of our recent jurisprudence, practicality, and persuasive authority,\u201d we held that to be admissible under the transaction rule, the evidence in question must be \u201cinextricably linked to\u201d or \u201cinextricably intertwined with\u201d a fact in dispute. <em>See Guill, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-30, 36, 42, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b6116 The Court acknowledges the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d standard as controlling in the present case. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 41. The plain and undisputed meaning of \u201cinextricable\u201d is \u201cincapable of being disentangled or <em>untiedMerriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>597 (10th ed., Merriam-Webster 1997). Hence, the evidence-or, more precisely, the factual matter the proponent seeks to prove with the evidence-must be so entangled or interwoven with a fact in dispute that it is simply impossible to separate them in the course of producing evidence. <em>See Guill, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>Taylor, </em>522 F.3d at 734; Wright &amp; Graham, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Evidence </em>\u00a7 5239, 446, 448. Here, Stout was charged with purposely or knowingly causing Bill\u2019s death, and the State produced evidence that she was alone with him at the time he died; that Bill was shot in the back of the head; that he was found in his bed; that the gun was found in the saddlebag of his motorcycle in the garage (thus undercutting any suicide theory); that the lights were on in the bedroom area of the house in the middle of the night (which neighbors said was unusual); that Stout stood to recover a $500,000 life insurance benefit and the home with over $500,000 in equity; that the ammunition box had been made to look like it was still full; that investigators found an unfinished laundry-washing project containing wet clothes, smelling strongly of bleach, in the laundry hamper; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>that investigators also found in the same laundry hamper a latex glove, which contained Stout\u2019s DNA on the inside and imbedded gunshot residue on the outside. It was by no means impossible, or even difficult, to present this evidence without also revealing that Stout had stalked her family and friends during the years prior to Bill\u2019s death. More to the point, it was practicable for the State\u2019s witnesses to testify as to the events of the night in question and the physical evidence described above without having to reveal the various uncharged acts comprising Stout\u2019s harassment campaign. The spurious emails and letters, the hang-up phone calls, and the acts of petty vandalism were all \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d covered by Rule 404(b), not \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b6117 Hence, if the Court applied the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d standard true to its meaning, then it would be necessary to reverse Stout\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial. But instead, the Court perversely twists the meaning of \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to broadly encompass any factual matter that is \u201cevidence of the crime\u201d or that serves to \u201ccomplete the picture\u201d or \u201cprovide essential context\u201d of the offense. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 45. This manipulation shows that this Court \u201c \u2018understand^] as well as the next court how to . . . articulate the correct legal principle, and then perversely fit into that principle a set of facts to which the principle obviously does not apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., </em>509 U.S. 443, 500, 113 S. Ct. 2711, 2742 (1993) (O\u2019Connor, White, &amp; Souter, JJ., dissenting) (ellipsis in <em>TXO Prod.) </em>(quoting <em>Garnes v. Fleming Landfill, Inc., </em>413 S.E.2d 897, 907 (W.Va. 1991)). Indeed, the Court deftly demonstrates that it can \u201c \u2018mouth the correct legal rules with ironic solemnity while avoiding those rules\u2019 logical consequences.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Garnes, </em>413 S.E.2d at 907). I cannot agree with this sort of decision-making. \u201c[C]ourts must do more than recite the [applicable] rule. They also must apply it, faithful to its letter and cognizant of the principles underlying it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 113 S. Ct. at 2741-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b6118 Setting aside the Court\u2019s utter distortion of the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d standard, the fundamental error in the Court\u2019s approach is its mistaken premise that Rule 404(b) is not implicated where the uncharged act is \u201cevidence of the crime.\u201d Here, for example, the Court reasons that (1) Stout\u2019s efforts to paint Miller as a deranged stalker and murder suspect were an integral part of Stout\u2019s plan to kill Bill, (2) evidence of the defendant\u2019s planning of the crime is evidence of the crime itself and not evidence of an \u201cother\u201d crime, wrong, or act, and (3) Rule 404(b), therefore, is not implicated. Opinion, \u00b6 45. This conception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>of Rule 404(b) is patently erroneous. First of all, the crime with which Stout was charged was deliberate homicide, and nowhere in the definition of this offense does the word \u201cplan\u201d appear. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA (\u201cA person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being.\u201d). Hence, the evidence that Stout manufactured the harassment campaign to implicate Miller was most definitely evidence of an \u201cother\u201d crime, wrong, or act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, as explained above, Rule 404(b) is implicated whenever the proffered evidence has a tendency to impugn the defendant\u2019s character. Whether the evidence can be categorized as \u201cevidence of the crime\u201d is wholly beside the point. Rule 404(b) is a rule of admissibility-more specifically, a narrow restriction on otherwise relevant evidence: evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts cannot be introduced to prove action in conformity with character, but it can be introduced for any logically relevant purpose that does not require an inference of the defendant\u2019s criminal disposition. This rule applies regardless of whether the evidence is \u201cevidence of the crime\u201d; and, in point of fact, evidence of uncharged misconduct offered under Rule 404(b) is typically \u201cevidence of the crime.\u201d Indeed, that is the whole purpose of offering evidence of an uncharged act: to establish the defendant\u2019s motive, plan, preparation, opportunity, etc., which in turn tends to prove that she committed the charged offense. <em>See </em>Weinstein &amp; Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 404.20[1], 404-39 (although other-acts evidence is not admissible to show character in order to prove conduct, such evidence is admissible \u201cto show other facts that may be in issue,\u201d including \u201ca consequential fact, such as intent or knowledge,\u201d or \u201ca proposition, such as motive, that through a series of inferences may tend to establish the probability of a consequential fact\u201d). In the present case, for example, the harassment campaign was evidence of Stout\u2019s intent (her purpose and knowledge) and her identity as the person who caused Bill\u2019s death. Lastly, there is no logical basis, let alone legal authority, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Court\u2019s proposition that all \u201cevidence of the crime\u201d is part of the \u201ctransaction\u201d and, as such, is admissible under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. As the <em>Bowie </em>court quite correctly pointed out, \u201cit cannot be that all evidence <em>tending to prove </em>the crime is <em>part of the </em>crime. If that were so, Rule 404(b) would be a nullity.\u201d <em>Bowie, </em>232 F.3d at 929 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b6119 The Court contends that there are clear difficulties determining \u201cthe line to be drawn between the evidence without which the conviction could not occur and all other evidence offered by the prosecution.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47. That may be true, but it is not the approach I am suggesting. Rather, my argument is that in order to give independent meanings to Rule 404(b) and \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, as we are required to do <em>(see </em>\u00b6 82, <em>supra), </em>we must draw a line between \u201cother\u201d acts and \u201cinextricably linked\u201d acts as the latter term is defined in <em>Guill </em>\u00e1nd the authorities discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 105-109 above. This is not to suggest that we should exclude a broader range of other-acts evidence in criminal trials. To the contrary, I believe that such evidence is routinely admissible, but under Rule 404(b)-which, it should be recalled, is open-ended with respect to the logically relevant, nonpropensity purposes for which such evidence may be offered. My position is that we should apply Rule 404(b) to the vast majority of other-acts evidence and that \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, should apply to only a very narrow category of such evidence. I recognize this would require prosecutors to give notice of other-acts evidence more often, and it may require trial courts to instruct the jury on the use of such evidence in more cases. But I believe this is the better, and not unduly burdensome, approach. It will ensure that the parties and the courts are actually engaging in a critical analysis of the purpose for which the evidence is being offered; it will ensure that the balancing of Rule 403 is conducted; and it will protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial \u2014 none of which are specifically required by our jurisprudence under the transaction rule.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Granted, our current Modified <em>Just </em>Rule is largely unworkable, and I do not suggest that prosecutors should be required to regularly comply with that rule as currently written. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>is why I am suggesting we revise the rule in the manner set out above (see \u00b6 102, supra) and then require compliance with \u00a7 46-13-109, MCA, and Rules 404(b), 402, 403, and 105 in most cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b6120 The Court issues two directives regarding compliance with the Rules of Evidence. Unfortunately, however, these directives ring hollow. On one hand, the Court cautions that the transaction rule \u201cshould not be used to avoid Rule 404 and the notice and instruction requirements it specifies,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 39, and that \u201cthe prosecutor is required to conform to the Montana Rules of Evidence,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 46, two statements with which I completely agree. Yet, on the other hand, the Court ratifies the very conduct it has cautioned against: the prosecutor\u2019s action in the present case of using the transaction rule to avoid Rule 404(b) and its notice and instruction requirements.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Cautions, warnings, and directives have little meaning when there are no consequences for ignoring them; and the message we are sending today is that our seeming directives-such as those in \u00b6\u00b6 39 and 46 of today\u2019s Opinion and in \u00b6 46 of <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776-are nothing more than aspirational requests.</p>\n<p id=\"A5aq\">\u00b6121 As a final matter, while it is frustrating that the Court has completely distorted the meaning of \u201cinextricably linked\u201d for purposes of the present case, it is even more troubling that the Court has adopted a double standard under which the State may use the transaction rule to provide \u201cthe essential context to prove to the jury how and why the crime occurred,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 45, but defendants are denied that very same use of the rule, <em>Henson, </em>\u00b6 26. The Court\u2019s approach is not only patently unfair, but also of dubious legal validity. <em>See People v. Cruz, </em>643 N.E.2d 636, 654 (Ill. 1994) (\u201c[Tjhere is a distinction between the limits imposed on a defendant\u2019s use of other-crimes evidence to exculpate himself and the State\u2019s use of such evidence to prosecute him.\u201d); Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 10:43, 114 (\u201c[T]he standard for admitting third party\u2019s misdeeds to exculpate the defendant should be less stringent than the test for admitting the defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b6122 For the reasons just discussed, I strenuously disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. I believe that our decision will only encourage further abuse of the transaction rule. Indeed, under the Court\u2019s holding that \u201cevidence of the crime\u201d satisfies the \u201cinextricably linked\u201d standard, the transaction rule has, for all practical purposes, finally swallowed Rule 404(b). <em>See Bowie, </em>232 F.3d at 929 (\u201c[I]t cannot be that all evidence <em>tending to prove </em>the crime is <em>part </em>o/the crime. If that were so, Rule 404(b) would be a nullity.\u201d (emphases added)). Moreover, because the Court holds in this case that the State may use evidence of uncharged misconduct to convict a defendant-although notice of this evidence was not given under \u00a7 46-13-109, MCA; although this evidence was not analyzed to ensure a nonpropensity purpose under Rule 404(b); although this evidence was not subjected to balancing under Rule 403; and although cautionary instructions were not given pursuant to Rule 105 and \u00a7 46-16-401(1), MCA-defendants will have to pursue federal due process claims in order to protect their right to a fair trial. <em>See Burden v. Zant, </em>903 F.2d 1352, 1363 (11th Cir. 1990) (habeas relief justified if the admission of other-crimes evidence deprived the defendant of fundamental fairness and due process of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b6 123 There is a better approach, however-one that will facilitate the introduction of other-acts evidence while protecting against unfair prejudice and misuse of that evidence by the fact-finder. Indeed, the repeated battles in the trial courts and this Court over the scope of the transaction rule should come to a welcome end. Specifically, as explained above (see \u00b6\u00b6 93-102, <em>supra), </em>I suggest that we revise the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule to contain the following five criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">1. advance notice, as required by statute (see \u00a7 46-13-109, MCA);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">2. compliance with Rule 404(b): the evidence must be offered for a purpose other than to show action in conformity with character;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">3. compliance with Rule 402: the evidence must be relevant to a material issue in light of the purpose for which it is offered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">4. compliance with Rule 403: the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">5. compliance with Rule 105: the court, upon request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury that the evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>which it was admitted <em>(see also </em>\u00a7 46-16-401(1), MCA).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">This approach does nothing more than require compliance with the applicable statutory provisions and Rules of Evidence. Evidence of uncharged misconduct is often highly probative, as in this case, but also inherently prejudicial. Yet, as the Supreme Court noted, Rules 404(b), 402, 403, and 105 provide the necessary protection against the introduction of <em>unduly </em>prejudicial uncharged misconduct evidence. <em>See Huddleston, </em>485 U.S. at 691-92, 108 S. Ct. at 1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b6124 In closing, I would reverse and remand for a new trial under Issue Two. I thus would not address the other issues raised by Stout on appeal.
