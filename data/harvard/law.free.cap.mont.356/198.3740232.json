We affirm, with a minor clarification, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b63 Haffey was convicted in 2007 of felony assault with a weapon and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). <em>State v. Haffey, </em>2008 MT 433N, \u00b6 2, 348 Mont. 371 (table); Mont. Sup. Ct., I.O.R. 3(d)(v) (providing that unpublished decisions \u201cshall not be cited or relied upon as authority in any litigation in any court in Montana except... in a criminal action or proceeding involving the same defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b64 At trial, the State presented testimony that in the early morning hours of February 25, 2007, a small, red car deliberately struck a pedestrian, and then sped off. <em>Haffey, </em>\u00b6 3. Minutes later police stopped the same small, red car a few blocks away. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. Haffey was the driver. <em>Id. </em>His blood alcohol content was above the legal limit, and he was arrested. <em>Id. </em>While at the county jail, Haffey spoke with his father and admitted hitting a pedestrian with his car, but suggested that it was an accident. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u00b65 Haffey\u2019s defense theory was general denial. His principal arguments challenged the State of Montana\u2019s evidence and attempted to raise doubts about what happened. He denied being the driver of the car that hit the victim, and suggested repeatedly in his closing argument that he might have been the passenger. He also argued, in the alternative, that if the jury determined that Haffey hit the victim with his car, that he did so negligently, rather than intentionally. (Haffey now maintains that someone else was driving, and that he concealed the true driver\u2019s identity because he did not want to \u201crat\u201d on his friend and because he feared that doing so would endanger his family.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u00b66 In any event, the jury convicted Haffey, and the District Court sentenced him to fifty years in prison with twenty suspended. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 6,9. Haffey, now incarcerated and proceeding pro se, petitioned the District Court under \u00a7 46-21-110, MCA, for DNA testing of a bloodstained envelope found in front of the front passenger seat of the car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>In his petition, Haffey contended that DNA testing would reveal the blood to be-not that of someone else-but his own. This, Haffey advanced, would prove that he was the passenger in the car at the time of the collision and that, therefore, someone else was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b67 The District Court denied Haffey\u2019s petition, reasoning that the petition failed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-110(1), MCA. The District Court ruled: \u201c(1) Stephen Patrick Haffey\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief entitled \u2018Motion for DNA Testing Under Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-21-110\u2019 is DENIED; and (2) This case is ORDERED DISMISSED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b68 Haffey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b69 This is our seminal decision regarding postconviction DNA testing under \u00a7 46-21-110, MCA. At issue on appeal are the District Court\u2019s determinations under \u00a7 46-21-110(5)(b), (c), (e), MCA, which involve, respectively, the chain of custody of the evidence to be tested, whether identity was or should have been an issue at trial, and whether the DNA testing would establish whether the petitioner was the perpetrator of the crime of which he was convicted. We conclude that these determinations are mixed questions of fact and law, subject to de novo review. <em>See United States v. Fasono, </em>577 F.3d 572, 575 (5th Cir. 2009) (similar chain-of-custody and likelihood-of-innocence determinations under federal DNA testing statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3600(a)(4), (a)(8), subject to de novo review); <em>Illinois v. Urioste, </em>736 N.E.2d 706, 710 (Ill. App. 2000) (question of whether identity was an issue under similar statute subject to de novo review); <em>see also United States v. Jordan, </em>594 F.3d 1265, 1269-70 (10th Cir. 2010) (Lucero, J., concurring) (explaining propriety of de novo review); <em>but see e.g. Washington v. Riofta, </em>209 P.3d 467, 473 (Wash. 2009) (applying abuse of discretion standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u00b610 <em>Whether theDistrict Court erred in dismissing Haffey\u2019s petition for DNA testing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\u00b611 In response to the development of DNA testing to the point where it can confirm guilt or innocence in certain categories of cases, Montana, like forty-five other states and the Federal Government, has passed legislation allowing postconviction DNA testing. 2003 Mont. Laws 148-51; <em>D.A.\u2019s Off. for the Third Jud. Dist. v. Osborne, </em>129 S. Ct. 2308, 2316 (2009). Exoneration of the innocent is the principal purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>of allowing postconviction DNA testing. <em>E.g. Washington v. Riofta, </em>209 P.3d 467, 472-73 (Wash. 2009); <em>Blake v. Maryland, </em>909 A.2d 1020, 1023 (Md. 2006); <em>Kansas v. Denney, </em>101 P.3d 1257, 1268 (Kan. 2004); <em>Knighten v. Florida, </em>829 So. 2d 249, 252 (Fla. Dist. App. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b612 Section 46-21-110, MCA, provides a procedure by which a person convicted of a felony may seek DNA testing to show innocence. To initiate the procedure, the person must file a verified petition that meets certain criteria. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 46-21-110(1). If the petition does not contain the required information, the district court must return the petition and advise the petitioner of the missing information. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 46-21-110(2). If the petition contains the required information, the district court must order the petition to be served on the attorney general, the county attorney of the county where the petitioner was convicted, and the body holding the evidence to be tested. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 46-21-110(3). The district court may then, in its discretion, hold a hearing on the petition. <em>Id. </em>at 46-21-110(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b613 Section 46-21-110(5), MCA, presents the criteria for granting a petition for postconviction DNA testing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">The court shall grant the petition if it determines that the petition is not made for the purpose of delay and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">(a) the evidence to be tested:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">(i) was secured in relation to the trial that resulted in the conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">(ii) is available; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">(iii) is in a condition that would permit the requested testing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">(b) the evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain of custody sufficient to establish that it has not been substituted, tampered with, degraded, contaminated, altered, or replaced in any material aspect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">(c) the identity of the perpetrator of the felony was or should have been a significant issue in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">(d) the petitioner has made a prima facie showing that the evidence sought to be tested is material to the question of whether the petitioner was the perpetrator of the felony that resulted in the conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-14\">(e) the requested testing results would establish, in light of all the evidence, whether the petitioner was the perpetrator of the felony that resulted in the conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-15\">(f) the evidence sought to be tested was not previously tested or was tested previously but another test would provide results that are reasonably more discriminating and probative on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>question of whether the petitioner was the perpetrator of the felony that resulted in the conviction or would have a reasonable probability of contradicting the prior test results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Here, the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">\u00b614 The District Court, in denying Haffey\u2019s petition, first reasoned that Haffey had not shown that identity \u201cwas or should have been a significant issue in the case.\u201d Second, the District Court determined that Haffey had not adequately shown how-in light of all the evidence-the requested testing would establish whether he was innocent. Third, the District Court noted Haffey\u2019s concession that he could not meet the chain-of-custody requirement. We address these points in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b615 Paragraph (c) requires a district court to determine whether identity \u201cwas or should have been a significant issue in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 46-21-110(5)(c). A petitioner may satisfy this requirement by showing that identity was a legitimate contested issue at trial. This is the case when a defendant denies having committed the acts alleged. <em>Missouri v. Ruff, </em>256 S.W.3d 55, 57 (Mo. <em>2008); Maine v. Donovan, </em>853 A.2d 772, 776 (Me. 2004); <em>Anderson v. Delaware, </em>831 A.2d 858, 865 (Del. 2003); <em>Illinois v. Urioste, </em>763 N.E.2d 706, 713-14 (Ill. App. 2000). The statutory language further indicates that the identity requirement may be satisfied in cases where, as here, identity is not the only issue. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-21-110(5)(c) (\u201c[I]dentity . . . was or should have been <em>a </em>significant issue . .. .\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Urioste, </em>763 N.E.2d at 713-14 (reasoning that identity remains at issue when a defendant denies committing the alleged act <em>(actus reus) </em>and also denies the charged state of mind <em>(mens rea)). </em>In contrast, identity is not an issue in cases where a defendant admits committing the act but relies an affirmative defense or a claim of insanity. <em>Urioste, </em>763 N.E.2d at 714 ('Where a defendant contests guilt based upon self-defense, compulsion, entrapment, necessity, or a plea of insanity, identity ceases to be the issue.\u201d); <em>accord Ruff, </em>256 S.W.3d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b616 When Haffey went to trial, his principal argument was general denial. In his closing argument he denied striking the victim with his car, repeatedly suggesting that he was the passenger, not the driver. He also argued, in the alternative, that if the jury concluded that he struck the pedestrian with his car, then he did so negligently, not intentionally. The fact that Haffey raised an alternative argument challenging the <em>mens rea </em>of intentional conduct does not amount to an admission to having committed the crime and should not foreclose his access to DNA testing under \u00a7 46-21-110, MCA. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>identity was a significant issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b617  Contrary to the reasoning of the District Court, it is irrelevant to the identity determination under paragraph (c) whether the eyewitnesses at the scene of the crime recalled seeing one or two occupants in the vehicle. The fallibility of eyewitness testimony is one reason that forty-six states and the Federal Government enacted statutes allowing postconviction DNA testing. <em>See </em>Brandon L. Garrett, <em>Claiming Innocence, </em>92 Minn. L. Rev. 1629,1635 (2008) (stating that postconviction DNA exonerations spurred states to pass statutes allowing postconviction DNA testing); <em>Bernal v. Colorado, </em>44 P.3d 184, 190 (Colo. 2002) (citing studies showing that majority of postconviction exonerations result from erroneous eyewitness identifications). Further, the District Court\u2019s observation that the requested DNA testing would not produce evidence inconsistent with Haffey\u2019s guilt of the underlying offense, while correct, does not bear on the question of whether identity was a significant issue in the case. <em>See New Jersey v. Peterson, </em>836 A.2d 821, 826 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 2003) (\u201c[T]he strength of the evidence against a defendant is not a relevant factor in determining whether his identity as the perpetrator was a significant issue.\u201d). For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court erred in determining that identity was not a significant issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">\u00b618 On the other hand, the District Court correctly determined that Haffey\u2019s petition failed to meet the requirement of paragraph (e). Paragraph (e) requires a district court to determine that \u201cthe requested testing results would establish, in light of all the evidence, whether the petitioner was the perpetrator of the felony that resulted in the conviction.\u201d It is under this provision that a district court must weigh the exculpatory potential of DNA test results favorable to the petitioner against the prosecution\u2019s evidence presented at trial. This is a fact-specific inquiry that will lead to a spectrum of results in different cases. For example, where \u201cthe State presented a strong case, and a favorable DNA test would discredit only an ancillary fact, the testing should be refused.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>831 A.2d at 867 (construing similar requirement of Delaware postconviction DNA testing statute). \u201cAt the opposite end of the spectrum, where the DNA test could exonerate the defendant, it does not matter how strong the other evidence might have been; [the statute] is satisfied.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b619 Haffey contends that DNA testing would reveal-not that the blood found on an envelope on the passenger side of the car belonged to a guilty third party-but rather that the blood belonged to Haffey, himself. Haffey contends that this will establish that he was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>passenger in the car at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b620 Admittedly, DNA test results identifying the blood on the envelope found on the passenger side of the car to belong to Haffey could have some tendency to prove that Haffey was, in fact, sitting on the passenger side at the time of the collision and, therefore, not driving. This would likely satisfy the materiality requirement of paragraph (d). <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-21-110(5)(d) (requiring determination that \u201cthe petitioner has made a prima facie showing that the evidence sought to be tested is material to the question of whether the petitioner was the perpetrator of the felony that resulted in the conviction\u201d). It does not, however, satisfy the requirement of paragraph (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b621 The evidentiary value of the proposed test results would be minimal. This is because there are plausible, alternative explanations for why the bloody envelope was found on the passenger side. As the State suggests, if Haffey was the driver at the time of the collision, he might have moved his hand over the passenger side at some point before his arrest, splattering blood. Also, the envelope is a movable item, and it is possible that Haffey bled on it and then discarded it on the passenger side. (Moreover, blood was also found on the car\u2019s steering wheel, which Haffey conspicuously does not assert belonged to the person he alleges was driving.) Thus, as the District Court explained, proof that Haffey bled on the envelope is not inconsistent with his guilt for the underlying offense. <em>See Riofta, </em>209 P.3d at 473-74 (denying postconviction DNA testing where favorable test results \u201cwould not exclude [the petitioner] as the perpetrator\u201d and where considerable evidence of guilt had been presented at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b622  The minimal evidentiary value that favorable DNA testing could produce contrasts with the weightiness of the evidence of Haffey\u2019s guilt presented at trial. Haffey was apprehended driving the car that had struck the victim just minutes earlier. Haffey\u2019s father testified that Haffey admitted hitting the victim with his car, but claimed it was an accident. No testimony was presented at trial that another person was driving, and no witness testified to seeing a passenger in the car at the time of the collision. Also, since Haffey specifically argued to the jury that the only blood inside the car was his, further proof that the blood was indeed his would simply be cumulative. In light of this evidence, we conclude that the requested DNA testing would not establish whether Haffey was the perpetrator of the crime. Because this determination is necessary for granting a petition for postconviction DNA testing, we need not go on to address the District Court\u2019s determination regarding the chain of custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>under paragraph (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b623  Haffey contends that the District Court, upon finding his petition deficient, should have returned it to him and advised him of the deficiencies, according to the procedure in \u00a7 46-21-110(2), MCA. This provision reads: \u201cIf the petition does not contain the information required in subsection (1), the court shall return the petition to the petitioner and advise the petitioner that the matter cannot be considered without the missing information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This provision, which reflects the remedial purpose of \u00a7 46-21-110, MCA, applies when a petition is \u201cmissing\u201d information that is required by \u00a7 46-21-110(1), MCA. We do not interpret this provision to preclude a district court from denying a petition that is facially incapable of meeting the substantive requirements of \u00a7 46-21-110(5), MCA. To the contrary, dragging out a facially unmeritorious petition for postconviction DNA testing wastes the limited resources of the courts and all parties involved. Here, Haffey\u2019s petition might not have contained all the information required by \u00a7 46-21-110(1), MCA, but the information contained in the petition was sufficient to demonstrate that the petition was without merit. The District Court did not err in summarily dismissing Haffey\u2019s petition for postconviction DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"A7b\">\u00b624 Haffey next contends that the District Court erroneously converted his petition for postconviction DNA testing under \u00a7 46-21-110, MCA, into a general petition for postconviction relief under \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-101 to -104, MCA. The basis of this argument is the language used by the District Court to deny Haffey\u2019s petition. The District Court\u2019s order read: \u201c(1) Stephen Patrick Haffey\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief entitled \u2018Motion for DNA Testing Under Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-21-110\u2019 is DENIED; and (2) This case is ORDERED DISMISSED.\u201d Haffey was understandably confused by this language. His confusion should not, however, work to his disadvantage. As the State concedes, the analysis in the District Court\u2019s order only addressed Haffey\u2019s petition for DNA testing. The District Court did not address Haffey\u2019s petition for postconviction relief under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-101 to -104, MCA. Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Haffey\u2019s petition for postconviction DNA testing, but remand the case for resolution of any remaining postconviction matters.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
