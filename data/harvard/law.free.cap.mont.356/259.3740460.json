Leisz appeals, claiming the District Court erred when it concluded the prescriptive easement had been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u00b62 For a complete description of the factual background, see <em>Leisz v. Avista Corp., </em>2007 MT 347, \u00b6\u00b6 2-8, 340 Mont. 294, 174 P.3d 481 (hereinafter <em>Leisz T). </em>In January 2003, Leisz filed her initial Complaint alleging that she had a prescriptive easement for ingress and egress over Avista\u2019s and the Reviers\u2019 property through the East Access. After a bench trial in November 2005, the District Court determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that a prescriptive easement was not established prior to 1982 because the use during that time was \u201cperiodic and unexplained.\u201d <em>Leisz I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 34. Leisz appealed. We concluded that the District Court\u2019s finding that the use was \u201cunexplained\u201d was clearly erroneous. <em>Leisz I, </em>\u00b6 34. We reversed and remanded with directions for the District Court to determine if a prescriptive easement was established. <em>Leisz I, </em>\u00b6 35. \u00b63 On remand, the District Court concluded that the elements of a prescriptive easement over the East Access had been established. However, the court found that in 1985, after the Reviers had loggers construct the West Access through their property, Leisz\u2019s predecessors ceased using the East Access. The court found that by the time Leisz purchased the property in 2000, \u201cthe East Access had long been abandoned in favor of the superior West Access.\u201d While noting that mere nonuse does not establish abandonment, the court concluded as a matter of law that the prescriptive easement had been abandoned because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">[Leisz\u2019s predecessors] did not use the East Access, and in fact did not even keep the East Access cleared and passable as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>alternative route. They allowed the East Access to become overgrown and impassable, and, at that point in time, with the superior West Access available, their intent was clearly to abandon the East Access road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b64 Leisz appeals three issues. First, she claims that the District Court violated the law of the case in <em>Leisz I </em>by going beyond the issue of whether the prescriptive easement was established and concluding it was abandoned. Alternatively, she asserts that the Appellees failed to sufficiently plead abandonment as an affirmative defense. Finally, she argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the prescriptive easement was abandoned. We only address whether the District Court erred when it concluded that the prescriptive easement was abandoned because that issue is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness and its findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>PPL Mont., LLC v. State, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 86, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court err by determining that the prescriptive easement was abandoned?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\u00b67 While Leisz asserts that the District Court correctly concluded that a prescriptive easement was established prior to 1982, she argues that the court applied the law on abandonment incorrectly. Specifically, she complains that the District Court erred in concluding that the easement was abandoned because of nonuse and the existence of an alternate access.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\u00b68  Abandonment must be proven with words or acts that indicate a clear intent to abandon. <em>Renner v. Nemitz, </em>2001 MT 202, \u00b6 30, 306 Mont. 292, 33 P.3d 255. Mere nonuse does not establish abandonment. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAbandonment means a voluntary act involving a concurrence of act and intent.\u201d <em>Harland v. Anderson Ranch Co., </em>2004 MT 132, \u00b6 40, 321 Mont. 338, 92 P.3d 1160. \u201cThe act is the relinquishment of possession and the intent is a manifestation not to resume beneficial use of it. Neither of these elements alone is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">\u00b69  Leisz\u2019s predecessors took no actions that show they relinquished possession of the easement. They took no actions that demonstrate a manifestation not to resume beneficial use of the easement. They simply stopped using the East Access. The District Court hinges its conclusion on the fact that the nonuse coincided with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the construction of the West Access. However, building the West Access is not an action taken by Leisz\u2019s predecessors and is not evidence of intent to abandon the easement. The District Court erred in concluding that Leisz\u2019s predecessors abandoned the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b610 The District Court erred in concluding that the prescriptive easement over the East Access had been abandoned. We reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the easement was abandoned and order judgment entered for Leisz that she has a prescriptive easement over the East Access.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b282-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"Apq\">dissenting,</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">fill dissent. After noting that \u201cAbandonment means a voluntary act involving a concurrence of act and intent,\u201d <em>Harland v. Anderson Ranch Co., </em>2004 MT 132, \u00b6 40, 321 Mont. 338, 92 P.3d 1160, the Court concludes that \u201cLeisz\u2019s predecessors took no actions that show they relinquished possession of the easement. They took no actions that demonstrate a manifestation not to resume beneficial use of the easement. They simply stopped using the East Access.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 9. The Court goes on to note that although the nonuse coincided with the construction of the West Access, that construction was not an act of the Leisz\u2019s predecessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b612 In <em>Harland </em>we held that \u201cthe act is the relinquishment of possession and the intent is a manifestation not to resume beneficial use of it.\u201d <em>Harland, </em>\u00b6 40.1 agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Leisz\u2019s predecessors did more than \u201csimply stop using\u201d the East Access. Rather, they allowed the East Access to become overgrown and impassable to the point that a bulldozer would be required to reopen the road. This affirmative neglect, in addition to their nonuse of the road, established their intent to abandon the East Access road.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-9\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
