Lamb asks this Court to assume supervisory control over the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, in Cause No. DV-06-38, with respect to the court\u2019s order dated December 14, 2009, granting an indefinite stay of proceedings. On March 23,2010, we issued an order granting Respondent District Court, or its designee, 30 days in which to prepare, file, and serve a response to the Petition. The District Court designated Patrick HagEstad, counsel for defendants in the underlying action <em>(Lamb v. Montana Hospital Association Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust, and Brentwood Services Administrators, Inc.), </em>to respond to the Petition. A response has now been filed. Having considered the parties\u2019 arguments, we grant the Petition, reverse the District Court\u2019s order, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">1. Are the issues presented by Lamb appropriate for resolution by this Court through a writ of supervisory control?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">2. Did the District Court err in staying the proceedings on Lamb\u2019s bad faith claims due to her discovery requests which sought disclosure of documentation relating to the defendants\u2019 handling of her workers\u2019 compensation claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\u00b63 In late 2003 or early 2004, Lamb suffered a back injury while working as a nurse\u2019s aid. She sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the Montana Hospital Association Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust (MHA), which provided coverage for Lamb\u2019s employer. MHA denied liability. Lamb then filed suit in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC). In February 2005, the parties entered into a Stipulation for Judgment (Stipulation) in which MHA accepted liability for Lamb\u2019s occupational disease, agreed to \u201cprovide medical benefits, including payment of outstanding medical bills, related to [Lamb\u2019s] occupational disease,\u201d and also agreed to pay a penalty and Lamb\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The WCC entered judgment on February 14, 2005, adopting the Stipulation and dismissing the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00b64 Lamb\u2019s condition is debilitating and has required multiple surgeries to fuse her vertebrae. MHA has paid for three such surgeries pursuant to the WCC\u2019s judgment. Lamb explains that future treatments are inevitable because her condition is degenerative. Thus, since her medical problems are ongoing, future medical benefits are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b65 Following the resolution of her claim in the WCC, Lamb filed a bad faith action in the District Court against MHA and against Brentwood Services Administrators, Inc., which had handled her workers\u2019 compensation claim on MHA\u2019s behalf. This action includes a common law claim, as well as a statutory claim under the Unfair Trade Practices Act <em>(see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201, -242, MCA). Lamb alleges that during the course of adjusting her claim, MHA and Brentwood (collectively, Defendants) wrongfully delayed, failed, and refused repeated requests to pay benefits that were due and payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Lamb asserts that the nature of Defendants\u2019 conduct is demonstrated in part by the fact that MHA ultimately conceded in the Stipulation that it should pay a penalty and attorney\u2019s fees in resolving Lamb\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. In this regard, Lamb notes that attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable only if the insurer\u2019s actions in denying liability were unreasonable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-611(l)(c), MCA. She maintains, however, that this limited measure of recourse does not compensate her for the damages she suffered for over a year while Defendants remained intransigent, which is why she is now pursuing the present bad faith action.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b66 Lamb sought discovery of the documents which Defendants had relied upon and generated in handling her workers\u2019 compensation claim, including claims-handling manuals, employee training materials, and investigative reports. She also sought Defendants\u2019 correspondence with counsel, since Defendants had asserted the \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense. <em>See Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. </em>Exch., 261 Mont. 91, 110, 861 P.2d 895, 907 (1993) (the attorney-client privilege does not apply if the insurer directly relies on advice of counsel as a defense to a bad faith charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b67 Defendants requested a stay of proceedings until Lamb\u2019s underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim is \u201cfully resolved.\u201d They asserted that Lamb had entered into only a \u201cpartial settlement\u201d of that claim, and they pointed out that she is still seeking benefits related to her back injury. Defendants argued that they would be prejudiced by having to defend both the underlying claim and Lamb\u2019s bad faith claim. They further argued that providing discovery of Brentwood\u2019s file and proprietary claims-handling procedures, as well as the attorney file advising Brentwood in the negotiations with Lamb\u2019s counsel, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>enable Lamb \u201cto use this information to unfairly leverage her position\u201d in obtaining future medical benefits under the WCC\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b68 The District Court recognized Lamb\u2019s right and obligation to file her bad faith claims for statute of limitations purposes, but the court stated that it must balance her right to proceed on these claims with Defendants\u2019 rights not to be prejudiced in resolving her ongoing workers\u2019 compensation claim. The court opined that \u201c[m]uch of the discovery Lamb seeks in this action would be privileged in the underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim\u201d and that \u201c[i]f discovery were allowed, Lamb would be able to improperly use the privileged information discovered in this, case in the underlying case, including how claims are negotiated, reserved, and settled, thereby resulting in prejudice to Defendants.\u201d The court concluded that Lamb\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim had not yet reached \u201ca point where proceeding in [the bad faith] case will not prejudice Defendants in resolving the underlying claim.\u201d On the other hand, the court noted that Defendants are on notice to preserve all relevant information as a result of this litigation. Thus, the court ruled that \u201cthe relative prejudice [to Defendants] in proceeding at this time outweighs any potential prejudice that Lamb may experience as a result of the stay.\u201d The court therefore ordered that \u201c[a]ll proceedings in the [bad faith] case are hereby stayed until Lamb\u2019s underlying workers\u2019 compensation claims reach a point where proceeding in this case will not prejudice Defendants in resolving the underlying claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b69 <em>Issue 1. Are the issues presented by Lamb appropriate for resolution by this Court through a writ of supervisory control?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b610  This Court has general supervisory control over all other courts and may supervise another court by way of a writ of supervisory control. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2(2); M. R. App. P. 14(3). Supervisory control is considered \u201can extraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 16, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121; M. R. App. P. 14(3). Thus, we exercise supervisory control on a case-by-case basis and only (1) when urgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate, (2) when the case involves purely legal questions, and (3) when one or more of the following circumstances exist: (a) the other court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice, (b) constitutional issues of state-wide importance are involved, or (c) the other court has granted or denied a motion for substitution of a judge in a criminal case. <em>State v. Thirteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2009 MT 163, \u00b6 13, 350 Mont. 465, 208 P.3d 408; M. R. App. P. 14(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\u00b611  We conclude that this case is appropriate for the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>supervisory control under the foregoing factors. First, it should be noted that a stay order is not an appealable order. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 6(3) (listing the orders appealable in civil cases). Furthermore, the stay imposed by the District Court is of an indeterminate duration in that it lasts \u201cuntil Lamb\u2019s underlying workers\u2019 compensation claims reach a point where proceeding in this case will not prejudice Defendants in resolving the underlying claim.\u201d Lamb\u2019s claims for medical benefits, however, are ongoing and will likely extend the duration of her lifetime due to the degenerative nature of her condition. Thus, as Lamb points out, because the District Court\u2019s rationale for staying the proceedings is based on her ongoing receipt of medical benefits, and because she will continue to receive those benefits for her lifetime, the stay will apparently last for her lifetime. It is effectively permanent and tantamount to an injunction prohibiting Lamb from ever pursuing her bad faith action as long as she receives medical benefits related to her underlying injury. At the very least, her bad faith action could likely be stale by the time the stay is lifted. Moreover, the stay halts \u201call\u201d proceedings, meaning that Lamb cannot develop her bad faith action through discovery, cannot file motions to begin shaping the issues for trial, and cannot take any other steps toward resolution. <em>Cf. State ex rel. Burlington N. R.R. v. Eighth Judicial Dish Court, </em>239 Mont. 207, 211-12, 779 P.2d 885, 888-89 (1989) (although this Court has \u201cexpressed disfavor in granting a writ in the context of a discovery issue,\u201d supervisory control is appropriate if the petitioner has been placed \u201cat a significant disadvantage in litigating the merits of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b612 Under these circumstances, we agree that urgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate-if not totally unavailable as a practical matter. In addition, the issue raised by Lamb involves a purely legal question, and Lamb has demonstrated that the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law, as explained under Issue 2, and is causing a gross injustice, for the reasons just discussed. We accordingly exercise supervisory control over this case to consider the issue raised in Lamb\u2019s Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b613 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in staying the proceedings on Lamb\u2019s bad faith claims due to her discovery requests which sought disclosure of documentation relating to the defendants\u2019 handling of her workers\u2019 compensation claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b614 Ordinarily, we review district court orders related to trial administration matters, such as a motion to stay, for abuse of discretion. <em>Wamsley v. Nodak Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 56, \u00b6 23, 341 Mont. 467, 178 P.3d 102. However, judicial discretion must be guided by the rules and principals of law; thus, our standard of review is plenary to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>a discretionary ruling is based upon a conclusion of law. <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 17, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\">\u00b615 As an initial matter, Lamb contends that her underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim is \u201cfully resolved,\u201d insofar as her present bad faith action is concerned, and that the District Court\u2019s contrary view is erroneous. In this regard, she cites our decision in <em>O\u2019Connor v. Natl. Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 65, 320 Mont. 301, 87 P.3d 454, where we addressed the question of whether statutory and common law bad faith claims against an insurer, predicated on actions taken in the adjustment of a workers\u2019 compensation claim, accrue when the WCC enters a judgment which orders the insurer to pay for a previously denied benefit, but which leaves unresolved the ultimate determinations of the extent and duration of the worker\u2019s disability. We answered this question in the affirmative. <em>See O\u2019Connor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 28. In so doing, we reviewed our decisions in <em>Grenz v. Orion Group, </em>243 Mont. 486, 795 P.2d 444 (1990), <em>Poteat v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., </em>277 Mont. 117, 918 P.2d 677 (1996), <em>and Brewington v. Employers Fire Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 312, 297 Mont. 243, 992 P.2d 237, and noted that in each of these cases, we resolved the issue of when the bad faith claim accrued by examining the particular dispute at issue in the underlying workers\u2019 compensation case which gave rise to the allegations of bad faith conduct, and determining when that dispute was resolved. <em>See O\u2019Connor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-22. In other words, \u201cwe determine the accrual date of a bad faith claim arising out of a separate and independent disputed issue by determining whether that particular issue has been ultimately resolved, regardless of the existence or absence of a resolution of other issues within the workers\u2019 compensation case.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b616 Here, the particular dispute at issue in the underlying workers\u2019 compensation case, which gave rise to the allegations of bad faith conduct in the present case, was whether MHA was liable for Lamb\u2019s occupational disease. That dispute was fully resolved in Lamb\u2019s favor when the WCC entered its judgment on February 14,2005, adopting the Stipulation. And it is clear, therefore, that Lamb\u2019s bad faith cause of action accrued on that date, even though the WCC\u2019s judgment ordering MHA to pay for previously denied benefits left unresolved the ultimate determinations of the extent and duration of those benefits. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>\u00b6 28. Lamb then timely filed her complaint in the present action on January 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b617 Defendants\u2019 assertions that Lamb\u2019s underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim is \u201cstill unresolved,\u201d that there was only a \u201cpartial settlement\u201d of the claim, and that they must still \u201cdefend the underlying claim\u201d are misleading and contrary to our decision in <em>O\u2019Connor. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Although the WCC\u2019s judgment did not adjudicate Lamb\u2019s entitlement to specific future medical treatments, it did resolve the dispute over MHA\u2019s liability for her occupational disease, which is the basis of her bad faith action. Also, Lamb readily acknowledges that other disputes concerning her workers\u2019 compensation claim may arise in the future. For example, MHA may dispute whether particular treatments are necessary or related to Lamb\u2019s on-the-job injury. Yet, such disputes would not alter the previous determination by the WCC that MHA is liable for her medical condition. If disputes over specific treatments ever materialize, those will have to be addressed by the WCC in the first instance. But the particular dispute upon which her bad faith action is premised-MHA\u2019s liability for her occupational disease \u2014 remains fully resolved. Likewise, the alleged bad faith conduct leading up to the WCC\u2019s judgment-Defendants\u2019 refusal to admit liability, their prolonged denial of liability, their failure to pay benefits that were due and payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and their failure to conduct a reasonable investigation-is likewise complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b618 The crux of the matter, then, is not whether Lamb\u2019s bad faith action has accrued (it has) or whether she may discover the documents she requested for purposes of pursuing that action (she may). Rather, it is whether she may be indefinitely precluded from doing so on the basis of the prejudice claimed by Defendants. As they did in the District Court, Defendants again argue in this Court that providing the requested discovery at this time would allow \u201cimproper leveraging\u201d and \u201cundue prejudice.\u201d Indeed, they claim it would be a \u201cgross injustice\u201d to require them to provide the discovery while \u201cdisputes\u201d are ongoing in the underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim. Defendants cite <em>Fode v. Farmers Ins. </em>Exch., 221 Mont. 282, 287, 719 P.2d 414, 417 (1986), for the proposition that there are \u201cdifficulties\u201d in defending a bad faith case while simultaneously defending claims in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b619  We rejected similar reliance on <em>Fode </em>in <em>O\u2019Connor. See O\u2019Connor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-25. But more importantly, there is a fallacy underlying Defendants\u2019 position-namely, that there is no discrete break-point between Lamb\u2019s bad faith claims and her ongoing (and indeed lifetime) claims for medical benefits. As explained above, Lamb\u2019s bad faith claims have to do with Defendants\u2019 handling of her workers\u2019 compensation claim prior to the stipulated final judgment entered by the WCC, in which MHA conceded liability and agreed to pay a penalty and Lamb\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Lamb is fully entitled to pursue discovery of <em>those </em>practices and is entitled to the insurer\u2019s and administrator\u2019s files with respect to <em>those </em>claims. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1); <em>cf. Peterson v. Doctors\u2019 Co., </em>2007 MT 264, \u00b6\u00b6 40-46, 339 Mont. 354, 170 P.3d 459. She should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>not be put in the position of having to relinquish her right to ongoing medical benefits under the WCC\u2019s judgment in order to obtain discovery in her bad faith action regarding Defendants\u2019 conduct surrounding the now-resolved issue of liability. Certainly, Defendants are entitled to open new files pertaining to Lamb\u2019s ongoing medical treatment and pertaining to her bad faith action. She is not entitled to discovery of those files. But that is not what she is seeking in discovery here. She seeks discovery of the original claims-handling files only, and she is undisputedly entitled to discovery of those files in order to prove her bad faith claims. Finally, to the extent Defendants believe that some portion of, or document in, the claims-handling file is not discoverable, Defendants may file a <em>specific </em>objection and motion for a protective order, and the District Court can then resolve that objection following an in-camera review.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b620 The District Court has effectively, and erroneously, conflated Lamb\u2019s request for discovery of Defendants\u2019 claims-handling practices and the files pertaining to those-to which she is entitled-with discovery of Defendants\u2019 new files regarding Lamb\u2019s ongoing treatment and bad faith suit. As regards these latter files, Lamb is not entitled to discovery of those and, indeed, has not requested discovery of them, in any event. The District Court\u2019s indeterminate stay of all proceedings, without recognizing the different files and the break-point occasioned by entry of the WCC\u2019s judgment adopting the Stipulation, has effectively put Lamb\u2019s bad faith action on hold forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b621 Accordingly, based on the foregoing,</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u00b622 IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\u00b623 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court\u2019s December 14, 2009 Order Granting Stay of Proceedings in cause number DV-06-38 granting an indefinite stay of proceedings is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The Clerk of this Court is directed to give notice of this Opinion and Order to counsel of record and to the Hon.
