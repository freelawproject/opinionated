(collectively, \u201cHerbalife\u201d) for, <em>inter alia, </em>breach of contract. The District Court for the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County, dismissed Peterman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>case on account of discovery abuses. Peterman appeals this and two other pretrial rulings. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the case and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in dismissing Peterman\u2019s case as a sanction for discovery abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b63 Herbalife produces weight-loss and dietary supplements, as well as \u201cpersonal care\u201d products. Herbalife is a multilevel marketing business (or, \u201cMLM\u201d) that sells its wares worldwide through a network of independent distributors. Under this pyramidal sales structure, an interested person becomes a distributor through an existing distributor, called a \u201csponsor.\u201d The aspiring distributor submits an application for distributorship and purchases a \u201cdistributor kit\u201d from Herbalife. When Herbalife accepts the application of distributorship, the person becomes a distributor, entitled to purchase Herbalife products at a discounted price. The sponsor and the line of distributors between him and the peak of the distribution pyramid become the \u201cupline\u201d of the new distributor. The new distributor may then recruit additional distributors, who become his \u201cdownline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b64 An Herbalife distributor may earn compensation in a number of ways. First, the distributor, after purchasing Herbalife products at discount, may resell them at retail for profit. Second, if the distributor purchases (for resale) a certain quantity of Herbalife products in a specified period, he becomes a \u201csupervisor,\u201d entitled to earn royalties from the sales of distributors in his downline. Third, Herbalife offers distributors who purchase a still greater volume of products the option to enter into an agreement in which the distributor forswears participation in any other MLM and in return becomes entitled to additional bonus payments based on downline sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u00b65 Peterman, along with his wife Sharon, applied and became a distributor with Herbalife in 1985. Peterman enjoyed a measure of success as a distributor, eventually qualifying for and entering into Herbalife\u2019s bonus program. In 1998 Peterman and Sharon dissolved their marriage, and their dissolution decree awarded Peterman\u2019s interest in the Herbalife distributorship to Sharon.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">\u00b66 The present case began a decade ago in 2000, when Peterman and a handful of other distributors sued Herbalife, alleging breach of contract, as well as various tort claims that were subsequently dismissed. Regarding the contract claim, Peterman asserted that Herbalife \u201cdenied [him] royalty and bonus checks to which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>entitled and stripped away portions of his downline organization.\u201d For relief, Peterman sought damages \u201cfor all losses sustained ... as a result of [Herbalife\u2019s] breach of contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b67 In 2001 Herbalife sought discovery of Peterman\u2019s federal and state income tax returns for 1993 through 2000. Peterman objected that the request was \u201cunduly burdensome, oppressive and harassing, and [was] not reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d An initial trial date in 2004 was vacated. In 2006, on the eve of the second trial date (which was also later vacated), Herbalife served its third request for production of documents on Peterman, seeking all documents relating to Peterman\u2019s income from 1994 to the present, including tax returns. Peterman objected generally that the period for discovery had ended, that Herbalife was only attempting to disrupt Peterman\u2019s trial preparations, and that the requests were duplicative. Peterman then repeated his specific objection that the request was overbroad, burdensome, and beyond the scope of discovery. Nevertheless, Peterman admitted, \u201cIn the unlikely event that any responsive documents are used in preparation of plaintiffs expert report on damages, plaintiff will deliver such documents to defendant in conjunction with the expert report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b68 In June 2006 Herbalife responded to the objections by moving to compel production of Peterman\u2019s tax returns from 1993 to 2006. In the alternative Herbalife sought, as a sanction, to exclude any evidence of Peterman\u2019s damages. Herbalife contended that discovery of the tax returns was proper and was necessary to determine if Peterman had \u201cmet [his] duty to mitigate [his] damages.\u201d Peterman opposed Herbalife\u2019s motion. He argued that his \u201cmitigation attempts began after July 1998, when he transferred his interest in his distributorship to his former wife, Sharon,\u201d and that he had produced all evidence within his control of his income for the period of 2000 to 2005. He also argued that Herbalife was seeking his tax returns for 1998 and earlier years for reasons other than mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b69 The District Court addressed the motion to compel at a pretrial hearing in July 2006. At the hearing, counsel for Peterman conceded that Peterman did not possess tax returns for 1998 onwards because he had failed to file his tax returns. Despite this oversight, Peterman\u2019s counsel assured the District Court, Peterman was planning to file: \u201cHe is actively working on the problem with an entity that helps people deal with issues regarding past returns, trying to put those returns together now. But they have not, as of this time, been filed.\u201d Peterman also asserted that he did not posses his tax returns for 1998 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>earlier, but that they were in the possession of his ex-wife Sharon. The District Court indicated that it was granting Herbalife\u2019s motion to compel. The court reasoned that the tax returns were discoverable and that Peterman, though he did not possess his tax returns, was required to retrieve them from either Sharon or the IRS. The District Court concluded that sanctions were not appropriate at that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">The only sanction that would be available to the Court would be to prevent [Peterman] from providing any evidence as to income during those years, or any damages during those years, which would be a sanction that to this Court would be draconian to say the least, would be beyond what should be sanctioned in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahxs\">The District Court did not issue a written order compelling discovery. Nor did the court directly address the tax returns (for 1998 and forward) that Peterman had not, at that time, prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b610 In September 2006 Peterman provided Herbalife with his and Sharon\u2019s joint tax returns for 1996 and 1997. He further indicated that he was trying to determine if the IRS had destroyed his tax returns for 1993 to 1995. Regarding his taxes for the years after 1998, Peterman wrote, \u201cDave\u2019s returns for the years 1999-2005 are being prepared and will be produced as soon as they are completed.... We expect to deliver tax documents to you by November 15.\u201d In January 2007 Peterman\u2019s counsel wrote to Herbalife\u2019s counsel that the IRS could not find copies of Peterman\u2019s tax returns for 1993 to 1996 and that Peterman had not completed his tax returns for 1998 onwards. Peterman subsequently authorized Herbalife to seek his tax returns for 1993 to 1996 from the IRS, but Herbalife was no more successful with the IRS than Peterman had been. Ultimately, Peterman did not file tax returns for the years beginning in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b611 In July 2008, two years after the District Court granted Herbalife\u2019s motion to compel, Herbalife moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that, despite the court\u2019s order, Peterman had not produced his tax returns for 1993 to 1995 and \u201cif he filed them,\u201d Peterman had not produced his tax returns for 1998 and forward. Herbalife argued that by failing to produce his tax returns, Peterman had delayed the case for two years and impaired Herbalife\u2019s ability to present a defense. Peterman countered that he had not, in fact, failed to comply with the District Court\u2019s order compelling discovery. Peterman reasoned that he had requested his tax returns for 1993 to 1997 from both Sharon and the IRS and that he had forwarded to Herbalife all the returns that he received (those for 1996 and 1997). Further, Peterson continued, he never completed tax returns for 1998 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>onwards, so the District Court could not compel him to produce those nonexistent documents. Peterman blamed Herbalife for the delay and argued that given the District Court\u2019s previous statement about sanctions being \u201cdraconian,\u201d Peterman had no reason to believe that he even faced the threat of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b612 The District Court agreed with Herbalife\u2019s arguments and dismissed the case. The court reasoned that Peterson had completely failed to comply with Herbalife\u2019s discovery requests and the court\u2019s order compelling discovery. This evidenced disregard for the court\u2019s authority and disregard for the rights of Herbalife. The District Court also concluded that alternative sanctions would not be appropriate and that dismissing the case would serve to alleviate its \u201cexcessive back-log of cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b613 This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u00b614 We employ an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for discovery abuse. <em>In re Marriage of Lundstrom, </em>2009 MT 400, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 353 Mont. 436, 221 P.3d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing Peterman\u2019s case as a sanction for discovery abuse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">\u00b616 Peterman presents two principal arguments to show that the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing his case. First, he contends that the tax returns were not relevant to mitigation or damages (and thus not discoverable under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure). Second, Peterman asserts that he acted in good faith, producing all tax returns that were in his control. Peterman also advances that he had no reason to believe that he faced sanctions. We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">\u00b617 Discovery, we have observed, enables courts and parties to determine the truth of a given matter so that cases may be resolved justly. <em>Richardson v. State, </em>2006 MT 43, \u00b6 22, 331 Mont. 231, 130 P.3d 634. Of course, discovery may also serve, less nobly, as an instrument for inflicting significant and unjustified costs on one\u2019s opponent. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 26(c) (providing for protective orders from oppressive discovery requests). We have repeatedly articulated a low-tolerance approach toward discovery abuse, encouraging district courts not to give transgressors second chances but rather to impose sanctions. <em>Linn v. Whitaker, </em>2007 MT 46, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 131, 152 P.3d 1282; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 <em>56-57; Xu v. McLaughlin Research Inst. for Biomedical Sci., Inc., </em>2005 MT 209, \u00b6 20, 328 Mont. 232, 119 P.3d 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b618 Under Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(C), when a party fails to obey an order to provide discovery, the district court may impose sanctions, including dismissal of the action. As the first step of our analysis, we consider whether Peterman failed to obey an order of the District Court to provide discovery. <em>See Xu, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow Co., </em>276 Mont. 329, 333, 916 P.2d 91, 93 (1996). Here, though it could have been more explicit, the District Court granted Herbalife\u2019s motion to compel. This motion had sought production of Peterman\u2019s tax returns from 1993 to 2006. It is undisputed that Peterman only produced his joint returns (with Sharon) for 1996 and 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u00b619 Peterman argues that he did not violate the District Court\u2019s order because (1) his tax returns were not relevant to mitigation or damages and (2) because he produced all the information he had or could acquire. Peterman\u2019s first argument is based on Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1), which limits discovery to \u201cany matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or the claim or defense of any other party.\u201d Peterman contends that his breach of contract claim is based on Herbalife\u2019s removing portions of his downline distribution network. This, Peterman maintains, caused him to lose royalty and bonus payments. He could not have avoided these losses by seeking income from other sources. Therefore, Peterman concludes, his damages should not be reduced simply because he might have received income from some other source.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u00b620 There are two flaws in this argument. First, Peterman did not raise this argument below, either in his objections to Herbalife\u2019s initial discovery request, or in his response to Herbalife\u2019s motion to compel production, or in his response to Herbalife\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See Molnar v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Commn., </em>2008 MT 49, \u00b6 11, 341 Mont. 420, 177 P.3d 1048 (providing that the Court does not address arguments presented for the first time on appeal because it is unfair to fault trial courts on issues that they did not have the opportunity to address). Second, even though Peterman did not articulate his precise theory for damages, he did concede in his response to Herbalife\u2019s motion to compel production of the tax returns that \u201chis mitigation attempts began after July 1998.\u201d This statement indicates that Peterman, himself, concluded that he was required to make reasonable efforts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>mitigate damages after 1998. This conclusion is bolstered by Peterman\u2019s allegations in the amended complaint that Herbalife \u201cstripped away and crippled [his] distributorship ..., making it impossible for him to continue in business.\u201d And it is consistent with his broad prayer for relief, seeking damages \u201cfor all losses sustained by [him] as a result of [Herbalife\u2019s] breach of contract.\u201d Accordingly, by Peterman\u2019s own account, his finances after 1998 were relevant to the issue of mitigation of damages. We are thus unpersuaded by Peterman\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b621 Nor are we persuaded by Peterman\u2019s second argument (that he produced all tax returns in his possession or control). The basis of this argument is Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 34(a), which limits production of documents to those that \u201care in the possession, custody or control of the party upon whom the request is served.\u201d To analyze Peterman\u2019s argument, it is helpful to consider separately Peterman\u2019s tax returns from 1993 to 1997, which he filed, and those for 1998 onwards, which he did not file (despite assurances that he would). Contrary to the District Court\u2019s suggestion, we conclude that Peterman was not at fault for not producing more tax returns for the years prior to 1998. He did not possess the records, and the IRS apparently could not locate them, as demonstrated by Herbalife\u2019s failed attempt to retrieve the returns directly from the IRS with Peterman\u2019s authorization. As such, they were not within the ambit of Rule 34(a). \u00b622 On the other hand, we, agree with the District Court that Peterman failed to comply with its order by not filing and producing tax returns for 1998 onwards. By its plain language, Rule 34(a) does not require parties to produce nonexistent documents. However, we have held that a party may be sanctioned for making repeated assurances to provide discovery and then failing to do so. <em>See Menholt v. State, </em>2009 MT 38, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 349 Mont. 239, 203 P.3d 792; <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 16. Here, Peterman repeatedly assured both the District Court and Herbalife that he would file his tax returns and then produce them for Herbalife. At the July 2006 hearing on Herbalife\u2019s motion to compel, Peterman\u2019s counsel stated that Peterman \u201cis actively working on the problem with an entity that helps people deal with issues regarding past returns, trying to put those returns together now.\u201d Then in September 2006, after the District Court granted Herbalife\u2019s motion to compel, Peterman\u2019s counsel wrote to Herbalife\u2019s counsel, \u201cDave\u2019s returns for the years 1999-2005 are being prepared and will be produced as soon as they are completed. ... We expect to deliver tax documents to you by November 15 [2006].\u201d In January 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Peterman\u2019s counsel again indicated that Peterman was preparing to file his tax returns and that he would then produce them for Herbalife: \u201cThe returns for the period after 1998 are not yet completed.\u201d Then, in response to Herbalife\u2019s motion to dismiss in 2008, Peterman performed a volte-face, writing, \u201cUnfortunately, although he intended to complete and file his personal tax returns for the years commencing in 1998, Peterman has not done so. It is not clear when or if those returns will ever [be] completed.\u201d This was an abuse of the discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b623 Having concluded that Peterman committed a discovery abuse, we next consider the propriety of the sanctions levied. <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 21. District courts are better positioned than we are to evaluate the conduct and good faith of parties during discovery, and as such they enjoy considerable leeway in sanctioning discovery abuses. <em>Menholt, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Owen v. F.A. Buttrey Co., </em>192 Mont. 274, 280-81, 627 P.2d 1233, 1237 (1981). We review sanctions imposed by a district court to determine if they are roughly proportionate to the gravity of the abuse and the inconvenience visited upon other parties and the district court. <em>See Culbertson-Froid-Bainville Health Care Corp. v. JP Stevens &amp; Co., </em>2005 MT 254, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 329 Mont. 38, 122 P.3d 431; <em>McKenzie v. Scheeler, </em>285 Mont. 500, 516, 949 P.2d 1168, 1177-78 (1997); <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 339-40, 916 P.2d at 97. Dismissal is an extreme sanction, which is generally too severe if a party\u2019s conduct is inadvertent or does not result in any serious inconvenience to other parties or the district court. <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 514, 949 P.2d at 1176; <em>see also </em>Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 8B, \u00a7 2284, 465 n. 41 (3d ed., West 2010) (listing cases). Neither the language of Rule 37(b)(2) nor our precedent requires a district court to expressly warn a party before imposing sanctions. <em>Culbertson, </em>\u00b6 15. However, if the court opts to expressly warn of sanctions, the sanctions imposed must be consistent with the warning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b624 [1] Here, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Peterman\u2019s case. Peterman repeatedly assured Herbalife and the District Court that he would file his tax returns for 1998 onward, but failed to do so. Peterman has offered no explanation for this failure, and there is no basis for chalking it up as inadvertence. This action deprived Herbalife of evidence that Peterman himself conceded was relevant and delayed resolution of the case for two years, inconveniencing both Herbalife and the District Court. Peterman argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his case because \u201che had no reason to believe that he faced dismissal or any other sanction.\u201d Peterman contends that the District Court was required to warn him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>before dismissing his case. This argument is mistaken. As mentioned above, no such warning was required. <em>See </em>id.; M. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2). Furthermore, the District Court\u2019s statement in response to Herbalife\u2019s initial motion to compel that sanctions were not appropriate cannot be interpreted as an assurance that Peterman would be insulated from sanctions for any subsequent failure to comply with discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b625 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-5\">JUSTICES RICE, MORRIS, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
