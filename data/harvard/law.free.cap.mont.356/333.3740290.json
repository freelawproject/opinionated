We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u00b62 Maynard presents the following issues<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did trial counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to argue that \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, prohibits initiation of a revocation proceeding following a seventy-two-hour hold and release?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">\u00b64 <em>Did trial counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to argue that initiation of a revocation proceeding following a seventy-two-hour hold and release violates the prohibition upon double jeopardy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">\u00b65 Pursuant to a plea agreement, Maynard pled guilty to Issuing a Bad Check, a Felony Common Scheme, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-316(3), MCA, and on April 25, 2007, received a three-year deferred sentence. He was placed under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and subjected to various conditions and rules and regulations of the Department, including that Maynard report to his probation officer, pay restitution in the amount of $2,218.69, refrain from establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>a checking or credit account, and comply with all laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b66 In October 2008, Maynard\u2019s probation officer learned that Maynard had written addition\u00e1l bad checks totaling $1,790.61 and, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, issued an authorization for law enforcement to pick up and hold Maynard. According to the briefing herein, Maynard was detained on October 30, 2008, and released on November 1, 2008, upon the probation officer\u2019s issuance to law enforcement of an authorization for his release. Maynard thereafter remained on active supervision and was required to continue reporting to his probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b67 In March 2009, Maynard\u2019s probation officer issued a report of violation stating that Maynard had violated four conditions of his suspended sentence, including: (1) failure to report to his probation officer, (2) failure to comply with all laws, (3) failure to pay restitution, and (4) failure to refrain from establishing a checking or credit account. The report articulated how Maynard had violated each condition and the dates of each violation. All of the alleged violations occurred before Maynard\u2019s October 2008 detainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b68 Based upon the report of violation, the Missoula County Attorney filed a petition to revoke Maynard\u2019s probation. The District Court held a hearing on the petition April 29, 2009, wherein Maynard, with counsel, admitted to all of the facts substantiating the petition. Maynard\u2019s counsel presented no argument that, due to Maynard\u2019s October 2008 detention, he had been \u201cpreviously sanctioned\u201d with a seventy-two-hour hold and release, and therefore the petition to revoke was barred. Thus, the District Court did not address the \u201cpreviously sanctioned\u201d argument, and on May 18, 2009, it revoked Maynard\u2019s probation and sentenced him to ten years at the Montana State Prison with five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b69 Meanwhile, a petition for revocation of a different sentence Maynard had received in Ravalli County was also filed, apparently upon the same violations supporting the petition filed in Missoula County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the Ravalli County proceeding, Maynard\u2019s counsel filed a \u201cMotion to Strike Allegation of Violations,\u201d arguing that the State could not base its revocation petition upon the alleged violations because Maynard had already been sanctioned for them by his October 2008 detention in Missoula County and, thus, would be receiving a \u201cdouble sanction.\u201d The District Court for Ravalli County granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Maynard\u2019s motion as to the \u201callegations of writing $1,7[9]0.61 in bad checks, maintaining checking accounts at First Citizen\u2019s Bank in Missoula, and issuing overdrafts on those account[s].\u201d The court denied the motion regarding the allegation that \u201cMaynard failed to personally report to his probation and parole officer as directed.\u201d However, after learning that the Missoula County District Court had revoked Maynard\u2019s probation, the Ravalli County Attorney\u2019s Office moved to dismiss its petition, noting that Maynard had \u201cbeen sentenced to ten (10) years, with five (5) suspended in the [Missoula County] District Court, and it seems expedient that Defendant begin to serve his sentence without any further delay in the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b610 Maynard appeals from the Missoula County District Court\u2019s revocation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b611 Claims for ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2009 MT 60, \u00b6 10, 349 Mont. 335, 203 P.3d 834 (citing <em>State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 509, 74 P.3d 1047).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b612 <em>Did trial counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to argue that \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, prohibits initiation of a revocation proceeding following a seventy-two-hour hold and release?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u00b613 Maynard argues that because his probation officer detained and released him under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(a), MCA, for alleged probation violations, the subsequent revocation of his probation upon the same acts constituted an impermissible \u201cdouble sanction.\u201d Noting that his Ravalli County counsel prevailed on this issue, Maynard argues that his Missoula County counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to raise it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State responds that Maynard\u2019s seventy-two-hour detention was not a \u201csanction\u201d under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, and, thus, counsel did not provide ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b614 We have adopted the two-prong ineffective assistance of counsel test as established by <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984). <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Under the first prong, the defendant must demonstrate \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. A deficiency of performance arises when counsel\u2019s actions fall \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d thereby denying a defendant his right to counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. Under the second prong, \u201cthe defendant must show that the [counsel\u2019s] deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. The defendant must demonstrate \u201cprejudice\u201d by \u201cshow[ing] that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b615 In light of the burden upon the defendant to establish both prongs to sustain a claim, \u201cthere is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (\u201c[I]f an insufficient showing is made regarding one prong of the test, there is no need to address the other prong.\u201d). Here, we resolve Maynard\u2019s claim under the first prong, and therefore turn to the substantive law governing the issue Maynard claims his counsel should have raised before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b616 If a probation officer reasonably believes that a probationer has violated a condition of probation, the officer may have an arrest warrant or notice to appear issued for the probationer. Section 46-23-1012(1), MCA. The statute then provides the following procedure after an arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">(3) A probation and parole officer may authorize a detention center to hold a probationer arrested under this section without bail for 72 hours. Within 72 hours following the probationer\u2019s detention, the probation and parole officer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">(a) authorize the detention center to release the probationer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">(b) hold an intervention hearing pursuant to 46-23-1015; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">(c) arrange for the probationer to appear before a magistrate to set bail. In setting bail, the provisions of chapter 9 of this title regarding release on bail of persons charged with a crime apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">(4) If the probationer is detained and bond is set, the probationer and parole officer shall file a report of violation within 10 days of the arrest of the probationer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">(5) After the probation and parole officer files a report of violation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the court may proceed with revocation of probation in the manner provided in 46-18-203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Section 46-23-1012(3X5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b617 We addressed these provisions in <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2008 MT 233, 344 Mont. 394, 188 P.3d 1034. Martinez violated the conditions of his probation on several occasions and, based upon these violations, Martinez\u2019s probation officer held three intervention hearings pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(b), MCA, and imposed administrative sanctions upon Martinez. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7, 9, 18. The probation officer then filed a report of violation and the District Court ultimately revoked Martinez\u2019s suspended sentence. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. On appeal, he argued \u201cthat once the probation officer elects to pursue an intervention hearing under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(b), MCA, then she cannot also pursue a revocation hearing before the District Court for the same violation.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18. We concluded that \u201c[t]he language of the statute being clearly disjunctive, the probation officer can pursue only one of these options for an alleged violation of probation conditions.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18. Because a probation officer\u2019s pursuit of both an intervention hearing and a probation revocation for the same violations would sanction a probationer twice under the statute, we agreed with Martinez. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18. However, we affirmed Martinez\u2019s revocation because he had not been previously subjected to an intervention hearing for one of the alleged probation violations. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"AC-\">\u00b618 In <em>State v. Johnston, </em>2008 MT 318, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 346 Mont. 93, 193 P.3d 925, police arrested probationer Johnston for an alcohol-related incident and later arrested him again for partner or family member assault and obstructing a police officer. On both occasions, the probation officer had a warrant issued to arrest and hold Johnston. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The probation officer then recommended bond be set pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(c), MCA, and each time the District Court agreed. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39-40. Based upon these incidents, his probation officer filed a report of violation recommending that Johnston\u2019s sentence be revoked. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 11. Citing to <em>Martinez, </em>we held in a single sentence, without analysis, that \u201c[t]he District Court could not revoke Johnston\u2019s sentence for conduct for which the court already had set bond pursuant to the two petitions of \u2018Suspected Violation of Probation\u2019 without subjecting Johnston to double jeopardy ....\u201d <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 42. As in <em>Martinez, </em>we nevertheless sustained the revocation of Johnston\u2019s probation because the District Court had not set bond for a different probation violation which supported the revocation. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b619 Maynard was released from detention under the option provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to probation officers under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(a), MCA. He thus argues, pursuant to our holdings in <em>Martinez and. Johnston, </em>that the probation officer\u2019s election to release him prohibits the subsequent proceeding to revoke his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b620 A reader of our prior decisions may make the assumption that the three disjunctive subparagraphs under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, are the probation officer\u2019s exclusive options with regard to a probationer who is believed to have violated probationary conditions. However, that assumption would be incorrect. As we explained in <em>Martinez, </em>the three options under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, are only \u201cwith respect to a <em>detained </em>probationer.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18 (emphasis added). As noted above, a probation officer may initiate a revocation proceeding without having the probationer arrested or detained, rather, by issuance of a notice to appear through a county attorney under \u00a7 46-23-1012(1), MCA, and then proceeding in court under \u00a7 46-23-1012(5), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA. Likewise, a probation officer may initiate an intervention hearing without first arresting the probationer pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1015, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b621 In <em>Martinez </em>we essentially equated option (c) under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA-allowing a probation officer to \u201carrange for the probationer to appear before a magistrate to set bail\u201d-as a sentence revocation for purposes of comparing the three options under that subsection. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18. This linkage is implicit within the statutory provisions following option (c), which provide that, after the setting of bail, a probation officer must file a report of violation within a specified time, followed by the revocation proceeding. Section 46-23-1012(4)-(5), MCA. While this linkage was appropriate in the context of the issue raised in Martinez-whether a probation officer could pursue both an intervention hearing and a sentence revocation against a detained probationer for the same violation-it is also clear that the mere setting of bail under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(c), MCA, is not a revocation determination itself. It is simply one step toward revocation. Consequently, our single-sentence analysis in <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 42, that \u201c[t]he District Court could not revoke Johnston\u2019s sentence for conduct for which the court already had set bond\u201d under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(c), MCA, was in error, and is overruled. Setting bail or \u201cbond\u201d is simply the first step in pursuing revocation of a detained probationer. It is not a sanction in itself, and does not preclude the revocation proceeding which would follow the setting of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b622 Similarly, option (a) under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, merely \u201cauthorize[s] the detention center to release the probationer.\u201d Option (a) does not impose a sanction upon the probationer for a probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>violation, but merely resolves his detention by release. At that point, the probation officer may determine not to take further action against the probationer; or, the probation officer may elect to either initiate a revocation proceeding under \u00a7 46-23-1012(5), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, or an intervention proceeding under \u00a7 46-23-1015, MCA, but not both. The statutory structure does not contemplate the pursuit of sanctions by both a revocation proceeding and an intervention hearing for the same violation. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 46-23-1012(1), MCA (probationer must \u201canswer to a charge of probation violation\u201d before the court) <em>with </em>\u00a7 46-23-1015(1), MCA (probationer\u2019s compliance with conditions of probation may be obtained by intervention \u201cwithout a formal revocation hearing\u201d). This is consistent with the options available for a detained probationer under \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, as we set forth in <em>Martinez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b623  In summary, a probation officer who has detained a probationer for a suspected probation violation may, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, (a) release the probationer, (b) hold an intervention hearing, or (c) arrange for a magistrate to set bail. Whether the probationer is released or detained, the probation officer may thereafter pursue an intervention hearing or a revocation proceeding for a particular violation, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b624  Here, Maynard\u2019s probation officer chose to release Maynard from jail under option (a) of \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA. After Maynard\u2019s release, the probation officer filed a report of violation with the court, thus pursuing a revocation proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(5), MCA. This procedure did not sanction Maynard twice for a probation violation. Consequently, Maynard\u2019s claim that he was impermissibly sanctioned twice under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, would have failed, and his counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, and did not constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b625 <em>Did trial counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to argue that initiation of a revocation proceeding following a seventy-two-hour hold and release violates the prohibition upon double jeopardy?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b626 Maynard also argues that the revocation of his probation, coupled with his detainment and release under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(a), MCA, violated his right under the federal and state constitutions to be free from double jeopardy, and that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to make this argument to the District Court. He cites again to our statement in <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 42, that \u201c[t]he District Court could not revoke Johnston\u2019s sentence for conduct for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>court already had set bond pursuant to the two petitions of\u2018Suspected Violation of Probation\u2019 <em>without subjecting Johnston to double jeopardy </em>....\u201d (Emphasis added.) The State argues that a probation revocation is not a \u201csanction,\u201d and therefore does not implicate double jeopardy concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b627 We likewise resolve this issue under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution provides, \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U. S. Const. amend. V. This provision is applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 2062 (1969). The Montana Constitution likewise states, \u201cNo person shall be again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 25. This Court has recognized that the Montana Constitution\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause affords Montana citizens greater protection than provided under the United States Constitution. <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 16, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b628 Recently, in <em>State v. Haagenson, </em>2010 MT 95, 356 Mont. 177, 232 P.3d 367, we extensively analyzed the double jeopardy implications of a revocation proceeding. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">[A] revocation of parole or probation does not constitute a punishment for double jeopardy purposes under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25. Rather, it is a supervisory act involving the enforcement of conditions imposed on a term of parole or probation. Upon the demonstration of a probation violation, the sentencing court may modify the offender\u2019s original sentence by replacing the term of probation with imprisonment.... This is not a \u201cpunishment\u201d; rather it is a forfeiture of a conditional privilege previously granted by the State as a matter of grace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An\"><em>Haagenson, </em>\u00b6 17 (citations omitted). Maynard bases his double jeopardy claim on the assumption that a probation revocation constitutes a punishment or sanction, but we concluded in <em>Haagenson </em>that it does not. Our brief statement to the contrary in <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 42, is thus overruled for this reason also. Maynard\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently in failing to raise this argument, and did not render ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-14\"> Although not listed within his Statement of Issues, Maynard states in his briefing that, alternatively, he \u201cappeals the sentence imposed upon him by the district court\u201d on the ground that the court did not take into account the provisions of \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, when sentencing him. Maynard did not further develop this argument in his brief and we do not address it. <em>See DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6 30, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753; M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"> Maynard\u2019s counsel in Ravalli County was different than his counsel in Missoula County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> Maynard acknowledges his ineffective assistance claim is not record-based but argues there is no \u201cplausible explanation\u201d for his counsel\u2019s conduct, allowing review on direct appeal. <em>See e.g. State v.
