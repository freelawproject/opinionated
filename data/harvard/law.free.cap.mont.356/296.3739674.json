(NPRC) (collectively Appellants), appeal the order of the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Big Horn County, granting summary judgment to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Richard Opper, Director of DEQ, and Fidelity Exploration &amp; Production Company (Fidelity). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b62 We review the following dispositive issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b63 <em>Whether DEQ violated the Clean Water Act or the Montana Water Quality Act by issuing discharge permits to Fidelity without imposing pre-discharge treatment standards?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b64 Appellants live and work along the Tongue River in southeastern Montana. The Tongue River rises in Wyoming and flows north through Big Horn and Rosebud counties to its confluence with the Yellowstone River. The Tribe holds reserved water rights on the Tongue River and uses this water for irrigation, stockwater, recreation, and cultural uses. Members of TRWUA and NPRC rely on the high quality waters of the Tongue River for irrigation, domestic use, and stockwater. Fidelity extracts Coal Bed Methane (CBM), a form of natural gas, for commercial sale near the Tongue River. Large underground coal seams permeate this part of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b65 The pressure of groundwater in these underground coal seams traps CBM. Fidelity draws groundwater from the subterranean coal seams in order to extract CBM. CBM extraction releases significant amounts of groundwater to the surface of the earth. Fidelity must dispose of the groundwater drawn to the surface. CBM producers dispose of the groundwater in a variety of ways. Fidelity discharges the groundwater at issue into the Tongue River.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b66 The groundwater associated with CBM extraction contains a naturally high saline content. The highly saline groundwater may degrade the quality of the receiving surface waterway. Surface waters degraded by CBM discharge water, in turn, may have an adverse affect on irrigated agriculture and aquatic life. In fact, federal law defines the discharge water associated with CBM extraction as a \u201cpollutant\u201d under the Clean Water Act (CWA). <em>Northern Plains Resource Council v. Fidelity Exploration &amp; Dev. Co., </em>325 F.3d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"A62\">\u00b67 This designation as a \u201cpollutant\u201d requires a CBM producer to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit in order to release the water into receiving waters. <em>Northern Plains Resource Council, </em>325 F.3d at 1160; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342 (\u00a7 402). NPDES permits impose conditions and limitations on the discharge of pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers NPDES permits unless a state has enacted its own enforcement program, in which case EPA\u2019s Administrator (the Administrator) must have approved the state\u2019s program. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1342 (\u00a7\u00a7 401, 402). Montana has chosen to administer its own permit program. Section 75-5-402, MCA; Mont. Admin. Rule 17.30.101. DEQ administers the Montana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (MPDES) permitting program. Section 75-5-211, MCA; Admin. R. M. 17.30.1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b68 Fidelity began discharging untreated CBM water into the Tongue</p>\n<p id=\"b319-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>River without a permit in August 1998. <em>Northern Plains Resource Council, </em>325 F.3d at 1158-59. DEQ authorized the discharge without a permit pursuant to \u00a7 75-5-40l(l)(b), MCA, between August 1998 and when DEQ issued Fidelity a permit in June 2000. Section 75-5-401(l)(b), MCA, allows unpermitted discharge to surface waters if the discharge does not alter the ambient water quality. EPA notified DEQ in 1998 that \u00a7 75-5-40l(l)(b), MCA, conflicts with the CWA, and that DEQ must follow NPDES permitting requirements for Fidelity\u2019s discharge. <em>Northern Plains Resource Council, </em>325 F.3d at 1159. DEQ resisted EPA\u2019s attempt to revoke the exemption under \u00a7 75-5-401(l)(b), MCA, and continued to allow Fidelity to discharge into the Tongue River.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">\u00b69 Fidelity filed for MPDES permits in January 1999 despite DEQ\u2019s advisement. <em>Northern Plains Resource Council, </em>325 F.3d at 1159. NPRC filed an action in federal district court in June 2000 in which it challenged Fidelity\u2019s lack of compliance with the NPDES permitting requirements. DEQ altered its position and issued Fidelity an MPDES permit for the discharge of CBM water into the Tongue River. DEQ issued the permit to Fidelity in 2000 shortly after NPRC had filed its action. <em>Northern Plains Resource Council, </em>325 F.3d at 1159. The permit allowed Fidelity to discharge untreated CBM water into the Tongue River. Fidelity applied to renew this permit in 2004 in conjunction with its application for a second permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b6 10 DEQ issued Fidelity its second MPDES permit in 2006 along with the renewed permit for the original discharge. The second permit required Fidelity to treat a portion of its CBM discharge water and \u201cblend\u201d this treated wastewater with untreated wastewater before discharging it into the Tongue River. DEQ measures the salinity levels of CBM discharge water by its electric conductivity (EC) and its sodium absorption ratio (SAR). Admin. R. M. 17.30.602(9) and (27). DEQ imposes conditions on MPDES permits based upon EC and SAR measurements. DEQ imposed effluent limitations on Fidelity\u2019s MPDES permits in the form of water quality standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b611 DEQ\u2019s water quality standards impose <em>discharge </em>rate restrictions based upon EC and SAR calculations. Water quality standards look to the change in ambient water quality in the receiving waterway to ascertain acceptable levels of pollutant discharge under the CWA. <em>EPA v. Cal. ex rel. State Water Resources Control Bd., </em>426 U.S. 200, 202, 96 S. Ct. 2022, 2023-24 (1976). These water quality standards guide polluter performance based upon \u201ctolerable effects\u201d of pollutant discharge. <em>EPA, </em>426 U.S. at 202, 96 S. Ct. at 2023. In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>water quality standards allow producers to discharge pollutants into a waterway up to a tolerable level. DEQ opted to impose these water quality discharge rate restrictions rather than to impose uniform predischarge treatment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b612 Pre-discharge treatment standards-often referred to as technology-based effluent limitations-focus on \u201cpreventable causes\u201d and <em>treatment </em>of pollutants before discharge into a receiving waterway. <em>EPA, </em>426 U.S. at 202, 96 S. Ct. at 2024. Producers treat wastewater before discharging it into a receiving waterway under pre-discharge treatment standards. Pre-discharge treatment standards seek to minimize effluent discharge through specified levels of treatment. This pre-discharge treatment system makes it \u201cunnecessary to work backward from an overpolluted body of water to determine which point sources are responsible.\u201d <em>EPA, </em>426 U.S. at 204, 96 S. Ct. at 2024.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b6 13 The Montana Board of Environmental Review (BER) promulgates rules related to water quality standards and industry-wide effluent limitations. Section 75-5-201, MCA; \u00a7 75-5-305, MCA. BER created a Water Quality Standard in 2003 specifically to control and limit CBM discharge water\u2019s saline characteristics and its negative impacts on Montana\u2019s waters and water users.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b614 BER promulgated a narrative \u201cnonsignificance\u201d threshold for EC and SAR during the 2003 rulemaking process. DEQ considered the discharge nonsignificant under this narrative standard if the EC and SAR did not have a \u201cmeasurable effect\u201d on existing uses in the receiving waterway and there was no \u201cmeasurable change\u201d in aquatic life in the receiving waterway. Admin. R. M. 17.30.760(6) (2003). These rules exempted the MPDES permit from nondegradation review, though otherwise required by Federal and Montana law, if the EC and SAR fell below the nonsignificance threshold. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.12(a)(2); \u00a7 75-5-303, MCA; Admin. R. M. 17.30.701 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b615 DEQ evaluated both of Fidelity\u2019s MPDES permit applications under the 2003 rule that classified the discharge as nonsignificant thereby avoiding nondegradation review. DEQ finally approved both of Fidelity\u2019s MPDES permits in 2006. BER was in the process of revising its 2003 rule at the time. BER declined entreaties to adopt pre-discharge treatment standards for CBM. BER concluded that predischarge treatment standards would not be \u201ctechnologically, economically, and environmentally feasible, as required by \u00a7 75-5-305(1), MCA.\u201d BER\u2019s 2006 revisions of the nonsignificance rule instead designated EC and SAR as \u201charmful parameters.\u201d BER classified EC and SAR as harmful parameters to implement Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>nondegradation policy to protect Montana\u2019s \u201chigh quality\u201d waters. The Montana Water Quality Act (WQA) designates the Tongue River a \u201chigh quality\u201d waterway. Section 75-5-103(13), MCA. BER adopted the new rule one month after DEQ had approved Fidelity\u2019s permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\u00b616 Appellants challenged DEQ\u2019s issuance of the MPDES permits. Appellants alleged that DEQ had violated the CWA and the WQA by failing to include pre-discharge treatment standards in both permits. Appellants further alleged that DEQ had failed to undertake a nondegradation review, and that DEQ and Fidelity had violated their right to a clean and healthful environment under the Montana Constitution. Finally, Appellants claimed that the environmental assessment prepared for Fidelity\u2019s permits had failed to comply with the Montana Environmental Policy Act\u2019s (MEPA) requirement of considering a range of alternatives, including a no action alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"AD4\">\u00b617 The parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment and the District Court heard oral argument on February 28, 2007. The court granted summary judgment to DEQ and Fidelity on all four claims on December 9, 2008. The District Court determined that DEQ properly had used water quality standards instead of pre-discharge treatment standards in evaluating Fidelity\u2019s permits. The court reasoned that the water quality standards ensured compliance with Montana\u2019s Water Quality Standard and the 2003 nonsignificance rule. The court noted that the CWA afforded DEQ discretion to use predischarge treatment standards or water quality standards in the absence of adoption of federal standards by EPA. Appellants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b618 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and apply the same criteria applied by the district court under M.R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Pennaco Energy, Inc. v. Mont. Bd. of Envtl. Review, </em>2008 MT 425, \u00b6 17, 347 Mont. 415, 199 P.3d 191.

The same standard of review-correctness-applies to the district court\u2019s review of the administrative agency\u2019s decision, and our subsequent review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Pennaco, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b620 <em>Whether DEQ violated the Clean Water Act or the Montana Water </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>Quality Act by issuing discharge permits to Fidelity without imposing pre-discharge treatment standards?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The CWA - Structure and Intent</p>\n<p id=\"AlS\">\u00b621 Congress enacted the CWA in 1948 with the goal of <em>eliminating </em>the discharge of pollutants in order to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. 1251(a) (\u00a7 101). Congress developed the NPDES permit system to achieve this goal. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1342 and 1311 (\u00a7\u00a7 402 and 301).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b622 Congress amended the CWA in 1972 to make pre-discharge treatment standards the centerpiece of the NPDES permit system. Sen. Rpt. 92-414 at 3675 (Oct. 28, 1971). Pre-discharge treatment standards prevent degradation of water quality by requiring treatment before discharging wastewater into the receiving waterways. The 1972 revisions sought to achieve enforcement through implementation of pre-discharge treatment standards \u201cbecause the previous water-quality based approach to pollutant control had been \u2018limited in its success.\u2019\u201d <em>Our Children\u2019s Earth Found, v. EPA, </em>527 F.3d 842, 847-48 (9th Cir. 2008); Sen. Rpt. 92-414 at 3675. Congress determined that water quality standards had proven ineffective because they did not govern adequately the conduct of individual polluters. <em>EPA, </em>426 U.S. at 202, 96 S. Ct. at 2023-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b623 Congress reaffirmed its commitment to pre-discharge treatment standards as the foundation of water quality regulation in the 1985 amendments to the CWA. Congress cited the \u201chistorical ineffectiveness of the previous water-quality-based approach\u201d and the \u201cimmediate and effective method of achieving the goals of the Act\u201d through the use of pre-discharge treatment standards. <em>Our Children\u2019s Earth Found., </em>527 F.3d at 848 (citing Sen. Comm. Print 3-4 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b624 We review the District Court\u2019s determination that the Administrator possesses discretion whether to impose pre-discharge treatment standards against this backdrop. The District Court agreed with DEQ\u2019s claim that \u00a7 402(a)(1) of the CWA grants discretionary authority to the Administrator. The court determined further that \u00a7 402 imposes no mandatory duty on the Administrator or the states to require pre-discharge treatment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The Non-Biscretionary Requirements of Sections 402 and 301</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u00b625 The Administrator establishes effluent limitations in one of two ways once the Administrator decides to grant a permit under \u00a7 402(a)(1)(A) or (B). The Administrator may promulgate guidelines for an entire class of industry when operating under \u00a7 402(a)(1)(A). 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1314(b) (\u00a7 304(b)). In the alternative, the Administrator may establish effluent limitations geared to the particular exigency of an individual permit application under \u00a7 402(a)(1)(B). The Fifth Circuit in <em>Texas Oil &amp; Gas Assn v. EPA, </em>161 F.3d 923 (5th Cir. 1998), determined that, \u201cin practice,\u201d compliance with the language of \u00a7 402(a)(1)(B) \u201cmeans that EPA must determine on a case-by-case basis what effluent limitations represent the BAT [best available technology] level.\u201d <em>Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">\u00b626 The Administrator must use its \u201cbest professional judgment\u201d in determining the BAT on a case-by-case basis. <em>Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 928-29. EPA\u2019s best professional judgment in determining the BAT \u201cthus take[s] the place of uniform national guidelines\u201d otherwise promulgated under \u00a7 402(a)(1)(A). <em>Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 929. The technology-based standard under \u00a7 402(a)(1)(B) \u201cremains the same,\u201d however, even in the absence of uniform national standards. <em>Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 929. As a result, individual NPDES permits must adhere to \u00a7 402(a)(1)(B) when EPA has not yet promulgated these industry-wide guidelines. <em>Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b627 EPA has yet to promulgate industry-wide guidelines for CBM. 74 Fed. Reg. 68599, 68607 (Dec. 28, 2009). In the interim, EPA must incorporate pre-discharge treatment standards on a case-by-case basis for the CBM industry pursuant to the mandate under \u00a7 402(a)(1)(B) that require the use of BAT. <em>Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 928-29. DEQ argues, nevertheless, that the absence of industry-wide standards for CBM leaves the actual use of pre-discharge treatment standards in the NPDES permitting process to the discretion of the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac8\">\u00b628 DEQ correctly notes that the language in \u00a7 402 of the CWA allows that the Administrator \u201cmay\u201d issue permits for pollutant discharge. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342. Once the Administrator decides to issue a permit, however, it may be granted only upon condition that such discharge will meet all applicable requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, and 403, or \u201csuch conditions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a)(l)(A)-(B). Sections 402 and 301 operate in tandem: \u00a7 402 grants the Administrator authority to issue NPDES permits and \u00a7 301 enumerates the conditions and limitations that each permit must contain. <em>E.P.A. v. National Crushed Stone Assn, </em>449 U.S. 64, 71, 101 S. Ct. 295, 301 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b629 Section 301 provides that the discharge of any pollutant shall be unlawful unless otherwise provided by the section. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a). Section 301 requires the implementation of \u201ceffluent limitations\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>carry out the objective of minimizing pollutant discharge. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(b)(l)(A)-(2)(A). The plain language of \u00a7 301(b)(l)(A)-(2)(A) requires the effluent limitations to use pre-discharge treatment standards in the absence of federal guidelines. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(b)(l)(A)-(2)(A). Further, \u00a7 306 of the CWA requires that new sources of pollution, such as Fidelity\u2019s, use the \u201cbest available demonstrated control technology.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b630 The statutory framework of the CWA \u201crequires\u201d the Administrator to enforce pre-discharge treatment standards on individual discharges from point sources when granting NPDES permits. <em>PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Co. v. Wash. Dept. of Ecology, </em>511 U.S. 700, 704, 114 S. Ct. 1900, 1905 (1994). This duty to impose pre-discharge treatment standards remains non-discretionary. <em>PUD No. </em>1, 511 U.S. at 704, 114 S. Ct. at 1905. Courts have interpreted \u00a7 402(a)(1)(B) to require the Administrator to impose pre-discharge treatment standards on a case-by-case basis for industries such as CBM. <em>Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b631 Section 301 ensures that the Administrator impose pre-discharge treatment standards under \u00a7 402\u2019s permitting system. It becomes apparent from our review of the CWA and decisions interpreting it that Congress intended to impose pre-discharge treatment standards in every NPDES permit issued under the CWA. This requirement furthers the CWA\u2019s goal of \u201celiminating\u201d pollutant discharge into our Nation\u2019s waterways. 33 U.S.C. 1251(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">State Mandates Under the CWA and Its Implementing Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b632 We now must determine whether the CWA imposes the same predischarge treatment requirement on those states that administer their own permitting systems. EPA has promulgated pre-discharge treatment regulations pursuant to the mandate from \u00a7 301(b). <em>National Crushed Stone Assn. </em>449 U.S. at 71, 101 S. Ct. at 301. Implementation of the CWA\u2019s enforcement provisions involves a \u201ccomplex statutory and regulatory scheme\u201d that implicates both federal and state administrative responsibilities. <em>PUD No. 1, </em>511 U.S. at 704, 114 S. Ct. at 1905. EPA\u2019s regulations explain the related duties of states and the Administrator in the permitting process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b633 Any NPDES permit granted under \u00a7 402 requires the discharger to \u201cmeet all the applicable requirements specified in the regulations issued under \u00a7 <em>SOI.\u201d National Crushed Stone Assn, </em>449 U.S. at 71, 101 S. Ct. at 301. EPA regulations mandate that the pre-discharge treatment requirements under \u00a7 301(b) of the CWA \u201crepresent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>minimum </em>level of control that <em>must </em>be imposed in a permit issued under section 402 of the Act.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3(a) (emphasis added). The regulation requires that the permit writer \u201cshall apply\u201d predischarge treatment standards \u201c[o]n a case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1) of the Act.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3(c)(2)-(d); <em>See also Texas Oil, </em>161 F.3d at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">\u00b634 DEQ cites to <em>Washington v. EPA, </em>573 F.2d 583 (9th Cir. 1978), to support its argument that imposition of pre-discharge treatment standards in MPDES permits remains discretionary despite the regulation\u2019s mandatory language. The court in <em>Washington </em>refused to impose effluent limitations through pre-discharge treatment standards until EPA first had established industry-wide guidelines under \u00a7 304(b). <em>Wash., </em>573 F.2d at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b635 The Ninth Circuit decided <em>Washington </em>before EPA had promulgated 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3 in 1979. EPA addressed <em>Washington </em>specifically when it promulgated 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3. EPA determined that 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3 provided what the court in <em>Washington </em>had found lacking-the authority and requirements for permit writers to impose pre-discharge treatment standards on a case-by-case basis. 44 Fed. Reg. 32854, 32893 (June 7, 1979). EPA concluded that its new regulation required either the Administrator or the states to enforce pre-discharge treatment standards. 44 Fed. Reg. at 32893.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b636 The District Court determined that state agencies implementing their own permitting programs, such as DEQ, do not \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of the Administrator. EPA\u2019s regulation defines the \u201cpermit writer,\u201d however, as either the Administrator or a state. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3(c). DEQ administers MPDES permits for the CBM industry in Montana on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b637 Contrary to DEQ\u2019s claim that it does not \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of the Administrator, DEQ-as a \u201cpermit writer\u201d-must adhere to the same requirement as the Administrator of implementing pre-discharge treatment standards as the minimum level of control required in all permits. <em>NRDC v. EPA, </em>859 F.2d 156 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The <em>NRDC </em>court determined that states issuing permits under \u00a7 402 \u201cstand in the shoes of the agency\u201d and thus must adhere to the federal requirement to use pre-discharge treatment standards. <em>NRDC, </em>859 F.2d at 183, 187. Further, the court deemed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Washington </em>unconvincing in light of the fact that the court had decided <em>Washington </em>before EPA had promulgated regulations. <em>NRDC, </em>859 F.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">\u00b638 The industry defendants in <em>NRDC </em>had challenged the Administrator\u2019s authority to veto a state-administered NPDES permit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>NRDC, </em>859 F.2d at 182. Specifically, the defendants argued that nothing required the states to \u201cadhere to vague technology-based standards set forth in the statute\u201d until EPA had promulgated industry-wide guidelines. <em>NRDC, </em>859 F.2d at 183. The court rejected outright this idea. The court determined that \u201cstates are required to compel adherence to the Act\u2019s technology-based standards regardless of whether EPA has specified their content\u201d through industry-wide regulations. <em>NRDC, </em>859 F.2d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b639 The court concluded that \u00a7 402 requires EPA to exercise its best professional judgment in setting effluent limitations in considering permits in the absence of formally promulgated industry-wide guidelines. <em>NRDC, </em>859 F.2d at 183. EPA\u2019s best professional judgment requires it to use pre-discharge treatment standards to set effluent limitations, as mandated under \u00a7 301(b). The court also concluded that EPA\u2019s implementing regulations obligated states to impose predischarge treatment standards when standing in the shoes of the Administrator. <em>NRDC, </em>859 F.2d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b640 DEQ still maintains, however, that EPA\u2019s regulations allow it to enforce effluent limitations in MPDES permits by imposing water quality standards instead of pre-discharge treatment standards as long as the water quality standards are \u201cmore stringent.\u201d 40 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 122.44(d), 125.3(a). Section 303 requires states to institute water quality standards that remain subject to federal approval. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313. Pre-discharge treatment standards and state-administered water quality standards represent separate and distinct functions of the CWA. <em>EPA, </em>426 U.S. at 204, 96 S. Ct. at 2024.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b641 State water quality standards \u201csupplement\u201d the protections offered by pre-discharge treatment standards. <em>EPA, </em>426 U.S. at 205, 96 S. Ct. at 2025, FN12. Neither the Administrator, nor states, may supplant pre-discharge treatment standards with water quality standards. <em>PUD No. 1, </em>511 U.S. at 704, 114 S. Ct. at 1905. State water quality standards provide an additional layer of protection when predischarge treatment standards alone would not protect water quality. <em>PUD No. 1, </em>511 U.S. at 704, 114 S. Ct. at 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b642 DEQ argues that it complied with the \u201cmore stringent\u201d criteria when it imposed the water quality standards on Fidelity\u2019s permits rather than pre-discharge treatment standards. We struggle to conceive how water quality standards could be more stringent than pre-discharge treatment in light of the capability of pre-discharge treatment to clean CBM wastewater. DEQ issued Fidelity\u2019s permits based upon a finding that high salinity levels already had impaired the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Tongue River. DEQ still chose to administer Fidelity\u2019s permits by imposing water quality standards that allowed Fidelity to discharge into the Tongue River nearly seven million pounds of sodium and seventeen million pounds of salts each year under one permit alone.</p>\n<p id=\"AFn\">\u00b643 The parties do not dispute that Fidelity had a pre-discharge treatment facility already in place that could reduce the CBM wastewater\u2019s SAR level to 0.1 or less. DEQ\u2019s claim that water quality standards would be more stringent than pre-discharge treatment rings hollow given these facts. We also cannot ignore the fact that EPA\u2019s regulations mandate that the Administrator or a state \u201cmust\u201d impose pre-discharge treatment standards at a minimum. 40 C.F.R \u00a7125.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"A4u\">\u00b644 Moreover, DEQ-under the implementing authority of Montana\u2019s WQA-has \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d the CWA provisions and EPA\u2019s regulations that require use of pre-discharge treatment standards in all MPDES permits. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1303. DEQ\u2019s own regulations expressly adopt 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3, \u201csetting forth technology-based treatment requirements.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.30.1340(10). EPA\u2019s implementing regulations impose a nondiscretionary duty on states to implement pre-discharge treatment standards. Montana\u2019s WQA, in turn, imposes a corresponding duty on DEQ to implement predischarge treatment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">\u00b645 Finally, DEQ argues that \u00a7 75-5-305(1), MCA, prohibits imposition of technology-based limits on an individual discharge when the discharge is considered \u201cnonsignificant.\u201d DEQ contends that only BER can adopt technology-based limitations. Appellants correctly point out, however, that \u00a7 75-5-305(1), MCA, confines BER\u2019s authority to promulgating \u201cindustry-wide\u201d technology-based controls in the absence of EPA-promulgated industry-wide guidelines. Nothing in this provision prohibits DEQ from establishing pre-discharge treatment standards on a case-by-case basis. Section 75-5-305, MCA. DEQ\u2019s own regulations require it. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1303 and 17.30.1340(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b646  To summarize, the 1972 amendments to the CWA refocused its purpose to eliminating pollutant discharge through the use of predischarge treatment standards in the NPDES program. The CWA imposes a duty to apply pre-discharge treatment standards when granting an NPDES permit. CWA \u00a7\u00a7 402 and 301. EPA\u2019s regulations promulgated under \u00a7 301(b) require states to use pre-discharge treatment standards. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 122.44,123.25, and 125.3. Montana has adopted these EPA regulations. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1303. Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>routinely have interpreted the CWA\u2019s pre-discharge treatment standards to apply to states since EPA\u2019s adoption of regulations in 1979. We, too, determine that the CWA\u2019s pre-discharge treatment standards apply to states. DEQ violated the CWA and Montana\u2019s WQA by issuing discharge permits to Fidelity without imposing predischarge treatment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b647 We reverse the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to DEQ and declare Fidelity\u2019s permits void. We remand to DEQ and direct the agency to re-evaluate Fidelity\u2019s permit applications under the appropriate pre-discharge treatment standards within 90 days of this Court\u2019s decision, during which time Fidelity may continue operating under its current permits. We need not address other issues raised by Appellants in light of our determination regarding the use of pre-discharge treatment standards in MPDES permits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, WHEAT COTTER and RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE DESCHAMPS, sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
