The District Court granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>court had erred in admitting evidence of verdicts in other cases. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b64 Bircher filed suit under the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51. He alleged that he had sustained repetitive motion injuries to his neck, back, and hips during the course of his employment with BNSF. The case proceeded to a jury trial, which lasted ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u00b65 BNSF filed nine motions in limine before trial. The District Court granted eight of the motions. Of particular relevance, BNSF\u2019s fifth motion sought to preclude other BNSF employees, or former employees, from testifying about their own injuries and injury claims against BNSF. The court granted this motion and stated that \u201c[a]ny opinions these individuals could offer about their medical condition or causation of the condition would be incompetent testimony as they are not a physician or expert in workplace safety.\u201d The court concluded by stating that the court\u2019s ruling did not prohibit Bircher from entering rebuttal evidence regarding notice or knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b66 Bircher called Dr. Eckardt Johanning to testify about medical and liability issues. BNSF cross-examined Dr. Johanning about his studies concerning whole-body vibration injuries incurred by people riding in locomotives. BNSF also asked Dr. Johanning about his previous testimony in various repetitive motion cases where a number of other railroads were involved. BNSF asked Dr. Johanning about his testimony in at least seven cases mentioned specifically by name. BNSF then asked Dr. Johanning about his testimony in whole-body vibration injury cases specifically involving BNSF workers, including, in BNSF\u2019s words, \u201cJeff Smith v. BNSF, right here in good ol\u2019 Yellowstone County, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">\u00b67 On redirect, Bircher asked Dr. Johanning about many of the cases that BNSF had covered during cross examination. BNSF did not object. Counsel for Bircher asked: \u201cAnd Mr. Jeff Smith, here in Montana, was he prematurely disabled as a result of musculoskeletal disorders of his spine?\u201d Dr. Johanning answered: \u201cRight. And that was present in my opinion.\u201d Counsel subsequently asked: \u201cAnd Mr. Delos [sic], the case that you went and did the testing on for this - that we\u2019ve been talking about here, was he, too, prematurely disabled from riding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>rough-riding locomotives over bad track?\u201d Dr. Johanning replied: \u201cThat\u2019s the facts and other people have seen it that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b68 On re-cross examination, BNSF then attempted to ask Dr. Johanning about the jury verdicts in the <em>Dellos </em>and <em>Smith </em>cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">Q. And then you were asked about the injuries from a couple of other gentlemen, Mr. Delos [sic] and Mr. Smith, and you said that you felt that they were injured by virtue of the repetitive trauma on the railroad, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">A. Yes. Well, it wasn\u2019t quite that exact question, but.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">Q. Do you know what the jury said. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">[Counsel for Bircher] Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGT\">[Counsel for BNSF] ... in those cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">[Counsel for Bircher]... to this as in violation of the Court\u2019s rules, and collateral, and brings us in to a territory where we\u2019re going to be talking about jury verdicts in all kinds of cases across the country. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The District Court subsequently took a recess to discuss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AnM\">\u00b69 The court then allowed counsel for BNSF to ask Dr. Johanning about whether the <em>Dellos </em>and <em>Smith </em>juries had found BNSF negligent. Counsel for BNSF asked Dr. Johanning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">Q. And in both of those cases, isn\u2019t it true that the jury - both juries, both Yellowstone County juries found that the Defendant, BNSF was not negligent and that with respect to the repetitive motion claims, it was not negligent and the BNSF did not cause any injury to either Mr. Smith or Mr. Delos [sic] as a result of repetitive trauma, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">A. I don\u2019t know anything about it, I wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Counsel for BNSF then asked the court to take judicial notice \u201cthat the verdicts in Delos [sic] v. BNSF and Smith v. BNSF as they related to the repetitive trauma claims, the verdicts were that the Defendant was not negligent and the Defendant did not cause any injury to either of those two gentlemen as a result of repetitive trauma.\u201d The court stated that it would \u201ctake judicial notice of those two cases regarding those facts as stated by counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">\u00b610 The following day, the District Court acknowledged that the discussion that occurred during the recess had not been recorded. The court summarized the conversation during recess as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-15\">My ruling was that [counsel for BNSF] would be allowed to ask the questions, because I thought [counsel for Bircher] had opened the door regarding Mr. Delos [sic] and Mr. Smith, as to what the cumulative trauma negligence was found, and it was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>not-BNSF was found not negligent. We anticipated that Dr. Johanning wouldn\u2019t be able to answer that so he said, well, then, can we take judicial notice, and I said I would, and then I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOu\">Essentially, the court determined that Bircher had violated the motion in limine and had \u201copened the door\u201d to evidence concerning the jury verdicts in the <em>Dellos </em>and <em>Smith </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b611 BNSF revisited the <em>Dellos </em>and <em>Smith </em>verdicts during its closing argument to the jury. BNSF stated that \u201c[t]his is the third stop on the tour here in Yellowstone County, it\u2019s the third time they did uh, we-that this thing\u2019s been done. You heard that the last two times on this repetitive trauma claim 24 of your neighbors, two jury panels, 24 members of this community total said no, no the railroad company wasn\u2019t negligent.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for BNSF.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b612 Bircher subsequently filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59 and \u00a7 25-11-102(1), (7), MCA. The court stated that \u201c[although the Court would rather be staked to an ant pile than retry this two-week case, the Court concludes it erred when allowing the repetitive motion claim portion of jury verdicts in <em>Dellos v. BNSF </em>and <em>Smith v. BNSF </em>to be considered by the jury in this case.\u201d The court further stated that it had believed that Bircher had opened the door to the evidence, but \u201cafter a thorough review of the transcript, and arguments of counsel, the Court believes it erred in that decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">\u00b613 The District Court acknowledged that \u201cprevious jury verdicts are typically not admissible evidence.\u201d The court noted that Bircher had cited many cases that stood for that proposition and that BNSF \u201creally doesn\u2019t disagree with that assessment.\u201d Further, the court stated that \u201c[i]n hindsight, the Court was, quite frankly, frustrated with Dr. Johanning\u2019s testimony. The fact that Dr. Johanning was on the witness stand for over a day probably did not help matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b614 The court concluded that it had erred in allowing the jury to consider the repetitive motion claims in the <em>Dellos </em>and <em>Smith </em>verdicts. The court stated that \u201c[a]ll the jury heard is that Mr. Dellos and Mr. Smith did not prevail on their repetitive motion claims, despite Dr. Johanning\u2019s testimony in those cases, and that fact was driven home in [BNSF\u2019s] closing arguments when [BNSF] discussed the fact that 24 friends and neighbors had ruled against similar plaintiffs, who had ridden similar track while working for BNSF, and this undoubtedly could have had a significant impact on the jury\u2019s decision in this case.\u201d Lastly, the District Court determined Bircher did not receive a fair trial. The court subsequently granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial. BNSF appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b615 The decision to grant or deny a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion. <em>Willing v. Quebedeaux, </em>2009 MT 102, \u00b6 19, 350 Mont. 119, 204 P.3d 1248. The abuse of discretion must be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the party asserting error. <em>Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 18, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b617 BNSF argues on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion when it granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial, even though BNSF agrees that evidence of other verdicts is generally not admissible. BNSF maintains that Bircher \u201cis the one who opened the door to the evidence of other verdicts,\u201d and that BNSF\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Johanning \u201cdid not open the door for Bircher to elicit testimony which falsely claims that the litigants were prematurely disabled by vibration, when in fact he knew that juries in two specific cases had determined otherwise.\u201d BNSF contends that Bircher went \u201cwell beyond rehabilitating the witness,\u201d and that his redirect examination was precluded under the District Court\u2019s order on BNSF\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b618 We disagree with BNSF. BNSF presents no argument that demonstrates that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion. Regardless of whether Bircher is, in fact, the party \u201cwho created this situation,\u201d evidence of what other juries decided could have had a significant impact on what the jury decided in this case. Moreover, BNSF\u2019s statement during closing argument that \u201c24 members of this community total said no, no the railroad company wasn\u2019t negligent\u201d was highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\u00b619 This Court generally affords a district court a great deal of deference because the trial judge is in the best position to weigh the impact of the erroneous admission of evidence or argument. <em>See e.g. Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1998 MT 47, \u00b6 37, 288 Mont. 1, 955 P.2d 160 (stating that the trial judge \u201cis in the best position to determine the prejudicial effect of an attorney\u2019s conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u00b620 The District Court stated that it \u201cwould rather be staked to an ant pile than retry this two-week case,\u201d and yet it granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial. This case illustrates the utility of the manifest abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of discretion standard. We will not disturb the District Court\u2019s decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b621 BNSF claims, secondarily, that the District Court abused its discretion when it granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial because \u201cthe jury independently found Bircher\u2019s repetitive motion claims statute barred.\u201d BNSF maintains that the jury found that Bircher knew or should have known of his medical conditions at issue and believed they were work-related on August 13, 2003. FELA contains a three-year statute of limitations. Bircher did not file his lawsuit until August 7, 2007, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b622  We conclude, as we did above, that the District Court in this case was in the best position to determine whether the admission of the prejudicial evidence had so infected the jury\u2019s deliberations that it influenced every question propounded to the jury. <em>Cf. State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 27, 327 Mont. 238, 113 P.3d 290 (\u201cBecause the trial court is in the best position to observe the jurors and determine the effect of questionable testimony, it is given a latitude of discretion in its rulings on prejudicial evidence.\u201d). Although the District Court did not reference the statute of limitations issue in its order granting Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial, the court specifically determined that Bircher had not received a fair trial. We conclude that BNSF has failed to demonstrate that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion when it granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b623 The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it granted Bircher\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
