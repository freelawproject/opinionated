The Class alleged that MPC had manipulated worker compensation claims benefits dating back to 1977. The Class also claimed that MPC\u2019s successors in interest had followed MPC\u2019s practices of manipulating worker compensation claims. In essence, the Class maintained that MPC intentionally had manipulated and mishandled worker compensation claims, and that such practices had been pervasive throughout the organization and its employees. The Second Judicial District, Butte-Silver Bow County, granted the Class\u2019s motion to certify a class action and defined the class. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court should have excluded the Class\u2019s claims for malice and punitive damages from its order granting the Class\u2019s motion to certify this matter as a class action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court appropriately defined the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b65 A group of MPC workers filed a petition for a class action in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC) against MPC. The workers sought payment for past-due \u201cimpairment awards\u201d for workplace injuries. As a self-insurer, MPC administered its own workers\u2019 compensation plan pursuant to statutory provisions. The WCC reviewed MPC\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b66 The WCC\u2019s review determined that approximately 117 class members had received a \u201cmedical impairment rating\u201d for a MPC workers\u2019 compensation injury and had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on that rating. The WCC further determined that MPC significantly and unreasonably had delayed payment to these employees. The WCC ordered MPC to pay additional penalties. Approximately 104 claims resulted in penalties against MPC as of June 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b67 The WCC\u2019s ruling prompted the Class to file this action in District Court on December 18,1998. The Class alleged that MPC had engaged in bad-faith handling and adjustment of the Class\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims. The Class maintained that MPC intentionally had manipulated their claims and benefits, and that Northwestern Energy and all the other successors in interest had continued those same practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b68 The Class eventually filed a request for class certification with the District Court. MPC argued that \u201cquestions of fraud, malice, and punitive damages were (and are) unique to each former MPC employee and not subject to class treatment.\u201d The District Court granted the Class\u2019s motion for certification on October 2, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\u00b69 The court excluded the Class\u2019s fraud claims from the class certification. The court noted that although \u201ca Class Action will be the best method to adjudicate this matter, the Court is not convinced that the fraud allegations can be established through a mechanism such as a class action under Montana law.\u201d The court recognized that \u201c[f]raud claims are highly fact intensive.\u201d The court determined, however, that the Class had met its burden to proceed with a class action for its other remaining claims, including claims for actual malice and punitive damages. MPC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for class certification for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>2008 MT 109, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 380, 180 P.3d 1164; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Sieglock v. Burlington Northern Ry. Co., </em>2003 MT 355, \u00b6 8, 319 Mont. 8, 81 P.3d 494; <em>McDonald v. Washington, </em>261 Mont. 392, 396, 399, 862 P.2d 1150, 1152, 1154 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court should have excluded the Class\u2019s claims for malice and punitive damages from its order granting the Class\u2019s motion to certify this matter as a class action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b612 MPC notes that the District Court properly recognized that the Class\u2019s fraud allegations were too \u201cfact intensive\u201d to be established in a class-action proceeding. MPC maintains that the District Court should have applied similar reasoning to the Class\u2019s claims for actual malice and punitive damages. In particular, MPC argues that punitive damages must be based on some individualized proof of harm as opposed to a finding of general liability to a class based on a pattern of conduct. MPC suggests that \u201c[t]here is no apparent similarity-other than delay in the payment of benefits-in the actual damages incurred by any of [the Class].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b613 The Class\u2019s claims for actual malice and punitive damages differ from the Class\u2019s claims for actual fraud. Section 27-1-221, MCA, sets forth the manner in which a court may award punitive damages. Subsection (2) provides that a defendant is guilty of actual malice if the defendant has knowledge of facts, or intentionally disregards facts, that create a high probability of injury to the plaintiff under two separate circumstances. Section 27-1-221(2), MCA. These circumstances include when a defendant who possesses actual knowledge, or intentionally disregards facts relating to it, \u201cdeliberately proceeds to act in conscious or intentional disregard of the high probability of injury to the plaintiff,\u201d or \u201cdeliberately proceeds to act with indifference to the high probability of injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff need not show any proof of reliance to prevail on a claim for actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b614 Section 27-1-221(4), MCA, by contrast, provides that \u201c[a]ctual fraud exists only when the plaintiff has a <em>right to rely </em>upon the representation of the defendant and suffers injury as a result of that reliance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The question of whether a party has a right to rely upon another\u2019s representation could create specific questions of proof best resolved in individual trials. The Class premises its actual malice claims, however, on MPC\u2019s conduct. The Class alleges that MPC consciously and intentionally disregarded the high probability of worker injury \u201cby withholding information, failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>investigate, failing to inquire about maximum medical improvement and/or impairment ratings, and other benefits.\u201d MPC\u2019s behavior, and, in particular, MPC\u2019s system and method of handling workers\u2019 compensation claims-and not the potentially fact-specific issues of reasonable reliance by members of the class-constitutes the main focus of the Class\u2019s actual malice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b615  MPC also contends that class treatment for punitive damages \u201ccould offend the due process contemplated by this Court and the United States Supreme Court.\u201d MPC suggests that members of the class in this case might be situated differently to such a degree that no nexus would exist between each individual class member\u2019s actual harm and the punitive damages awarded. MPC\u2019s manner and practice of handling workers\u2019 compensation claims will constitute the predominant focus of the Class\u2019s claims for punitive damages. The District Court retains numerous tools to keep any punitive damage award within acceptable bounds so as not to offend the principles of due process. <em>See e.g. Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6\u00b6 148-152, 165, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it certified the Class\u2019s claims for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"A12\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court appropriately defined the class.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b617 The District Court defined the class as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">MPC employees with compensable worker compensation claims, with permanent impairment ratings under an edition of the American Medical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Imnairment. injured between January 1, 1970, and March 28, 1998, and not paid an impairment award until after December 10, 1997, and that such outlined above employee falls within one or more of the following categories:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">a) sustaining damage because of MPC\u2019s improper claims handling and adjusting procedures; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">b) sustaining damages because of [Northwestern Energy\u2019s] improper claims handling and adjusting procedures; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">c) sustaining damages because of [reorganized debtor Northwestern Corporation\u2019s] improper claims handling and adjusting procedures; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">d) sustaining damages because of Putman\u2019s [sic] improper claims handling and adjusting procedures that were the obligation of Putman [sic] as third-party administrator ... and as an independent reviewer for MPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">\u00b618 MPC argues that the District Court\u2019s class definition improperly \u201cpredetermines that each class member has sustained damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u2018because of MPC\u2019s improper claims handling.\u2019 \u201d MPC terms this class definition a \u201cfail-safe,\u201d and maintains that a decision on the merits of each class member\u2019s claims determines class membership. MPC asserts that the \u201ceffect of such a definition is that any putative class member who fails to establish-in this proceeding-improper claims handling on the part of MPC is thereby excluded from the class and thus not subject to the binding or <em>res judicata </em>effect of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b619 The facts of this case belie MPC\u2019s concerns regarding the definition of the class. MPC focuses on subparagraph (a) of the District Court\u2019s class definition and ignores the first full paragraph. An employee must satisfy a number of requirements in order to be eligible as a class member. The employee must be a former MPC employee with a compensable workers\u2019 compensation claim. The compensable claim must have led to a permanent impairment rating. The employee must have been injured between January 1,1970, and March 28,1998. The injured employee must not have been paid an impairment award until after December 10,1997. An employee must satisfy each of these five elements to be entitled to damages for improper workers\u2019 compensation claim treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b620  Any determination made by the court under subsection (a) through (d) of the class definition would be for purposes of apportioning liability among MPC and its successors in interest, including Northwestern Corporation (as a reorganized debtor), Northwestern Energy, and Putnam and Associates. The District Court did not create a \u201cfail safe\u201d when it established the boundaries of the class. The District Court appropriately defined the class and retains discretion to adjust or modify the class as appropriate as the case progresses. For example, M. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) provides that a court shall determine whether to allow a proposed class action to proceed \u201cas soon as practicable after the commencement\u201d of an action. The court\u2019s order in this regard may be conditional, and, more importantly, \u201cmay be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
