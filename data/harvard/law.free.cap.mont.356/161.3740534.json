We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b63 <em>Did Becker\u2019s appellate counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to argue on direct appeal that Becker\u2019s constitutional trial right was violated by his absence from a critical stage of the trial ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\u00b64 In December of 2001, Becker was tried on the charges of accountability for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, criminal possession of dangerous drugs, and criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs. During trial, the District Court held a conference to settle the jury instructions. The prosecutor, Becker, and Becker\u2019s counsel were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">\u00b65 During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge, stating, \u201cWe, the jury, would like a definition for the term, \u2018possession\u2019 with respect to possession of precursors to dangerous drugs.\u201d In response to the note, the District Court met with the prosecutor and Becker\u2019s counsel. Becker was confined in jail and was not brought to the meeting. The District Court determined not to \u201cinstruct the jury any differently than how they had previously been instructed and referred them back to the original jury instruction\u201d defining possession. The court sent a written message to this effect, and did not meet with the jury. Becker was found guilty of all three crimes and was given a twenty-five-year sentence by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">\u00b66 Becker appealed to this Court, claiming his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to argue that his sentence violated Montana\u2019s double jeopardy statute. Becker did not argue that he was denied his constitutional right to be present during the meeting held in response to the jury question. We reversed Becker\u2019s conviction for criminal possession of dangerous drugs, concluding it violated Montana\u2019s double jeopardy statute, and remanded for resentencing for his convictions on the other two offenses. <em>State v. Becker, </em>2005 MT 75, \u00b6 25, 326 Mont. 364, 110 P.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">\u00b67 Becker then filed a self-represented petition for postconviction relief, raising six claims. The District Court appointed counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Becker, and he filed an amended petition raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim regarding his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the right to trial issue. Becker supported his petition with an affidavit by his appellate counsel acknowledging her failure to raise the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">I am aware of Supreme Court authority that requires appellate counsel to raise the issue of whether [Becker\u2019s] absence from court proceedings amounts to structural error necessitating anew trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">I did not discuss this issue with Mr. Becker when representing him on appeal before the Montana Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">I had no tactical reason for failing to raise this issue on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFD\">At the postconviction hearing, the District Court acknowledged that Becker was not present at the meeting held in response to the jury question but denied the petition on the ground that Becker had not demonstrated that he had sustained any prejudice by his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue. Becker appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. We review claims for ineffective assistance of counsel, which present mixed questions of fact and law, de novo. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 9. We exercise plenary review of constitutional questions, including alleged violations of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at critical stages of the trial. <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 27, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u00b69 <em>Did Becker\u2019s appellate counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to argue on direct appeal that Becker\u2019s constitutional trial right was violated by his absence from a critical stage of the trial ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">\u00b610 Becker acknowledges he waived the trial right issue in his direct appeal but argues that the waiver constituted ineffective assistance by his appellate counsel. Becker argues the District Court erred by denying his postconviction petition and asks this Court to reach the merits of his trial claim and reverse his convictions on the two remaining charges. The State argues that Becker failed to establish prejudice under the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">\u00b611 Criminal defendants possess a constitutional right to \u201ceffective\u201d assistance of counsel, which can be violated if defense counsel fails \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>render \u2018adequate legal assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2063-64 (1984) (quoting <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 1449 n. 14 (1970); <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 344, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 1716 (1980)). In determining whether counsel provided effective assistance, the <em>Strickland </em>Court adopted a two-prong analysis, which we follow. <em>See e.g. State v. Godfrey, </em>2009 MT 60, \u00b6 14, 349 Mont. 335, 203 P.3d 834; <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753; <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. Under the first prong, deficient performance is established when \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance fell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases ....\u201d <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>see also Whitlow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 17. Under the second prong, the defendant must demonstrate prejudice-\u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068; <em>see also Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 14. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. The <em>Strickland </em>prongs are conjunctive, and both prongs must be satisfied. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069. Therefore, \u201cthere is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.... If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; <em>see also Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11. Here, we have determined to resolve the case under the prejudice prong, and turn to the substantive issue raised by Becker\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, the right to be present at all critical stages of his trial, and the governing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b612 The United States Constitution protects a defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6 16, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244 (citing <em>Ill. v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 1058 (1970); <em>U.S. v. Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. 522, 526, 105 S. Ct. 1482, 1484 (1985) (per curiam)). The Montana Constitution provides similarly: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. The defendant\u2019s right to attend his trial not only \u201csafeguard[s] the public\u2019s interest in a fair and orderly judicial system,\u201d but it also allows a defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>personally \u201chear and see the proceedings and [to] participate in the presentation and preservation of his rights.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b613 When analyzing a defendant\u2019s right to be present, we first determine whether the proceeding at issue was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the trial. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 25. A critical stage is any part of the proceeding where there is \u201cpotential for substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 17, 288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670). If the defendant was not present during a critical stage, we then determine whether the violation was harmless. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 25. The State must show the error was trial error, as opposed to structural error, and that there was \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d that the violation prejudiced the defendant. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"AOh\">\u00b614  Even assuming the meeting conducted in response to the jury question constituted a critical stage, we conclude that the prejudice necessary to sustain Becker\u2019s ineffectiveness claim has not been demonstrated. Becker\u2019s absence from the meeting would likely have been deemed trial error, as it did not consist of an error which \u201crendered the trial fundamentally unfair,\u201d such as a \u201cbiased judge\u201d or a \u201cjury-selection error.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>see Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 32 (trial judge\u2019s response to jury questions in defendant\u2019s absence deemed to be trial error). The question would then become whether the error was harmless. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 44; <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 33. Becker was present with his counsel during settlement of the jury instructions. Though he was absent from the meeting held in response to the jury\u2019s question about the definition of \u201cpossession,\u201d the District Court merely referred the jury back to the instructions which had been previously given and settled in Becker\u2019s presence. We are not persuaded that there is a reasonable probability, had Becker\u2019s appellate counsel raised this issue on direct appeal, that the outcome of the appeal would have been any different, and thus, prejudice has not been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b615 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Becker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b185-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"A48\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b616 I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion. However, I would not reach the second prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984), <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 11, because Becker has failed to meet his burden under the first, most elemental prong. Specifically, Becker has failed to show that his appellate counsel\u2019s performance did not pass constitutional muster. He did not offer any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>evidence in the postconviction proceedings of prevailing professional norms as applied to his counsel\u2019s performance, nor did he demonstrate how his counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under those norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances. <em>See Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 32-33, 36-40, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Appellate counsel\u2019s gratuitously falling on his sword is self-serving and is insufficient to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b617 I specially concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
