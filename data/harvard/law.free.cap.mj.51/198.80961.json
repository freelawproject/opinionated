The adjudged and approved sentence provides for a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 12 years, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals set aside the findings and sentence on the ground that appellant did not receive effective representation. The Judge Advocate General of the Army certified the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">WHETHER THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL ON THE BASIS OF TRIAL DEFENSE COUNSELS\u2019 FAILURE TO LEARN OF WITNESSES WHO MIGHT HAVE IMPEACHED THE PROSECUTRIX\u2019S VERACITY, WHERE THERE WAS OVERWHELMING AND UNREBUTTED INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE THAT APPELLANT, A MARRIED MAN, AND THE 15-YEARr-OLD PROSECUTRIX WHO WAS NOT HIS SPOUSE, UNDRESSED IN HIS VEHICLE DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS AND ENGAGED IN SEXUAL RELATIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">WHETHER, ASSUMING THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS CORRECTLY DECIDED THAT DEFENSE COUNSEL WERE INEFFECTIVE IN NOT LEARNING OF WITNESSES WHO MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONED THE TRUTH OF THE PROSECUTRIX\u2019S ALLEGATIONS AND VERACITY, THAT COURT NONETHELESS ERRED BY SETTING ASIDE ALL FINDINGS OF GUILTY, WHERE THE ALLEGED INEFFECTIVENESS COULD HAVE ONLY CAUSED A REASONABLE DOUBT AS TO SOME ELEMENTS, BUT COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED A REASONABLE DOUBT AS TO THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSES OF CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, INDECENT ACTS (OR LIBERTIES) WITH A CHILD, AND INDECENT ACTS WITH ANOTHER, AND TO THE INDEPENDENT OFFENSE OF ADULTERY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">For the reasons set out below, we answer both certified questions in the negative, and we affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">The Court of Criminal Appeals summarized the evidence on the merits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-15\">The government\u2019s proof of rape rested primarily on the testimony, and thus the credibility, of the fifteen-year-old victim, L. She stated that she initially noticed appellant because of the music coming from his sport utility vehicle, thought he was nice, and readily accepted his offer of a ride home. Her statements concerning lack of consent and force, while meeting the requirements of legal and factual sufficiency, were far from being overwhelming proof on both issues. Fiber and DNA evidence circumstantially corroborated sexual activity, including an ejaculation, in appellant\u2019s vehicle. However, in the absence of direct evidence of penetration, this scientific evidence provided, at best, only tenuous corroboration of that aspect of her allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-16\">Appellant did not take the stand and presented his defense solely through cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses. The defense theory of the case asserted that there was insufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that sexual intercourse occurred, but that if it did occur, it was not through force, but with the consent of L. The emphasis of the defense presentation by cross-examination sought to discredit or reframe the laboratory evidence. The cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tion of L focused on resistance and consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Unpub. op. at 2-3 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">After the trial, appellee\u2019s wife obtained a copy of the final Criminal Investigation Command (CID) report, which contained summaries of witness interviews that raised questions about L\u2019s credibility. The detailed defense counsel, Captain (CPT) Boyd, then accused trial counsel of failing to disclose material favorable to the defense. The convening authority ordered a post-trial Article 39(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> session to consider the accusation of nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The evidence at issue was a series of interviews with teachers and classmates of the alleged victim that were summarized in the final CID report. They were captioned, \u201cSignificant Interviews.\u201d The interviews reflect the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">(1) L was expelled from school for 1 year, and a teacher suggested that the rape allegation was her way of distracting attention from her misbehavior;</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">(2) L told some classmates that she was a virgin before the encounter with appellee, and she told others an \u201coff the wall\u201d story about being raped in the United States and becoming pregnant;</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">(3) L told conflicting versions of the alleged rape by appellee; and</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">(4) L had a poor reputation for truthfulness among some of her classmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">At the Article 39(a) session, civilian defense counsel, Mr. Cohen, asserted \u201cas an officer of the court\u201d that neither he nor detailed defense counsel had seen the final CID report. Mr. Cohen asserted that, if he had known about the material in the final CID report, he could have cross-examined L and destroyed the image of a \u201cyoung schoolgirl who was embarrassed about what happened.\u201d On examination by the military judge, Mr. Cohen conceded that, if he had received the final report but failed to read it and attempt to interview the witnesses listed, he was \u201cnot merely negligent, but [he] failed to discharge [his] responsibilities as a defense counsel in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Captain (CPT) Flowers was the trial counsel for the case. When the Article 32<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> investigation convened, CPT Flowers was pending deployment to the Balkans, and CPT Vandeveld was detailed to replace him in the event that the ease was referred to a court-martial. CPT Flowers testified that, on the day of the Article 32 hearing, he gave CPT Vandeveld the final CID report, who copied it and returned it to him, and then CPT Flowers personally gave it to Mr. Cohen.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">During the Article 32 hearing, Mr. Cohen referred to a laboratory report that was contained in the final CID report, but was not included in the initial or interim reports. CPT Flowers testified that the defense made no written discovery requests before the Article 32 investigation. A tape recording of the Article 32 hearing was played at the Article 39(a) session, in which Mr. Cohen referred to a serology report contained in the final CID report.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">The laboratory report was in two parts, a trace evidence report and a serology report. The trace evidence report concluded that fibers found on two pairs of L\u2019s panties were microscopically consistent with the fabric in appellee\u2019s vehicle. The serology report concluded that there was semen on appellee\u2019s underwear and on a blue towel found in appellee\u2019s vehicle. The semen matched appellee\u2019s DNA profile. There was no semen found in vaginal and cervical swabs taken from L, on L\u2019s clothing, or in a condom found in appellee\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">CPT Boyd testified that the laboratory report was in his ease file at the time of the Article 32 investigation. He testified that he became \u201cphysically ill\u201d when he read the summarized witness statements pertaining to L\u2019s credibility. CPT Boyd also testified that CPT Flowers had an open discovery policy, and that \u201cyou could walk in anytime and ask him and he\u2019d give you anything he had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">Mr. Cohen testified that, when he read the final report, he was shocked. He thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that appellee had been unjustly convicted because Mr. Cohen \u201chad failed to properly either investigate or to get materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The military judge made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">1. The final CID report, dated 21 September 1995, was received by trial counsel in early October 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">2. Detailed defense counsel, CPT Boyd, had complete access to the entire government case file at all times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">3. Before the Article 32 Investigation, on 13 November 1995, CPT Boyd may not yet have been provided a copy of the final CID report, but it had been available for defense to review and photocopy for about a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">4. At the Article 32 Investigation, CPT Flowers directed that a complete copy of the case file, including the final CID report be photocopied for Mr. Cohen. CPT Vandeveld copied the case file and returned it to CPT Flowers who personally handed the complete case file to Mr. Cohen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">5. The final CID report looks very much like the interim CID report, and much of the final report is identical to the interim report. The several new paragraphs, at issue here, were sandwiched between such identical entries. When CPT Boyd read the final report after trial she testified that at first she thought it was the report she had already read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">6. The final CID report referenced, and has as attachments, photographs and certain lab reports that were not previously available or disclosed, including a trace evidence/serology report dated 29 August 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">7. CPT Flowers\u2019 testimony, that he gave to Mr. Cohen a complete copy of the case file, to include the final CID report, is corroborated by the audio recording of the Article 32 in which he is heard to say to Mr. Cohen, \u201cI think I\u2019ve given y\u2019all every scrap of paper on this case ...,\u201d and then confirmed that defense had received the lab reports dated 29 August.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">8. Both before and after the Article 32 Investigation, CPT Flowers made available to the defense everything in the government\u2019s case file, including witness statements, witness lists, CID reports, lab reports, photos, and physical evidence. CPT Flowers had this \u201copen discovery\u201d procedure, in this and every other case, and the defense was aware of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">9. There was no evidence presented as to where SSG Gibson, wife of the accused, acquired the copy of the final CID report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-17\">10. The defense received complete discovery of all documents in the government\u2019s possession, including the final CID report, but apparently did not recognize a few paragraphs in that final CID report that were added to the interim report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">Based on the evidence adduced at the post-trial Article 39(a) session, the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that appellee had not received effective representation within the meaning of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). On the question of prejudice, the court below held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-19\">[Tjhis was legally and factually a close ease. The government\u2019s proof relied heavily on the testimony, and therefore the credibility, of the victim, L. Thus, the testing of the government\u2019s proof by counsel in the form of a thorough, focused cross-examination of L, was pivotal to the effective defense of [appellee]. Overlooking, or failing to pursue, the statements of nine potential adult and juvenile witnesses questioning the truth of L\u2019s allegations, as well as her general veracity, cannot be viewed as harmless, non-prejudicial error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-20\">Unpub. op. at 7. The court then set aside the findings and sentence and authorized a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-21\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">Before this Court, the Government argues that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s failure to notice the slight differences in the Final CID Report during the Article 32 investigation did not depart from prevailing norms to such an extent that the adversarial process failed.\u201d Final Brief at 20. Government appellate counsel point out that the list of witnesses was contained within a pile of \u201capproximately sixty papers, about two inches thick.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>5. They argue that the deficiencies in the defense performance were not prejudicial because \u201cthe government\u2019s case ... was virtually incontrovertible [sic].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Finally, the Government argues that the evidence of penetration needed to prove carnal knowledge was \u201cirrefutable,\u201d and that, at the very least, the court below should have affirmed a lesser-ineluded offense of carnal knowledge or indecent acts, as well as the conviction of adultery. <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Appellee asserts that the failure of trial defense counsel to investigate the evidence summarized in the CID report left the alleged victim\u2019s testimony unchallenged and, thus, made the outcome of the court-martial unreliable. Answer to Final Brief at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">This Court has adopted the two-pronged test of <em>Strickland </em>to determine if an accused has received the \u201ceffective assistance of counsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>24 MJ 186, 188 (CMA 1987). Counsel are presumed competent. <em>Id. </em>To prevail on a claim of ineffective representation, an accused must show (1) deficient performance and (2) prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Regarding the first prong, the Supreme Court has held that \u201ccounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, quoted in <em>United States v. Loving, </em>41 MJ 213, 242 (1994); <em>see also United States v. Polk, </em>32 MJ 150, 153 (CMA 1991). Both military and civilian counsel conceded during the post-trial hearing that their failure to investigate would satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>if they received the final CID report. The military judge found that they received the report, and the record supports his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We agree with military and civilian defense counsel\u2019s concession of deficient performance. Their failure to investigate information strongly suggesting that L was not a credible witness was deficient within the meaning of the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Their failure to investigate was not a tactical decision; it was a serious oversight caused by their failure to carefully read the final CID report.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">With respect to the second prong, we agree with the court below that defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the evidence in the CID report deprived appellee of \u201ca fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d Unpub. op. at 7, quoting <em>Scott, </em>24 MJ at 188, and <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The prosecution\u2019s case rested on L\u2019s credibility. The evidence summarized in the CID report suggested that she had serious disciplinary problems in school; that she may have alleged rape to distract school officials from her behavior; that she had a record of exaggerating her sexual experience; that she related conflicting versions of the alleged rape; and that she did not enjoy a good reputation for truthfulness. This evidence was relevant not only to the greater offense of rape, but also to the lesser-ineluded offense of carnal knowledge and the related offense of adultery, because her testimony was the only direct evidence of vaginal penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">We reject the Government\u2019s fallback argument that the court below erred by not affirming a conviction of indecent acts. Under Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 866(c)(1994), a Court of Criminal Appeals \u201cmay affirm only such findings of guilty ... as it finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved.\u201d Commenting on this broad grant of appellate authority, our Court has said, \u201cA clearer <em>carte blanche </em>to do justice would be difficult to express.\u201d <em>United States v. Claxton, </em>32 MJ 159, 162 (1991). Our Court explained: \u201cIf the Court of Military Review [now the Court of Criminal Appeals], in the interest of justice, determines that a certain finding or sentence should not be approved \u2014 by reason of the receipt of improper testimony or otherwise \u2014 the court need not approve such finding or sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>United States v. Cauley, </em>45 MJ 353, 356 (1996), we declined to disturb a determination regarding factual sufficiency at the trial and at the court below, stating that \u201cfactual sufficiency is a question for the fact-finder at [the] court-martial and the Court of Criminal Appeals, not this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>We hold that the court below did not abuse the discretion given to it by Article 66(c). Proof of indecent acts depended almost entirely on L\u2019s testimony. The fiber evidence was of marginal value. There was no evidence that the fiber from the seat cover was unique or rare. Traces of the same or similar fiber were also found on a second pair of L\u2019s panties that she was not wearing at the time of the alleged offenses. The semen on the towel shows only that appellant ejaculated at some time and place, but tells us nothing about the circumstances. The scientific evidence had corroborative value when combined with L\u2019s testimony. Standing alone, however, it proves little. In light of the broad appellate authority conferred on the court below by Article 66(c), and the importance of L\u2019s testimony in proving any lesser-included offenses, the decision of the court below to not affirm a lesser-included offense was within its statutory authority. The certified questions are answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals setting aside the findings and sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\">.
