Fleming, </em>USMC (on brief).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b546-25\">Chief Judge COX</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-26\">Appellant was convicted at a special court-martial of two specifications of wrongfully using marijuana and one specification of distributing marijuana, in violation of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 912a. The court-martial, comprised of officer members, sentenced appellant to confinement for 3 months, forfeiture of $583.00 pay per month for 3 months, reduction to E-l, and a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-27\">We granted review of one issue in which appellant asks us to hold that his arraignment was a \u201csham\u201d arraignment, used only to stop the speedy-trial clock in his case, and thus was insufficient because he was not brought to actual trial until 7 days later. <em>See </em>51 MJ 131 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-28\">Appellant was arraigned on December 4, 1996, which was day 119 on the speedy-trial clock. Appellant was tried on the charges pending before this court-martial on December 11, 1996, 7 days after his arraignment. There was no pretrial confinement in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-29\">Immediately following appellant\u2019s arraignment, the defense raised an oral motion, later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>followed by a written motion to dismiss, alleging that the Government was essentially conducting a \u201csham\u201d arraignment that violated appellant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. The military judge denied the motion holding that the military speedy-trial rule was \u201creasonabl[e],\u201d and that it was \u201ccomplied with in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The conclusion whether an accused received a speedy trial is a legal question that is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Thompson, </em>46 MJ 472, 475 (1997). The military judge\u2019s findings of fact are given \u201csubstantial deference and will be reversed only for clear error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Edmond, </em>41 MJ 419, 420 (1995), quoting <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>487 U.S. 326, 337, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 2419-20, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988). Although we are not required to defer to the military judge\u2019s or the lower court\u2019s legal conclusions, after due consideration we have no occasion to disagree with their analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The military judge ruled that arraignment of appellant was proper within the plain language of the rule itself, RCM 707, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 edition), and also through interpretation of the rule in light of the cases leading to its enactment. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. Edington, </em>26 MJ 95 (CMA 1988); <em>United States v. Carlisle, </em>25 MJ 426 (CMA 1988). He went on further to state that the President\u2019s decision to clarify the speedy-trial rules in a way that allows for a lapse between arraignment and trial was not constitutionally barred, as long as the accused is not restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The Court of Criminal Appeals further noted that the pretrial processing of appellant\u2019s case appears \u201cdiligent,\u201d and that most of the delay occurred at the Article 32, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 832, stage of the proceedings. That court, 1998 WL 275951 could \u201cfind no evidence of intentional or negligent actions\u201d that would cause it to avoid applying the plain language of RCM 707. Unpub. op. at 2-3 (May 27, 1998). We agree. RCM 707 clearly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">(a) <em>In general. </em>The accused shall be brought to trial within 120 days after the earlier of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">(1) Preferral of charges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">$ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-14\">(2) The imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2) \u2014 (4); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-15\">(3) Entry on active duty under R.C.M. 204.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-16\">(b) <em>Accountability.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-17\">(1) <em>In general. ... </em>The accused is brought to trial within the meaning of this rule at the time of arraignment under R.C.M. 904.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">The Government thus has 120 days from the date of preferral to bring an accused to trial. In order for an accused to be brought to trial, he must be \u201ccalled upon to plead,\u201d the process commonly known as arraignment. RCM 904, Discussion; <em>see also United States v. Stokes, </em>39 MJ 771 (ACMR 1994), <em>pet. denied, </em>41 MJ 100 (CMA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-19\">All of these events occurred in this case within the statutorily imposed period of time, 120 days. Thus, the arraignment on day 119 occurred in the \u201cnick of time\u201d to stop the speedy-trial clock. Appellant\u2019s arraignment was properly conducted and was not a \u201csham.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We are not at liberty, and do not desire, to unilaterally modify clearly written Presidential rules that do not conflict with the Congressionally passed Code or the Constitution. <em>Cf. United States v. Davis, </em>47 MJ 484, 486 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-20\">Additionally, there is no reason to question appellant\u2019s arraignment based on the fact that the Government was unprepared to present its case on the merits immediately following arraignment. In fact, arraignment serves to protect an accused\u2019s rights. After arraignment, the power of the military judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>to process the case increases, and the power of the convening authority to affect the ease decreases. <em>See </em>RCM 601(e)(2)(no referral of additional charges without accused\u2019s consent); RCM 603(d)(no major changes to charges without accused\u2019s consent); RCM 604(b) (power to withdraw charges limited); RCM 804(b)(1) (trial in absentia permitted). Moreover, after being arraigned, appellant is still free to make a motion to the military judge demanding speedy trial. <em>See </em>RCM 707(c)(2); RCM 905(b). Thus, appellant\u2019s argument here is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The primary definition of \"sham\u201d in the dictionary is \"a trick that deludes.\" <em>Webster\u2019s Tenth Collegiate Dictionary </em>1076 (1998). While theoretically such a \u201ctrick\u201d could be possibly staged at an arraignment, such as the case where the Government never intends to go forward on charges, this case would be extreme. Moreover, such an instance would violate the ethical rules governing lawyer conduct. <em>See </em>Rule 3.3, ABA <em>Model Rules of Professional Conduct </em>(1998)(can-dor toward the tribunal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b548-5\">CRAWFORD, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AYb\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Military accused enjoy the right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and by statute \u2014 Article 10, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 810. They also enjoy a right to a speedy trial as set forth in RCM 707, which is simple for the bench and bar to follow: When arraignment falls within the 120-day period provided by RCM 707, there is no speedy-trial violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">As the majority states, \u201cWe are not at liberty, and do not desire, to unilaterally modify clearly written Presidential rules that do not conflict with the Congressionally passed Code or the Constitution.\u201d 51 MJ at 465. However, this language points out the opinion\u2019s self-contradictory nature which suggests the Court\u2019s willingness to craft exceptions to this \u201cclearly written\u201d rule on a case-by-case basis. While the Government was not ready to proceed in the ease at the time of arraignment, as the court below indicated, the Government was diligent in processing the case, unpub. op. at 2, and that court found \u201cno evidence of intentional or negligent actions by the Government which compel us to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. I disassociate myself from the dicta in this case setting forth new language which contradicts RCM 707 as presently drafted. My view does not preclude the President from drafting a \u201csham\u201d rule. However, at this date, he has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">As to the hypothetical set forth by the majority, that is, arraignment when the Government never intends to go forward on the charges, military defendants would be protected from such an action by the sources of rights set forth above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
