He was notified that a soldier had discharged a weapon in a barracks room, and he went to the scene to investigate. While he was investigating, he overheard \u201can MP\u201d say that a bomb or exp\u00edo - sive device had been found in a different module of the barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">SA Conner went to the other module, where he found a health and welfare inspection in progress. In a common area of the barracks, he saw \u201csome electrical cables, some books, an improvised explosive device, pyrotechnics in a can, Gatorade bottle containing what they thought was fertilizer.\u201d Captain (CPT) Abbott, the company commander, told SA Conner that the items belonged to appellant. SA Conner asked appellant for some personal data and asked him \u201cif the stuff was dangerous, what is it, how long he had it.\u201d SA Conner testified that appellant asked \u201cwhat his rights were,\u201d and he told appellant \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have to talk to\u201d him. According to SA Conner, \u201c[w]e then mutually ceased the interview.\u201d SA Conner testified that appellant did not \u201crequest an attorney\u201d or \u201cmention a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Gaddy was present during the health and welfare inspection. He heard SA Conner questioning appellant. When the CID agent stopped questioning appellant \u201cfor a few minutes,\u201d appellant asked SSGT Gaddy if he \u201cthought he needed an attorney present or should he answer the questions.\u201d SSGT Gaddy told appellant that \u201cit was up to him, that [he] wasn\u2019t going to tell him what to do at the time.\u201d He testified that appellant \u201cwent back over\u201d; the CID agent \u201casked him a couple of more questions,\u201d appellant \u201casked to have a lawyer present, or to talk to a lawyer,\u201d and the CID agent stopped the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">CPT Abbott testified that appellant was not advised of his rights in the barracks, but that he inquired about his rights. He did not remember appellant asking for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">Appellant did not testify concerning his conversation with SA Connor in the barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">Appellant was transported from the barracks to the CID office, where he was placed in an interview room. This room was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>scribed as being about 8 feet by 10 feet with a one-way mirror on one wall. SA Sinclair testified that he questioned appellant to obtain essential identifying data. SA Sinclair did not warn appellant of his rights at that time. At some point Sinclair learned that appellant was from Texas, and used the fact that he was also from Texas to establish some rapport with appellant. After SA Sinclair obtained some identifying information from appellant, they conversed about Texas and appellant\u2019s plans for the future. Also, during that conversation, SA Sinclair asked appellant about the Free Men and what appellant thought about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. SA Sinclair estimated that this process took about 15-20 minutes. Appellant testified that he believed this interview lasted about one hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">SA Conner then entered the room and advised appellant of his rights. SA Conner testified that this second interview with appellant was about 45 minutes after the conversation at the company barracks. There is no evidence that SA Conner advised appellant that the information he had provided earlier could not be used against him, and trial counsel conceded that no such \u201ccleansing statement\u201d was made. Appellant waived his rights and made an inculpatory statement. Appellant told SA Conner how he learned to make the devices, how he ordered parts, when he made the item in question, and the length of time the item was in his locker.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">During the interrogation, appellant said that he had kept the items in his locker for a considerable time. Another agent had found several receipts in appellant\u2019s room and SA Connor believed that they showed that appellant had purchased several of the items within the preceding month or so. SA Conner accused appellant of lying about the date of purchase. This led appellant to mention an attorney. SA Conner testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">Q. [TC]: At any time during the questioning, did you stop the questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">A. [SA Conner]: In what respect, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Q. Did you stop questioning him for any reason during the questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">A. There was one period where we had ceased questioning [sic] of the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqx\">Q. Why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">A. After the other agent came back from searching [appellant\u2019s] room, he had found some receipts from Radio Shack in Hines-ville, and on the receipts it appeared that the items were purchased in March of this year. So, I questioned [appellant] about, you know, \u201cI thought you\u2019d been honest with me here so far,\u201d and he said \u201cYeah.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve had this stuff here for a long time,\u201d you know. \u201cHere, we find receipts that you were out there shopping last month,\u201d you know. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?\u201d So, we questioned that. It was later determined that, upon viewing the original receipt, the receipt was dated 1995, not 1996. The photocopy had made the \u201c5\u201d appear to be a \u201c6.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">Q. So, you thought he was lying to you? A. Yes, sir. And it was during the course of that conversation pertaining to the receipts that Specialist Ford had said something like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore. Maybe I should get a lawyer\u201d or something. So I stopped asking the incriminating questions and then I looked at him, and after I looked at him, I said, \u201cWell, what are we going to do? Are we going to continue the interview or do you want to stop and get a lawyer?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, are you going to continue accusing me of lying?\u201d, and I said, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re talking about the receipts, we have clarified this issue, that it was 1995 and not 1996, as I originally thought,\u201d and \u201cNo, I do not still think you\u2019re lying about that receipt.\u201d He said, Well then, I guess I\u2019ll go ahead and continue to speak with you about this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">Q. And did he do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">A. Yes, sir, he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Appellant\u2019s recollection of that portion of the interview was somewhat different:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-16\">Q. [DC] When Agent Conner was asking you questions, did he ask you questions of the same nature that he was asking you up in the barracks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-17\">A. [Appellant] I believe so. Some of them were. I don\u2019t remember exactly how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>all things went on it, but a lot of the questions were the same throughout.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">Q. And then it switched to questions about the Radio Shack and where you bought wires?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">A. Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">Q. Had he asked you that beforehand, in the barracks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">A. I really don\u2019t remember. I remember him asking me about where I came from and ... I really don\u2019t remember those questions being asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">Q. When he started asking you about the Radio Shack stuff, what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">A. He came in and started accusing me of lying, after the other CID agent had brought the receipts to him. He started saying that I was lying, that I had just bought the stuff, you know, and so I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m tired of playing your games. I want a lawyer.\u201d I\u2019m sure I said it several times, because he kept, you know, saying stuff, and I said, \u2018Well, I want a lawyer.\u201d And then he \u2014 I don\u2019t know, something went on and I said, \u201cLet me see the receipts,\u201d and that\u2019s when he showed me copies of the receipts. I said, \u201cI want to see the originals,\u201d and that\u2019s when he pulled out the originals and showed me the originals that had the actual dates on it that you could read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">Q. What did they say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">A. They said March of \u201995 instead of March of \u201996. He was trying to say that I\u2019d bought the stuff in March of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">Q. And then after you \u2014 when you requested a lawyer, did you say maybe you should or did you tell him that you definitely wanted one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">A. No, I said, \u201cI want a lawyer,\u201d and I said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of playing games. I want a lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-15\">Q. And then he looked at the Radio Shack receipt and it proved you right. Who made the next step?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-16\">A. He asked me if I still wanted a lawyer, and that\u2019s when I said, uh \u2014 and he said something about he didn\u2019t like being lied to, and I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like being called a liar. I\u2019ve been trying to answer your questions as honestly as I can.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you still want a lawyer?\u201d and I said, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re not going to call me a liar any more, you know, and do what you\u2019ve been doing, then I will answer your questions, but ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-20\">Q. So when you first asked for a lawyer, he didn\u2019t give you an opportunity to call one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-21\">A. Exactly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-22\">On cross-examination, trial counsel asked appellant if he was \u201cwilling to go ahead and answer questions\u201d after the issue about the date on the receipts was resolved. Appellant responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-23\">That\u2019s correct, because he said there was going to be no more problems out of it and I said okay. Like I told him earlier, that I \u2014 he said that he didn\u2019t like being lied to and I said that I didn\u2019t like being called a liar, because I had answered his questions honestly. I said, \u201cAre you going to be calling me a liar anymore on the stuff that I\u2019m talking about here?\u201d and he said, \u201cNo,\u201d and I said, \u2018Well, I guess I don\u2019t need a lawyer then.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">Trial counsel asked, \u201cSo, you were willing at that point to just keep answering questions, right?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-25\">At trial, the defense moved to suppress appellant\u2019s oral statements made in the barracks and the written statement executed at the CID office. The military judge suppressed the oral statement made in the barracks, but denied the defense motion to suppress the written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-26\">The military judge suppressed the barracks statement by virtue of its unwarned character, but he determined that the request for counsel was not made in the barracks, but rather, that appellant only asked, \u201cWhat are my rights?\u201d The military judge also found that appellant did not invoke his right to counsel at the CID office, but instead he made an ambiguous reference to counsel. He also ruled that the first inadmissible statement made in the barracks did not taint the second statement given to the CID.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-27\">To support his ruling, the military judge made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>I find that the accused did not make an unequivocal request for an attorney. Second, that the accused did reopen dialogue with the agents. He did express a willingness and a desire for further discussion about the subject of the interrogation. Specifically, I find that the accused made a statement to the effect, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to play games, I want an attorney\u201d or \u201cIf you call me a liar, I want an attorney,\u201d or words to that effect; both of those, in my view, are not unequivocal, because they are proceeded by that conditional \u201cif.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">I find, further, that the accused reinitiated conversation with the Criminal Investigation Division [sic], stating something to the effect \u2014 and I reviewed the testimony of Special Agent Michael Connor and Specialist Ford \u2014 that, \u201cAs long as you are not calling me a liar anymore, then I don\u2019t need an attorney,\u201d or something to the effect, \u201cAre you going to be calling me a liar anymore?\u201d Response, \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cThen I guess I don\u2019t need a lawyer.\u201d Also, a statement to the effect, \u201cAre you going to accuse me of lying anymore?\u201d; response, \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cThen I don\u2019t need a lawyer,\u201d or \u201cIf you are not going to call me a liar, then I will answer your questions.\u201d In my view, those responses characterize what took place and, thereby, the accused did reinitiate conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">I find that the accused was willing and did desire further discussion about the subject, and he did voluntarily proceed without an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Appellant asserts that the Government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his written confession was voluntary. He argues that the military judge\u2019s findings that he did not invoke his right to counsel in the barracks and later at the CID office were clearly erroneous. The Government asserts that appellant did not make an unequivocal request for an attorney at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">If, as in this case, the defense objects to admissibility of a confession, \u201cthe prosecution has the burden of establishing ... admissibility.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 304(e), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 edition).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before a confession may be admitted, \u201c[t]he military judge must find by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that the confession was voluntary. Mil.R.Evid. 304(e)(1). A confession \u201cthat is challenged ... as derivative evidence may be admitted ... if the military judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the [derivative confession] was made voluntarily, that the [confession] was not obtained by use of the [inadmissible evidence,] or that the confession would have been obtained even if the [inadmissible statement] had not been made.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 304(e)(3); <em>see United States v. Murphy, </em>39 MJ 486, 488 (CMA) (\u201ccrucial issue ... is not whether the consent was a fruit of the inadmissible statement but rather, ... whether the \u2018later confession\u2019 was voluntary\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1019, 115 S.Ct. 582, 130 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">In <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>32 MJ 76 (1991), and <em>United States v. Steward, </em>31 MJ 259 (1990), this Court applied the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), to determine if a subsequent confession was tainted by a previous unwarned confession. In <em>Phillips, </em>this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">Where a confession is obtained at a lawful interrogation that comes after an earlier interrogation in which a confession was obtained due to <em>actual </em>coercion, duress, or inducement, the subsequent confession is presumptively tainted as a product of the earlier one. On the other hand, where the earlier confession was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d only because the suspect had not been properly warned of his panoply of rights to silence and to counsel, the voluntariness of the second confession is determined by the totality of the circumstances. The earlier, unwarned statement is a factor in this total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>picture, but it does not presumptively taint the subsequent confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">32 MJ at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">An assessment of \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances\u201d includes \u201cboth the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The Supreme Court has described the test for actual coercion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">Is the confession the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker? If it is, if he has willed to confess, it may be used against him. If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of his confession offends due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\"><em>Culombe v. Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). In <em>Elstad, </em>the Supreme Court stated: \u201cA subsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>[384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (1966) ] warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.\u201d 470 U.S. at 314, 105 S.Ct. 1285, quoted in <em>Murphy, </em>39 MJ at 488, and <em>United States v. Young, </em>49 MJ 265, 267 (1998). Thus, \u201c[t]he necessary inquiry is whether the confession is the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d <em>United States v. Bubonics, </em>45 MJ 93, 95 (1996). If there has been an earlier unwarned statement, \u201cthe absence of a \u2018cleansing\u2019 warning before the subsequent statement\u201d is one of the \u201ccircumstances to be considered in determining voluntariness.\u201d <em>United States v. Lichtenhan, </em>40 MJ 466, 470 (CMA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Interrogation of a suspect in custody must cease if the suspect requests counsel. Mil.R.Evid. 305(f)(2). An ambiguous comment or request, however, does not require that interrogation cease. A request for counsel must be articulated \u201csufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d If the mention of an attorney \u201cfails to meet the requisite level of clarity,\u201d questioning may continue. \u201cIf the suspect\u2019s statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 461-62, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cit will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not [a suspect] actually wants an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis, supra </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350. \u201cThere is no blanket prohibition against a comment or a statement by a police officer after an invocation of rights.\u201d <em>Young, </em>49 MJ at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The military judge\u2019s determination that a confession is voluntary is a question of law, requiring independent, <em>ie., de novo, </em>review. <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 287, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1252, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991); <em>Bubonics, supra </em>at 94. When a military judge makes special findings of fact, they are the basis for our review of the question of voluntariness, unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Cottrill, </em>45 MJ 485, 488 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Applying the foregoing principles, we hold that appellant\u2019s written confession was voluntary and admissible. Because appellant did not testify about the barracks interview, the military judge had only the testimony of SSgt Gaddy, who testified that appellant asked for a lawyer; SA Conner, who testified that appellant did not \u201cmention a lawyer\u201d; and CPT Abbott, who testified that he did not remember appellant asking for a lawyer. The military judge found that appellant did not ask for a lawyer during the barracks interview. The testimony of SA Conner and CPT Abbott was sufficient to meet the requirement for proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Because the military judge\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous, it is the factual basis for our review of voluntariness. Based on the military judge\u2019s finding that appellant did not request a lawyer during the barracks interview, we need not address the question whether SA Connor improperly reinitiated interrogation at the CID office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>after appellant invoked his right to counsel in the barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Two issues remain: (1) was appellant\u2019s confession at the CID office voluntary in spite of the unwarned questioning in the barracks; and (2) did appellant invoke his right to counsel at the CID office? We answer the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, we hold that appellant\u2019s written confession was voluntary. The barracks interview, although unwarned, was not the product of coercion. It was conducted in an open area of the barracks, with other unit personnel moving around. SA Conner questioned appellant in a casual environment while talking to others, including CPT Abbott, at the same time. Although appellant was not free to leave the area, he was free to move around and talk to others, as evidenced by his conversation with SSgt Gaddy. SA Conner terminated the conversation when appellant asked about his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Appellant conceded at trial that he was properly warned of his rights at the CID office. While being interrogated in the \u201cstation house\u201d is somewhat coercive in itself, there is no evidence that appellant was deprived of food, water, or other personal comforts. He was not questioned at great length to wear him down physically. While no \u201ccleansing warning\u201d was given, appellant appeared to understand his rights and freely waived them. When he became irritated at SA Connor, he threatened to invoke them. Finally, there was no reference to the earlier unwarned statements at the barracks. Thus, after examining the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the written confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The only contested issue regarding appellant\u2019s written confession was whether he invoked his right to counsel. SA Connor testified that after he accused appellant of lying about the date on which he purchased the materials found in his locker, appellant said, \u201cMaybe I should get a lawyer,\u201d or something similar. SA Conner testified that he stopped the interrogation, waited a few minutes, and asked, \u201cAre we going to continue the interview or do you want to stop and get a lawyer?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">On the other hand, appellant testified he said, \u201cI want a lawyer.\u201d Appellant admitted, however, that when SA Connor examined the receipt -and admitted that he had been mistaken, appellant told him that he would continue answering questions without a lawyer if SA Conner would stop calling him a liar. Appellant testified that he responded to SA Conner\u2019s question, \u201cDo you still want a lawyer?\u201d by stating, \u201cWell, if you\u2019re not going to call me a liar anymore ... then I will answer your questions.\u201d The context of the conversation, understood by both SA Conner and appellant, was that appellant would not talk to SA Conner if he persisted in calling him a liar, but that appellant was willing to talk if SA Conner acknowledged that he had been mistaken about the date on the receipt and stopped calling him a liar. Under the circumstances, we hold that appellant\u2019s invocation was ambiguous, conditioned on not being called a liar. It was not articulated \u201csufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that SA Connor was not required to terminate the interview and thus the written confession was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\n<em>Issue II: Expert Assistance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APe\">\n<em>Factual Background,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The defense theory was that the device seized from appellant\u2019s locker was not a \u201cfirearm,\u201d as defined by 26 USC \u00a7 5845(a)(8) and (f). The statutory definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d includes any \u201cdestructive device.\u201d The defense argued that the device was not a \u201cdestructive device\u201d but merely a firecracker designed for entertainment. On the other hand, the prosecution theory was that the device was a \u201cbomb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">During a session under RCM 802, Manual, <em>supra, </em>defense counsel informed the military judge that he had interviewed Anthony May, a government explosives expert employed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). Defense counsel was not satisfied at that time that Mr. May could answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>all his questions. When it appeared that defense counsel\u2019s questions pertained more to chemistry than explosives, the Government informed the military judge that it intended to make its forensic chemist, David Flohr, available to the defense. Conceding that Mr. Flohr might be able to answer his questions, defense counsel received permission from the military judge to reserve his request until the Government completed its case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">During the Government\u2019s case-in-ehief, Mr. Flohr identified a bottle, seized from appellant\u2019s locker (Prosecution Exhibit 7), and testified that it contained a mixture of Pyrodex gunpowder, the \u201cfirst fire\u201d mixture from an M127A1 illuminator, and \u201cflattened ball, double based smokeless [gunjpowder,\u201d consistent with the powder from M-16 rifle cartridges. On cross-examination, Mr. Flohr testified that the Pyrodex mixture was \u201csafe to send through the mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Mr. Flohr also identified a device seized from appellant\u2019s locker (Prosecution Exhibit 5) which was disassembled in the laboratory. The device included a flashbulb with the glass removed, red and black wires, and a tube that appeared to be a toilet paper cardboard tube wrapped in multiple layers of silver duct tape, with a metal liner made from an iced tea can. Mr. Flohr testified that the tube contained a condom filled with a substance containing urea and ammonium sulfate, and approximately 18.7 grams of Pyrodex gunpowder. The tube also contained a plug at one end made from \u201cPlay-Doh,\u201d and plugs made from snuff cans and hot glue.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">On cross-examination, Mr. Flohr testified that the flashlight bulb\u2019s tungsten filament was missing and he was unable to find it. He testified that ammonium sulfate will smoke but will not \u201csustain combustion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">On examination by the military judge, Mr. Flohr testified that he conducted an experiment with a small quantity of the Pyrodex gunpowder taken from the device, igniting it by removing the glass from a flashlight bulb similar to the one found in appellant\u2019s locker, and illuminating the filament to ignite the powder. In the experiment, the powder ignited and produced a bright flash. Mr. Flohr testified that if the 18.7 grams of powder from appellant\u2019s device were ignited, he \u201cwould expect a very brilliant flash.\u201d If it were ignited in the tube, \u201cit would produce a loud report and then throw the disks and the hot glue, and it would eject those.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Mr. May testified that he began working for ATF on September 8, 1995, upon his retirement from the Army, where he served as an explosive ordnance disposal technician for 15 years. After cross-examining Mr. May extensively about his training and experience, defense counsel accepted him as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Mr. May testified that if the device seized from appellant were ignited, it \u201cwould explode causing the container to violently burst, projecting metal fragments.\u201d He testified that, \u201calthough this device is not like a grenade, it would have the similar effects that a grenade would have. It would produce fragments that are basically anti-personnel in nature.\u201d He testified that the device has \u201cno social or industrial applications\u201d and that it, \u201cas constructed, could be used as a weapon.\u201d He based his opinion on the fact that the tube contained \u201ca metal sleeve\u201d that \u201cwould produce fragmentation.\u201d Asked why fertilizer would be placed in a device, Mr. May testified that ammonium nitrate is \u201can explosive mixture,\u201d but ammonium sulfate, the substance seized from appellant, is not \u201can explosive mixture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Mr. May was asked if he would classify the device as \u201cjust a big firecracker.\u201d He responded that he would not, because of the metal sleeve.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">On cross-examination, Mr. May stated that it was the metal sleeve that made the device a \u201cdestructive device\u201d instead of an illegal explosive device. He agreed that the metal from the iced tea can, which was only one-tenth of a millimeter thick, was \u201clight shrapnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">Defense counsel followed with an extensive cross-examination based on the question, \u201cwhat have you worked with containing metal that would have less of an explosive and destructive effect that this thing right here,\u201d referring to appellant\u2019s device. Eventually, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Mr. May testified that appellant\u2019s device was somewhere in the middle of explosive and destructive power, between a pipe bomb and an M-80 firecracker. He qualified his answer, saying, \u201cI can truly say I have not worked with a device that was made out of a soda can with powder in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Defense counsel continued to explore the question of the destructive power of appellant\u2019s device in the following cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Q. So, everything else that you worked with, with metal, would you say had thicker metal or more metal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">A. Pm thinking ... I\u2019m trying to give you a truthful answer here. Most of the devices that I look at have thicker metal. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Q. And do most of the devices you look at have more powder when they contain metal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">A. Well, you\u2019re trying to compare improvised explosive devices. But again there\u2019s no mil specs on them. It\u2019s left up to the imagination of the builder. Have I worked with devices with more powder? Yes. Have I worked with devices with less powder? Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">DC. Your Honor, is there any other way I could ask the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">MJ. I think he\u2019s answered the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZX\">DC. Okay. I think we\u2019re there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">Jfs <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">Q. And by saying that, you\u2019re saying the metal can distinguishes it from mere firecracker status?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-13\">A. Well, the quantity of powder distinguishes [it] from a legal firecracker to an illegal device. The container, the metal container, distinguishes it from an illegal device, a destructive device, an anti-personnel weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-14\">Q. Now, is it possible that if this device were detonated, that one or both of the lids would pop off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-15\">A. With no shrapnel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-16\">Q. With no shrapnel effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-17\">A. I\u2019ll have to answer that question separately. Yes, it\u2019s possible. But, yes, there will be shrapnel effects because you\u2019ve got that thin, metal snuff can that\u2019s going to come flying out. You\u2019re going to have shrapnel. Well, actually, sir, you\u2019re going to have frag. The definition of shrapnel is something \u2014 as a metal container will fragment. But if I take BBs or nails taped to the outside of this, I\u2019m adding shrapnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aix\">Q. So, the fragments that you would have, under the best case scenario, being the least damaging, is frags, which would consist of the metal disks on the ends, one or both, flying off with no other effect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP4\">A. I would not say best case scenario. I would say it is probable, or possible, that this device functioning, yes, it could blow out, yes, a metal disk will fly. It\u2019s also probable, more probable, that the container, the whole container itself, would rupture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-19\">Q. Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-20\">A. The hot glue will cause a seal and once the powder starts burning it\u2019s gonna go to an explosion and that container is going to come apart. The whole container itself is going to fly, creating a fragmentation effect in itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-21\">Q. But the fact that it\u2019s taped up on the sides wouldn\u2019t help to prevent shrapnel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXq\">A. Oh, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-22\">sjc ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-23\">Q. Would a type of seal on the device have anything to do with that, how well it was sealed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-24\">A. For having to do with what, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-25\">Q. Would that affect the explosion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-26\">A. If you had \u2014 the better the seal, the greater the pressure increase; the greater the pressure increase, the better the explosion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-27\">Q. So, if it were old or mishandled, it\u2019s possible that we would have a lesser seal and, therefore, a lesser explosion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-28\">A. If you\u2019ve got a leak in your seal, you could have \u2014 you still would have an explosion. So, as I said, you can take powder and I can pile the Pyrodex up on that typewriter table without any other confinement other than the pile itself and I can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>get that to explode. You\u2019re still going to have an explosion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Q. But you really -can\u2019t tell exactly how much of an explosion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">A. Oh, no, sir\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Q. \u2014based upon what we got\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">A. No, sir. I can tell you the probable effects based on my experience. But I can\u2019t tell you as an exact science. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">At the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case, defense counsel renewed his request for expert assistance. Defense counsel asserted that Mr. May was unable to adequately assist the defense because he works for ATF, had worked for ATF for only a short time, is still a probationary employee, and was uncooperative on cross-examination, <em>i.e., </em>\u201che just wouldn\u2019t grasp it [the last series of questions] and acknowledge the issues\u201d that defense counsel wanted to raise. The following dialogue then ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">DC: ... What the defense requests is a witness who would work with the defense to help us decide whether or not any expert could tell, based upon the set of facts as exemplified by Prosecution Exhibit 5 [the materials seized from appellant\u2019s locker], whether or not any expert could make an opinion as to the volatility of the device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABv\">MJ: Volatility being what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">DC: What would happen if it exploded. He first said it would definitely throw shrapnel and then he called them \u201cfrags\u201d and then he said it\u2019s possible that it might not throw frags. What I want to do is find and talk to a defense expert who would say, based upon Prosecution Exhibit 5 as it sits here, no member of the ATF, particularly a post-blast analyst, can look at this device and tell what it could have done if it were assembled properly \u2014 depending on the age of the thing, how it\u2019s been handled, volatility, leaking, things like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">MJ: I don\u2019t think that you\u2019ve made an adequate showing that you need an expert. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any real dispute that the materials that were included in there were explosive materials and, if ignited, that they could propel whatever materials were in there, metal materials or what have you. That is what Mr. May testified to. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve made an adequate showing that any consultation with another expert would be beneficial to you on the points for which you offered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">Your request is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">RCM 703(d) authorizes employment of experts to assist the defense at government expense when their testimony would be \u201crelevant and necessary,\u201d if the Government cannot or will not \u201cprovide an adequate substitute.\u201d This Court has observed that \u201cupon a proper showing of necessity, an accused is entitled to\u201d expert assistance. <em>United States v. Burnette, </em>29 MJ 473, 475, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 821, 111 S.Ct. 70, 112 L.Ed.2d 43 (1990). This Court has adopted a three-pronged test for determining whether expert assistance is necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-17\">First, why the expert assistance is needed. Second, what would the expert assistance accomplish for the accused. Third, why is the defense counsel unable to gather and present the evidence that the expert assistant would be able to develop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-18\"><em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>39 MJ 459, 461, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 965, 115 S.Ct. 429, 130 L.Ed.2d 342 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-19\">We review the military judge\u2019s decision on a request for expert assistance for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>46 MJ 477, 480 (1997), citing <em>United States v. Garries, </em>22 MJ 288, 291 (CMA), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 985, 107 S.Ct. 575, 93 L.Ed.2d 578 (1986), <em>cert. denied </em>in <em>Washington, </em>522 U.S. 1051, 118 S.Ct. 698, 139 L.Ed.2d 642 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-20\">Applying the above <em>Gonzalez </em>test, we hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion. The Government made a forensic chemist and an explosives expert available, and the record reflects that both were interviewed by the defense before the Government presented its case on the merits. Although the defense complained that Mr. May was a probationary employee of ATF with less than one year\u2019s experience, Mr. May also had 15 years of experience as an Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and defense counsel conceded at trial that he was an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Defense counsel\u2019s complaint about Mr. May\u2019s answers on cross-examination arose from Mr. May\u2019s unwillingness to agree that the device in question was \u201cjust a big firecracker.\u201d Mr. May adamantly insisted that, even if the metal liner did not rupture, the metal end caps would still produce a fragmentation effect. Defense counsel asked for an expert to \u201chelp us decide whether or not any expert\u201d could express an opinion contrary to Mr. May\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Appellant\u2019s request satisfies the first <em>Gonzalez </em>prong. He needed an expert to testify that the device was \u201cjust a big firecracker\u201d and not a \u201cdestructive device.\u201d More specifically, the defense wanted an expert to contradict Mr. May\u2019s testimony that the device would produce a fragmentation effect if detonated.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Whether appellant\u2019s request satisfies the second <em>Gonzalez </em>prong is a closer question. He wanted an expert to help him find an expert. In essence, he was asking the Government to find him an expert who could tell him whether the Government\u2019s expert could be contradicted. We need not decide, however,' whether the second prong is satisfied, because appellant\u2019s request fails the third <em>Gonzalez </em>prong. The record does not show any efforts on the part of the defense to determine if an expert existed who could contradict Mr. May. There is nothing in the record indicating whether defense counsel had done any independent research or had any specific basis for questioning the responses given by the government expert. <em>See generally United States v. Short, </em>50 MJ 370, 373 (1999) (defense counsel expected to do \u201chomework\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-13\">.
