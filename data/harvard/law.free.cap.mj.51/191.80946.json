The convening authority approved the sentence of a dishonorable discharge, 30 years\u2019 confinement, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed without opinion. We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION WHEN HE FAILED TO DECLARE A MISTRIAL AFTER THE GOVERNMENT IMPROPERLY ELICITED INADMISSIBLE CREDIBILITY TESTIMONY AND UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT EVIDENCE FROM A CRITICAL PROSECUTION WITNESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">WHETHER THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ERRORS DURING APPELLANT\u2019S COURT-MARTIAL DENIED APPELLANT A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">Appellant contends that the military judge should have <em>sua sponte </em>declared \u201ca mistrial when the prosecutor repeatedly asked questions relating to the victim\u2019s credibility and improperly elicited uncharged misconduct evidence from Dr. Ellen Speyer.\u201d Final Brief at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">\n<em>Improper Credibility Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">It was clear from the onset of trial that the military judge was aware of and sensitive to the limitations surrounding expert testimony in sexual abuse cases concerning stress syndromes. Before the members heard any evidence, the military judge repeatedly cautioned counsel against improper indications or questioning designed to show impermissibly that this victim was credible. Those cautions, as well as assurances by trial counsel, follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-20\">MJ: And do you [TC] expect to ask her [Dr. Speyer] a question or to proffer evidence that she says after having investigated this matter, I think [K] is truthful and her story believable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-21\">TC: Your Honor, we\u2019re aware of the case law involving the human lie detector and we will ask questions consistent with the case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-22\">MJ: <em>[United States </em>u] <em>Suarez[, </em>35 MJ 374 (CMA 1992),] is the case you need to look [a]t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-23\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-24\">MJ: See, here\u2019s the problem that everybody\u2019s having and I know you guys have read <em>Suarez, </em>but not this woman, Mrs. [C], or any doctor\u2019s going to come in here and say, \u201cI believe [K]\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t believe [K].\u201d I mean, I\u2019m not allowing anybody to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>MJ: Okay. And we are specifically excluding Dr. Speyer or any other person to be a witness as to the truth or veracity of [K], is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">MJ: I don\u2019t want to simply go on other cases because every case is different. Why should I give a forensic examination of this witness, when A \u2014 of [K], when A, the witness cannot testify as to the truth or give their opinion,....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">MJ: All right. If there\u2019s anything else [Dr. Speyer will testify to], Captain [M] [sic], let him know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">TC: We abide by the rules, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">MJ: And that\u2019s the ticket. And I will not permit any witness to come in here, okay, and talk about whether or not they believe or how to believe a witness based upon something like that. The members will watch her demeanor. The members will listen to her testimony. And the members will determine her believability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">MJ: Does he have any \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s right. Does he have any expertise on why \u2014 on how people should believe children based upon their demeanor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">TC: Yes, he does, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">MJ: He does? There\u2019s a body of scientific information that when a child does a certain thing they\u2019re believable or less believable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">TC: Sir, it\u2019s the best education of all, experience. He had \u2014 he can establish his experience over 10 years, I believe, in this work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">MJ: And say \u201cMy experience is is [sic] that [K]\u2019s believable and \u2014 though some children aren\u2019t?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">TC: No, Your Honor. We will not ask that line of questioning as we\u2019re aware of the case law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">Despite these cautions and despite his assurances, trial counsel ventured into the prohibited area, more than once, with several witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">TC: Do you believe that [K] is a [sic] honest person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-17\">A [Mrs. L, teacher]: Very much so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-18\">TC: Has she ever given you any reason to question her credibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-19\">DC: Asking for specific instances, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-20\">MJ: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-21\">TC: Do you have any reason to question [K]\u2019s credibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-22\">A: I would trust [K] with my wallet, my purse, anything. I mean she\u2019s a----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-24\">MJ: Yeah. Talk to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-25\">DC: The bell\u2019s been rung, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-26\">MJ: Do you object?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-27\">DC: Not at this \u2014 no, sir. Not at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-28\">TC: When you were questioning the accused, what was his demeanor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-29\">A [Special Agent (of the Criminal Investigation Command) Reid]: He appeared to me to be evasive, sir. He rendered physical signs of crossing his arms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-30\">DC: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-31\">MJ: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-32\">\u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-33\">MJ: [Y]our objection is sustained. Members will disregard evasive or any of those other things that go to whether or not this witness\u2019s opinion is the person was truthful or not. You may have the witness describe physical characteristics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-34\">TC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-35\">MJ: Okay. From which the members if they wish, can come to a conclusion. But I will not let anyone ask a witness the truth question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-36\">TC: Understood, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">TC: Did her demeanor seem appropriate for somebody who was claiming that they\u2019d been sexually molested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">A [Dr. Nataraj, Pediatrician]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">DC: Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">MJ: Sustained. Members, you\u2019ll disregard the question and the answer. You won\u2019t ask another question like that. The members are advised that it\u2019s your opinion in the form of your verdict that counts. You may ask her about the witness\u2019 demeanor, but you will not ask this or any witness a conclusion like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">TC: Yes, sir..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">\u2022I* \u00ed\u00ed\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">TC: [C]ould you describe for the panel the progression of the treatment that you provided [K]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">A [Dr. Speyer]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">DC: Relevance, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">TC: It goes directly to [K]\u2019s treatment and her credibility, sir. It an all\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">DC: 39(a), Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">[Session under Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a), convened]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">MJ: ... Why did you, in the presence of these members, use the words [K]\u2019s credibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-17\">TC: Misstatement, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-18\">MJ: I\u2019m tired of your misstatements. I\u2019m tired of the Government\u2019s misstatements. How many times do I have to tell you and tell the members that the credibility issue is solely to the members? We have talked about the <em>Suarez </em>ease till I\u2019m sick of talking about it. I\u2019ve pointed out that instruction a thousand times. How many times do you want to- try this case, Captain [B]? Cause you\u2019re so damn close to a mistrial, that you\u2019re about to try [it] all over again if you want to. Is that what you want?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD3y\">TC: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-19\">MJ: Do you want to put the [C] family, the [H] family and all these witnesses through this again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-20\">TC: No, I do not, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-21\">MJ: Do you want to go to jail personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A31\">TC: I do not, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-22\">MJ: Okay. Your [sic] damn close, and I\u2019m beginning to believe it isn\u2019t a mistake, got it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-23\">TC: Got it, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-24\">At this point, the military judge assured himself that Dr. Speyer understood the permissible limits of her testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-25\">Would you please, and in case that we have another error, and I throw Captain [B] out and cause Captain [K] to fix up \u2014 pick up the direct examination, will you be very clear to make it understood that you are not giving your opinion as to whether or not you believe whether or not abuse occurred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-26\">When the members returned, the military judge gave the members \u201ca preview\u201d of Dr. Speyer\u2019s testimony and described for them the permissible manner in which the testimony could be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-27\">\n<em>Uncharged-Misconduct Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-28\">When trial counsel asked Dr. Speyer how K\u2019s \u201ctreatment progressed,\u201d Dr. Speyer responded, \u201cOkay. [K] and her mother both verbalized a lot of concern. They talked about threats being made by the accused perpetrator against the family.\u201d Defense counsel made a general objection which was sustained on the basis of hearsay. The military judge directed the members to disregard the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-29\">At the request of defense counsel, an Article 39(a) session was held, where the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-30\">DC: Your Honor, as an officer of the court and on [sic] the interest of justice, I request that Captain [B] be removed off this case at this point. I don\u2019t know how many times he has to be warned. He knows the rules, we\u2019ve heard him say it in this courtroom that the Government always follows the rules at earlier 39(a) sessions. I have worked very hard, even with my witnesses to make sure that objectionable testimony doesn\u2019t come out; you even saw me do it with Mrs. [H] where I cut her off. And I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>think justice calls for Captain [B]\u2019s removal from the case at this point, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al_\">TC: Your Honor, I think Captain [M]\u2019s trying to channel your anger and take advantage of the situation here and have you focus it at me. And I think that \u2014 I think that----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">MJ: You are the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">TC: As you see it, sir; I do not see it that way, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">MJ: Do you think that it\u2019s admissible under any conceivable theory to allow this witness to testify that Mrs. [C] and or [K] were reporting that the accused and his family were making threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">TC: Certainly not Mrs. [C], no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">MJ: Or [K], for making threats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">TC: I think \u2014 I think the statements [K] made to her physician in the course of treatment are admissible and they are relevant, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">MJ: Have you read----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">TC: And screaming at me is not going to change my opinion on that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">MJ: Take a hike, Captain [B], leave. And when Dr. Speyer is done, you can come back in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">TC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">After a short recess, the military judge was asked to reconsider his decision to remove trial counsel from questioning this witness. Defense counsel maintained his position that Captain B should be \u201cpermanently\u201d removed, even stating that he was \u201cnot convinced\u201d Captain B\u2019s actions were unintentional. Ultimately, the military judge did modify his decision, permitting Captain B to remain in the courtroom, but directing that the assistant trial counsel complete the examination of Dr. Speyer. Her testimony was completed with only two additional problems: (1) an objection to Dr. Speyer\u2019s referring to K as \u201ca victim of abuse,\u201d which again caused the judge to caution Dr. Speyer about labeling K as a victim; and (2) the military judge <em>sua sponte </em>cutting off a question on redirect which sought to elicit information from Dr. Speyer beyond the diagnosis of trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">\n<em>Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">Although the military judge made strong reference to the potential for a mistrial after findings and before sentencing, defense counsel did not request a mistrial at any point in the proceedings. This fact was not lost on the military judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-20\">MJ: Okay. Captain [M], you don\u2019t have to sign up for this if you don\u2019t want to, but I was surprised that you did not request a mistrial when we got into it with Dr. Speyer and whatnot. Do you have any \u2014 would you like to state anything for the record why you did or did not \u2014 why you did not move for a mistrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-21\">DC: Yes, Your Honor. The requested relief at the time we felt was appropriate. It was also a tactical decision on my part considering the way the trial was proceeding. I did consult with my client. At that time we decided that our case was progressing well, that we did not want to risk a second trial. My client and I agreed that it was wrong and not desirable for him to have to undergo a whole new trial. And it was a joint decision made between myself and [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-23\">Declaration of a mistrial and prosecutorial misconduct must be viewed through the prism formed by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment; Article 44(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 844(a); and RCM 915, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 edition).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-24\">The Constitution, the Code, and the Manual protect the accused against improper retrials. The Double Jeopardy Clause provides: \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb____\u201d Article 44(a) provides that \u201c[n]o person may, without his consent, be tried a second time for the same offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-27\">Relying in part on Supreme Court precedent <footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 see, <em>e.g., Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982); <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976) \u2014 RCM 915(a) sets forth that a mistrial may be declared in the discretion of the military judge \u201cwhen such action is manifestly necessary in the interest of justice because of circumstances arising during the proceedings which cast substantial doubt upon the fairness of the proceedings.\u201d Declaration of a mistrial is, however, \u201ca drastic remedy\u201d which should be used only when necessary \u201cto prevent a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Games, </em>32 MJ 345, 349 (CMA 1991). A military judge\u2019s determination on a request for mistrial, or on his own <em>sua sponte </em>consideration of a mistrial, will not be reversed \u201cabsent clear evidence of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Rushatz, </em>31 MJ 450, 456 (CMA 1990); <em>United States v. Jeanbaptiste, </em>5 MJ 374, 376 (CMA 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The Double Jeopardy Clause and the Code are designed to protect the accused against repeated attempts to try an individual for the same offense, including subjecting the accused to the embarrassment, expense, and ordeal of a second trial. With this in mind, the judge should examine numerous factors in deciding whether to grant a mistrial, including the timing of the incident leading to the question of mistrial, the identity of the factfinder, the reasons for a mistrial, and potential alternative remedies; but, most importantly, the desires of and the impact on the defendant. <em>United States v. Donley, </em>33 MJ 44, 47 (CMA 1991). The defendant \u201cretain[s] primary control over the course to be followed in the event of\u2019 trial errors. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 609, 96 S.Ct. 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">This is not an instance where the defense alleges a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d between retrial and unfairness at the first trial because of intentional or egregious misconduct by the prosecutor. <em>See id. </em>at 609, 96 S.Ct. 1075. The military judge demonstrated his keen sensitivity to improper credibility testimony. He repeatedly warned counsel and received assurances that counsel was aware of the limitations. Yet, in at least four instances trial counsel ventured into the area of improper credibility evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Obviously, trial counsel gave the military judge pause to consider the option of a mistrial despite the absence of a request from the defense: \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re so damn close to a mistrial, that you\u2019re about to try [this case] all over again if you want to.\u201d Under these circumstances, the military judge ultimately determined that he could rely upon the various cautionary or limiting instructions he gave the members during trial, and his closing instructions which once again emphasized that credibility was the determination of the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The frequency of the warnings should have caused the Government to be vigilant with each and every witness. Yet evidence of that vigilance is lacking. The frequency of the incursions into improper areas is somewhat remarkable under these circumstances. Fortunately, the military judge was vigilant. Proper limiting instructions, along with the presumption that the members followed those instructions, eliminated the risk of harm from this improper credibility evidence. <em>United States v. Skerrett, </em>40 MJ 331, 333-34 (CMA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Similarly, the military judge corrected the error from the improper evidence of threats. The evidence was never admitted or considered as proper \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. <em>See </em>Mil.R.Evid. 404(b), Manual, <em>supra. </em>The military judge told the members to disregard the comment about threats as hearsay, and he explained that hearsay denied the appellant an opportunity to confront the allegations of threat. It is presumed that the members followed this instruction. We conclude that there is no prejudicial error in the manner in which the military judge dealt with the evidence of alleged threats made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">This is not a case where the errors went unnoticed or uncorrected at the time they occurred. The military judge maintained control over the entire proceedings, and thereby caught and took corrective action when inadmissible credibility and uncharged misconduct evidence was improperly broached by trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Thus, we hold that the judge did not abuse his discretion by not <em>sua sponte </em>declaring a mistrial. We further hold that the corrective action taken by the military judge assured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>appellant a fair trial, especially in light of appellant\u2019s expressed desires.</p>\n<p id=\"Aom\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-17\"> <em>See </em>Manual, <em>supra </em>at A21-61.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
