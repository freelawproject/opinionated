Meade, Maryland. Contrary to his pleas, he was found guilty of one specification of rape, and two specifications of indecent assault, under Articles 120 and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 920 and 934, respectively. The members sentenced him to a dishonorable discharge, 3 years\u2019 confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged on August 26, 1996. On appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals ordered a DuBay<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing on the issue of unlawful command influence. 47 MJ 715 (1997). After that hearing was conducted in March 1998, the lower court affirmed the findings and sentence on June 30,1998. 48 MJ 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">On February 22, 1999, this Court granted review on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-19\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION AND/OR WAS CLEARLY ERRONEOUS IN DENYING APPELLANT\u2019S PRE-TRIAL MOTION TO SUPPRESS AN ALLEGED ADMISSION OBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 31 OF THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE (UCMJ)<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-20\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-21\">WHETHER APPELLANT\u2019S CONVICTION AND/OR SENTENCE IN THIS CASE WAS THE RESULT OF THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF COMMAND INFLUENCE AND/OR IMPROPER ACTIONS BY THE SPECIAL COURT-MARTIAL CONVENING AUTHORITY\u2019S STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-22\">We resolve these issues in the Government\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-24\">On Issue I, the record before us shows that appellant was a \u201ccryptologic linguist specialist\u201d with a high-level top secret security clearance. On August 5, 1994, he was accused of raping and indecently assaulting a female member of his unit. The Government produced evidence that appellant\u2019s acting commander, Major Scafidi, received a phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>call informing him of the alleged rape. He then attempted to contact appellant by telephone. Once contact was made, Major Scafidi informed appellant that he needed to speak with him after appellant spoke with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The next day, appellant called Major Scafidi as instructed. Major Scafidi testified to the telephone conversation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">Q. [TC]: Okay. When he called you back, as best you can remember, after you answered the phone, what did the accused say to you or what did you say to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANL\">A. I asked him <em>what happened at the police station.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">Q. Word for word as best you can recall, what exactly did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">A. I said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">Q. First of all, did you ask him where he was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">A. I asked, \u2018Where are you at?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">Q. And what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">A. He said, \u201cFm at home,\u201d and I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">Q. And when you asked what happened, what were you asking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-13\">A. <em>I needed to know what happened at the police station.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-14\">Q. Is it fair to say that just because he\u2019s home something might have happened at the police station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-16\">Q. He might have been booked and released, for example?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-17\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-18\">Q. And you needed to know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-19\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-20\">Q. When you said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d, what did the accused say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-21\">A. <em>He said, \u201cI admitted to touching her without her consent.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-22\">Q. And your understanding is that he was relating to you what he had just said at the police station that afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-24\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-25\">Major Scafidi testified that the purpose of his call was to inquire whether appellant had been arrested, charged, or accused of criminal conduct in order to determine whether appellant\u2019s security clearance required termination. He did not ask any other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-28\">Appellant testified somewhat differently. He testified that he spoke with Major Scafidi twice after his arrest by civilian authorities. The record states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-29\">Q[DC]. What was you conversation with Major Scafidi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-30\">A. He asked me, <em>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He said that </em>\u2014 he <em>asked me if I had spoke with the authorities yet, and I said no, that I was going to soon. </em>He then told me he couldn\u2019t tell me any more; he couldn\u2019t talk to me about what was going on; that as soon as I was done speaking with the authorities to call him back. Detective Wright came to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-31\">Q. Before you go on, did he ask you any questions \u2014 he Major Scafidi \u2014 did he ask you questions regarding when was your next scheduled duty time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-32\">A. At that time, no, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-33\">Q. Did he ask you what your status was or had you been charged with an offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcG\">A. At that time I told him that I had not talked to the authorities yet and that I had not been contacted or charged or seen by anybody of the authorities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-34\">Q. Did he express to you at that time any conversations regarding, \u201cIf you are charged or if anything happens, please call me because it pertains to your security clearance\u201d? Did he make any statements regarding that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-35\">A. Not relating to the security clearance. <em>His concern was simply had I spoke with the authorities, had I been charged. No reference to the security clearance at that time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-36\">Q, That was your first conversation with the major?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-37\">A. Yes, sir, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-38\">Q. Did you later call him back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-39\">A. Yes, sir. After Detective Wright left my home, I returned Major Scafidi\u2019s call. <em>He asked me what was going on, and I said that I hadn\u2019t been charged and related to him what Detective Wright said to me which was, </em>\u201cAssuming you touched her without permission, this is aggravated as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>sault, but I\u2019m not charging you with that now,\u201d <em>and I related that information quoting Detective Wright to Major Scafidi.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">Q. Did you tell Major Scafidi this is what .the detective told you or did you say, \u201cSir, this is what happened; this is what I did; or this is what I heard\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">A. I said, \u201cThis is what Detective Wright indicated to me what is going on with my status \u2014 with my current status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Q. Did the major then ask you if you had gone down to the police station for any questioning or to be arrested and formally charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">A. No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Q. Did he ask when your next duty day was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">A. Yes, he did. He asked me, \u2018When do you have to work again?\u201d I replied, \u201cEarly Monday morning; I have a mission scheduled for probably 2:00 or 3 o\u2019clock show time early Monday morning.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay. Do not go to the mission; report to the commander at 7:30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Q. Did he give you any instructions as far as finding a replacement or someone to fly in your place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">A. He said he would take care of that. He said that he would find out who the NCOIC in charge of the mission that morning was and take care of having a replacement for me, that my concern was to be in blues Monday morning at 7:30 to see Colonel Mitzel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">Q. Was there anything else in that conversation with the major?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">A. <em>No, sir, just he asked me, \u201cHave you been charged? Have you been detained?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d And \u201cDon\u2019t go to the mission on Monday morning.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">Q. At any point during any of your conversations, either your first phone call to the major or the later one, did he ever read you your Article 31 rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">A. No, sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">Q. Did he ever tell you, if not formally your Article 31 rights, did he ever say anything about, \u201cThere\u2019s some serious charges or there\u2019s been an allegation\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGF\">A. No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">Q. Did he ever say, \u201cDon\u2019t make any statements to me about what happened. I\u2019m just trying to determine what your duty status is as relating to your clearance\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">A. No, sir, he did not. He did the opposite. He told me he could not speak to me but never advised me to not tell him the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-19\">\u2756 \u00ed\u00a1s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-20\">Q[TC]: \u2014when you called him back, he asked you what happened? He was asking you what had just happened that afternoon wasn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-21\">A. He asked me my status. <em>The \u201cwhat happened\u201d he was asking me the status of the nature of [sic] with the authorities being there I understood him asking me, \u201cHave you been charged? Are you going to be detained? What\u2019s your situation?\u201d I understood that to be the question.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfV\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-22\">At trial, appellant moved to suppress evidence of the <em>unwarned statement </em>made to Major Scafidi because he was conducting a disciplinary inquiry and failed to read him his Article 31 rights. The military judge denied the motion and made factual findings stating that there was \u201cno question that both the questioner and the person questioned understood the purpose and intent of the question, \u2018What happened?\u2019 An incriminating response was not requested, and in the mind of the accused, an incriminating response was neither sought nor given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction because it held that the \u201cmilitary judge did not abuse his discretion\u201d by admitting appellant\u2019s pretrial statement to his acting commander. The lower appellate court found, as the military judge found, that Major Scafidi \u201cwas not conducting a criminal investigation.\u201d 47 MJ at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-24\">Appellant asserts that the military judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his purported pretrial admissions to his acting commander, Major Scafidi. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>first contends that the judge erred in finding his commander was not acting in a disciplinary capacity when that commander telephoned him and asked, \u201cwhat happened.\u201d He next argues 'that the service appellate court erred when it held that no Article 31 violation occurred simply because he took the witness stand and disputed the accuracy of the responses which Major Scafidi testified he made to these questions. We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Turning first to appellant\u2019s \u201ctroubling paradox\u201d argument, Final Brief at 29, we conclude that he has misread the opinion of the service court below. Neither the military judge nor the Court of Criminal Appeals held that appellant\u2019s testimony disputing Major Scafidi\u2019s testimony on appellant\u2019s responses to the challenged questioning waived or forfeited his suppression motion. They did conclude that appellant\u2019s testimony that he provided non-incriminating answers to those questions and he perceived these questions as non-incriminating was some evidence that this was not interrogation barred by Article 31. This was not legal error. <em>United States v. White, </em>48 MJ 251, 257-58 (1998) (considering appellant\u2019s perception of events to determine whether interrogation occurred); <em>see United States v. Meeks, </em>41 MJ 150, 162 (CMA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Turning to appellant\u2019s first argument, this Court\u2019s precedents hold that warnings under Article 31 \u00e1re required when a suspect or an accused is questioned by a military superior during an official law enforcement investigation or disciplinary inquiry. <em>See United States v. McLaren, </em>38 MJ 112 (CMA 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1112, 114 S.Ct. 1056, 127 L.Ed.2d 377 (1994); <em>United States v. Loukas, </em>29 MJ 385 (CMA 1990); <em>see also United States v. Moore, </em>32 MJ 56, 60 (CMA 1991). Indeed, this Court will presume \u201cthat a superior in the immediate chain of command\u201d is acting in an investigatory or disciplinary role unless circumstances show otherwise. <em>Loukas, supra </em>at 389 n. *; <em>United States v. Good, </em>32 MJ 105, 108 (CMA 1991); <em>United States v. Pittman, </em>36 MJ 404, 407 n. 7 (CMA 1993). Here, the military judge found that appellant\u2019s commander was not acting in a law enforcement or disciplinary role when he questioned appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">This Court previously considered the type of circumstances surrounding a commander\u2019s official questioning of an accused which did not necessitate Article 31 rights\u2019 warnings. In <em>Loukas, </em>the accused indicated that he \u201cwas experiencing a hallucination\u201d aboard an aircraft in mid flight. In response to his irrational behavior and without administering Article 31 warnings, the crew chief asked the accused, his subordinate, \u201cif he had taken any drugs.\u201d We held that admission of the accused\u2019s response (he had taken some cocaine the night before) did not violate Article 31 because the challenged questions were pertinent to the crew chiefs \u201coperational responsibilities\u201d for the safety of the plane and its crew. We further noted \u201cthere was no evidence\u201d that the superior\u2019s questions \u201cwere designed to evade the accused\u2019s constitutional or codal rights.\u201d 29 MJ at 386, 389; <em>Good, supra </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Appellant does not generally contend that a security clearance question is not within the ambit of the administrative and operational exception to Article 31, as recognized by our case law. His particular complaint is that his commander used his security responsibilities as a pretext to ask appellant questions which would be both incriminating and admissible in court. Both the military judge and the Court of Criminal Appeals factually rejected appellant\u2019s view of the evidence on this point. We conclude that their findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and were amply supported by the evidence of record in this case. <em>See generally United States v. Campos, </em>42 MJ 253, 261 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">In this regard, we note, Major Scafidi testified that the purpose of his questions was to determine whether charges were filed because that action would necessitate suspension of appellant\u2019s high level security clearance. He also testified that he did not seek or ask for incriminating information about the alleged rape. <em>See also United States v. Hessler, </em>7 MJ 9 (CMA 1979). Furthermore, there was no other evidence in this case which shows that Major Scafidi was pursuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>a criminal investigation or held any other law enforcement role in appellant\u2019s ease. On the contrary, evidence was admitted that immediately after asking appellant \u201cwhat happened?\u201d, he pulled appellant\u2019s TS/SCI clearance and told him not to report to duty, thus corroborating his testimony. <em>See Loukas, supra </em>at 389. Appellant also presented no evidence that Major Scafidi asked the question as a ruse for an investigation or attempted to evade appellant\u2019s Article 31 rights. <em>Id. </em>at 388. Finally, as noted by the court below, \u201cit is clear from the record that both Major Scafidi and appellant understood that, although Major Scafidi was acting in an official capacity, he was seeking information needed for the proper review of appellant\u2019s security clearance status and was not conducting a criminal investigation.\u201d 47 MJ at 717. Accordingly, we conclude that the military judge did not err in admitting appellant\u2019s pretrial statements to Major Scafidi. <em>See United States v. Campos, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In the second granted issue, appellant alleges that Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col) Dent, the special court-martial convening authority\u2019s staff judge advocate (SJA) improperly influenced his general court-martial in four specific ways. First, he contends that the SJA improperly pressured a defense witness, Master Sergeant (MSgt) Lisa Becker, not to testify. Second, he asserts that this SJA engaged in improper ex parte communications with the president of the panel. Third, he alleges that this same officer published an article in the base newspaper which prejudiced appellant\u2019s chances for clemency from the general court-martial convening authority. Finally, he avers that the SJA (Lt Col Dent) after trial dissuaded a court member from providing a letter for appellant\u2019s clemency package.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">(1) Pressure on defense witness</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Appellant\u2019s first contention, as noted above, is that MSgt Becker was unlawfully influenced by Lt Col Dent, the staff judge advocate to the special court-martial convening authority at Fort Meade, Maryland. He asserts that the SJA spoke with MSgt Becker on the telephone and dissuaded her from' testifying for the defense in this case. He contends that the SJA\u2019s comments were \u201cblatantly improper\u201d and caused this witness\u2019 testimony to be \u201cless enthusiastic and less forthcoming\u201d for the defense. Final Brief at 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Our initial concern is whether the SJA\u2019s telephone conversation amounted to unlawful command influence. <em>See </em>Art. 37(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 837(a). Certainly, an SJA may not engage in conduct which dissuades defense witnesses from testifying truthfully at courts-martial. <em>See United States v. Gleason, </em>43 MJ 69, 73 (1995). Here, however, the Court of Criminal Appeals found the same facts as those found by the judge at the <em>DuBay </em>hearing and concluded that they \u201cneither indicated bias towards appellant nor amounted to unlawful command influence.\u201d 48 MJ at 779. We need not decide this question because we agree with the appellate court below that no prejudice in this case occurred as a result of the SJA\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">Although MSgt Becker\u2019s testimony conflicted in part with Lt Col Dent\u2019s, she admitted that although she did think about not testifying after their conversation, she nonetheless decided to testify for the appellant both on the merits and during sentencing. We note from the record that, in addition to testifying about the victim\u2019s demeanor at the hospital, she also provided strong character and truthfulness testimony on behalf of appellant. However, at the post-trial hearing she had apparently forgotten giving this latter testimony and claimed to have withheld it because of her conversation with Lt Col Dent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">48 MJ at 779-80 (1998). Appellant has proffered no legal authority that a loss of enthusiasm constitutes legal prejudice requiring reversal and he has not indicated what, if any, testimony was withheld by this witness. In these circumstances appellate relief is not warranted. <em>See generally United States v. Rivers, </em>49 MJ 434, 443 (1998) (this Court \u201csatisfied that appellant was not deprived of any witnesses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>(2) Ex parte communication</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Appellant next contends that Lt Col Dent engaged in improper ex parte communications with the president of appellant\u2019s court-martial panel. He asserts that the service appellate court erroneously found only one such conversation occurred, when in fact another occurred as well, and two such conversations are enough for reversal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">It is not the number of ex parte conversations which is critical, but their content. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>41 MJ 22, 27 (CMA 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1084, 115 S.Ct. 738, 130 L.Ed.2d 640 (1995). Here, despite evidence that a second conversation may have occurred, the military judge found that only one occurred and that it did not concern appellant\u2019s trial. <em>See generally United States v. Campos, supra. </em>Furthermore, the defense did not protest the president\u2019s further participation in this court-martial once this matter came to light at trial. <em>See </em>48 MJ at 780-81. We are satisfied that there was no unlawful command influence as a matter of fact or law in these circumstances. <em>United States v. Hamilton, supra</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">(3) Newspaper article</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Appellant\u2019s third complaint of unlawful command influence concerns an article appearing in a base newspaper written by the special court-martial convening authority\u2019s SJA after appellant\u2019s general court-martial. He contends that Lt Col Dent\u2019s article constituted unlawful command influence on the general court-martial authority and his SJA who were then reviewing this case in Texas. He relies on the decision of this Court in <em>United States v. Wansley, </em>46 MJ 335 (1997), for the proposition that such conduct constitutes unlawful command influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The appellate court below noted the findings of the military judge on this matter, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">We also agree with the military judge that the article concerning appellant\u2019s conviction in \u201cThe Eagle,\u201d a 694th Intelligence Group publication, was in no way improper command influence. It merely informed the local community of the results of appellant\u2019s trial. The reference to the Navy\u2019s Tailhook incident in that article was apparently to emphasize that all military members should be on notice about the possible consequences of sexual misconduct, not to directly liken appellant\u2019s crimes to Tail-hook. In any case, it was written by Lt Col Dent, the special court-martial convening authority\u2019s SJA, who was stationed in Maryland. We found no evidence to indicate it could have possibly affected the general court-martial (GCM) convening authority or his SJA, both in Texas, even if the article had been improper. This is notwithstanding the fact that Lt Col Dent sent a copy of this article to the GCM SJA for informational purposes as a routine part of tracking the preventive law program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">48 MJ at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">We agree with the military judge that unlawful command influence did not occur on the basis of this newspaper article and its routine delivery to the general court-martial convening authority. This article was unsigned and basically reported the results of trial to the military community at Fort Meade. The quotes ascribed to a junior legal officer at a subordinate command were consistent with his law enforcement duties and were not directed to the clemency process. We see no violation of Article 37 in this context and we do not read <em>United States v. Wansley, supra </em>(a post-trial review-disqualification case) as holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">(4) Stifling clemency recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">Appellant\u2019s final complaint of unlawful command influence concerns a matter raised for the first time at the <em>DuBay </em>hearing which the Court of Criminal Appeals noted was \u201cnot addressed in our order for a post-final hearing.\u201d 48 MJ at 780. A member of appellant\u2019s court-martial, Captain (Capt) Applegate, testified that he approached Lt Col Dent for legal advice on what a member of a court-martial was legally permitted to say after trial on behalf of a convicted accused in a letter of clemency. <em>See </em>RCM 1105(b)(4), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>(1995 edition)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (clemency recommendation by court-martial member). He further stated that Lt Col Dent refused to answer his question and attempted to dissuade him from submitting such a statement by saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to do that, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The Government opposed this claim at the <em>DuBay </em>hearing on the basis of the testimony of Lt Col Dent who remembered advising Capt Applegate on this matter. He denied making the above noted statement or advising Capt Applegate in any way that he should not submit a clemency letter. The Government also submitted the testimony of Colonel Behrens, who overheard much of their conversation concerning such a statement and confirmed Lt Col Dent\u2019s version of this incident. 48 MJ at 780. The military judge at the <em>DuBay </em>hearing, however, made no particular findings of fact or conclusions of law on this matter. Instead he generally concluded that appellant\u2019s unlawful-command-influence complaints were without merit and that he chose to believe Lt Col Dent\u2019s version of events rather than Capt Applegate\u2019s in another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We are not a court with factfinding powers and the judge\u2019s incomplete findings of fact preclude us from resolving this case on the basis of his lawful exercise of these powers. <em>Cf. United States v. Campos, supra. </em>Nevertheless, a factfinding hearing is not required where an accused fails to aver sufficient facts necessary to constitute a legal claim. <em>See United States v. Ginn, </em>47 MJ 236, 246-47 (1997). Here, appellant avers that he was denied a member\u2019s clemency letter whose content is unknown except that it may contain inadmissible post-trial statements of a member concerning his prior deliberations in this ease. <em>See </em>Mil.R.Evid. 606(b), Manual, supra.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our view, there was no reasonable possibility that the general court-martial convening authority would have changed his action in this case on this basis. <em>See United States v.
