Haines, for money had and received. The plaintiff put in evidence two checks, drawn by him on a bank, payable to and endorsed by said John; and the defendant admitted that John received the amounts of the checks from the plaintiff\u2019s deposit in the bank. One check, dated June '28, 1880, was for $2,110.56, and the other, dated September 31, 1881, was for $560.47. A nonsuit was ordered, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>J.

Notes 84; <em>Fletcher v. Manning, </em>12 M. &amp; W. 570. \u201cA check presented and paid is no evidence of money lent or advanced by the banker to the customer. On the contrary, it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the repayment, to the amount of the check, by the banker to the customer, of money lodged previously in the banker\u2019s hands.\u201d Byles Bills 83; <em>Flemming\u2019s Ex'rs </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>18 Pa. St. 177 ; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>4 Pa. St. 469. Unless it is shown upon what consideration and under what circumstances a check is given, proof of its delivery and payment is not sufficient evidence of a debt. <em>Aubert </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>4 Taun. 298.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b135-6\">.Doe, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akn\">The plaintiff, having paid John $2,110.56 at one time, and $560.47 fifteen months afterward, produces no notes or other written evidence of John\u2019s express promises to repay those sums, and no evidence that there were such writings. The evidence introduced at the trial does not shift the burden of proof, and has no tendency to show it to be more probable that the payments were loans than that they were payments of debts, or parts of other transactions that would not include the receiver\u2019s obligation of repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-8\">Blodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
