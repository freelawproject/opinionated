Plea, a former adjudication of the subject-matter of the action by the Vermont county court for the county of Essex. A referee found that in 1882 this defendant commenced an action of assumpsit in the Essex county court against this plaintiff; that this plaintiff filed therein, by way of set-off, two items which involved the same matter for which he seeks to recover here, and that at the September term, 1883, judgment was rendered for this defendant on the ground of the statute of limitations alone.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-10\"><em>J. W. Bemick </em>and <em>Aldrich </em>Bemich, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-11\"><em>H. W.

Such a judgment, conclusive against the plaintiff\u2019s right of action in Vermont, where it was rendered, is conclusive everywhere when pleaded in a suit between the same parties and on the same cause of action. The fact that the judgment was rendered upon the plea of the statute of limitations alone does not make it any less conclusive in character. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was merged in the judgment by which its further prosecution is barred. <em>Sanderson </em>v. Peabody, 58 N.
