J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq8\">The first of the three suits is a bill in equity, in which the plaintiffs ask a decree against the validity of the contract by which they undertook to lease their road to the Lowell in 1884. In 1883 the legislature had given all the authority they could give for leasing the road upon certain conditions. \u201cAny railroad corporation may lease its road ... to any other railroad corporation upon such terms and for such time as may be .. . . agreed to by the directors, and as may be . . . approved by two thirds of all the votes cast on that subject by the stockholders. ... No competing railroads, now prohibited by law from leasing or uniting, shall have a right under the provisions of this act to . . . lease each other, unless said roads, or one of them, has heretofore leased or united with some other road or roads, for the purpose of forming a continuous line, or shall hereafter, or at the time of such lease . . . unite with \u2022or lease some other road for such purpose. . . . Railroad corporations created by the laws of other states, operating roads within this state, shall have the same rights for the purposes of . . . leasing . . . other roads as if created by the laws of this state.\u201d Laws 1883, <em>e. </em>100, ss. 17, 18. The first question is, whether the lease of the Montreal road to the Lowell company complied with all the terms prescribed by law as conditions of the state\u2019s assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">The lessees are a Massachusetts corporation. Were they \u201coperating\u201d a railroad in this state, within the meaning of <em>s. </em>18? In the literal and ordinary sense of the word, they were operating the Manchester &amp; Keene road. They and the Concord company had bought it. Each of the corporate purchasers had a deed of an undivided half. In a practical and equitable sense, they were joint proprietors of the road. The Lowell were operating it for themselves and the Concord. For many of the purposes of responsibility, the Lowell were proprietors <em>(State </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>58 N. H. 410) ; and if they were operating it legally, under a good title or valid contract, with the consent of the state and of all parties in interest, it is not material who had the profit and loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">The Manchester &amp; Keene company had mortgaged their road under authority given by <em>c. </em>142, Laws 1873. In 1881, an act (e. 232) had been passed, entitled \u201cAn act in relation to the foreclosure of the Manchester &amp; Keene Railroad.\u201d The legal mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ing of parts of this act is materially affected by the peculiar circumstances of disaster and danger far which the act shows the legislature intended to provide. The contemplated foreclosure indicated the bankruptcy of the Manchester <em>&amp; </em>Keene company, and their inability to perform their public duty of transportation in the district tlieir road was designed to accommodate. The third section of the act recognizes the need of powers of sale and purchase specially adapted to secure the completion and effective operation of the road. The legislature evidently understood there was reason to fear that whatever might be the prospect of a sale of some part or parts of the road, there would be difficulty in finding a purchaser willing to pay all the debts, and take the road with an obligation to complete, maintain, and operate the whole of it. The stipulation, that \u201cnothing in this act contained shall be construed to authorize the discontinuance of any portion of said road,\u201d reveals an apprehension that the authority given the trustees to sell it \u201c as a whole or in suitable parts,\u201d and the authority given the purchasers to sell \u201c the whole or any part thereof at private sale, if they think such sale best calculated to secure the effective operation of the whole road,\u201d might be construed as an assent to a discontinuance of some part that would not pay the expense of operation. While the bankruptcy of the corporation and the losses of the stockholders might be irretrievable, a sale under a prohibition of discontinuance might save something for the creditors without subjecting the public to the loss of any part of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The act discloses no purpose to withhold from nonresidents the privilege of bringing their money into this jurisdiction, and devoting it to public use in this unpromising enterprise. It contains no allusion to the subject of their laboring under a peculiar disability, and suggests no reason for shutting them out of this branch of the public service. It does not require the purchase to be made by a corporation, or by more than one person. Neither in express terms, nor by fair implication, does it require the purchaser to be a citizen of New Hampshire or of the United States. In the attempt to rescue the highway from extinction, it is not to be assumed that the legislature must have meant to deprive the public of the pecuniary aid and personal services that might be offered by strangers and foreigners. For all necessary and proper-purposes, the road and its purchasers and operators would be subject to New Hampshire law, and to the verdicts of New Hampshire juries in all courts, state and federal. There is in the act no intimation of a preference for the opinions of this court on questions of local law, or an intention to adopt an inability to remove a case to the federal court as a test of the right to be a purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Express consent is given to a purchase by \u201c any railroad company.\u201d Taken without qualification, this clause includes foreign as well as domestic railroad corporations. The words \u201c any rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>road company \u201d might be used in a connection and for a purpose that would show a restricted sense not including foreign companies. Here is no evidence of a purpose to exclude them ; and the general scope of the act, and the impending danger for which it attempted to provide the best available remedy, furnish abundant reason to believe the rejection of foreign aid was not intended. So much of the road \u201c as may be purchased by any railroad connecting therewith, either directly or through lines which it leases or operates, may thereupon be made a part of the railroad purchasing the same as aforesaid, the same as if it had been originally incorporated as a part of its railroad; and said railroad shall have all the rights, powers, and privileges necessary to carry this act into effect.\u201d How many connecting railroads are within this clause we need not inquire. It describes the Lowell as a company authorized to be a purchaser, so far as authority can be given by New Hampshire law. And without this clause, considering to what extent the Manchester &amp; Keene road must have been designed to be a means of communication between southern New Hampshire and Boston, and to what extent economy and public convenience would be consulted by its being run as a part of the Lowell, a legislative intent to exclude the Lowell and every other foreign company from the right of purchase could not be found without clear evidence of a discrimination so manifestly calculated to defeat the object of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Words literally importing the singular number may extend to several persons or things when such is their apparent meaning. By this rule of construction, the act authorizes several railroad companies to be joint purchasers of the whole or any part of the road. And this meaning is in the provision of s. 4 (amended by <em>c. </em>246, Laws 1883) giving a certain authority to \u201cthe railroad or railroads purchasing the said Manchester &amp; Keene Railroad, or any part thereof.\u201d \u201c The railroad or railroads \u201d making such purchase \u201c are authorized to issue bonds, secured by mortgage on their own road, ... or on the property purchased, or on both jointly.\u201d The legislature were content with giving all the needed authority they could give to invite bids from citizens and aliens, residents and non-residents, incorporated railway companies and unincorporated persons, and to induce them to save this road for public use, without undertaking to exclude any for want of foreign corporate power. The consent of another state was not made a condition of the consent of this state. The authority to make a mortgage and increase capital stock, which was given to those purchasers to whom New Hampshire could give it, included the assent of this state to a joint mortgage of this road and a foreign road of the purchasers. The Lowell company operated this road, with the consent of the state, under the act of 1881. If any stockholders of the Lowell were ever entitled to an injunction in this state, they apparently waived it by laches. The burden of proof has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>not been shifted from the plaintiffs to the defendants; and it does not appear that, at the date of the Montreal lease, the Lowell company could have been expelled by legal process from the Manchester &amp; Keene road. For all the purposes of this case, they were operating that road lawfully : and if an illegal operation would not be sufficient under <em>s. </em>18 of the act of 1888, nothing more than a legal one is made necessary by that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">If the lease was subject to the condition that the lessors or lessees should lease or unite with some other road for the purpose of forming a continuous line, the union of the Montreal and White Mountains roads was a compliance with the condition. That union is within the literal meaning of the requirement, and no ground has been suggested on which it can be held not to be within the legal meaning. The reason that induced the legislature to accept extension as compensation for loss of competition is not stated in the act, and none that can be fairly inferred is competent and sufficient evidence of any other condition than a union or lease for the purpose of forming a continuous line. The adequacy of the compensation is not submitted to the court, but is settled by the statute. The legislature have not stipulated that the region losing the benefit of competition shall receive the benefit of extension. In such public benefits there are no vested private rights that affect the construction of this act. If, upon an investigation of the facts, we should be of opinion that the compensation in this case is inadequate, or does not accrue to the territory losing the advantage of competition, or that in every possible lease there would be a compliance with the condition, such an opinion could not impose a qualification which the legislature have chosen to omit. There is probably no jurisdiction in which a legislative purpose is carried into effect by a more liberal mode of construction than that which prevails in this state. But the most liberal construction is nothing more than the ascertainment of that purpose from competent evidence. Here is no evidence of a condition at variance with, or in expansion of, the ordinary and natural meaning of a continuous line formed by a union or lease. This suit is an exercise of corporate power acquired by persons who bought a controlling amount of Montreal stock for the purpose of taking the road from the lessees and uniting it, by lease or otherwise, with the Concord. The evidence shows the Concord have been advised that the formation of a continuous line by the union of the Montreal and the Concord would legalize the union of the Concord and the Manchester &amp; Lawrence. This advice gave the legal construction of the proviso, which may have been designed for that or some other special case, without regard to its effect as a general clause applicable to other cases. If the design was to require something more than the formation of a continuous line by a lease or other union, the act does not show what other condition the legislature intended to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The road of the lessees need not adjoin that of the lessors. On this point, and in relation to the foreign authority of a foreign company, the act is silent. An intention to require contiguity of roads, or to make foreign authority a condition of New Hampshire\u2019s assent, is not proved by competent evidence. The validity of the lease is not disputed by stockholders of the Lowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The lease of the Montreal to the Lowell complied with all the terms prescribed by law as conditions of the state\u2019s assent. Neither the state, nor any Montreal stockholder who voted for the lease, can maintain a suit to set it aside. If all the stockholders had voted for it or assented to it, this bill would be dismissed because neither they nor the corporation could complain of their own act. If the lease had been contrary to public policy, that is, had been contrary .to the will of the state as a party in interest, and abatable at the suit of the state, there would have been a question whether a bill seasonably brought by the lessors could be sustained. But the lease is not contrary to public policy in the sense in which those terms are commonly used in this connection. If it is illegal, its illegality does not extend beyond its violation' of the partnership contract of the Montreal stockholders; and of that violation the objecting minority alone could complain. The lease being allowed and approved by the state, so far as legislative power can allow and approve it, nobody can object but a dissenting party in interest, or some one representing him and acting in his behalf, because nobody else is aggrieved. This is a private suit, in which no one has a right to be heard who is not interested in the decree. <em>Central Railroad Co. </em>v. Collins, 40 Ga. 582, 616. Neither the state, the corporation, the majority of the stockholders who voted for the lease, nor their assigns can contest the lease which they or their assignors made or authorized to be made. Whether the suit could be maintained if seasonably brought in the name of the corporation as a representative of the dissenting minority, we need not now inquire. The bill stands no better than it would if brought by that minority in their own. names as sole plaintiffs, after a refusal of the corporation to act for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">If the suit could be regarded as brought by or for the minority, it could not be maintained. The bill was filed April 22, 1887. It alleges that the lease, was approved by a vote of the stockholders June 12, 1884, and that it was executed June 19, 1884. When the minority had knowledge of the vote or the lease, they would waive their claim for equitable relief by not prosecuting it with equitable expedition. The suit was brought nearly three years after the lease was made.. During that time the lessees became extensively involved in obligations and liabilities incident to the business of running the leased road. The delay needs explanation, and none is given. It is said the minority supposed the question of the validity of a lease of another road would be settled in <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Northern R. R. </em>The supposition is irrelevant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>It does not account for their inaction. They may have hoped, or even expected, that if Dow prevailed against the Northern lease, the Montreal lease would be surrendered without suit. But it was not a hope or expectation of the result in the Northern case that induced them to refrain from litigation. It was for a very different reason that they did not resort to the law. A suit prosecuted in their name, by and for the benefit of others having no legal cause of action, would have been unavailing; and there is no presumption that they would have allowed themselves to be mere nominal plaintiffs. A suit prosecuted by themselves, in their own name or in any other name, for their own benefit and at their own expense, is a stop they have never intended to take. The agreement, in pursuance of which eighteen other persons bought stock of the majority for the purpose of controlling the corporation and contesting the lease, is dated May 20, 1886, nearly two years after the date of the lease. The defence of the partnership rights of the minority was not among the objects for which that purchase was made, and for which this suit was brought. Were it possible to treat the minority as plaintiffs in interest, it would remain impossible to find that the Northern case was the cause of this or any other suit not being brought by or for them at an early day. Assuming that the suit is theirs, they were bound to know that a delay of nearly three years would raise, in the equity jurisdiction, a question of laches that was not raised in the Northern case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The delay does not destroy the minority\u2019s cause of action, if they had one, but it affects the number of their remedies. If they have a grievance, they have a right of action at law against the. Montreal company for violation of their partnership contract. In such an action against the lessors, they can recover all the damages to which they are entitled. Their right to the additional redress of an injunction that would enforce specific performance of the partnership contract is a question of justice. <em>Eckstein </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>64 N. H. 248, 259. If they desired the cumulative remedy in equity, they should have done equity by applying for it promptly. The question is, not whether their delay comes within a technical rule of estoppel, but whether it was unreasonable. It was not equitable that they should leave the lessees exposed to the railway risks and controversies arising during two successive lawsuits. Reasonable diligence did not permit the Montreal minority to wait for the decision of the Northern case. They did not know that all the answers that would be made to this bill would be disposed of by that decision. More than one defence is set up here that was not presented in the Northern case; and the consequences of an unwarranted assumption that the defences would be the same in both cases cannot justly be put upon the lessees. As this action was not seasonably begun to contest the original validity of the lease, it is not necessary to exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ine the partnership contract of the Montreal stockholders to ascertain whether the lease is a violation of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Of the contract in regard to rent, the construction most unfavorable to the lessees is, that they are to pay a maximum sum, fixed in the contract, unless they show, in a prescribed manner, that a less sum is the result of a certain computation upon the gross receipts of the Northern and four other roads: but a minimum is also fixed below which the rent cannot be reduced. There has been no breach of the express covenant to pay rent, or the express ag'reement to render to the plaintiffs a statement of the gross receipts of the five roads, or tile express covenant that books and accounts relating to the business of the five roads shall be open to the plaintiffs\u2019 inspection. But the lease of the Northern and its branches to the defendants has been judicially annulled; and the plaintiffs contend that upon the validity and continuing existence of that lease the Montreal lease was made dependent. If the parties had intended this lease should terminate in case the Lowell voluntarily or involuntarily ceased to operate or control the Northern, their accidental failure to put that important part of their contract in the lease could have been cured in a suit for the reformation of the defective instrument. In the lease there is no express stipulation of that kind, and no evidence on which it can be found that such a condition (which would naturally be expressed in direct and distinct terms) was intentionally left to be implied from the mode in which the lessees are to ascertain and show the amount of rent to be paid if they seek to avoid the payment of the largest sum named in the contract. It is not a necessary or a reasonable inference that the inability of the lessees to prove their right to hold the road' on payment of a less sum would extinguish their right to hold it on payment of the maximum. If the writing is construed literally, the plaintiffs have no cause of complaint. They do not claim that they have received less rent than was due, or that the statement of the receipts of the five roads has not been rendered, or that \u201c all books and accounts kept by it (the Lowell corporation) relating to the operation of the demised premises and the business of the other roads herein named, so far as may be necessary and proper in determining the gross receipts whereby the amount to be paid as rent is to be ascertained\u201d have not been open to the plaintiffs' inspection. The letter of the written contract does not require that the defendants shall operate or control the Northern, or be able to render the statement without the consent of the operators of the Northern, or that any books or accounts not kept by the defendants shall be open to the plaintiffs\u2019 inspection. And upon the intention of the parties legally proved by the evidence contained in the lease, the plaintiffs have no stronger position than upon the letter of the document. There is no evidence and no reason to believe, that the statement of receipts and the opportunity to inspect books and accounts were to be given for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>any other purpose than to furnish means of information on the question of the amount of rent to be paid if the defendants should raise that question by not paying the maximum. Whether a strict interpretation is accepted without looking for the intention of the parties, or their words are weighed as evidence of what they meant, the result is the same. The lease of the Montreal was not made dependent upon the validity and continuing existence of the lease of the Northern.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">All concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The substance of the second bill (filed March 30,1888) is stated in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">[Answer of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, filed June 1, 1888.]</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">This defendant,' reserving to itself the benefit and advantage of any exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s bill, which can or might be taken by special or formal demurrer, or otherwise, for answer thereto saith as follows, to wit,\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">I.

D. 1887, and referring to the same as part of this answer, reiterates the denials and allegation therein contained; and in further answer to the bill of complaint of said plaintiff, against the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, filed in the said supreme court within and for the county of Merrimack in said state, March 80, 1888, to which it has become a party defendant by leave of court and by said agreement, it says,\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">1.

That in accordance with the provisions of said lease, this defendant took full possession and control of said leased railroad and property, including the Pemigewasset Yalley Railroad, and held, operated, and controlled the same in accordance with the agreements and covenants of said lease, not only from said 19th day of June, A.

This defendant further alleges, that it has greatly improved said property and added to the business done over said railroad, and by its expenditure of money has permanently improved said railroad and leased property, and that by its effort said property has become of much greater value and efficiency for the transportation of passengers and freight than it was before and at the time said lease was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">3. .This defendant further says, that it is true that on the 22d day of June, 1887, it executed to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad a lease of its railroad and property, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed, marked Exhibit B, and made a part of this answer; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>it alleges tliat said lease was authorized by law and by the votes o\u00ed the stockholders and directors of the parties thereto, and that in pursuance of said lease, on the 11th day of October, 1887, it transferred to the Boston <em>&amp; </em>Maine Railroad the possession of the railroad and property of which it was the absolute owner, and of which it had the legal right to transfer the possession, and of which the said Boston &amp; Maine Railroad had the legal right to take the possession. This defendant further alleges, that it did not and never has assigned or underlet or parted with the possession of the premises demised to it by the plaintiff by its lease of June 19, 1884, marked Exhibit A, either to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, or to any other corporation or person, and has not parted with the control thereof, but still possesses, operates, and controls the same in accordance with the provisions of said lease. It also alleges that at the time of said lease to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, and ever since, it reserved and still reserves and possesses sufficient rolling-stock, equipment, and other means with which to operate said railroad and property leased of the plaintiff as aforesaid, and it has retained under its direction a sufficient number of officers and employes to control and operate said demised railroad and property, in strict conformance with said lease of June 19, !884.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">4. This defendant denies the allegations in said bill of complaint relating to the motives and purposes of said lease to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad; it denies that said lease, or any clause or covenant thereof, was made for the purpose of allowing the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad to acquire;, against plaintiff\u2019s consent, the railroad mentioned in said plaintiff\u2019s lease marked Exhibit A, or to acquire any of plaintiff\u2019s property by \u201csubterfuge, equivocation, and quibble,\u201d as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s bill. It denies that said Boston &amp; Maine Railroad either threatens to hold, or is in fact holding, operating, or controlling, the railroads mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s lease marked Exhibit A, and in violation of said lease, and that this defendant has no interest in or to said leased property, or possession thereof, as alleged in said plaintiff\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">5. This defendant admits that it surrendered possession of the Northern, Concord &amp; Claremont, and Peterborough &amp; Hillsborough railroads, July 1, 1887, pursuant to a decree of the supreme court of the state of New Hampshire, but this defendant alleges that it has ascertained and paid to the plaintiff the full amount of rental provided for by said lease marked Exhibit A, and it alleges that the fixed charges of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad, named in said lease, Exhibit A, have, since the eleventh day of October, 1887, exceeded the earnings thereof, and that such excess has been paid for the plaintiff. It alleges that said Stony Brook and Wilton railroads are operated under contract between the Nashua &amp; Lowell Railroad corporation and said Wilton and Stony Brook companies respectively, dated May 6, 1872, May 28, 1860, and October 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>1868, and that if the Boston &amp; Maine operates said railroad or either of them, it does so as the attorney of said Nashua <em>&amp; </em>Lowell Railroad, and that such operation does not affect the rights of the plaintiff in any manner whatsoever, and it denies the allegations in relation thereto as set out in the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">6. This defendant denies, except as herein otherwise stated, each and every allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s bill as fully and particularly as if the same were herein set out and specifically denied, and especially it denies that there was any pretence, or suggestion, or fraud, or concealment in relation to the management of the several properties and railroads mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s bill,, or that the same were privately or clandestinely managed or controlled by the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad under the cover and in the name of the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad as therein alleged, or for the purpose therein set forth; it denies that at any time since October 11, 1887, or before that time during its existence, this defendant has ceased to exist as a manager of all railroad property, or that it has deprived itself of rolling-stock, equipment, and supplies necessary for the operation of a railroad; it denies that since the 11th day of October, 1887, it has received no money or income from any source for its own use, excepting its dividends and organization expenses, and that it has expended no money since said date for any purpose except that received from dividends and organization expenses, and that it cannot receive from any source money, cash, or income except from the treasury of the Boston <em>&amp; </em>Maine Railroad for the term of ninety-nine years, as alleged in said bill; it denies that it has turned over to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad its railroad and property of every kind and description, including the premises leased of the plaintiff, and has discharged and turned over to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, its officials and employ\u00e9s, excepting its president, directors, and treasurer, and has quit the business of operating railroads, as alleged in said.plaintiff\u2019s bill; it denies the allegations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s bill that there was any pretence in the operation of any of the railroads therein named, or that there was any purpose to deprive the plaintiff of its property and its rights, or to cheat the plaintiff,, the public, and the court, as alleged in said bill; it denies that this defendant .has ceased to be a corporation, that it is the pretended agent and servant of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, that it is a corporation without officers, employ\u00e9s, cash, or resources, that it is helpless to use its own name in this proceeding, except at the bidding of the Boston <em>&amp; </em>Maine Railroad, as is impertinently, arrogantly, and scandalously alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s bill, and alleges that such allegations are neither.pertinent nor proper in a proceeding of this character; it denies that there are any fictitious business machinery and methods adopted by it or the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad for the purpose of concealing the real possession of the railroad leased of the plaintiff, or that by false and deceitful methods of machinery the Boston &amp; Maine Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>road operated and possessed the plaintiff\u2019s railroad for one month or for any other time; and it denies that it ever consented or authorized any warning to be given to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad; as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s bill; it denies that its chief officials ever did give such warning; it denies that there were any deceitful and delusive methods of machinery ever invented or used for the operation and possession of the railroad leased of the plaintiff, as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s bill; it denies the allegations relating to the invention and construction of new machinery and methods relating to the operation of said railroads leased of the plaintiff, as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s bill, or that any officers were fictitiously appointed therefor, and alleges that due and proper measures have been taken to control and operate the roads leased of the plaintiff in accordance with the provisions of said lease, and that this defendant has taken especial care not to part with the possession and operation of said road, or permit any violation of the clause of said lease in relation thereto. And this defendant is not advised, and therefore denies the claimed admissions of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, as alleged in said bill; and alleges that if such admissions have been made, this defendant is in no way bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">This defendant admits that on the 18th day of November, 1887, the plaintiff entered upon the railroad described in the lease of June 19, 1884, claiming a breach of the covenant of said lease, that this defendant \u201c will not assign or underlet the premises hereby demised, or part with the possession thereof, except with the written consent of the first party (the plaintiff),\u201d for the purpose of determining the estate created by said lease, but it denies that by such entry the estate or rights of this defendant under said lease were determined and divested, and that notwithstanding such entry, the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, in violation of the covenants of said lease, unlawfully, and without right, retained possession of the railroads and railroad property named in said lease, and now unlawfully, and without right, holds the same as alleged in said bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">This defendant admits that on the 29th day of November, 1887, the plaintiff brought its suit at law against the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad for the recovery of a part of the railroad and property of the plaintiff named in Said lease, to wit, that part situated in the county of Merrimack in the state of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">7. This defendant specially denies that since taking possession of the plaintiff\u2019s road, named in the lease of June 19, 1884, it voluntarily deprived itself of the power to perform any of its covenants ; that it has permitted said railroad property to depreciate in its general condition so as to be unsafe or hazardous for the public to travel upon; that the bridges on said railroads have been improperly neglected, and permitted to become unsafe and imsuitable for the engines and cars doing the business over said railroad; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the ties and rails of said railroad have not been renewed and kept in repair according to the covenants of said lease and the demands of public travel and the business thereon; that the rolling-stock, equipment, engines, and cars used upon said railroad are insufficient for the business of said road, and are unsafe, and are in an unsuitable condition of repair; that every locomotive now in use on said road ought, in the proper management of said railroad, to be sent to the shop for repairs; that new locomotives and rails, other than those from time to time furnished, are an absolute necessity for said railroad; that the station-houses and buildings on said railroad are ruinously out of repair, and that two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or any sum of money over and above what this defendant is to furnish or cause to be furnished, is necessary to be expended on said railroads in renewals and repairs, in order to make the same suitable for doing the business thereof, and that the public safety and convenience, and the preservation of said railroad and property, demand any such expenditure as alleged in said bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">And this defendant alleges that said railroad and property is in no worse condition than what would be reasonably expected, regard being had to the condition of the road when leased and the rigorous nature of the winter just ended, and that this corporation is now making such repairs as are necessary for the reasonable improvement of said road and as are sufficient to make it safe and convenient for the accommodation of summer travel and business to be done over the same; and it further alleges, that since its lease of said railroad it has greatly improved the same ; that at the time of said lease said railroad was so out of repair as to be unsafe; that in many instances it has renewed bridges and relaid rails, put on new equipment and rolling-stock, and increased the efficiency of said road and the business thereon; it has repaired, painted, and improved the stations along the line of said road, and greatly added to the convenience of the public having occasion to use the same; and in these improvements it has expended a sum upward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, all of which has been received by the plaintiff corporation and its directors without objection or sign of dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">It denies that the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad has obtained possession of said railroad and property, named in the lease of the plaintiff, by trickery, fraud, or in any other manner, and that said road is permitted to waste and deteriorate from any cause, and that great and irreparable loss of property and business must result unless the relief prayed for is granted, as alleged in said bill.

No reason appears why the question of forfeiture should not be settled in the pending suit at law, or why it should be settled in chancery. <em>Walker </em>v. Walker, 63 N. H. 321, 328. The plaintiffs also ask the appointment of a receiver to take possession of the road and run it during litigation,, because of the alleged failure of the operators to keep it in suitable repair. If there were no responsible persons able and legally compellable to perform this duty, the road might be in such a ruinous and dangerous condition as to require a receiver. But the Lowell company are responsible persons, claiming to be the operators, acknowledging their duty, and compellable by process of law to do it upon their claim. It is not necessary in this case to inquire whether the Lowell or the Maine are the operators., And there is no occasion for the law to assume, through a receiver, the duty of repair which a responsible, company can be legally compelled to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">All concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In THE Suit at Law, Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad <em>v. </em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad and Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, the1 writ is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The State of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">[L.

That the property herein demised and to be accounted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>at the expiration or earlier termination of this lease may be accurately determined, there shah be made, as of the day when this lease takes effect, a full, complete, and particular inventory, description, and appraisal of all estate and property, real and personal, belonging to the lessor and coming into the possession of the lessee by virtue of this lease ; and to this, from time to time, shall be added such other estate and property as shall come into the possession of the lessee under the terms of this lease. Such inventory, description, and appraisal, and the additions thereto from time to time, shall be made by two competent persons \u2014 one selected by each party ; in case of their disagreement, they shall refer the matter in difference to some third person, whose decision shall be final.

Olney </em>(of Massachusetts), for the defendants. Any discussion of the question whether any provision of the plaintiff\u2019s lease to the Boston &amp; Lowell has been violated assumes as matter of course the original validity of that lease. That being assumed, the Boston &amp; Lowell, when it made its contract with the Boston &amp; Maine in June, 1887, was in this position. It owned and possessed its own peculiar franchises, together with all the real and personal property inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>dent and appurtenant to them.- It also held and possessed certain franchises and property originally conferred upon and belonging to the plaintiff corporation. It had not succeeded to all the plaintiff\u2019s franchises. The plaintiff, notwithstanding its lease, still continued in existence as a corporation, and had, among others, the right and power to receive its rental, and to dispose of the same accordingly as the claims of creditors or the interests of stockholders might require. In short, the plaintiff, after its \u2022 lease to the Lowell of 1884, retained all the rights and powers incident and appurtenant to its reversionary interest in the demised premises. On the other hand, after that contract, the Lowell, the lessee, was invested with every right and power essential to the due operation and maintenance of the plaintiff\u2019s road. For the term of the lease and subject to its conditions, the Lowell held all of the plaintiff\u2019s franchises essential to the operation of the plaintiff\u2019s road exactly as it held its own, \u2014 to be used, enjoyed, and \u25a0exercised exactly as if <em>it </em>instead of the plaintiff had been the original grantee of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Another thing to be noticed in this connection is the peculiar \u25a0character of the property originally belonging to the plaintiff, and by its contract of 1884 with the Lowell vested in the latter corporation, and by the latter corporation and the Maine still further dealt with in their contract of June, 1887. The essential subject matter of these several contracts was not land nor interests in lauds. It was not tangible personal property of any description. When the state creates a corporation for the accomplishment of certain public objects, when it endows that corporation with the faculty of holding property conditionally upon its application of that property to those public objects, the franchise granted by the state on the one hand, accepted by the corporation on the other, represents and comprises in itself everything of value that the corporation has. It may acquire real estate; it may acquire personal property of any sort. But property is valuable only as it can be used, and only as the holder is competent to use it for the purposes to which it is adapted. The franchise of a railroad corporation, therefore, constitutes its estate \u2014 is the principal thing to which all the lands and chattels necessary for its exercise are simply inseparable incidents. They are inseparable incidents: the real and personal property necessary to the exercise of a railroad franchise is inseparable from it because the corporation is bound to exercise the franchise, is bound to acquire the property requisite for its exercise, is bound to serve the franchise with that property, and is bound, therefore, not to alienate it. The law welds the franchise and the property essential to its use indissolubly together, the corporation holding the franchise for the execution of a public trust, and holding the property as the indispensable means of such execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The subject-matter of the contract of 1884 between tbe plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>and the Lowell, therefore \u2014 the demised premises \u2014 was the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise, which drew after it all the property essential to its use and enjoyment. So, the inquiry now being whether the Boston <em>&amp; </em>Lowell has aliened or in any way dispossessed itself of the demised premises, what is wanted is to ascertain what corporation has and is exercising the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise. If, as matter of law, that franchise remains to-day in the possession of the Boston &amp; Lowell, then there has been no breach of the-covenant in the plaintiff\u2019s lease against any alienation of the demised premises. It has been broken only if the Lowell has in some way divested itself of that franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">What is necessary in order that a quasi public corporation like-a railroad may divest itself of its essential franchises, \u2014 of the rights and powers given to it to be exercised in the promotion of certain public objects,- \u2014 and what is the nature of the process by which those rights and powers may become vested in a person or corporation other than the original grantee ? That a semi-public corporation, like a railroad, may part with its essential franchises, the one indispensable thing is the permission of the state. The state, and only the state conferring the franchises, is competent to authorize their surrender. Without such authorization they are wholly incommunicable. It follows, that when a railroad corporation, for instance, purports to sell or lease its essential franchises, it does-not in strictness transmit or grant anything in any event. If it proceeds without the consent of the state, its act is wholly futile and ineffectual. If it proceeds with the consent of the state, it is-the consent of the state, and that alone, which gives the act force and virtue. In other words, the consent of the state is the true-source of the purchaser\u2019s or lessee\u2019s title. Hence, in every such case the selling or lessor corporation, instead of itself transmitting or conveying anything', merely exercises a power of appointment by which the purchasing or lessee corporation gets the franchises directly from the state, and as if a new grant of them were at that moment made.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The exact question, then, before the court on this part of the record and as respects this claim of the plaintiff is, Has the Lowell exercised an authorized power of appointment of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise, and thereby substituted the appointee for itself in the use and enjoyment of that franchise? The appointee, if any, is of course the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. The plaintiff claims, in substance, that such appointment of the Boston &amp; Maine has been made by force of the Lowell and Maine contract of June,, 1887. I submit that on no admissible construction of that contract can that claim be maintained. In the first place, it is directly in the teeth of the language of the contract. As I have just observed, the grantee of a railroad franchise, by the act by which another person or corporation becomes invested with it, does not itself transmit or grant anything, but simply exercises- a power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>appointment. By the invariable usage in such cases, however, the formal instrument of appointment treats the power as property, and, the intent being incontestable, it operates on familiar principles as a good execution of the power. For instance, this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, though nothing but the exercise of a power of appointment so far as the Lowell\u2019s own franchises are concerned, purports to demise and let them just as in the common case of an ordinary lease of real or personal .estate. How is it under that contract with the plaintiff\u2019s franchises \u2014 which the Lowell held in addition to its own ? They are not appointed nor demised nor let by any language in the contract that is susceptible of that interpretation. On the contrary, the plaintiff\u2019s franchises, with those of all other roads which the Lowell could not part with without breach of contract, are expressly excepted from the things the Lowell does purport to convey. Still further, after being taken out of the category of things conveyed, the plaintiff\u2019s franchises, with those of all other roads similarly situated, are then separately dealt with in a special clause of the contract, by which it is explicitly declared that the Lowell shall retain them, and shall not divest itself of them until some future time when it can legitimately do so. Thus, the express language of the contract is absolutely opposed to the claim of the plaintiff that thereby the Lowell made any appointment or conveyance of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In the second place, the manifest intent of the parties antagonizes the plaintiff\u2019s claim in an equal degree. \u25a0 They realized in June, 1887, as fully and clearly as we do to-day, the precise situation. They knew that the Lowell held various railroad franchises which it could not part with without the consent of their original owners. They knew that that consent had not even been asked for, much less given. They knew that any assignment, or subletting, or alienation of any sort, of those franchises would cause serious trouble and mischief for all parties concerned. With that knowledge, the exact thing the parties to the contract meant to avoid, and must have meant to avoid, was any assignment, or alienation of any sort, of railroad franchises which the Lowell derived from other corporations and could not part with without their consent. The parties not only say so in the contract in express terms, but their interests and all the surrounding circumstances show that they could not have had any different purpose.' As respects, then, this claim that the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, amounts to an assignment or alienation of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise, two things are established, \u2014 first, that the express language of the contract is diametrically opposed to any such claim, and second, that the manifest intent of the parties is equally opposed to it. The plaintiff\u2019s contention can prevail, therefore, only in one contingency, \u2014 only if the parties have builded, perhaps not better, perhaps not worse, than they knew, but cer-</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tainly differently, and have done as matter of law what as matter of fact they meant to leave undone. The proposition of the plaintiff is, that notwithstanding the express terms of the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, in its application to the plaintiff\u2019s road, and notwithstanding the undeniable intent of the parties to it, that contract does amount to an assignment or alienation to the Maine of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise. The plaintiff assumes that the contract is and can be nothing else than an assignment, or subletting, or transfer of possession of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise, \u2014 than an alienation of it of some sort; and that the Lowell and the Maine cannot enter into such relations respecting the plaintiff\u2019s road as the contract calls for without an alienation of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise within the prohibition of the covenants of the plaintiff\u2019s lease. I submit that that position is an entire mistake. The statute law of New Hampshire, section 17, chapter 100, Laws of 1888, enacts that \u201cTwo or more railroad corporations may contract that either corporation shall perform all the transportation of persons and freight upon and over the road of the other.\u201d Thus, the statutes of New Hampshire expressly authorize one railroad corporation to do all another\u2019s transportation work as the latter\u2019s servant and agent, and without dispossessing the latter of its essential franchises and property. And this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, in its application to the plaintiff\u2019s railroad, sets on foot, I submit, an arrangement of precisely that sort, and neither in legal effect nor practical execution constitutes any alienation of the demised premises within the prohibition of the plaintiff\u2019s lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Let us consider the several ways in which the statutes of New Hampshire authorize a New Hampshire railroad corporation to deal with its railroad franchise, to which, as I have already argued, is inseparably attached all its essential railroad property. In the first place, it may dispose of its franchise and discharge itself of all duty thereunder forever by a union or consolidation with another railroad company. In the second place, it may dispose of its franchise and discharge itself of any duty thereunder for a term of years by a lease, the lessee becoming the owner of the franchise <em>pro Jiae vice. </em>In the third place, it may retain and itself exercise the franchise through the instrumentality of natural persons. In the fourth place, it may retain and itself exercise the franchise through the instrumentality of another railroad corporation .contracted with for that purpose. A distinct statute of New Hampshire also provides that one railroad may contract with another for the use of the latter\u2019s road. But that statute, I take it, is immaterial in this connection, because, as I understand the construction put upon it by this court, the effect simply is to permit the joint use by two railroad corporations, each with its own motive power and cars, of a railroad belonging to one of them. This construction would seem to be a necessary one, because a contract by one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>railroad corporation with another for the exclusive use of another\u2019s road could not be anything but a lease. These being the several ways in which a New Hampshire railroad corporation may deal with its essential railroad franchises and the railroad property inseparably appurtenant to them, to which of them did the parties resort in this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, as it relates to the plaintiff\u2019s road? There was not, of course, any attempt at consolidation of roads. There was not any attempt to provide for the joint use of one railroad by the respective engines and cars of two companies. But the conti\u2019act made a change of some sort. , Before the contract, the Lowell had worked the plaintiff\u2019s road in the ordinary manner, and the Maine had no relations to the road or its working of any sort. After the contract, the Maine just as certainly had such relations of some sort. What was their nature ? They might have been those of assignee or alienee under the plaintiff\u2019s lease of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchises and the property incident thereto, which is what the plaintiff claims they were and are. On the other hand, they might be simply those of a contractor to perform all the transportation of persons and property upon and over the plaintiff\u2019s road. And, as the most reasonable and the true construction of the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, in its application to the plaintiff\u2019s road, I submit, that under it the Lowell passed no estate whatever in the plaintiff\u2019s road or franchise, either permanently or temporarily, but simply constituted an agency whereby the Maine undertook the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road, or, to use the language of the statute more nearly, contracted for all the transportation of persons and freight upon and over the plaintiff\u2019s road. The difference between the two theories is for present purposes vital. On the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the nature and operation of the contract of June, 1887, as regards the plaintiff\u2019s road, there was of course an alienation of the demised premises, a change of possession of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise whereby it became vested in the Maine either as assignee, alienee, or tenant of some sort. On the other hand, on the defendants\u2019 theory of the nature and operation of that contract as applied to the plaintiff\u2019s road, the demised premises, to wit, the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise with its appurtenant property, did not change hands at all. It remained in the undisturbed possession of the Lowell, \u2014 the only relation assumed to-the plaintiff\u2019s road by the Boston &amp; Maine being that of contractor to work the plaintiff\u2019s road in the name of the Lowell and under its franchise, and as its servant and agent. If that be the true construction of the Lowell and Maine contract of June, \u00cd887,\u2014 and I,shall presently consider whether it be or not, \u2014 then the practical execution of the contract by the parties, that is, the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road by the Maine, is not an alienation of the demised premises within the prohibition of the plaintiff\u2019s lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">A corporation must act' through agents. But that necessity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>its being does not operate to deprive it of tbe legal possession of its franchises and property. A corporation ordinarily carries on its business through the instrumentality of natural persons. But if it can find artificial persons or corporations legally and practically qualified for tbe work, there is no reason why it should not employ them, nor, if it does, why such emplo3rment should operate to divest it of its corporate estate. A railroad company is usually chartered to build as well as to run a railroad, and very commonly exercises its franchise to build <em>by </em>putting out its whole road under contract to one man. The practice is of unquestionable validity, and never has -been considered and cannot be considered as any abandonment or alienation by a railroad company of one of its most important franchises. It would no more be such abandonment or alienation, of course, if the railroad company\u2019s contract for the building of its road, instead of being with one individual, were with a corporation \u2014 a construction company, for instance. But if a railroad company may exercise its building franchise through a single contract with one individual without any abandonment or alienation of the franchise, on the same ground it may execute its operating franchise in the same manner and also without any abandonment or alienation of the franchise. Without pausing upon that point, however \u2014 railroad operating companies are just as conceivable as railroad construction companies, and if by general or special laws the state of New Hampshire were to charter companies for the solo purpose of working railroads for their owners, it would not be disputed that any railroad corporation might avail itself of such an instrumentality, and carry on its business through it without thereby evicting itself from its railroad franchise and property. It may be well also to observe in this connection that it is entirely immaterial, so far as the point now under consideration is concerned, that a railroad company\u2019s contracts with its employes are usually for short periods of time. If that were not so, \u2014 if all its contracts with every one of them, from general manager to crossing-tender, were on twenty or thirty years\u2019 time, \u2014 the railroad company\u2019s possessory right and title in its plant and franchise would be wholly unaffected, and would be the same as they ordinarily are. It being plain, then, as I think it is, that a railroad corporation, like every other, must act through agents; that it may employ as such agents either natural persons or corporations legally qualified to act as such; that it may do its business through one contract with a general agent or through many contracts with many special agents; that its contract or contracts with either class of agents may be of long or of short duration, at its discretion,\u2014 these things being plain, as I think they are, it is equally plain that in all such cases and in every such case the railroad company\u2019s legal possession of its road and franchise remains intact, the indisputable rule of law applying, that, whatever may be the rights of the principal and agent <em>inter sese, </em>as against all the world, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>agent\u2019s possession is always and for all purposes the principal\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\">It has not been adjudicated in New Hampshire, I suppose, that it is competent for a railroad to put out all its operating work under contract to one man. Neither, I suppose, have the laws of New Hampshire, by special enactments or general laws, authorized the formation of companies for the sole purpose of working railroads for their owners. But very early in the history of the railroad legislation of the state it was enacted that two railroad companies might contract that one should do all the other\u2019s work. A statute to that effect was continuously in force from 1842 to 1867, when it was either purposely or inadvertently omitted from a revision or compilation of the public laws at that time made. The provision, however, reappears in 1883 in the Colby act, so called. It forms the first part of section 17 of that act. It immediately precedes the grant of the railroad leasing power, and is obviously regarded' as conferring a power of a wholly different character. Indeed, it has always been so treated in the legislation of New Hampshire, \u2014 the power of two railroad corporations to contract that one may do the other\u2019s entire transportation service being powers separately granted by distinct enactments, and existing side by side as distinct powers, during the whole or nearly the whole of the period from 1842 to 1867. In the act of 1883 the difference between the &gt;two powers is even more emphatically marked, since a contract of lease requires the approval of stockholders, while a contract by one road to work another <em>may </em>be made by directors only. What the legal difference is between the two powers so distinct in legislative contemplation is manifest, and cannot be mistaken. A lease, <em>ex vi </em>termini, implies possession, \u2014 a change of possession from the general owner to a tenant. As applied to a transaction between railroads, it means that the lessor\u2019s essential railroad franchise becomes vested in the lessee, to be used and exercised by it exactly as if it were the original grantee of the franchise. Because a lease between railroads is of this character, because it involves a transfer of the lessor\u2019s essential railroad franchise, the approval of stockholders is necessary. \u2018 Indeed, if I understand the doctrine of this court, a lease between railroads involves so vital a change in the purposes of the lessor\u2019s incorporation that nothing less than the assent of all the stockholders can give it validity. While this is the natur\u00e9 and effect of a contract of lease, a contract between railroads by which one is to work another is of a wholly different character. Such a working contract is not inconsistent with the purposes of the employing company\u2019s charter, and involves no breach of the original compact between stockholders. It simply selects one out of various legitimate means for accomplishing the objects of such charter and such compact. It does not operate as a transfer of the employing company\u2019s essential franchise, but simply secures an' agent through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>whom the franchise is to be executed. The virtue of the enabling statute does not consist in its authorizing one railroad company to do its work through an agent. It cannot do its work in any other way. What the statute does is to qualify another railroad corporation as such agent. A railroad corporation is, of course, competent to work its own road. But to enable it to work the road of another corporation as the latter\u2019s agent requires express statutory authorization. If, however, the authority is granted, any railroad company employed under it is an agent just like any other, and is nothing else. That is to say, it runs the road in the employer\u2019s right and under the employer\u2019s franchise, and its possession is the employer\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The defendant\u2019s position, then, as respects the alienation claim of the plaintiff, is, that the true inquiry is what corporation has a,nd is exercising the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise; that the Lowell could not exercise it except through an agent or agents of some sort, and might employ for that purpose any persons or corporations qualified by law to act as such agents; that the statutes of New Hampshire expressly qualify one railroad corporation to do another\u2019s entire transportation service as the agent of the latter; and that if by this Maine and Lowell contract of June, 1887, as applied to the plaintiff\u2019s road, nothing more is done than to make the Maine the Lowell\u2019s agent for the performance of the transportation service of the plaintiff\u2019s road, then the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise, with all the railroad property inseparably appurtenant thereto, has always remained and now remains in the possession of the Lowell, has not been parted with, and there has been no breach of the alienation covenant of the plaintiff\u2019s lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It remains to consider the true character and construction of this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, in its application to the plaintiff\u2019s road. The plaintiff interprets it as constituting an assignment or alienation of the plaintiff\u2019s essential railroad franchise with the property inseparably annexed to it. That interpretation is one which I submit cannot possibly be maintained. The manifest intent of the parties is direetty opposed to it. We know that it is so, and must be so, both because they say so in express terms in the contract itself, and because their mutual interests, as they obviously well knew, would be greatly prejudiced by any assignment or alienation of the plaintiff\u2019s franchise which did not have the plaintiff\u2019s previous consent in writing. But the ai\u2019gument from the parties\u2019 intent does not stop at showing what they did not want and what they meant to avoid. When their entire environment is considered, it is plain, I submit, what they did want and what they meant to accomplish. The statute enabling one railroad corporation to hire another to do its, work was obviously founded largely on economical considerations. \u2022 It was thought that a,large corporation, with plant and capital to correspond \u2014 a wholesale dealer in transportation \u2014 could do the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of a small corporation with small capital and equipment \u2014 a retail dealer, that is \u2014 at a great saving of expense, to the mutual benefit of the parties and to the advantage of the public. Now, at the time this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, was made, and by force of that contract, the Lowell was giving up the greater part of its railroad business, but could not give up the plaintiff\u2019s road on account of this covenant against alienation in the plaintiff\u2019s lease. Being obliged to run the road temporarily, and an express statute authorizing it to get the work done by another railroad corporation as agent, it would naturally avail itself of the statute, and resort to such agency because thereby it could run the road to the best advantage, most inexpensively in its own interest, and most efficiently as regards the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We come to the examination of the terms of the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, with very definite knowledge of the parties\u2019 intentions. We know what they did not want and why, and we know what they did want and why. The provisions of the contract conform to and cany out the parties\u2019 intentions as thus ascertained and explained. It is declared, in the first place, that the plaintiff\u2019s road shall be operated in all respects under the direction of the Boston &amp; Maine. That makes the Maine the agent to work the road \u2014 the operating power and instrumentality beyond all peradventure. I need not dwell upon that point; there is no excuse for my dwelling upon it, because, incredible as it may seem, it is a matter upon which my friends on the other side and myself are substantially agreed; and when a unique proposition of that sort is by some miracle discovered, I take it that the court will be only too glad to regard it as finally settled, and to hear nothing more about it. In the next place, the contract compensates the agent for its services in working the road by giving it any profit of the business, \u2014 the provision being that the agent shall have all the gross receipts of the road upon condition of its discharging all its principal\u2019s liabilities on account of it. It will be said that the proposition that the contract makes the Maine the agent of the Lowell to work the road is inconsistent with the language, \u2014 that the Lowell shall remain in possession and itself operate the road. But, in the third place, that language is to be taken in connection with the other language, \u2014 that the plaintiff\u2019s road shall be operated under the direction of the Maine in all respects; and so construed, it is conclusive upon the point that the Lowell did not undertake to assign or in any way alienate the plaintiff\u2019s essential railroad franchise, but simply constituted the Maine, being expressly qualified therefor by statute, its agent to work the road under contract. In that view, of course, the Lowell does continue in the operation of the road, and does continue to be responsible for the operation of the road both to the state and to.all customers of the road, and is the only party known to either in connection with such operation. The business of the road is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>as it ought to be, carried on in its name, in its right, and under its franchises. And the only change which the contract makes in the conduct of the business is to put one lawful agent in the place of another, is to substitute for the instrumentality of natural persons that of another railroad corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">It will be said that on the theory 1 am urging there is no substantial difference in practical results between a working contract between two railroad companies and a contract of lease, and that the Maine is to-day in substantially the same position as if it were assignee, sublessee, or alienee of some sort under the plaintiff\u2019s lease. But that is not so at all. In the first place, if a lease is authorized, the lessee does not become in any way or sense the lessor\u2019s agent. It enters into direct relations with the state and with all parties using the road. The lessor\u2019s essential railroad franchise becomes vested in it, to be used and enjoyed as if it were the original grantee of the franchise. The same thing is true of an assignee or sublessee under a valid lease, if the assignment or subletting be authorized. On the contrary, the status is exactly the reverse, if all that the railroad corporation does is to hire another corporation to do its work. In that case no franchise is divested or vested anew, but the employing company\u2019s railroad franchise remains in its possession, and it alone is responsible for its exercise. For example: Under this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, construed as I think it must be, the Lowell and not the Maine is responsible alike to the state and to private parties interested both for the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road and for the manner in which it is worked. Again: It is not true that a railroad company working the road of another as agent has all the same rights, powers, and privileges as a lessee of the road, or as an assignee or sublessee under a valid lease. A genuine working contract \u2014 a contract by one road to work another \u2014 does not give the agent the power to extend the road, to build branches to it, to hire or operate other roads, to acquire land or other property for it, or to use the principal\u2019s power of eminent domain for any purpose. Under this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, for instance, does the Maine get any power to have the plaintiff\u2019s road extended, to have branches built to it, to hire or operate other roads in connection with it, to acquire property for it, or to put in motion the plaintiff\u2019s power of eminent domain ? It is clear that it does not. All it gets is the right to run the road as agent, to run the road as existing at the time of the contract; all the other powers, privileges, and franchises coming to the Lowell under the plaintiff\u2019s lease still remain in the Lowell, to be exercised, used, and enjoyed by it alone. On the other hand, in the case of a valid lease, or authorized assignment or subletting under a valid lease, the lessor\u2019s entire railroad franchise passes. It is indivisible in its nature, and the lessee or assignee or sublessee is entitled to every right and power essential to the enjoyment of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>franchise. In what name the franchise shall be exercised is sometimes made a question, as, for instance, whether needed railroad property shall be taken in the name of the lessor of a railroad or in the name of the- lessee. The suggestion that the lessor\u2019s name shall be used is founded upon its reversionary interest in the demised premises; whereas, it is entirely clear that the only taking for which an immediate public exigency can be vouched is a taking by the. lessee. But what name shall be used in such case is a matter of form and not of substance, is a technical rather than a real question. That the practical power, discretion, and authority in the matter is in the lessee, it being the party holding the franchise with the assent of the state and responsible for its exercise, is not and can not be seriously controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It may be objected to the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, regarded as a working contract, that it does not refer in terms to the agent\u2019s compensation for services, and does not in terms declare what that compensation shall be. But the substance of the contract, and its necessary operation and effect, are to be considered. The Lowell held the plaintiff\u2019s railroad plant and franchise under a contract which required the business to be carried on, and required certain expenditures to be made on the road and in the interest of creditors and for the benefit of stockholders. Under the contract the Maine undertakes the business for the business, \u2014 for. any profit there may be in it after all its principal\u2019s expenditures on account of the road have been satisfied. That is one mode, certainly, of compensating the Maine for services as working agent, \u2014 whether wise or not wise in point of fact for either or both parties is now immaterial. The only question here is, whether it is a mode of ascertaining and paying the agent\u2019s compensation which the statute authorizes. To that, I submit, there can be but one answer. The working contract any two railroad corporations may make is, as respects form and terms and the mutual considerations enuring to the parties, wholly unlimited. The statutory power is of the most comprehensive character. If the discretion of the two contracting corporations be exercised in good faith, it is absolute and final.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">It may be suggested that this Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, in its application to the plaintiff\u2019s road, has the character of a lease rather than of a working contract in respect to the time it may last; that no limit of time is set; that it may go on forever, or, at least, for the entire balance of the term of the plaintiff\u2019s lease, to the Lowell. Well, if that be the true construction of the contract, it does not lead to the conclusion suggested,, and it does not tend to show that, the contract is not a genuine working contract. The statute puts no limit to the duration of such a contract. It leaves the period it is to run to be determined wholly by the two contracting corporations, and, if they choose to make that term as long as the term for which railroad leases are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>generally made, it is perfectly competent for them to do so. But I by no means agree that the construction of the contract suggested is the true one. On the other hand, I submit that the contract was not meant to be, and is not to be regarded as, of a lasting or permanent character. The Lowell undertook to lease and make present delivery of its railroad property, so far as it could do so without breach of contract. As to property of which it could not make present delivery, it undertook to make \u201creasonable efforts to deliver\u201d \u2014 I cite the exact language of the contract' \u2014 - and actually to. deliver as soon as practicable. Meanwhile, as respects the property it could not at once deliver, and which it was to make reasonable efforts to deliver, the Lowell and Maine made an arrangement to work it. But \u201creasonable efforts\u201d means reasonable in point of time as well as in all other respects. Consequently, the Lowell and Maine arrangement for the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road was meant to endure only so long as might be necessary to enable such reasonable efforts to be made. It was an <em>ad interim, </em>a provisional arrangement, to continue in force pending reasonable efforts to deliver the road under an assignment of the lease. And, although the contract does not itself fix any definite time within which the reasonable efforts are to be made and concluded, the law supplements the contract in that respect and makes the time such reasonable time as under all the circumstances of the case may be adjudged just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">It may bo said, finally, that the Maine\u2019s working the plaintiff\u2019s road as agent is within the mischief of the alienation clause of the plaintiff\u2019s lease; that the plaintiff suffers the-same injury as if the Maine were in possession under an assignment or subletting under the plaintiff\u2019s lease. But it is to be remembered, in the first place, that these anti-alienation covenants of leases are not favored in law, but are to be construed with the utmost strictness. The covenant must be broken in its exact and literal significance, or it will not be held to be broken at all. But, in the second place, it is not true that the Maine\u2019s working of the plaintiff\u2019s road as agent for the Lowell is the same thing or means the same thing to the plaintiff as if the Maine were in possession as assignee or sub-lessee under the plaintiff\u2019s lease. It is not the same thing to the plaintiff, and it does not mean the same thing, for the reasons already stated, because the Maine, working the plaintiff\u2019s road as agent for the Lowell, merely runs the road as it is, whereas, if the Maine were in possession under a valid assignment or subletting under the plaintiff\u2019s lease, it would be subrogated to the lessor\u2019s essential railroad franchise, including the power to extend the plaintiff\u2019s road, to build branches to it, and to acquire property for it by purchase, or to condemn it by the power of eminent domain. But there is still another, and, I submit, a conclusive answer to the suggestion that the Maine\u2019s agency for the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road is within the mischief of the alienation clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s lease, and is something meant to be prohibited by it. On the contrary, such agency is something that the plaintiff must be held to have contemplated, and to have intended to permit and sanction, from the very outset. The statute by which one railroad company may hire another to do its work was in force at the time the plaintiff made its lease to the Lowell in 1884. The plaintiff knew at that time, therefore, that the Lowell might lawfully work its road by employing the Maine or any other railroad corporation to do all the transportation service of the plaintiff\u2019s road. Knowing that, if the plaintiff meant to limit the Lowell in the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road to any one kind of agent, if it meant to prohibit the employment of another railroad corporation for that purpose, it was bound to say so and to have its intention expressed in the instrument of lease in unequivocal terms. But there is nothing whatever in the contract on the subject. The inevitable result, therefore, is, that the plaintiff must be held to have authorized the Lowell to work the plaintiff\u2019s road by any agent legally competent to do it. And, as the law then made and now makes the Maine or any other railroad corporation a competent agent to work the plaintiff\u2019s road, it follows that, instead of the plaintiff\u2019s having any right to complain that the Maine is working its road as agent of the Lowell, in truth and in fact it consented to exactly that thing being done when it executed the contract of lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">This contract of June, 1887, between the Lowell and the Maine, is one in form but two in substance; that is, it deals with two distinct subject-matters by two distinct sets of provisions. Undoubtedly the form might have been different: the separate contracts might have been embodied in separate instruments, one dealing with the railroad property of which the Lowell could dispossess itself without' brea.ch of contract, and the other dealing with the railroad property of which it could not so dispossess itself. If the two contracts had been put into two instruments, perhaps the vital difference between the two contracts would have been more marked and more apparent to persons not familiar with legal principles and the legal rules governing the interpretation of writings. But to lawyers and to a court, the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, embodies two distinct contracts respecting two distinct subject-matters, with a certainty and clearness which would not be increased in the remotest degree if two indentures had been used instead of one, each applicable solely to one of the two distinct subject-matters. My business at the present moment is with the last named of these two contracts, \u2014 with that contract between the Lowell and the Maine which was meant to relate to such railroad property as the Lowell could not dispossess itself of without the assent of the original owner. Three views of that contract are possible in its application to the plaintiff\u2019s road. One is, that it contemplated and effected an assignment or alienation of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tiff\u2019s essential railroad franchise and the property incident thereto from the Lowell to the Maine. But the court cannot adopt that construction except upon some compulsion the grounds of which are not obvious, because it directly conflicts with the express terms of the contract, confounds the distinction between its two subject-matters which the contract everywhere makes, and totally defeats the unmistakable intent of the parties. The second view is, that under this contract the Lowell gives the Maine influence over the operation of the plaintiff\u2019s road, for which the Maine pays by guaranteeing the Lowell against any loss from such operation, the actual possession and operation remaining all the time in the Lowell. To that it is a possible objection that that precise kind of contract is novel, may not be within the general powers of the two contracting corporations, and is not specially authorized by any statute. If that should turn out to be so, still, while any influence proven to have been exercised by the Maine might be held to be illegitimate, the Lowell would, nevertheless, be left in the undisturbed possession of the plaintiff\u2019s road and franchise, and there would be no breach of the covenant against alienation of the demised premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The third view, which I have been urging, is not open to the objections to which the other views stated are liable. It does not conflict with the language of the contract, nor defeat the plain purpose of the parties, nor make their mutual stipulations <em>ultra vires. </em>On the other hand, it accords with the words the parties have used, carries out their manifest purposes, and makes the contract one for which special statutory authority can be vouched. In this view, too, the contract is found to be exactly such a one as the parties would naturally and probably make under the circumstances of the situation in which they were placed. On the one hand, the Lowell could not at once deliver the plaintiff\u2019s road, but had bound itself to make reasonable efforts to deliver and actually to deliver the road as soon as it could lawfully do so. On the other hand, the Lowell was going out of active railroad business generally, and, pending its reasonable efforts to deliver possession of the plaintiff\u2019s road, it could not work it in the ordinary way except at great disadvantage. But one alternative mode of working it in this interval was open, and that was by contracting with and employing some other railroad corporation to do the work. That railroad corporation need not have been the Boston &amp; Maine. But, on the other hand, there was no objection to its being the Boston &amp; Maine : it would naturally be the Boston &amp; Maine, and as the Boston &amp; Maine was under obligation to accept the road when the Lowell could deliver it under an assignment of the plaintiff\u2019s lease, the Maine might properly insist that the <em>ad interim </em>working of the road should not be in strange or unfriendly hands, nor in any other hands than its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We have, then, two principal purposes of this contract definitely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>established, \u2014 first, that the Lowell should in no way alienate the plaintiff\u2019s property and franchise; and second, that pending the reasonable time in which the Lowell should make efforts to deliver the property under an assignment of the lease, the Mainejshould work the road, which working, as the Maine could legitimately do it only in one capacity, namely, as the agent of the Lowell, the parties are to be presumed to have intended should be done hy it in that capacity and no other. To these two chief purposes of the contract its substantial provisions correspond and conform. They are exactly what they might have been expected to be under the circumstances. It is difficult to see how they could be different. For example: As to the mode of operation of the plaintiff\u2019s road, the parties had no discretion, the Lowell being bound to work it according to the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s lease, and being wholly incapable of authorizing the Maine to work it in any other way. So, as to the agent\u2019s compensation for services: Circumstances are conceivable in which a railroad corporation would not work a road merely for the profit it could get out of it, and in which, on the other hand, the owner of a railroad would not consent to let another railroad corporation work it merely upon being indemnified against loss. But under the actual circumstances of the then existing situation, it is perfectly plain that the Lowell could not reasonably be expected to let another railroad corporation work the plaintiff\u2019s road except under a contract which secured it against loss, because the mode of operation might be the very thing which would cause the loss. . On the other hand, the Maine could not reasonably be expected to do any more than indemnify the Lowell against loss on account of the plaintiff\u2019s road, because the operation of that road was not necessarily profitable, and had not been uniformly profitable in the past. Hence, the contract contains exactly such a bargain as the parties might be expected to make in the circumstances in which they were placed \u2014 a bar\u2022gain by which the Lowell on its part was content with immunity against loss on account of the plaintiff\u2019s road, and by which the Maine on its part was content to accept for services a compensation measured by the profit it might be able to make the business yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">As for the language of the contract, I readily agree that it was not necessary formally to declare that the Lowell should remain in possession of the road and should operate it. Its hiring of the Maine to do the work of the plaintiff\u2019s road would not have dispossessed the Lowell of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad property and franchise, even if that language had not been used. But the terms employed, even if objectionable as surplusage, are not otherwise harmful. They do exclude most emphatically all idea of any attempted assignment or alienation of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad franchise by the Lowell to the Maine. They do not exclude, but, on the other hand, are entirely consistent with, the purpose of the Lowell to make the Maine its agent to work the plaintiff\u2019s road under con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tract as specially authorized by statute. On these grounds, and because the contract as thus interpreted does not violate any law or any other contract, but is seen to be exactly such a contract as. the parties, in their then situation, would naturally and probably make, the defendants confidently ask the judgment of the court upon this part of their defence. It need not be denied that the contract offers opportunities for verbal criticism; that specious, and superficial reasoning, sticking-in the bark, dealing with words- and phrases, and ignoring the purpose of the parties, may seem to make the contract of difficult or of doubtful interpretation. But it is the province of the court to construe contracts according to the spirit that makes alive, rather than according to the letter which kills ; to give to their provisions such meaning and effect as, consistently with the language employed and when viewed in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, the parties meant they should have. The defendants ask for nothing more than that this contract be so interpreted and so dealt with; and if it is, they cannot bring themselves to have any fear of the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">It is argued that under the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, as applied to the plaintiff\u2019s road, the Lowell is agent of the Maine, and not the Maine of the Lowell. As the Maine gets all discretion, choice, and authority as to the working of the plaintiff\u2019s, road, and, moreover, takes all the receipts of the road and pays all the Lowell\u2019s bills on account of it, the argument is, that instead of being agent, it is really a substituted principal. But the relation of principal and agent is determined not by the extent, but by the source, of the powers exercised. A delegated authority may be coextensive with the principal\u2019s entire authority. An attorney under the most general power is none the less the agent of his constituent, than an attorney under a special power. A man, as agent, may have all the power over another\u2019s property or business, that he could have if the property or business were his own. What makes him agent, and not principal, is, that he acts in another\u2019s right, and properly in another\u2019s name; that he is liable to account; and that his power will, sooner or later, terminate. The same tests which determine the existence of the relation of principal and agent as between individuals, determine it as between corporations. The Maine is simply agent in the working of the plaintiff's road, if the powers it exercises to that end belong not to it, but to the Lowell; if it is bound to exercise them in the Lowell\u2019s name and subject to the latter\u2019s right to call it to account;, and if it must, sooner or later, cease such exercise. Further, the Maine is none the less an agent to work the plaintiff\u2019s road because its compensation is dependent upon the results of the business \u2014 because the Lowell is to turn over to it all the receipts of the business on the one hand, and it is to discharge all the Lowell\u2019s liabilities on account of the business on the other. It is exactly such a case as if A, the owner of a factory, were to hire B-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>to carry on the business, and, by way of compensating B for services, were to agree that B should have the whole or a part of the profits of the business, provided, on the other hand, he would guarantee A against losses. The principle is now settled by a great number of decisions, that under such a contract B, notwithstanding he bear the profit and loss, does not become a partner or principal in the business, but is simply an agent, whose compensation for services is regulated by the results of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It is argued that on the defendants\u2019 interpretation the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, in its application to the plaintiff\u2019s road, operates like a lease, or an assignment or subletting under a lease, and vests in the Maine the same possession of the plaintiff\u2019s road and franchise as if it were in possession as such lessee or assignee or sublessee. That, under the contract construed as the defendants say it should be, the Maine gets a sort of possession \u2014 a possession enabling it to work the plaintiff\u2019s road as the Lowell\u2019s servant and agent \u2014 is not denied. But that such possession is legally the Lowell\u2019s possession, and not distinct from nor independent of it \u2014that it is something radically different, both in rights and responsibilities, from the possession acquired by a lessee or a lessee\u2019s assignee or sublessee \u2014 are things the defendants believe they have clearly shown in the brief and argument already filed, and which do not therefore demand any further notice. As respects this claim, however, and as respects another of the same character, namely, that the plaintiff shows a breach of the anti-alienation covenant of the plaintiff\u2019s lease whenever it shows any possession of the demised premises by the Maine of any sort or kind, it is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff\u2019s arguments in support of them only prove a radical misconception of the real issue. For example: It is intimated that whether the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, as applied to the plaintiff\u2019s road, amounts to an assignment or alienation of the plaintiff\u2019s road and franchise, is immaterial,because,whether it does or does not,there has been a change of possession within the prohibition of the lease. But the truth is, that the facts relied upon by the plaintiff as constituting such change of possession do, or do not, bring it about according to the . legal significance and character which the contract impresses upon those facts. The physical occupation of the plaintiff\u2019s road determines nothing. It is in possession of a body of employ\u00e9s whose possession is that of their principal, whoever that principal may be. The statutes of the state permit the Maine, or any other railroad corporation, to be interposed as general agent between the Lowell, the lessee of the plaintiff\u2019s road, and the employ\u00e9s in actual physical possession of it, and such agency does not disturb or prejudice the Lowell\u2019s legal possession. Hence, as the Maine may be using and working the road in either capacity, wrongfully as assignee or sublessee under the plaintiff\u2019s lease to the Lowell, rightfully as agent under contract \u2014 as there are no physical crite<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>riaof the capacity in which it is acting \u2014 it is to be determined and can be determined only by the contract of the parties, \u2014 by the sort of relation to the plaintiff\u2019s road in which they meant to put themselves and had the power to put themselves. In other words, whether there has been any change of the legal possession of the premises demised by the plaintiff to the Lowell in 1884 really depends upon the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887. If that contract, as rightly construed, means that the Maine is to act as the Lowell\u2019s agent for the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road, all the facts respecting the actual working of the road are consistent with that theory; on the other hand, if it means that the Maine is to bo assignee or alienee of the plaintiff\u2019s lease, the same facts may, though by no means so easily, be reconciled with that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">It is argued that the parties to the Lowell and Maine contract of June, 1887, as applied to the plaintiff\u2019s road, did not contemplate the working of the plaintiff\u2019s road by the Maine as the Lowell\u2019s agent under the statute expressly authorizing such an arrangement, and that if they had, different and simpler and more pertinent terms would have been used. But parties are not to be deprived of their rights because of the diffuseness or infelicity of the language creating them. If their purpose is clear, the substantial provisions of the contract, not the phraseology in which they are couched, will determine what the contract really is. The purpose of the parties not to make any assignment or subletting under the plaintiff\u2019s lease to the Lowell, or any transfer of possession of the demised premises, is too plain to be mistaken or denied. In that view, they provide that the Lowell shall remain in possession and operate the plaintiff\u2019s road. In the same view, they provide that the franchise to take tolls shall remain in the Lowell, and that it shall, in the first instance, receive all the earnings of the plaintiff\u2019s road. In the same view, they provide that the payment of all the rental of every kind shall continue to be made by the Lowell, the Maine only undertaking to indemnify it against all its expenses on account thereof. Then comes the provision that the plaintiff\u2019s road shall be operated in all respects under the direction of the Maine. And whatever might be the effect of this provision if it stood alone, yet, viewed in connection with the context, construed by the light of the statute and of the other provisions just referred to, there can be, it is submitted, but one result, namely, that the effect of the contract is not to put the Lowell out of possession of the demised premises and put the Maine in, but is simply to make the Maine, the Lowell\u2019s agent to work the road in the Lowell\u2019s name and in the Lowell\u2019s right.</p>\n<author id=\"b461-5\">Clark, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmC\">This is a writ of entry brought by the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad against the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, November 29, 1887, to recover possession of that portion of its railroad situated in the county of Merrimack. The plaintiff, recifc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ing the transfer of its road to the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad by a lease dated June 19, 1884, for the term of ninety-nine years, and the condition therein that the lessee should not assign or under-let the demised premises, or part with the possession thereof, except with the written consent of the lessor,-alleges that on the first day of November, 1887, the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad corporation, in violation of its covenants, and without the written \u25a0consent of the plaintiff and without right, assigned the plaintiff\u2019s railroad and delivered the possession of the same to the defendant ; that the lease of the plaintiff to the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad thereby became forfeited; and that, in accordance with its provisions, the plaintiff entered upon the demised premises on the \u25a0eighteenth day of November, 1887, for the purpose of enforcing the forfeiture and determining the estate thereby granted, but the defendant refused and still refuses to surrender the possession of its railroad to .the plaintiff. The action is founded upon an alleged violation of the covenant not to assign, underlet, or part with the possession of the demised premises except with the written consent of the lessor; and the question is whether there has been such a violation of that covenant as to work a forfeiture of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">No question arises in this action as to the validity of the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal lease to the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, or the legality of the transfer'of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad to the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad corporation under it. The action proceeds upon the assumption that the Montreal lease was originally a valid contract ; and the ground upon which the plaintiff now seeks to be relieved from the further operation of it is, an alleged forfeiture of the demised estate, resulting from a violation of its covenants by the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad in assigning, underletting, or parting with the possession of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad, by and under a \u2022contract of lease to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, dated June 22, 1887, and a transfer of the possession of the property and estate demised thereby, on the eleventh day of October, 1887, to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. The plaintiff claims a forfeiture on the ground that the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad,- by the lease of June 22, 1887, demised to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad its contract of lease of June 19, 1884, with the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad, and that the execution of the lease of June 22, 1887, to the Boston &amp; Maine was of itself an assignment of the plaintiff\u2019s road and a violation of the covenants of the Montreal lease; and that the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad corporation have parted with the possession of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad to the Boston \u2022&amp; Maine Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The Montreal lease provides that the lessors may enter and determine the estate thereby granted in case of a breach of any of its covenants; and the covenant for a violation of which a forfeiture is claimed is as follows: \u201c Said second party [Boston &amp; Lowell Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>road] covenants and agrees that it will not assign or underlet the premises hereby demised, or part with the possession thereof, except with the written consent of the first party \u201d (Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The provisions of the Maine lease of June 22,1887, bearing upon the question under consideration, are the following: \u201c The lessor [Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad] doth grant, demise, and lease unto the lessee [Boston '&amp; Maine Railroad], its successors and assigns, its railroad and railroad property of every description, and all rights, franchises, easements, privileges, and appurtenances thereto belonging, together with the right to demand and receive all tolls, rent, revenue, income, and profits of the demised premises, including also therein all the right, title, and interest of the lessor in and to any and all railroads operated by it, under lease or otherwise, so far as the same are assignable or transferable by the lessor without violation of law or of agreement, but not otherwise; and in and to any bonds, obligations, and contracts of or with other railroads, corporations, or individuals, and all income or other advantages and benefits to be derived therefrom . . ; hereby assigning and transferring unto the lessee, subject to all legal obligations and incumbrances thereon, all its railroad, railroad property, franchises, and assets of every description, except as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u201c The lessee shall pay all operating expenses of the lessor, and of all railroads of which it shall come into possession, or which it shall operate under and by virtue of this instrument, there being included therein as part thereof all repairs and renewals; all expenditures arising out of any contract, obligation, business, negligence or misfeasance, or however otherwise arising, and whether, the liability for the same now exists or be hereafter created, in any way connected with the use and operation of the demised premises, or of railroads operated by the lessee or lessor as herein provided, and including damages to persons or property . . . The lessee shall pay, as the same become due, the rentals of all railroads of which it shall come into possession, or which it shall operate under and by virtue of this instrument, during the continuance of this lease, and of all roads leased to the lessor according to the terms of the several leases, and the interest on the indebtedness of the lessor, and on the indebtedness of all roads leased or operated by the lessor which this lessor is under obligation to pay, a schedule whereof is hereto annexed</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u201c The lessor covenants that if it be found impracticable to at once deliver immediate possession of any railroad leased or operated by it at the inception of this lease, by reason of any agreement to the contrary or other reason, it will use all reasonable efforts to deliver, and will deliver, possession thereof as soon as practicable. The lessor shall, meanwhile, continue in the possession of such railroad, and, under the direction of the lessee in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>respects, shall continue to use and operate the same under its contract with the company owning the same, and to pay the rental or other consideration agreed to be paid for the use of the same, and to receive the earnings thereof, but shall immediately transfer and pay over all such earnings to the lessee to its own use, which, in consideration thereof, shall reimburse the lessor for all expenditures, and indemnify and hold it harmless against all costs, claims, and liabilities arising out of the lessor\u2019s possession and operation of said railroad, or under and by virtue of its lease or other contract for operating the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u201cThe lessee shall use and operate the railroads and properties herein demised, in accordance with the charter of the lessor, and of the several corporations whose roads are so operated . . ; shall furnish all cars, engines, rolling-stock, and equipment of every description required, in addition to the like property hereby demised, for the due operation of the railroads operated under and by virtue of this lease; shall observe and perform all the provisions of contracts of the lessor with railroads now leased or operated by it, under the provisions of this indenture ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">An examination of these provisions of the Maine lease and of the whole instrument does not admit of a reasonable doubt that the intention of the parties was to transfer all the interest of the Boston &amp; Lowell corporation in its railroad and railroad property, and the practical operation, management, and control of the same, to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. It is conceded that the lease went into actual operation October 11, 1887, and that the Maine and Lowell corporations have since been acting under it. Upon these facts the question of the forfeiture of the Montreal lease is not a difficult one.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The provision in the Montreal lease that the Lowell corporation should not assign, underlet, or part with the possession of the demised premises, except with the written consent of the lessor, was designed to secure a personal performance of its covenants by the Lowell corporation. The lessor had the right to choose their tenant, and, whatever may have been its purpose in doing it, the conclusion is irresistible that the stipulation against assigning, underletting, or parting with the possession of the demised premises was inserted in the lease \u25a0 to secure the exercise of the personal integrity, discretion, and judgment of the lessee in shaping the policy and controlling the management and operation of the road. The language of the lease is susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">By the Maine contract of June 22, 1887, the Lowell corporation leased its railroad and railroad property to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, and agreed to continue in the possession of the Montreal road, which it could not lawfully lease, and to use and operate it under its Montreal lease, in all respects .under the direction of the Maine corporation. Nothing was done under the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Maine contract until October 11, 1887, when the Boston &amp; Maine corporation took possession of the property leased to it by the Lowell company, and the lease went into operation. Since then the Lowell company claims to have operated the Montreal road, \u2014 \u25a0 presumably according to its agreement with the Maine corporation. There is no evidence or claim that it has operated it in violation of the terms of the Maine contract. But it is entirely immaterial whether the Maine corporation has exercised any actual control over the management and operation of the Montreal road, or that the Lowell company has operated it without consulting the Maine corporation. If the fact is so, it is merely evidence that the management of the Lowell company has been satisfactory to the Boston &amp; Maine. Whenever the Maine corporation chooses to interfere or exercise active control, the Lowell is bound to obey. It may interfere at any moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The Lowell company has voluntarily parted with its power to control the operation of the Montreal road, and has become the agent and servant of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, and its possession is the possession of the Maine corporation. This, in spirit and in substance, is a breach of the covenant of the Montreal lease and a forfeiture of. the estate granted by it. If the condition of the Montreal lease had been in terms, as it is in legal effect,. that the lessee should not assign, underlet, or part with the possession of the Montreal road to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad Corporation, it would not admit of a question that the execution and operation of the Maine contract of lease was a violation of that condition.</p>\n<author id=\"b465-5\">Carpenter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3d\">By the first lease, the plaintiff (the Montreal company) conveyed its railroad to the Lowell for the term of 99 years from June 1, 1884. The second lease, made by the Lowell to the Maine, and dated June 22, 1887, is for the term of 99 years from April 1, 1887. In the first lease the Lowell covenanted that it would operate the plaintiff\u2019s road during the term, and would not assign or underlet it, or part with the possession of it, except with the plaintiff\u2019s written consent; and that if the Lowell violated any of its covenants, the plaintiff might enter upon and take possession of the road, and thereby determine the Lowell\u2019s estate therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In the first article of the second lease the Lowell conveyed its own road and all roads leased to it, so far as they were assignable without violation of law or of agreement, and the Maine agreed to pay the rent of all roads leased to the Lowell. By this agreement, read as it must be with the second article and the rest of the instrument, the Maine bound itself to pay the rent of all roads leased to the Lowell, whether they were assignable or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The second article is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\u201cThe lessor covenants that if it be found impracticable to at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>once deliver immediate possession of .any railroad leased or operated by it at the inception of this lease, by reason of any agreement to the contrary or other reason, it will use all reasonable efforts to deliver, and will deliver, possession thereof as soon as practicable. The lessor shall meanwhile continue in the possession of such railroad, and, under the direction of the lessee in all respects, shall continue to use and operate the same under its contract with the company owning the same, and to pay the rental or other consideration agreed to be paid for the use of the same, and to receive the earnings thereof; but shall immediately transfer and pay over all such earnings to the lessee to its own use, which in consideration thereof shall reimburse the lessor for all expenditures, and indemnify and hold it harmless against all costs, claims, and liabilities arising out of the lessor\u2019s possession and operation of said railroad, or under and by virtue of its lease or other contract for operating the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">This contract was made without the plaintiff\u2019s consent, and the performance of it by the Lowell and the Maine was begun October 11, 1887. Thereupon the plaintiff, having duly asserted its right of forfeiture by entering upon and taking possession of its road so far as it could without personal violence, properly brought against the Maine this real action <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>63 N. H. 321), in which, by agreement, the Lowell has been joined as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">No special plea has been filed, and by the ninth rule of court (56 N. H. 581, 582), in the absence of such plea, the case would be tried on the general issue. Under this plea the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment against both defendants on the first count, because the only estate claimed by either of them is one for years and not a freehold. The plaintiff would also be entitled to judgment against the Maine, because by the plea of <em>nul disseisin </em>that corporation would admit itself in possession <em>(Fletcher </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>61 N. H. 438, 470), and thereby admit a violation of the Lowell\u2019s covenant against a change of possession. But defective pleading may be amended. The parties understood that no question was to be raised on the want of special pleas, and that the answer of each defendant to the second bill in equity was to be treated as its plea to this\u2019action. Though such a practice is irregular and not approved, the case is considered and decided as if the material facts stated in the answers were properly and formally pleaded. -</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Each defendant admits the execution of the second lease, and makes a copy a part of its answer. The Maine denies that before \u201c October 11,1887, it managed and controlled the . . . Lowell . . . corporation, or any part thereof; or any of its leased lines including the plaintiff\u2019s railroads; that after October 11, 1887, it operated or continued to operate the roads of the plaintiff, except as hereinafter alleged and stated; \u201d and alleges that the Lowell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201cpursuant to the covenants of its lease to the defendant of June 22, 1887 [the second lease], has remained in possession thereof, and operated the same in all respects conformably to said contract.\u201d The Lowell alleges that \u201c it did not and never has assigned, or underlet, or parted with the possession of the premises demised to it by the plaintiff, . . . either to the . . . Maine . . . or to any, other corporation or person, and has not parted with the control thereof, but still possesses, operates, and controls the same in accordance with the provisions of \u201d the first lease ; but does not deny, and by not denying admits, the performance of its covenants in the second lease after October 11, 1887, as averred by the Maine. Both defendants distinctly present the exact issue to be tried. They say that the Lowell, by making and performing its contract with the Maine, has not assigned, underlet, or parted with the possession of the demised premises. And they maintain in argument, as they aver in their answers, that the Lowell, though it uses and operates the plaintiff\u2019s road under the direction in all respects of the Maine, for the Maine\u2019s exclusive benefit, \u201cstill possesses, operates, and controls the same in accordance with the provisions of said lease \u201d from the plaintiff. They present the question whether a performance of the second lease is a violation of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Did the Lowell, by making and performing the stipulations of the second lease, break its covenant not to assign the demised premises or its covenant not to part with the possession? It might part with, and the Maine might take possession of, the plaintiff\u2019s road without a legal assignment. <em>West </em>v. Dobb, L. R. 5 Q. B. 460; <em>Quackenboss </em>v. Clarke, 12 Wend. 555. Tt might make an assignment without parting with the possession., <em>McMurphy </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>4 N. H. 251; <em>White </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>L. R. 6 Exch. 32; <em>Corporation of Bristol </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>12 Ch. Div. 461; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bosanquet, </em>1 B. &amp; B. 238; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>15 Ves. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s object in requiring the Lowell to covenant against alienating or parting with the possession of its road was legitimate. A -faithful performance of the covenant might be of great value, and its non-performance a great injury, to the plaintiff. The parties agreed that the plaintiff should have, as security for its performance, the property leased. Whether the plaintiff is in fact injured by a violation of the covenant is not in this case material.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">By the common law leases for years were forfeited if the tenant disaffirmed the lessor\u2019s title, claimed a greater estate than he was entitled to, or aliened in fee. 4 Kent 106; 2 Bla. Com. 274, 276; Bac. Abr., Leases T., 2; <em>De Lancey </em>v. <em>Ganong, </em>9 N. Y. 9. The covenants of a lessee, and provisos for a reentry upon a breach of them, are, like other contracts, to be construed fairly and without favor to either party. A strained and forced interpretation is not to be given them in order to defeat their object. The intention of the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>as expressed -by the language of the whole instrument, is to be found and enforced. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Elsam, </em>1 M. &amp; M. 189 ; <em>Goodtitle </em>v. Saville, 16 East 87, 95, 96; <em>Croft </em>v. <em>Lumley, </em>6 H. L. Ca. 672, 693; <em>Corporation of Bristol </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>12 Ch. D. 461; <em>Hayne </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>16 C.

D. 359, 362; <em>Whitwell </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>106 Mass. 532, 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Technical terms or special words are not necessary to an assignment ; any language which shows the intention of the parties to transfer the property from one to the other is sufficient. The form of the instrument is immaterial. If it has the legal effect to pass to another the lessee\u2019s interest in the whole or in any part of the demised premises for his entire term or the remainder of his term, it is an assignment. An under-lease for the whole term is an assignment. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 99 ; <em>Beardman </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>L. R. 4 C. P. 57; <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Terhune, </em>30 N. Y. 453. Although by the under-lease a rent exceeding the original rent is reserved, and it is expressly stipulated that the so called under-tenant shall hold as the tenant of his grantor, he is nevertheless in law the tenant of the original lessor. <em>Wollaston </em>v. <em>Hakewill, </em>3 M. &amp; G. 297, 322, 323; <em>Parmenter </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>8 Taunt. 393; Bac. Abr., Leases, I, 3. A lessee\u2019s grant of all his interest in the whole or in a part of the premises is an assignment. <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>8 N. H. 22, 29; <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>64 N. H. 106; Com. Dig., Condition E. A lessee of one hundred acres, on condition that he shall not assign, can no more convey one acre without breaking the condition than he can ninety-nine or one hundred acres. His grant of ninety-nine and ninety-nine one hundredths acres is no more a breach than his grant of one hundredth of an acre. If A is bound not to alien a manor, his alienation of one acre, parcel of it, is a breach. Vin. Abr., Condition, U, a. 25. \u201cIf a lessee, by any instrument whatever, whether reserving conditions or not, parts with his entire interest, he has made a complete assignment; if he has transferred his interest in a part of the premises, he has made an assignment <em>pro tanto.\u201d Woodhull </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>61 N. Y. 383, 391; Com. Dig., Debt E ; Cro. Jac. 411; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>1 Doug. 187, <em>note; Wollaston </em>v. <em>Hakewill, supra. </em>It is not material that all the plaintiff\u2019s franchises were not conveyed by the Lowell to the Maine, if such is the fact. It is enough if any one of them or any part of the plaintiff\u2019s property was conveyed. Nor is it material to the present questions whether the plaintiff\u2019s franchises are the principal thing of which its lands and chattels are inseparable incidents, or whether the tangible property is the principal to which the franchises are incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Whether the performance of the second lease in legal effect conveys to the Maine the franchises and property of the plaintiff, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>any part of them, or the possession of the property, is a question to be determined on a consideration not merely of the granting or other single clause of the lease, but of all the provisions relating to the subject. The plaintiff\u2019s road is not formally assigned to the Maine. On the contrary, it is excepted from the operation of tlie granting clause. But the plaintiff\u2019s franchises and property \u201c after being taken out of the category of things conveyed . . . are then separately dealt with in a special clause of the contract.\u201d By the literal terms' of this clause (the second article) the Lowell covenants that it will give to the Maine and that the Maine shall have the plaintiff\u2019s franchise of using, controlling, and operating the Montreal. The covenant that the Lowell shall \u201c use and operate \u201d the road \u201cunder the direction of the lessee in all respects\u201d is an express agreement that the Maine shall use and operate it through the instrumentality of the Lowell as a servant, agent, or general manager. In the performance of their contract the Maine is the mast\u00e9r, the Lowell the subordinate. In the absence of any question of estoppel, the Lowell is not, and the Maine is, responsible to employes with notice of the situation for their pay, to patrons and others for negligent injuries, and to the state for the performance of all the requirements of law relating to railroads. The Lowell is no more answerable in these particulars than any individual superintendent or general manager. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>decided in Grafton county, December, 1860, and not reported (for the head note, see <em>24 </em>Monthly Law Rep. 32); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Cartwright, </em>6 T. R. 411; Sto. Ag., 261, 263, 313; <em>Brown v. Rundlett, </em>15 N. H. 360 ; <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Weymouth, </em>26 N. H. 34, 38. It has no legal interest in the earnings: every dollar of them is the property of the Maine. If the Lowell can maintain an action to recover moneys due for freight, or funds in the hands of an employ\u00e9 or agent, a release by the Maine would be a good defence. Whatever money the Lowell receives, it is bound to pay over to the Maine \u201c immediately.\u201d It has no lien. <em>Stillings </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>63 N. H. 1. In literal and explicit words, the Lowell agrees to give, and by performing the agreement does give, to the Maine the plaintiff\u2019s franchise of taking and receiving all the tolls \u2014 the gross receipts from the business of the road \u2014 to be held by the Maine -for its exclusive benefit. It is not material that they ar\u00e9 received by the Maine through the hands of the Lowell as an intermediary. If the road were discontinued, or ceased to be a source of income, the Lowell would lose nothing. Until 1983 the entire loss would fall on the Maine. The gift is not of such net profits as the Lowell by its management may realize, but of the gross tolls, \u2014 all the moneys that may be obtained by the use and operation of the property \u201cunder the direction of the lessee in all respects,\u201d during the entire remainder of the Lowell\u2019s term. This is an assignment. By it the entire beneficial interest of the Lowell in the plaintiff\u2019s property is conveyed to the Maine. By the grant of the profits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>land, \u201c the whole land itselfe doth passe; for what is the land but the profits thereof ?\u201d Co. Lit. 4, <em>b. </em>A devise of the use and income of land is a devise of the land itself. <em>McClure </em>v. Melendy, 44 N. H. 469; <em>Wood </em>v. Griffin, 46 N. H. 230, 234. The Lowell\u2019s subsequent grantee of all its right, title, and interest in the plaintiff\u2019s road would take nothing of value, assuming that by the grant he would acquire the possession of the road and the Lowell\u2019s right to use and operate it under the direction of the Maine. The naked possession of the road, with the barren right to operate it under the direction, and for the benefit of another, is worthless. Its value is in the right to control the management and take the usufruct of the property, in the possession of whomsoever it may be and by whomsoever it may be operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">By the covenants of the second lease and the performance of them, the relation of principal and agent is established between the Lowell and the Maine. If the Lowell is the agent of the Maine, there is a forfeiture by assignment of title and of possession; it is not possible in law, or in fact, for the Lowell to hold and operate the plaintiff\u2019s road as the plaintiff\u2019s tenant according to the terms of the first lease, and also as the Maine\u2019s agent according to the terms of the second. The question is, Which one is the other\u2019s agent? The defendants say the plaintiff\u2019s railroad was excepted from the granting clause of the lease, because they \u201cknew that any assignment or subletting or alienation \u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c franchises would cause serious trouble and mischief for all parties concerned,\u201d and this was \u201c the exact thing \u201d they \u201c meant to avoid; \u201d they knew \u201c a contract by one railroad corporation with another for the exclusive use of another\u2019s road could not be anything but a leasethey knew \u201c the indisputable rule of law . . . that whatever may be the rights of the principal and agent <em>inter sese, </em>as against all the world the agent\u2019s possession is always, and for all purposes, the principal\u2019s possession,\u201d but that as the Lowell could not exercise the plaintiff\u2019s franchises except through agents, it might without assigning or parting with the possession of the road employ any person or qualified corporation \u2014 might employ the Maine \u2014 as its agent to do its work; therefore they say, that in the use and operation of the plaintiff\u2019s road they must have intended to make the Maine the Lowell\u2019s agent; they could not have intended to make the Maine the principal and the Lowell the agent, for that arrangement would effectuate both a transfer of the title and a change of the possession; the legal effect of the contract is to \u201c make the Maine the Lowell\u2019s agent to work the road in the Lowell\u2019s name and in the Lowell\u2019s right,\u201d and by the stipulation that the plaintiff\u2019s road shall be operated by the Lowell under the direction in all respects of the Maine, they meant, and their language must be construed to mean, that it shall be operated by the Maine under the direction in all respects of the Lowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">By their contract the Maine controls the use and operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s road, takes all the profit, and bears all the loss and responsibility of the business, \u2014 is. in fact, the master; the Lowell operates the road under the control and direction of the Maine, has no part in the profit or loss, and no interest in the business,\u2014 is, in fact, the servant. To style the Lowell master or principal and the Maine servant or agent, if in any conceivable view permissible, subserves no useful purpose here. The legal relations of the parties are not changed by the misnomer. To say that A, who has authority to direct and control B in operating a railroad for A\u2019s exclusive benefit is B\u2019s servant and agent in the operation of the road, is to use language in a sense unknown to the law or in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The Maine and the Lowell intended that the plaintiff\u2019s property should be conveyed in fact, but not in law; that it should pass, but be held' not to pass. To see if by some peculiarity of judicial interpretation in New Hampshire their purpose can be accomplished', they say, The Montreal road is excepted from the operation of this agreement, but shall be controlled, used, operated, and enjoyed by the Maine in all respects as if it were included herein, except that the Maine\u2019s orders shall be transmitted through the Lowell. It is as if they had said, concerning the entire contract, This instrument is not and shall not be construed to be a lease. <em>Burke </em>v. Railroad, 61 N. H. 160, 167, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Lowell \u201c doth grant, demise, and lease \u201d its assignable roads to the Maine. A further provision, that \u201c the Lowell doth also grant, demise, and lease its non-assignable roads to the Maine,\u201d would have been equivalent to a notice of readiness to surrender them to their owners without controversy. Concerning those roads, the instrument was so drawn as to raise the question whether the Lowell would \u201c assign \u201d them, \u201c or part with the possession thereof,\u201d by performing an agreement to become the Maine\u2019s indemnified servant thereon, holding and operating them under the Maine\u2019s orders and paying all the earnings to the Maine. Instead of \u201c doth grant, demise, and lease,\u201d or other ordinary terms of conveyance signifying a present assignment of those roads completed by delivery of the writing, the Lowell\u2019s possession of them and interest in them were disposed of by an executory contract in the future tense. The Lowell shall enter the service of the Maine as holder and operator of the Lowell\u2019s non-assignable roads under the direction of the Maine in all respects, and shall pay all the earnings to the Maine ; the Maine shall pay the rents and expenses, and shall indemnify the Lowell and hold it harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The effect of the Lowell\u2019s covenants in the first lease cannot be avoided by a circuity of language or other verbal device in the second. To hold that the performance of the agreement, that the Maine shall exercise the plaintiff\u2019s franchise to control the use and operation of the road and shall receive and hold the tolls for its exclusive benefit during the entire remainder of the Lowell\u2019s term, is not a breach of the covenant against assignment, is to fritter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>away the covenant and make it worthless. <em>Varley </em>v. Coppard, L. R. 7 C. P. 505, 507. The purpose of the condition against assignment is defeated. The provision might as well have been omitted. It has no substantial effect. What it forbids in form, it permits in substance. <em>Doe </em>v. Carter, 8 T. R. 300; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Hawke, 2 </em>East 481; <em>Davis </em>v. Elsam, 1 M. &amp; M. 189; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Corliss, </em>7 Johns. 531; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Silvernail, </em>15 Johns. 278; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Kipp, </em>3 Wend. 230 ; <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Stickles, </em>7 Hill 253, 257, 258; <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>17 N. H. 18, 21 \u2014 S. <em>C., </em>21 N. H. 149, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The defence that the Maine is th\u00e9 agent of the Lowell is a traverse of those covenants of the second lease that give to the Maine the control and the earnings of the plaintiff\u2019s road, and impose on the Lowell the duty of obedience. The possession of property held by a servant in his subordinate capacity is his master\u2019s possession. When the second lease took effect, October 11, 1887, it changed the Lowell\u2019s possession of the Montreal from that of a master to that of a servant, substituted the Maine for the Lowell as the principal in the possession and operation, and conveyed from the Lowell to the Maine the Lowell\u2019s rights of property and \u25a0control. The Maine\u2019s possession, held for it by the Lowell as its servant, is a disseisin for which the plaintiff can maintain trespass or this real action against the Maine. If the Lowell had filed a plea of disclaimer, and the plaintiff had replied maintaining its writ, the Lowell would prevail. On a like issue between the plaintiff and the Maine, the plaintiff would prevail. The disseisin is a complete transaction, and not a promise to deliver possession when the plaintiff consents. Since the agreement that the Maine shall have the Lowell\u2019s interest and power has. been carried into execution, it has not been a mere executory covenant to make an assignment. Divested of everything but possession as a servant, the Lowell is bound by the terms of the agreement to withdraw from its menial position \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d that is, until June 1, 1983, if the plaintiff does not give its written consent to an assignment, the Lowell is bound to remain in the service of the Maine, and, whether the plaintiff consents or not, the Maine is bound to pay the rent as it becomes due to the plaintiff, bear all the expense and loss of the operation of the road, and is entitled to all the profits. The only effect of obtaining the plaintiff\u2019s consent would be, that in the operation of the Montreal the orders given by the Maine would no longer be sent by wire, or otherwise, through the office of the Lowell. There is no occasion to consider the large amount of testimony presented on the irrelevant and immaterial questions whether the Maine, on and after October 11, 1887, exercised its stipulated power of direction in all respects by a general order entrusting the conduct and operation of the road to the Lowell as its general manager, or whether from time to time it issued special and specific orders, or, if it did, whether it sent them direct to the men in its employ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>or performed the idle ceremony of transmitting <em>them </em>through the Lowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">In this suit at law the rights of the parties depend upon no general or special question of an equitable as distinguished from a legal character. The case is a simple one of broken contract. The Lowell agreed that if it transferred the plaintiff\u2019s road to another company the plaintiff might take it back; and the Lowell has made the transfer which it agreed not to make. There is no peculiar equity or want of equity that affects the legal merits. The court has no power to deprive the plaintiff of the remedy which the contract specifically provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The disfavor which a forfeiture meets in legal presumptions and technical rules is irrelevant, because here is no ambiguous language or doubtful construction. Those presumptions and rules do not alter the contract by which the Maine is to be put in the place of the Lowell as principal in the operation of the plaintiff\u2019s road until 1983 without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. Since the defendants have expressed their intention to make this change in written words that admit but one meaning, it is useless to inquire how probable or improbable it is that they intended to do what they have done. Were such inquiry made, it would be found not merely probable, but certain, that they intended to use the language of their covenants in the only sense of which it is capable. The words carefully chosen to express their purpose are so simple, full, and precise, that a mistake is impossible. It has not been suggested that there was a mistake. Had there been one, it could have been rectified on a bill in equity for the reformation of the contract. If such a bill had been filed, the decision of this case would, on motion and cause shown, have been postponed to await the result. On the question that would be raised in such a proceeding, there is in the three volumes of deposition\u2019s abundant and unconflicting testimony which puts the point beyond a doubt. It shows that their intentions were what would necessarily be inferred from the second lease without extraneous evidence. The Lowell desired to let its own road to the Maine for 99 years if it was released from its obligation to pay rent, and from all its duties, liabilities, and risks as lessee and operator of the Montreal and other roads. If it went out of business on its own road, it did not propose to continue in business on the Montreal. The Maine desired to hire the Lowell and the Montreal, and to take the Lowell if it could not have both. When the bargain was put in writing, their purpose was expressed with professional accuracy and skill in provisions that would enable the Maine to keep the Montreal if the court should hold that the Lowell\u2019s covenants against alienation could be evaded by circumlocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As soon as the second lease took effect, October 11,1887, the plaintiff refused to receive rent. By agreement of the parties, payments were afterwards made and received \u201c on account,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u201c without prejudice to the rights of either partj\u2019-.\u201d By receiving rent before that time, the plaintiff did not waive the forfeiture incurred by the transfer of the possession of its road from the Lowell to the' Maine, nor the forfeiture caused by the Lowell\u2019s alienation of its leasehold title. A landlord does not waive the breach of a condition by receiving rent before the breach occurs, nor by receiving it after a breach of which he is ignorant. Until October 11, 1887, there was no change in the possession of the plaintiff\u2019s road. Before that day the Lowell held the possession in . its own right as proprietor ; on and after that day as the servant and agent of the Maine. On this point the pleadings and proofs concur. The denials and allegations above recited of the Maine are an averment that the Lowell entered upon the performance of its covenants with the Maine, October 11, 1887, and not before. In the second volume of the evidence, page 17, is a paper-signed by the president of the Lowell and by the president of the Maine, in which those officers say that on that\" day the Lowell delivered and the Maine received possession of all the Lowell\u2019s assignable roads. The Maine did not take possession or control of the Lowell\u2019s non-assignable roads before it took possession of the assignable ones. When the second lease went into effect, October 11, 1887, and not before, the Maine began to exercise over the plaintiff\u2019s road its power of direction. in all respects, \u2014 took the position of master; the Lowell began to use and operate the road under that direction, \u2014 took the place of servant; and the legal possession of the road passed from the Lowell to the Maine. If the defendants had proved the waiver of a forfeiture incurred by the Lowell\u2019s alienation of the title, it would not aid them, \u2014 it would not be a waiver of the forfeiture created by tbe change of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">If the Lowell\u2019s leasehold estate in the Montreal was not assigned before October 11,-1887, by the unperformed covenants of the second lease, it was assigned by the performance of those covenants on that day and afterwards; and the forfeiture by alienation was not waived by the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of rent, because it had not then occurred. If, by the mere execution and delivery of the lease without a performance of its covenants, the Lowell's estate in the road passed to the Maine, the forfeiture was not waived by the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of rent, because there is no evidence in the case tending to show that prior to October 11, 1887, the plaintiff had any notice or knowledge of the existence, delivery, or contents of the lease. If the defendants\u2019 omission to call witnesses on this point when the depositions were taken had been due to inadvertence, it must be assumed that they would have moved to open the case for the. admission of the evidence (if it existed and they deemed it material) when their attention was called to the subject by the printed and oral arguments of the plaintiff. They were aware of the liberality with which parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>are relieved from tbe consequences of accident, mistake, or misfortune touching the merits of the cause, either in pleading or in proof, when they apply for relief. They have had abundant time and opportunity for such a motion, which they knew would be granted if it ought to be. One sufficient reason for their not making the motion would be its futility. Even if by the unperformed covenants of the second lease the Lowell\u2019s title was assigned before October 11, 1887, the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of rent prior to that day, with full knowledge of the existence, delivery, and contents of the lease, could not be a waiver of the forfeiture caused on that day by the change of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In one of the defendants\u2019 briefs they contend that the Lowell could not, contrary to its covenant, assign the plaintiff\u2019s road to the Maine; that an assignment would be <em>ultra vires </em>and void; and that therefore \u201c there has been no alienation by the . . . Lowell of the plaintiff\u2019s franchises and property.\u201d That is to say, the Lowell\u2019s covenant not to assign is incapable of being broken; and for an assignment made by the Lowell to the Maine and put by them into permanent effect from October 11, 1887, the plaintiff has no remedy, because by force of some technicality (which the defendants do not specify), although there is a breach of the covenant in fact, there is none in law. The position finds no countenance in either of the cases cited in its support. In <em>Ottawa R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Black, </em>79 Ill. 202, there is nothing suggestive of the idea that a corporation\u2019s covenant against alienation is not as capable of being broken as any other agreement, or that the Lowell could not convey the plaintiff\u2019s road to the Maine for 96 years, subject only to the plaintiff\u2019s right to enter and enforce the forfeiture. In <em>Doe </em>v. Powell, 5 B. &amp; C. 308, the lessee\u2019s voluntary assignment would have been voidable at the election of the lessor, if there had been no bankrupt law. But the assignment was an act of bankruptcy on the part of the lessee ; and it was held that his leasehold estate passed to his assignee in bankruptcy, and that this involuntary assignment, being an act of the law, was not a breach of the covenant. Holroyd, J , said the voluntary assignment \u201cnot only became void and a nullity <em>ab </em>initio, but was actuall}7 avoided by the bankruptcy and the proceedings under the same before any advantage was attempted to be taken of the supposed forfeiture. Tinder these circumstances, for want of the deed\u2019s operating in law as an assignment, it was not in consideration of law an assignment by the bankrupt, but in that respect the same as if no such deed had ever been executed by him.\u201d This decision, whether right or wrong, is irrelevant except in so far as it assumes that the voluntary assignment would have been a breach of the covenant and a forfeiture if it had not been annulled by the proceedings in bankruptcy. In this case there is no question of the operation of a bankrupt law. The stipulations of the second lease, by the performance of which the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>road would be transferred from the Lowell to the Maine for the term ending June 1, 1983, went into effect when the.Maine took possession of the Lowell, October 11, 1887. Between the Lowell and the Maine the transfer was effective, and would have remained in force 96 years if the plaintiff had not, by reasonable \u25a0entry, exercised its right to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u201cFurther, on the same grounds,\u201d say the defendants in the same brief, \u201cthere has been no dispossession of the Lowell by the Maine, neither corporation being competent to authorize or to acquiesce in it. If upon the evidence there has been any interference with the Lowell\u2019s full enjoyment of the franchises pertaining to the plaintiff\u2019s road, it cannot be regarded as other than the personal trespass of the individuals immediately concerned. . . . No case of that sort . . . can be heard or tried in the present suits, to which the Maine and Lowell are the only parties defendant.\u201d In other words, a corporation, like the king, can do no wrong; for injuries 'committed by its agents acting within the scope of their authority, the agents personally, and not their corporate master, are responsible. The grounds upon which the defendants put this exception to the law that regards the possession and acts of an agent as the possession and acts of his principal are not disclosed, and to sustain it no authority is cited. Until a change is made by the law-making power, corporations acting by agents, like individuals acting in the same manner, will continue to be capable of committing torts and violating contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-9\">Doe, C.

No formal plea has been filed; but, by agreement of the parties stated in oral argument, the facts alleged in the answers of the defendants to the plaintiff\u2019s bill in chancery, so far as material to their defence in this action, are to be treated as if formally pleaded. The actions were heard and submitted together. The defendants, in. their answers, in substance set forth the instrument of June 22, 1887, deny that the Lowell assigned its estate or parted with the possession or control of the plaintiff\u2019s road to the Maine, and aver that the Lowell is the owner of the lease of June 19, 1884, in possession of the plaintiff\u2019s road under it, performing its duties and covenants to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">The plaintiff, June 19, 1884, leased its railroad to the Lowell for ninety-nine years from the first day of the month, and the Lowell covenanted in the lease not to assign, underlet, or part with the possession of the demised premises, except with the written consent of the plaintiff. The lease of the Lowell to the Maine is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>dated June 22, 1887, and is for ninety-nine years from the first day of the preceding April. The date of the lease is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the time of its execution, and it will be presumed to have been delivered on the day of its date, unless the contrary is-proved. 4 Bac.

If the plaintiff\u2019s claim of forfeiture is, admitted, it waived it by collecting the rent which became due-after the breach, knowing that it had been committed. Tay.

It is time that by reason of an obvious inadvertence, the case does not afford formal proof of such knowledge ; but this does not seem to be of controlling importance, as railroads are public corporations, and those in whom they are vested, so far as the public is concerned, are public agents, (Gen. Laws., <em>c. </em>160, s. 123), and inasmuch as it does not admit of contradiction that the fact of the lease and its provisions were-matters of general knowledge, and had become so well known in this jurisdiction prior to the receipt of rent in September, 1887,. as to be notorious. <em>Lanfear </em>v. <em>Mestier, </em>18 La.

It was dismissed by the court; and it may well be inferred that the defendants gave their attention to that case, and unconsciously neglected to make the preparation in this that they would have made had they been sure their rights were to be determined in it. The court, of its own motion, considered the advisability of leaving open the question of waiver as a similar question was left open in <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Lyndeborough, ante, </em>but it was denied. The facts, as well as the law, were to be determined by the court in both actions, and the parties did not know with the usual certainty what questions of law or fact might become especially material, and could not well anticipate the importance that the question of waiver assumed. The defendants were guilty of no laches, and might well rely on the established practice of leaving similar questions open for further proof if found desirable to make it, and no presumption of fact adverse to them should be made. Certainly, the fact that the defendants did not -make an application, does not show the nonexistence of a waiver or of the evidence to prove one. This, however, is of slight importance, as the court will take notice of facts which are notorious without formal proof being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The claim that the Lowell forfeited the plaintiff\u2019s lease by \u25a0executing the one to the Maine is of strict legal right, to which the rules of the common law apply, \u2014 that conditions subsequent are not favored in law, and are to be construed strictly because they tend to destroy estates, and the plaintiff, to defeat the lease of its own creation, must show a breach strictly within its letter. <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>49 N.

This question is mainly one of intention. In the construction of written instruments, the intention of the parties is material, and, to ascertain it, resort may be had to the nature of the instrument itself, the situation of the parties executing it, the purpose they had in view, and the contemporaneous construction which they gave it. <em>Corwin </em>v. Hood, 58 N. H. 401; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Society, </em>56 N. H. 191, 197; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>58 N. H. 391; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>58 N.

Palmer, 38 N. H. 212, 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">If this evidence proves that the parties executing the instrument intended to convey the estate of the Lowell in the plaintiff\u2019s road <em>in present\u00ed, </em>then it is a lease ; but if it proves they did not, and that the intention was to make an agreement to convey, or a conveyance not to take effect unless something happened which might never occur and which had not occurred at the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ, then it was such an agreement or conveyance. <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Pattee, </em>58 N. H. 326; Tay. L. <em>&amp; </em>T., <em>ss. </em>37, 38, 39, 42; Wood Land &amp; T., <em>ss. </em>183, 185. The latter, both upon the law and the evidence, seems to be the true interpretation, and justice requires this construction if it will avoid a forfeiture of the Lowell\u2019s estate, and it can bo done without violating the intention of the parties. If the legal title to the Lowell\u2019s estate did not pass to the Maine, there was no assignment, underletting, or parting with the possession, as the physical possession and dominion of the Lowell continued unchanged. Neither an agreement to convey, nor an assignment of the lease to take effect when the lessor shall give its consent in writing, as provided in the plaintiff\u2019s lease, is a violation of the covenant against assigning or parting with the possession. Weat<em>herall </em>v. <em>Geering, </em>12 Ves. 504, 511; <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Pursell, </em>66 N. Y. 193, 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">On the question whether a given instrument is a lease which conveys the estate, or an agreement for one which does not, the presence or absence of certain evidence has been held material, and in many instances decisive of what the finding should be. If the instrument contemplates the execution of a formal lease, or if anything remains to be done,* or if there is the absence of words of present demise, or\u2019if the time fixed for the term to commence is uncertain, being dependent on an event which may never happen, or if construing the instrument a lease would work a forfeiture or render the instrument inoperative, it has usually been adjudged an agreement, and not a lease, especially in the last three instances. 4 Kent Com. 105 ; 1 Hill.

The language of part one indicates the purpose of the parties to make an instrument containing both a lease- and an agreement. The operative words-used are grant, covenant, and agree, the first being a word commonly used in making a present demise, while the other two indicate an intention to make a contract or agreement under seal. If the parties had intended to make simply a lease, they would have indicated it by using the common words grant, demise, and lease, which they used in part one, the. granting part of the instrument, but which are entirely omitted in part two where the agreement is found, and where the word covenant is the only operative word used. These words are properly used in these places, and \u25a0 correctly express the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In the granting part of the instrument, the Lowell\u2019s estate in the plaintiff\u2019s railroad is not conveyed; on the contrary, it is specially excepted. The parties refer therein to the Lowell\u2019s inability to convey without violating its agreements in the plaintiff\u2019s lease, and then except the plaintiff\u2019s road from the grant. This shows that both the Lowell and the Maine had in mind the Lowell\u2019s agreements as to assigning and subletting, and did not intend to violate them. The fact that the parties to the instrument specially excepted the plaintiff\u2019s railroad in the granting part, where its conveyance should be found if they intended to convey it, and the fact that they reserved it for a special agreement in part second, are equivalent to saying, We do not intend to lease the plaintiff\u2019s railroad, but to make an agreement to do so when it can lawfully be done. Again: If the parties intended to assign the Lowell\u2019s estate in violation of its covenants in the plaintiff\u2019s lease, why did they make this reservation and exception ? The only reasonable explanation is, that when the parties made the instrument they did not intend to convey the Lowell\u2019s estate in the plaintiff\u2019s road, but to make an agreement to do so when they lawfully could.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Such being confessedly the purpose of the parties, did they abandon it, and convey and forfeit the Lowell\u2019s estate in the plaintiff\u2019s road, in making the stipulations in part two ? To have this effect, language and provisions must be used admitting of no other \u25a0reasonable construction. This does not .appear. On the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>part two begins with words of agreement, not of present demise, and refers to the inability of the Lowell to convey its estate in the plaintiff\u2019s road. Then follows the provision that the lessor will use all reasonable efforts to deliver the possession as soon as practicable, which is, in effect, an agreement by the Lowell to convey and deliver the premises to the Maine in a reasonable time, if the written consent of the plaintiff can be obtained \u2014 a contingency which might never occur. Wood Land. &amp; T. 183; <em>Buell </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>4 Conn. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">It is further provided, that the Lowell shall continue in possession, which is not usual in a lease which is intended as a present demise, especially if the subsequent possession is to be held by the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">It is a good reason why part two should not be construed a technical conveyance of the Lowell\u2019s estate, that the parties had in part one of the same instrument made a lease in express and proper words, and why part two must mean something less, as it varies so widely in its form of expression, and has its own natural and proper meaning as an agreement, which cannot amount to a lease without doing violence to the words as well as the intention of the parties. 4 Bac. Abr. 135, 165, 166 ; <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Way, </em>1 T. R. 735; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Ashburner, </em>5 T. R. 163. The change in the language in part one of a present demise to that of a covenant or agreement in the second part, proves a like intention of the parties to change the meaning, and that a present demise was not intended by it. The use of such words in the former place, and their omission in the latter, show that the parties knew their proper use, that the omission was intentional, and that a present demise was not intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">These considerations, taken in connection with the full knowledge of the parties that if the Lowell conveyed its valuable estate in the plaintiff\u2019s road it would work a forfeiture, of which the plaintiff\u2019s hostile management in the interest of the Concord Railroad woidd take advantage, are decisive evidence of the intention of the parties not to make a lease of the plaintiff\u2019s road, but merely an agreement for one, and such is the fair and legal construction of the,instrument. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clare, </em>2 T. R. 739, 741, 744; 4 Kent Com. 105; Hill. Real Prop. 265, 266 ; 4 Bac. Abr. 136 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>3 Johns. 388, 394. It is improbable that parties like the Lowell and the Maine entered into a bargain which contained stipulations 'plainly and clearly to the disadvantage of both, and this instrument is to be read in the light of this improbability. <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>54 N. H. 507, 512; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>64 N. H. 520, 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">When the parties came to part second they had not made a conveyance, but in express terms had said they would not do so in violation of law. Then, with this expressed intention in view, they made the agreement in the second part, both knowing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Lowell had not the lawful right to convey its estate till it had obtained the required consent. In this situation the parties agreed, the Lowell that it would use reasonable efforts to obtain the right to convey its estate, and if it could do so within a reasonable time would convey it, and the Maine' agreed to accept the conveyance. This is the agreement made by the parties in part second. It is for a lease, if the Lowell can lawfully make one; and it does not contain \u25a0 words of present demise or words indicating a purpose to make one, but shows the design of the parties to adhere to their previously expressed intention not to make one till it could be lawfully done.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">It is true that further on in part second the parties make what may be called a \u201c meanwhile \u201d arrangement as to the management of the plaintiff\u2019s road during the reasonable time which the Lowell has to obtain the consent of the plaintiff that the Lowell may convey. In this temporary arrangement it is claimed that language is used that creates the relation of master and servant, which technically presupposes that the Lowell had conveyed its estate to the Maine and thereby worked a forfeiture. It not being claimed, however, that words of present demise are used, nor that the words used would convey the Lowell\u2019s estate unless the parties intended they should, the essential inquiry still remains, What was the intention? Is it probable that the parties intending to make a lease of the Lowell\u2019s estate in the plaintiff\u2019s road expressly excepted it in the granting part of the instrument, made an agreement in the agreeing part for a lease in harmony with their expressed intention to do so when the Lowell could lawfully.make one, still, in this temporary \u201cmeanwhile \u201d arrangement, intentionally make a complete conveyance of the Lowell\u2019s unexpired term of ninety-six years in one hundred and eighty-five miles of railway of the value of millions of dollars, by a technical, unnatural application of legal principles governing the relation of master and servant ? It does not seem possible. The parties making the instrument are intelligent, straightforward business men. Their intention had been clearly expressed in the instrument not to convey the Lowell\u2019s estate, but to make an agreement to do so; and the \u201c meanwhile \u201d arrangement was temporary, only to exist during the reasonable time the Lowell had under the agreement to obtain the plaintiff\u2019s assent to an assignment, the Lowell retaining the ownership and possession of the property during the interval. The estate of the Lowell in so important a system of public railways as that of the plaintiff\u2019s is not conveyed by the technical interpretation of the agreement in the Lowell\u2019s lease, claimed by the plaintiff, when such a conveyance depends on a contingency which has never occurred, works a forfeiture, and is contrary to the intention of the parties; nor is it an assignment of the Lowell\u2019s estate in the plaintiff\u2019s road, which forfeits the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>under the common-law rules of strict construction of conditions subsequent. <em>Hoyt </em>v. Kimball, 49 N. H. 322, 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">If part two is susceptible of being construed a conveyance of the class of roads and property coming within its provisions, the inquiry arises, When was it to take effect? It clearly was not intended to do so at once, but when the property could bo lawfully delivered. The evidence on this point is so clear as to leave little doubt as to the conclusion. If part two conveyed the plaintiff\u2019s roads and property, to take effect at the same time the conveyance made in part one did, what was the object of the parties in making part two? If it was all to be conveyed, delivered, and become the property of the Maine at the same time and by the same delivery, why did the parties except it in part one and refer to it as not being assignable or transferable without violation of law or agreement, and why did the parties in part two say that \u201c the lessor covenants that, if it be found impracticable to at onCe deliver the immediate possession of any railroad leased or operated by it at the inception of this lease, by reason of any agreement to the contrary or other reason, it will use all reasonable efforts to deliver and will deliver possession thereof as soon as practicable\u201d? The parties knew that the assignment as to the plaintiff\u2019s road could not take effect before the Lowell obtained the plaintiff\u2019s consent to it without forfeiting the plaintiff\u2019s lease, and therefore they agreed, if the Lowell had not obtained the required consent at the beginning of the operation of the lease, that part two should not take effect at the time part one did by a delivery of the property conveyed by it, and the delivery of the property described in part two should.be postponed for such a reasonable time as would enable the Lowell by the use of all reasonable effort to obtain the necessary consent. In other words, the agreement of the parties in the lease was, that part two should not take effect at the inception, or beginning, of fee operation of the lease <em>(Marvin </em>v. <em>M\u2019Cullum, </em>20 Johns. 288, 289, <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>65 N. Y. 528), but should be postponed to a time when it could lawfully be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The exception of the roads in part one that come within the provisions of part two, and the special arrangement as to their delivery, made them a part of the instrument; and in its construction all its parts must be considered, and each given its due weight in determining the intention of the parties. If the parties had not intended this to be so, and their purpose was to convey the Lowell\u2019s leased roads and those operated by it without regard to their being assignable or transferable, then they would not have made the exception in part one, and would have omitted part two altogether. The construction claimed, that part two makes a present conveyance of all the roads coming within its provisions, to take effect at any time when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the roads in part one might be delivered, renders the exception aimless and part two useless verbiage, as the same result would have been accomplished by omitting both the exception and part two; and if the property described in both' parts was conveyed, why was it not to be delivered- in the second at the same time as in the first, unless it was agreed and was the intention and understanding of the parties, as well as agreed that part two\u2019 should not take effect till the Lowell could lawfully deliver the property ?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">After the execution of the lease, and prior to October \u2022 11, the Lowell paid and the plaintiff received money as rent on its lease at four different times, amounting in all to the sum of $114,500, the last payment being\u2019 September 30, 1887- To meet the legal presumption arising from the execution of the lease, that it was delivered and took effect on the day of its execution, and to avoid the waiver of the forfeiture which would be thereby incurred,\" it is claimed as a fact that the Lowell and Maine made some arrangement not contained in the lease, by which it was not to take effect till there was the physical delivery of the property, which took place October 11, and that the lease did not take effect till that time, when it became operative, in all its parts. The arrangement sought to be established is found in the contemporaneous action and construction given to the lease by the parties to it, from its date to October 11, and the delivery then made, and the circumstances attending it. While these may tend to prove an arrangement that may avoid the waiver, they confirm beyond a doubt the interpretation of the lease, that part two was not to take effect till the roads coming* within its provisions could be lawfully and should be actually delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">June 24, 1887, two days after the date of the lease, the directors of the Maine passed the following vote, which was recorded : \u201c That under the lease to this company by the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation, the president is hereby authorized and instructed, for and in behalf of this company, to receive possession of the demised railroad and property (exceptas hereinafter stated) in such manner and at such times as may be agreed upon with the directors of said Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation; and that until said Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation can lawfully and without violation of agreement surrender to this company the possession and occupation of the roads and property now held and possessed by it under leases and contracts' with the Nashua &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation, the Central Massachusetts Railroad Company, and the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad Company, respectively, said Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation shall continue to hold and possess not only the roads and properties of said several companies, but also such equipment, supplies, materials, and other property as may be required to enable it to oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ate said leased and operated roads according to law and conform-ably to the obligations of said leases or contracts.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s road was within the provisions of part two. June 29, 1887, the Lowell directors passed and recorded the following vote: \u201c That under the lease by this corporation to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, when executed, the president is hereby authorized and instructed, for and on behalf of this corporation, to deliver possession of the demised railroad and property (except as hereinafter stated) in such manner and at such time as may be agreed upon with the directors of said Boston &amp; Maine Railroad; and that until this corporation can lawfully and without violation of agreement surrender to said Boston &amp; Maine Railroad the possession and occupation of the roads and property now held and possessed by this corporation under leases and contracts with the Nashua <em>&amp; </em>Lowell Railroad Corporation, the Central Massachusetts Railroad Company, the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad Company, the Stony Brook Railroad Corporation, and the Wilton Railroad Company, respectively, this corporation shall continue to hold and possess not only the roads and properties of said several companies, but also such equipment, supplies, materials, and other property as may be required to enable it to operate said leased and operated roads according to law, and conformably to the obligations of said leases or contracts, and shall continue to operate said leased railroads according to the terms of the said several leases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">September 28, 1887, the Boston &amp; Maine directors voted and recorded the following: \u201cThat the president is hereby authorized and instructed, in the name and behalf of this corporation, and as soon hereafter as he may deem it expedient, to take and receive possession of the premises and property\" of which this corporation is entitled to the present possession, under the terms and provisions of the lease of the Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad Corporation to this company, dated June 22, 1887.\u201d October 11, 1887, the president of the Lowell delivered to the president of the Maine the roads and property conveyed in part one, and did not deliver the roads then within the provisions of part two, of which the plaintiff\u2019s road and property were a part.

Lord and Edwin Morey, the presidents of the corporations, who made and received the delivery of the property and executed the receipt, is, in substance, that the roads which were then within the provisions of part two were not delivered, of which the Montreal was one, and that those which were within the provisions of part one were delivered; that they did not understand that the Maine was entitled to receive the delivery or possession of the plaintiff\u2019s road under the lease, or that the Lowell could deliver it without violation of law or agreement, and that it was understood by them October 11, when the other roads were delivered, that the Lowell was to continue in possession of the Montreal and operate it under the plaintiff\u2019s lease, and that- the\u2019Maine had nothing to do with it and that this understanding was practically executed by the Lowell\u2019s operating the road on its own direction after October 11, the same as it did before <em>; </em>that there was no delivery or change made in the operation of the plaintiff\u2019s road, because the contingency on which it was to be delivered had not occurred, and the road remained in the same legal and physical condition as to the plaintiff as it.did before October 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">The roads conveyed in part one were formally delivered October 11, and the lease took effect then as to them if it had not before,' but this did not affect the plaintiff\u2019s road. The contract with reference to that was entirely different. The agreement and conditions upon which it was to be delivered, and the time when it was to take effect, were different in this, that while in the first part the roads could be lawfully delivered at once without prejudice, in the second they could not without forfeiting the plaintiff\u2019s lease to the Lowell and doing great injury to its entire railroad system. This difference in the right and property of the Lowell in the different roads in its system was the reason why the parties made part second, and agreed that the lease as to the class of roads coming within its provisions should not take effect till they could be lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>delivered, although the lease could take effect at any time the parties might name as to the roads conveyed in part one.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">October 11, the consent of the plaintiff that the Lowell might assign its lease had not been obtained, and its roads and property were still ih a condition that they could not be delivered and have the lease take effect without a forfeiture, and they were not delivered, and the Lowell\u2019s lease did not take effect as to them, and the plaintiff\u2019s lease was not forfeited. The taking effect of part one, by the delivery of the property conveyed in it, did not affect part two, because under the agreement each part was to take effect on the delivery of the property conveyed in it. If the two parts had been written and executed separately as two instruments, but otherwise the same as now, no doubt would exist as to when and how each would take effect; and the intention of the parties being plain, a single signing would be sufficient, and the lease would take effect as to the property conveyed in part one when it was delivered, and as to the property in part two, when within a reasonable time thereafter the right was acquired to deliver it and a delivery could actually be made. This was the contemporaneous construction which the parties gave to the instrument. They delivered, October 11, the property which lawfully could be delivered on that day, and expressly excepted the property which came within the provisions of part two that they could not lawfully deliver. The lease as to part two was to take effect either on its execution, or, by the agreement of the parties, when the property described in it could and should be lawfully delivered. If it ever took effect as to that part, it was on its execution, as the property was not delivered, and could not have been lawfully before the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ.^ It may be claimed that the \u201c meanwhile \u201d arrangement provided for its operation till there could be a delivery, which created the relation of master and servant. The reply to this is, that no provision of part two took effect till they all did; it did not take effect piecemeal. All the provisions were to take effect on the delivery of the property, and not before.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The parties, in their settlement of October 11, under the \u201c to have and to hold\u201d arrangement of part one, construed it to mean, in substance, as the \u201c meanwhile \u201d arrangement in part two reads, by the Maine\u2019s taking all the earnings, paying the rentals, operating expenses, and providing against all liabilities incurred from April 1. In the plaintiff\u2019s view the Maine was the master or principal from the date of the lease to October 11, receiving all the earnings, and responsible for all the operating 'expenses, claims, and liabilities, and the Lowell was its servant operating the roads of part one for the Maine, receiving and to receive not what the roads earned for compensation, but the rental provided for in the lease, and the running of those roads by the Lowell for the Maine was settled and adjusted in this way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>October 11. Case, Book 2, <em>pp. </em>18, 20, Tuts. 19, 32. After <em>the </em>date of tbe lease till October 11, taking tbe plaintiff\u2019s view, it was immaterial to tbe Lowell, whether it paid the expenses of operation or not, as to the sum it was to receive for doing the work. In principle, the same legal relation existed between the Lowell and the Maine during this period which it is claimed existed between the Maine and the Lowell after October 11 as to the plaintiff\u2019s road: still it is said it is unimportant because the lease had not taken effect, that it was to take effect on delivery and not before. The same reply is equally pertinent, and an answer to the claims made as to the relations between the Maine and the Lowell after October 11. There had been no delivery of the roads in part two, and it was not to take effect till a delivery was made. The same relations,, both in law and in fact, continued to exist between the Lowell and the Maine, from October 11 to the date of the writ, that existed from the date of the lease till October 11. So far as the plaintiff\u2019s roads and property were concerned, no change had been made. The conclusion then is, if the lease did not take effect on its execution, it took effect as to the property conveyed in part one on its delivery October 11; and as to part two, the contingency stated in the lease not having occurred, the property coming within its provisions was not delivered, and the lease, as to it, had not taken effect at the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">For these reasons, as well as for total want of equity in the plaintiff\u2019s case, I am unable to assent to the opinion of the majority of the court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-6\">Allen and Blodgett, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
