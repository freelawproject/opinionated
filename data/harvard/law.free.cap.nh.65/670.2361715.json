The bill was dismissed upon a hearing, and the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b686-13\"><em>U. I).

Taking this to be so, no question of law is raised by the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the order of dismissal. Issues of fact arising in the trial term are properly for the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>determination of that term, and, consequently, when they are heard and decided there, the decision will not be revised here. To support a bill of exceptions, some legal error must be alleged and shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b687-5\">Carpenter, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
