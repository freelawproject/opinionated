Demurrer to the bill. Allegations of the bill: Mrs. Young died in Massachusetts May 7, 1889, intestate, owning land in this county, and leaving neither issue nor husband. The plaintiffs are her next of kin by blood, and are tenants in common of the land as her heirs unless the defendant has a better title. The defendant was legally adopted in Massachusetts, April 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>1884, by Warren H. Holt, wbo was the son and only issue o\u00a3 Mrs. Young. Holt died in Massachusetts before the death of his mother. The defendant, by his guardian (he being a minor) claims the land as heir of Mrs Young by virtue of her son\u2019s adoption of him; and his claim prevents the plaintiffs\u2019 selling the land for its value, and is a cloud upon their title. The prayer is for a decree that the premises are the plaintiffs\u2019 property, for an injunction against the defendant\u2019s setting up his claim, and for general relief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-4\"><em>O. H. Knight, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiR\">The defendant was adopted in Massachusetts, and his domicile is and always has been there, as well as that of Holt, his adopting parent, and that of Holt\u2019s mother, Mrs. Young, at the time of their decease. If, under these circumstances, he has any status here as an adopted child (Ross v. <em>Ross, </em>129 Mass. 248, 2451, his rights are limited by the Massachusetts statute under which he was adopted, and by which his status was established. <em>The Estate of Sunderland, </em>60 Iowa 732. \u201cAs to the succession to property, a person adopted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall take the same share of property which the adopting parent could have devised by will that he would have taken -if born to such parent in lawful wedlock, and he shall stand in regard to the legal descendants, but to no other of the kindred of such parent, in the same position as if so born to him.\u201d Pub. St. Mass., <em>c. </em>148, <em>s. </em>7. \u201c The intent of the statute was to put an adopted child, for all legal purposes, with certain carefully defined exceptions, in the place of a natural child.\u201d <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Bruerton, </em>148 Mass. 619, 620. Mrs. Young being the mother, and not a legal descendant, of Holt, the defendant has no title. <em>The Estate of Sunderland, supra; Safford </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>48 Vt. 236; <em>Quigley </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>41 Ohio St. 375; 9 Am.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuN\">Holt\u2019s mother outlived him and owned the land at the time of her death, and the plaintiffs are her next of kin. The defendant is Holt\u2019s adopted son. As Holt had no title, the land did not go to the defendant as Holt\u2019s heir. By the law of the defendant\u2019s adoption, he could inherit property which Holt \u201ccould have devised by will.\u201d This land Holt could not have devised. By the same law, \u201c as to the succession to property,\u201d the defendant stands, \u201c in regard to the legal descendants, but to no other of the kindred of\u201d Holt, in the same position as if he were Holt\u2019s son. This does not make him an heir of Holt\u2019s mother. No objection being made in argument to the form of action, the question of procedure has not been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-9\">Bingham, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
