Now before the Court are the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons set out below, the Court grants the agency's motion for summary judgment except as to PRD 260, 1095, 1108 and 1617, which EPA must disclose in full, and PRD 940 and 1449, which EPA must disclose in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

PEER also challenges the adequacy of EPA's explanations for non-segregability. The Court agrees with PEER that EPA used boilerplate, conclusory language to describe its efforts to segregate nonexempt, factual material from exempt material. Nearly every\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index entry includes the exact same language on the question of segregability.

This Court's inspection of the documents disputed in this case confirms that most of the records do not feature reasonably segregable factual information.

Because the Court personally reviewed each document and verified the applicability of Exemption 5 to the aforementioned records, no elaborate, individualized discussion of why each record is properly withheld is called for. The Court will, however, explain its conclusion as to PRD 240, which was primarily disputed on the grounds that drafting comments cannot be withheld unless explicitly linked to a policy deliberation or decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PEER Mot. at 3-6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    According to EPA, redacted portions of PRD 240 \"contain[ ] staff impressions and recommendations concerning how to draft [a] field report,\" which \"would be used by EPA to plan further action (if needed) at [SMMUSD].\"\n    <em>\n     See Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index 5/11/17, ECF No. 43-2. EPA contends that disclosure of redacted portions of this record may stifle internal discussions regarding \"how reports are drafted and what is included in reports\" and could cause public confusion \"by disclosure of reasons, rationales and conclusions that were not in fact ultimately part of the Field Report.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271565\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/1/#p22\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    PEER disputes EPA's application of Exemption 5, arguing primarily that EPA has not shown that the record is deliberative in nature and that this sort of document likely includes factual information that is not protected by the privilege. PEER Mot. at 3-6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Having reviewed the record, the Court confirms that it does not contain technical, factual material, but rather offers editorial suggestions concerning how to present information in a report. Generally, employee recommendations and suggestions are covered by the deliberative process privilege.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coastal States Gas Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n     617 F.2d at 866\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And our Circuit Court has clarified that editorial recommendations are protected. In the context of draft agency histories, for example, the Circuit has explained that Exemption 5 applies because \" 'disclosure of editorial judgments' made during the agency's deliberative process 'would stifle the creative thinking and candid exchange of ideas necessary to produce good historical work.' \"\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Sec.

Our Circuit Court has explained that FOIA does not permit an agency to parse a responsive record to redact specific information within it as non-responsive.
