Reeves, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendants have moved for summary judgment regarding all claims asserted by Plaintiff Mary Curtis. [Record No. 47] The defendants' motion will be granted because sovereign immunity protects Defendant Breathitt County Fiscal Court (\"BCFC\") from Curtis's state law claims and because Curtis has not presented sufficient proof to maintain federal constitutional claims against BCFC. And as explained more fully below, the defendants' motion will also be granted regarding all claims that Curtis has made against Defendant Mary Lois Stevens, the Breathitt County Court Clerk, and Defendant John Lester Smith, the Breathitt County Judge Executive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Many of the relevant facts are undisputed. Curtis is the current Breathitt County Clerk having taken office in November 2016. Before assuming this role, Curtis worked in the clerk's office for over 20 years. [Record No. 56, p. 4] In late July 2015, long-time Breathitt County Clerk Tony Watts informed the BCFC that he would be retiring for health reasons. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 4] At the time of this announcement, Curtis and three others were employed in the clerk's office. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 4.] Curtis was serving as the chief deputy clerk under Watts. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 4] Curtis was associated politically and affiliated with Clerk Watts. Additionally, she was his first cousin. [Record No. 56, p. 5] In his capacity as judge executive,\n   Smith had the sole responsibility to appoint the next county clerk. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 7] Watts asked Smith to appoint Curtis to the position; however, Smith instead appointed Harold Hutchinson in August 2015. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 10]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After taking office, Hutchinson changed Curtis's title from chief deputy clerk to deputy clerk and did not employ a chief deputy. [Record No. 56, p. 14] On August 4, 2015, pursuant to Ordinance No. 07212015, the BCFC instituted fee polling with the clerk's office and transferred all of the employees of that office into the county's payroll system. This action made them subject to the Breathitt County Administrative Code. [Record No. 44-1] As a result, all net income and fees from the clerk's office would be paid monthly to the county treasurer instead of excess fees being paid at the end of the year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The four clerk's office employees (Curtis, Martinez, Combs, and Fletcher) were appointed to the position of deputy clerk and their pay rates were set for payroll purposes. [Record No. 44-3, 44-4]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Curtis filed for the Breathitt County Clerk's position on Friday, November 6, 2015. [Record No. 56, p. 18] Hutchinson announced that he would be resigning, effective November 13, 2015. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 18] Curtis alleges that Hutchinson told her that he could not do to her what Smith wanted. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 16] But Hutchinson denies he ever said anything of the sort. [Record No. 44, p. 76] Smith again had the sole responsibility to appoint the next county clerk and decided to appoint Defendant Stevens rather than Curtis. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 5; 56, p. 19]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 13, 2015, newly-appointed county clerk Stevens came into the office and handed Martinez, Combs, and Fletcher an envelope containing a paper offering them a position of deputy clerk. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 6; 56, p. 19] Curtis did not receive an envelope and asked if she would be receiving one. Stevens responded in the negative, indicating that Curtis no longer had a job and that her services were no longer needed. [Record Nos. 47-1, p. 6; 56, p. 20] Curtis alleges that her termination was due to her political affiliation with former Clerk Watts. However, Stevens alleges the termination was due to budgetary reasons and because Curtis was receiving a significantly higher hourly rate than the other deputies. [Record No. 26, p. 28, lines 20-23; p. 30, lines 10-16]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Curtis asserts three state law claims, two based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and one based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, Curtis has failed to show such that a reasonable jury could conclude that\n   her First Amendment rights were violated by Stevens' decision to terminate her employment. While the Court accepts the plaintiff's factual allegations as true,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p456\">\n    504 U.S. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 456,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p456\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p456\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), Curtis has failed to show anything more than her affiliation with the former county clerk and Stevens' termination decision on the first day of her appointment as the new county clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Stevens maintains that she terminated Curtis for budgetary reasons and Curtis has not offered evidence to rebut that contention. Stevens indicated in her deposition that the reason for terminating Curtis was due to the fact that Curtis made significantly more per hour that the other deputy clerks. Stevens stated that \"if she brought my own [deputy], I had to get rid of one ... so I picked the highest paid one.\" [Record No. 26, p. 28, lines 20-23] After Stevens terminated Curtis, she brought in Courtney Hudson as her chief deputy at a lesser rate and raised all of the other deputies to the same amount. She stated that she equalized the deputy clerk's pay because \"it wasn't fair to pay somebody-I'm hiring new employees, not a 20 year veteran, a 10 year veteran, trained deputies. I don't see one trained deputy being worth $12 more an hour than another trained deputy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 30, lines 10-16. And while the plaintiff contends that Stevens allegedly acknowledged it would have been cheaper to have kept Curtis and brought in Courtney Hudson as her chief deputy, rather than giving everyone raises and hiring additional staff throughout the year, the argument fails to take into account Stevens previously identified reason for terminating Curtis: letting go of the person who made the most and then equalizing the pay of the other deputies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, the plaintiff contends that when Stevens came into the office and she was terminated, Stevens allegedly indicated that Curtis was the chief deputy and she did not need her because Stevens would be bringing in her own chief deputy. [Record No. 56, p. 21] This argument does little to bolster the plaintiff's argument that the termination was due solely to political affiliation. In fact, it does quite the opposite, and shows that Stevens allegedly thought that Curtis was the chief deputy and did not need her any longer because Stevens was bringing in her own person for that position. Curtis states that \"[c]learly, Mary Lois Stevens, when appointed, saw the opportunity to rid herself of the person most closely associated with her former political rival and did so even knowing that she was not the chief deputy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 36. In reality, the record does not clearly support this contention and Curtis does not \"point to specific, nonconclusory allegations linking [her] speech to employer discipline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Regarding Smith, Curtis was not subject to removal with approval by Smith and the fiscal court. While the fiscal court determines the maximum amount a county clerk may expend for deputies and assistants, the county clerk determines the number of deputies and assistants to be hired and the compensation of each such employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook v. Popplewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094043\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/394/323/#p338\">\n    394 S.W.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338 (Ky. 2011). The actual hiring or firing of the deputies resides with the county clerk. OAG 84-383. Nor did Smith terminate Curtis' employment. Stephens terminated Curtis's employment upon her taking office as the new county clerk. Curtis fails to address this distinction and even notes in her response that \"Mary Lois Stevens when appointed, saw the opportunity to rid herself of the person most closely associated with her former political rival and did so even knowing that\n   she was not the chief deputy.\" [Record No. 56, p. 36] Judge Smith did not terminate Curtis from her employment as a deputy clerk in the county clerk's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Official Capacity Claims Asserted Against Stevens and Smith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendants also argues that they are entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's constitutional claims asserted against them in their official capacity. [Record No. 47-1, p. 26] \"In an official capacity action, the plaintiff seeks damages not from the individual officer, but from the entity for which the officer is an agent.\"\n   <em>\n    Pusey v.

Stevens's duties as County Clerk did not require her to dismiss Curtis, and the plaintiff does not contend that Stevens was actually performing a ministerial function when she fired Curtis. Furthermore, Stevens was within her scope of authority when dismissing Curtis, a deputy clerk in the county clerk's office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

KRS \u00a7 67.710(7) grants the county judge executive the power \"to exercise with approval of the fiscal court the authority to appoint, supervise, suspend, and remove county personnel.\" However, Curtis was not subject to removal with approval by Smith and the fiscal court. As noted earlier in this opinion, the fiscal court determines the maximum amount a county clerk may expend for deputies and assistants, but the county clerk determines the number of deputies and assistants to be hired and the compensation of each.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094043\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/394/323/#p338\">\n    394 S.W.3d at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Upon taking office as the new county clerk, Stephens terminated Curtis. [Record No. 56, p. 36]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because Smith did not terminate Curtis from her employment there is no violation of KRS \u00a7 67.710(7). Furthermore, the statute only lists the powers and responsibilities of a county judge executive. It does not explicitly authorize suits for political discrimination against judge executives who violate its individual provisions.

In fact, she does not even mention Section 2 or Section 3 in her response to the motion for summary judgment. Curtis has not provided any legal support for a private cause of action for violation of the Kentucky Constitution, nor has she shown that she was treated unequally or without due process by Smith.

In\n   <em>\n    Grzyb v.

The\n   <em>\n    Grazyb\n   </em>\n   court also identified two situations in which discharging an at-will employee would be so contrary to public policy as to be actionable, despite the absence of \"explicit legislative statements prohibiting the discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9972886\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/700/399/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9972886\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/700/399/#p401\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, her response to the defendants motion for summary judgment does not even mention her wrongful termination claim or address the arguments raised by the defendants. Curtis has not identified a \"well-established legislative enactment\" creating a right that Curtis was fired for exercising.
