Plaintiffs seek to bring section 1983 claims against Defendants in their individual and official capacities under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, as well as a retaliation claim stemming from Plaintiff Cronin's exercise of his First Amendment rights. (Filing No. 19, Amended Complaint.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants have filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint (Filing No. 20) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims against the City and the Defendants in their official capacities must be dismissed for failure to allege that a policy or custom caused violations of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights (Filing No. 21 at CM/ECF pp. 3-6, 11-12); that Plaintiffs' allegations do not state any constitutional claims (Filing No. 21 at CM/ECF pp. 6-9); that the Defendants in their individual capacities are entitled to qualified immunity from suit (Filing No. 21 at CM/ECF pp. 9-11, 12-14); and that Defendant Assistant City Attorney Tonya Peters is entitled to either absolute or qualified immunity (Filing No. 21 at CM/ECF pp. 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Timothy Cronin and Joshua Fullerton are police officers with the City of Lincoln Police Department (\"LPD\"). Defendant Chris Peterson is a LPD captain; James Peschong is the chief of the LPD; Brian Jackson is the assistant chief of the LPD; Tonya Peters is a City of Lincoln assistant city attorney who is assigned to the LPD as the police legal advisor; and William Koepke and Daren Reynolds are LPD sergeants. Plaintiffs allege that all of the Defendants are \"vested by virtue of [their] position[s] with the City with the power and authority to formulate and enforce the custom and practices which resulted in violations of [P]laintiffs' constitutional rights....\" (Filing No. 19, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After having worked under Defendant Peterson's supervision in the LPD narcotics unit, Plaintiff Cronin moved to uniform patrol, where he continued to perform narcotics investigations. When Cronin began to \"have success\" with narcotics arrests and seizures, Peterson \"began a pattern and practice of interference and harassment\" against Cronin, including contacting his supervisors and attempting to stop his investigations. (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cronin first alleges that in July 2014, Peterson attempted to interfere with Cronin's application to attend specialized training called \"Desert Snow\" by privately contacting Defendant Peschong, chief of the LPD, and lobbying against Cronin attending the training after the selection committee had already informed Cronin that he had been selected to attend. (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 25-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2014, Cronin filed a complaint against Peterson with LPD's personnel sergeant based on Peterson's alleged discrimination, harassment, and creation of a hostile work environment, and the complaint was forwarded to the Lincoln Commission on Human Rights for investigation. Cronin claims that the City of Lincoln did not throughly investigate his claim against Peterson. (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   More than a year later-in September 2015-Defendant Jackson, assistant chief of the LPD, told Cronin he had received a complaint alleging that Cronin had interfered with an Ohio illegal-steroid investigation. Cronin had a friend from Powell, Ohio, who owned a nutrition and supplement store, and from whom Cronin had previously purchased nutritional supplements\"in conjunction with lifting weights, working out, and overall fitness.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6 37.) Cronin's friend had been accused of selling illegal steroids, and Cronin had corresponded with him via text messages regarding the investigation and \"reminding him of his rights in dealing with the police.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6 38.) As a result of these text messages, a member of the Powell, Ohio, police department told Jackson that Cronin was interfering with their investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Also in September 2015, Peschong \"and/or\" Jackson turned over the text messages to Peterson, who then used the texts to again harass, discriminate, and retaliate against Cronin for the complaint Cronin had filed against Peterson with the LPD personnel sergeant. Cronin claims that Peterson's actions based on \"mere text messages were contrary to the past practice and usual and ordinary actions taken by the Lincoln Police Department based upon similar information.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6 44.) For example, Peterson failed to contact the DEA, conduct internet searches, or otherwise investigate whether the supplements at issue in Ohio were legal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In investigating Cronin, Peterson allegedly obtained the assistance of Defendants Peters, Koepke, and Reynolds. On September 28, 2015, Defendant Koepke detained\n   Cronin in a conference room at the LPD's Center Team Station, where Koepke told Cronin he was being criminally investigated, but the interview was not recorded by audio or video, contrary to LPD policy. Cronin alleges that Koepke advised him that \"he was not under arrest but he was not free to leave\"; did not advise him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights; allowed Cronin to call his legal counsel, but refused to leave the room so Cronin could consult with counsel privately; and when Cronin's counsel arrived, he was not allowed to meet with Cronin. (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 47-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Using statements obtained from Koepke's interview with Cronin, Peterson applied for search warrants for Cronin's home, vehicle, blood, urine, and cellular phone with \"critical information omitted,\" such as Koepke's opinion that the substances referenced in the text messages were legal and Cronin's statement that he did not have any of the substances at issue at his house. Defendant Assistant City Attorney Peters, who allegedly knew or should have known that the information used in the search-warrant applications was obtained in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , assisted with the preparation of the search warrants. (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 55-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cronin alleges that several searches supported by warrants then occurred. First, as part of Koepke's six-hour detention of Cronin, Koepke transported him to a hospital for a test of his blood and urine, the latter of which was obtained by threatening Cronin with the insertion of a catheter into his penis if he did not comply. Next, without seeing a search warrant, Defendant Reynolds and \"other officers\" searched Cronin's house \"with nothing illegal located.\" Likewise, Reynolds executed a search warrant for Cronin's 2015 Toyota 4 Runner on a completely different vehicle-Cronin's 2009 Ford Escape-for which Reynolds had no probable cause or consent to search, and in which Reynolds found nothing. Officers also allegedly searched Cronin's police vehicle and locker, neither of which contained illegal substances. (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 58-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 28, 2015 (the same day as Cronin's detention), Plaintiff \"Fullerton was contacted at his home and voluntarily turned over the substances he had obtained through Cronin.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6 71.) The next day, Peterson contacted Fullerton to request an interview, during which Fullerton was not read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Garrity\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, was allowed to call counsel upon request, but was manipulated into talking to Peterson outside the presence of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that search warrants or subpoenas were also obtained for Cronin's and Fullerton's cellular phone records, Cronin's personnel records, and Cronin's personal financial information, and that Cronin's cellular phone was seized on September 28, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 6, 2015, Cronin's blood and urine tests came back negative for illegal substances, and on October 8, 2015, the substances seized from Fullerton were determined to contain nothing illegal. On October 9, 2015-and without evidence that any of Cronin's text messages referred to illegal substances-members of the LPD \"destroyed Cronin's phone in an alleged effort to extract any information card or chip within the device,\" thereby destroying Cronin's personal family photographs, including his newborn daughter, and other sensitive personal information. The phone chip was sent to an outside source for \"potential extraction,\" but \"no evidence was able to be obtained or extracted.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 78-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite the fact that Peterson was unable to link Cronin to any illegal activities, he continued his investigation for the next several months, including a December 2015 trip to Powell, Ohio, to conduct a follow-up investigation which yielded no evidence of Cronin's involvement with illegal steroids. In January 2016, Peterson requested and received \"items\" that had been seized by the Powell, Ohio, police department and took them to the Nebraska State Laboratory to be tested for the presence of illegal substances. (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 89-93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For several months thereafter, Peterson asked unidentified prosecutors to bring charges against Cronin, but \"[a]ll prosecutors declined to pursue charges because of a lack of evidence Cronin violated any laws or was ever involved in illegal steroids.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.) After prosecutors refused to bring criminal charges, Defendants City of Lincoln, Peschong, and Jackson began an internal-affairs investigation of Plaintiffs Cronin and Fullerton. In a meeting between Cronin and Defendant Jackson regarding that investigation, Jackson allegedly told Cronin he would be \"exonerated\" if Cronin agreed not to pursue legal action and that Cronin should \"let this go.\" Jackson admitted to Cronin that \"the investigation could have 'been handled better.' \" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs state in their Amended Complaint that Defendants have \"made defamatory remarks to other officers, friends, and members of the public, claiming that Cronin and Fullerton are 'dirty' or otherwise impugning their reputation.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants City of Lincoln, Peschong, and Jackson knew or should have known that the searching officers lacked probable cause, but instead actively assisted with \"the investigation and illegal activities engaged in by Peterson, Koepke, and Reynolds in support of the pattern and practice of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation spearheaded by Peterson.\" Further, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants City of Lincoln, Peschong, and Jackson knew or should have known that \"the pattern and practice of conduct by Peterson was discriminatory and harassing,\" but they \"failed to do anything to ensure Cronin was free from a hostile work environment and retaliation from the prior complaint.\" Finally, Plaintiffs assert that all Defendants' actions \"were done pursuant to the custom and practice formulated and enforced by Defendants and were within the course and scope of their respective positions as employees of the City of Lincoln and under color of law.\" (Filing No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 97, 100-01.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a result of the stress caused by Peterson's investigation, harassment, and discrimination, Cronin alleges he suffered physical symptoms. Further, Defendants Peschong and Jackson have allegedly denied Cronin opportunities for career advancement and specialized positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
