BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case revolves around a decades-old family saga that, as this Court observed in a previous Opinion, reads like the plot of one of John le Carr\u00e9's Cold War novels. It opens in 1996 with the airport assassinations of Yevgenyi Scherban, a Ukrainian politician and businessman, and Nadejda Nikitina, his wife. Scherban left more than $100 million behind, along with three sons-Evgenyi, Ruslan, and Yevgen-who have since engaged in a global hunt for their missing inheritance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This latest chapter concerns but a small sliver of the family fortune-namely, one savings account held with Defendant SunTrust Bank at its Boca Raton, Florida, branch. Scherban opened this account around 1994 and deposited more than a million dollars into it. In 2003, the account was apparently closed with no funds remaining, but SunTrust has little explanation for what happened to its balance. More than twelve years later, Plaintiffs brought a twelve-count Complaint, alleging foul play. The Court has since dismissed all but two of those counts, leaving one claim for accounting and one for fraudulent concealment. After protracted discovery, both parties now moves for summary judgment. The Court will grant SunTrust's Motion, thereby closing the book on the Bank's role in this unfortunate tale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court outlined the Scherban family history in detail in its previous Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trudel v. SunTrust Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76-81 (D.D.C. 2016). It therefore limits the discussion here to the aforementioned savings account (with terminal digits 5216) and its often puzzling transactions. As SunTrust ultimately prevails, the Court recounts these facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, except to note disputes where relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the outset, the parties debate when exactly Scherban opened this joint savings account. Plaintiffs plead that he did so around 1994, while SunTrust suggests it was opened on March 1, 1995.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint (SAC), \u00b6 38\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79 (Def. MSJ), Exh. 3 (Affidavit of John A. Barry), \u00b6 5. The ownership of that account is also somewhat murky, but the Court has assumed (to Plaintiffs' benefit) that Scherban designated two direct beneficiaries on the account: Nikitina and Ruslan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trudel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Regardless of Ruslan's ownership status, he alleges that he \"was not involved in managing\" the account, \"did not get any copies of any statements from SunTrust,\" and did not review any such statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31-9 (First Affidavit of Ruslan E. Scherban), \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 10. He lacked\n   this knowledge because Scherban's assistant, Alexei Alexeenko, was tasked with keeping tabs on the family's American financial interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10 (identifying Alexeenko as the \"manager\" of the account and speculating that copies of statements from SunTrust were \"withheld by Alexeenko, who ... concealed various documentation from [Ruslan] and from the two other heirs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With Ruslan left in the dark, the account's balance slowly dwindled. Before Scherban's and Nikitina's deaths on November 3, 1996, Plaintiffs pled that the 5216 account contained over one million dollars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 41. On December 17 of that year, SunTrust received a fax signed \"N. Nikitina\" requesting that the Bank transfer via wire $282,000 from Account 5216 to a Czech Republic bank account held by a corporation, Gwynfe Holding Limited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. Among other suspicious circumstances (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Nikitina was deceased), the fax misspelled the name of the Czech bank and did not use SunTrust's wire-transfer form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. Yet SunTrust employees approved the transfer anyway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 48-51. The family discovered in 2014 or 2015 that Gwynfe was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands until its dissolution sometime after 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. In addition to suing SunTrust here, Plaintiffs named Gwynfe as a Defendant, and the Clerk of Court recently entered default against it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99. That transfer and Gwynfe's culpability, however, are not before the Court now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Given the counts that remain, the current controversy instead centers on one question: what happened to the remaining $812,215.93 in the account? The answer is elusive. According to SunTrust, any records related to the 5216 account are long gone, as it retained such information for only seven years after closing the account. Plaintiffs have pieced together several old bank statements, but those records paint only an incomplete picture of the account's activity. A June 30, 1997, statement, for example, shows an unexplained $50,000 debit, leaving a balance (after accrual of interest) of approximately $771,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46-5 (Pl. Opp. to MTD), Exh. A. Then, a statement dated March 31, 2001, shows $3,773.04 remaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 71-2 (Pl. Reply to Mot. to Reopen Discovery), Exh. 5. SunTrust has little explanation of how roughly $767,000 went missing over those nearly four years, other than casually pinning the blame on Alexeenko.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 5. For their part, Plaintiffs seem to allege that the Bank has squirreled away the cash.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 62-65. Finally, SunTrust reports that the account \"was closed\" in January 22, 2003, apparently with no money remaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 3. It again offers no explanation of where the $3,733 balance went, other than speculating that the funds \"were withdrawn,\" perhaps by Ruslan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 87 (Def. Opp. to Pl. MSJ) at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Adding to the intrigue, Plaintiffs have also discovered a June 2002 letter, purportedly from SunTrust, sent to lawyers for Nikitina's estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81-5 (Pl. MSJ), Exh. B. The letter reports that there has been no \"client-initiated\" activity in the account since March 1, 1995 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the day SunTrust says that Scherban opened the account), and that the Bank's statements were repeatedly returned in the mail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant has no record of sending this letter, which contradicts Plaintiffs' own evidence showing withdrawals from the account between 1997 and 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 6, 2015, the three sons and Scherban's and Nikitina's estates filed the present lawsuit against Defendants\n   SunTrust, Alexeenko, Gwynfe, and Does 1 through 10 (ten unnamed individuals, including Gwynfe employees, who had facilitated the allegedly fraudulent transfer).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. Since then, this suit has undergone several metamorphoses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One month after filing, Plaintiffs apparently feared that the Court lacked personal jurisdiction over Alexeenko, and so they stipulated to dismissing him without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11 (Notice of Voluntary Dismissal). Then, following SunTrust's first motion to dismiss, the Court issued an Opinion instructing Plaintiffs to remove the estates as parties, as estates cannot bring a direct suit, and to designate instead the proper personal representative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Scherban v. SunTrust Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20777913\">\n    2016 WL 777913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 26, 2016). The Second Amended Complaint, which is operative here, named Deborah Trudel (the estate representative), Ruslan, Evgenyi, and Yevgen as Plaintiffs. The Court subsequently dismissed these latter two sons, as there was no allegation that either shared a legal interest in the 5216 account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trudel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d at 81-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The remaining two Plaintiffs (Trudel and Ruslan) brought twelve counts in tow, each largely related to the Bank's handling of the account between 1996 and 2003. While Tolstoy once observed that \"the two most powerful warriors are patience and time,\" neither served Plaintiffs terribly well here. On December 12, 2016, this Court dismissed the lion's share of their Complaint, holding that Counts I-VII and XII were all untimely.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These claims-including conversion or confiscation, breach of contract, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, money had and received, and constructive trust-thus all fell by the wayside.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court also dismissed counts for declaratory relief (Count IX) and civil conspiracy (Count XI) for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    at 90-91, 94-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That left only two counts standing: one for accounting (Count VIII) and one for fraudulent concealment (Count X). Both sides have now moved for summary judgment on the whittled-down claims but not before fighting myriad battles over discovery. The Court describes those disputes in more detail below, but given that history, it is not surprising that Plaintiffs have alternatively moved under Rule 56(d) to forestall summary judgment until they can conduct even more discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"When faced with cross-motions for summary judgment, the [C]ourt must review each motion separately on its own merits 'to determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Family Trust of Mass., Inc. v.

The closest they come is\n   their allegation that SunTrust \"knew that both account holders were foreigners, with next to no knowledge of English.\" Pl. Opp. to MSJ at 8. Under that theory, as soon as SunTrust opened an account for non-local, non-English-speaking customers, it necessarily assumed a fiduciary relationship. Plaintiffs cite no authority for that proposition, however, and the caselaw belies it. To establish a fiduciary relationship, Plaintiffs must submit \"substantial evidence showing some dependency by one party\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   some undertaking by the other party to advise, counsel, and protect the weaker party.\"\n   <em>\n    Lanz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7382950\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/764/176/#p179\">\n    764 F.Supp. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). At most, Plaintiffs have claimed (without evidence) that SunTrust knew that they were dependent on the Bank, but they offer no allegation (much less evidence) that it agreed to advise, counsel, or protect them. Instead, their relationship with Defendant appears typical of any bank with its customer: Scherban opened a savings account, deposited money, and could have withdrawn sums as needed; there is no evidence that he contracted for any special treatment or extra services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same result obtains even if Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    expected\n   </em>\n   SunTrust to protect their interests, as \"[t]he fact that one party places trust or confidence in the other does not create a confidential relationship in the absence of some recognition, acceptance or undertaking of the duties of a fiduciary on the part of the other party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jaffe v.

Indeed, a contrary rule would have absurd results: no bank could serve a foreign customer-or one with limited English proficiency-without automatically assuming a host of concomitant responsibilities.

The Florida Supreme Court has made clear that the 12-year statute of repose applies to fraudulent-concealment claims, running as soon as \"the defendant's last act or omission\" occurs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6846873\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/687/#p698\">\n    175 So.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 698 (Fla. 2015). So when was the \"last act or omission\" here? Under Plaintiffs' theory, SunTrust's last omission giving rise to its fraudulent-concealment claim occurred on May 1, 2001-the date by which the Bank should have notified Florida of any funds left in the 5216 account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 13. At the latest, the Court might assume that Defendant's last culpable act was in January 22, 2003, when it allegedly closed the 5216 account without either a) escheating the money to Florida or b) informing Plaintiffs that money remained. Even including that later act, however, the time limit expired by January 22, 2015, ten months before the current lawsuit arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   True, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant committed further acts of fraudulent concealment through its allegedly misleading disclosures during litigation in this case. The Florida Supreme Court has held that \"where there is evidence of the defendant's wrongful conduct within the repose period, the statute of repose will not bar a plaintiff's fraudulent concealment claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6846873\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/687/#p698\">\n    175 So.3d at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   none of SunTrust's allegedly wrongful conduct occurred \"\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the repose period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6846873\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/687/#p698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). A statute of repose \"effect[s] a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    CTS Corp. v. Waldburger\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581203\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2175/#p2183\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2183,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581203\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2175/#p2183\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, once twelve years has passed since the last culpable act, the \"statute of repose extinguishes that cause of action altogether.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Auto Serv. Ctrs., Inc. v. F/R 550, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800304,6800276\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/192/498/\">\n    192 So.3d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). Here, Plaintiffs allege a wrongful act on January 22, 2003, and then offer no indication of any foul play during the ensuing twelve years. The statute of repose thus kicked in on January 22, 2015, and Trudel and Ruslan cannot revive that claim from the dead by tacking on allegations of misconduct that occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the clock had run out. The Court must therefore reject their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment brought on that basis, and it similarly determines that a rewriting of this count does not prevent summary judgment being awarded to SunTrust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    2. Failure to Follow Internal Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs also suggest that SunTrust violated its own record-retention policies. Specifically, they cite an internal policy of retaining \"[r]ecords related to escheated/abandoned property [for] 20 years.\" Pl. MSJ at 16. Because the Bank kept records relating to the 5216 account for only seven years, Plaintiffs ask the Court to hold as a matter of law that it \"failed and/or refused to comply with its own\" policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. This is an odd request, and one that need not detain the Court for long. As explained above, SunTrust never treated the property in the account as abandoned or escheated, so it had no reason to retain the records for 20 years. And, in any event, Plaintiffs supply no explanation for why SunTrust's violation of its own internal policy would give rise to any cause of action (much less one for fraudulent concealment). The Court thus cannot provide any relief on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    3. Failure to Disclose Third-Party Relationships\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That brings the Court back to where it started: SunTrust's allegedly misleading disclosures during litigation. To refresh the reader, Plaintiffs previously alleged that they had sought information about the various Scherban holdings from SunTrust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 91. Defendant repeatedly responded that it had \"reviewed the records at SunTrust Bank to determine if there were any accounts\" and concluded that it \"no longer has any records in its system.\" ECF No. 38-1 (Affidavit of John A. Barry), \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93 (quoting Barry Affidavit). According to Ruslan and Trudel, these representations omitted the crucial fact that SunTrust never held on to information for closed accounts in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 94. Old account information would thus not be \"at\" the Bank or in \"its system.\" Instead, Plaintiffs alleged that SunTrust outsourced its archiving services, first to Iron Mountain Information Management LLC and, beginning in February 2002, to Viewpointe Archives Services LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 95-96. Under this theory, Defendant should have directed Plaintiffs to Iron Mountain or Viewpointe to search for their account information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 97-99. This omission, Plaintiffs said, crippled their protracted search for their assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 166-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To proceed on that basis, Plaintiffs must show that (1) Defendant concealed or failed to disclose a material fact, (2) it knew or\n   should have known that fact should have been disclosed, (3) it knew that its concealment or nondisclosure would induce Plaintiffs to act, (4) it had a duty to disclose the fact, and (5) Plaintiffs detrimentally relied on the misinformation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6846873\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/687/#p698\">\n    175 So.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris USA, Inc. v.

Dist. Ct. App. 2010). The Court previously found Plaintiffs' Complaint had sufficiently stated a claim on this count but cautioned that \"[i]t may be the case that [the] undisclosed facts about outside vendors are not ultimately material or harmful (especially given that those companies may have discarded the relevant files).\"\n   <em>\n    Trudel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   And so it came to be. After Plaintiffs subpoenaed Viewpointe, the company informed them that, while it \"maintains a check archive on behalf of SunTrust, in which SunTrust stores checks drawn on its accounts,\" it found no records related to Scherban's various accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. 11 (Affidavit of James Randolph Thomas), \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh. A at 2-3. This comes as no surprise because, as Plaintiffs themselves admit, \"[T]he joint savings account ending 5216, at issue here, has had no checking privilege.\" Pl. Opp. to Def. MSJ at 35. Viewpointe thus could not possibly have maintained a check archive for that account, and it follows that SunTrust did not \"conceal[ ] or fail[ ] to disclose a material fact\" when it declined to mention its relationship with that vendor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6846873\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/687/#p698\">\n    175 So.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Plaintiffs now criticize SunTrust for\n   <em>\n    allowing\n   </em>\n   them to subpoena Viewpointe in the first place, as such action has proved \"a waste of time and resources.\" Pl. Opp. to Def. MSJ at 35. Needless to say, they seem to have abandoned any claim related to Defendant's\n   <em>\n    concealing\n   </em>\n   its relationship with that company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   That leaves Iron Mountain. In its subpoena response, the company reported that it had located a now-defunct Customer ID number \"for SunTrust's branch at 800 S. Federal Highway, Boca Raton, FL 33432.\" Def. MSJ, Exh. 10 at 1. Its account with SunTrust, however, \"is inactive and has been for several years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"All inventory was either permanently withdrawn or destroyed and Iron Mountain no longer has access to this account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As the vendor never retained \"file level\" information for its customers, it is unable to determine \"what was in any individual carton stored.\" In other words, it cannot confirm or deny whether it ever stored records related to Account 5216 (or any other Scherban account). Iron Mountain can say definitively, however, that if it did house such records, it no longer does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Given that Iron Mountain has \"discarded the relevant files,\" this Court, too, must jettison Plaintiffs' fraudulent-concealment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trudel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270674\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/71/#p76\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At best, SunTrust knew all along that the vendor had no relevant files, and they thus never concealed or failed to disclose a material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6846873\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/687/#p698\">\n    175 So.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At worst, it believed that Iron Mountain could have records and did not disclose such fact to Plaintiffs. But Trudel and Ruslan's reliance (if any) on that representation was not detrimental. As an initial matter, Plaintiffs never took SunTrust's word that it \"no longer has any records in\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   system.\" Instead, they diligently conducted their own search for those documents, ultimately issuing subpoenas to the vendor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exhs. 10, 11. In any event, even had SunTrust disclosed its relationship with Iron Mountain, that company would have no relevant records for Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Indeed, Plaintiffs do little to defend their fraudulent-concealment claim, instead devoting fewer than two pages to\n   \"SunTrust's Declination to Produce Contractual Documents\" relating to Iron Mountain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. to Def. MSJ at 33. They hint at opposing summary judgment only by maintaining (without explanation) that \"whether or not SunTrust in fact has had a contractual relationship with Iron Mountain\" has \"ripened into a triable issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. It is Civil Procedure 101, however, that parties must have a \"dispute about a\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   fact [that] is genuine\" to proceed to trial.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    477 U.S. at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Here, Plaintiffs may dispute SunTrust's relationship with Iron Mountain, as Trudel and Ruslan have repeatedly asked the Bank to produce its contract and retention agreement with the vendor, but \"SunTrust continued to deny that it has ever had a contract with Iron Mountain and has produced none.\" Pl. Opp. to Def. MSJ at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This dispute, however, proves immaterial to resolving Plaintiffs' claim. As discussed above, regardless of whether SunTrust once contracted with Iron Mountain to store data, the latter no longer maintains records related to the 5216 account. While Plaintiffs level plenty of shots against SunTrust, they do nothing to impugn\n   <em>\n    Iron Mountain's\n   </em>\n   veracity, nor do they allege that the vendor might still actually maintain records of the account. The Court therefore concludes that there is no dispute of \"material fact[s]\" related to the fraudulent-concealment count, as none of the points in contention is capable of \"affect[ing] the outcome of the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 247-48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\").

In a now-familiar pattern, SunTrust objected to each deposition, except to one for a corporate designee, as they related to the claims that had been dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Plaintiffs countered that the causes of action were dismissed \"without prejudice,\" and they believed this discovery could prove fruitful in amending their Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 75 (Pl. Opp. to Protective Order) at 3. In an abundance of caution, the Court denied SunTrust's Motion for a Protective Order on August 15, 2017, allowing the depositions to proceed during the ensuing month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Perhaps not surprisingly, each deposition had hiccups (including scheduling difficulties due to Hurricane Irma), but the crux of the parties' dispute turns on the deposition of SunTrust's corporate designee. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6), a plaintiff may depose an organization (like SunTrust) and \"describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination.\" That organization must then designate at least one officer to \"testify about information known or reasonably available to the organization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs so moved, and after amending the scope of this deposition several times, sought a person knowledgeable about (1) the archiving and handling of accounts at SunTrust's 800 S. Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida, branch; (2) \"Dispatch of archived materials\" from that branch with Iron Mountain; (3) the branch's contract with Iron Mountain; (4) how the branch handled the Scherban-Nikitina family accounts; (5) the branch's authority to implement outgoing wire transfers per instructions received by fax; (6) \"Operation of the 'ARGO Sales and Service' \" software used at the branch, \"including but not limited to incorporation of the data system used in 1995-2003, data archiving, procedure for access, logs-in and retrievals of data missing for any reason\"; and (7) operations of the branch's Departments of Dormant Accounts and of Returned Mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 76 (Pl. Mot. to Compel), Exh. A at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   SunTrust ultimately selected John Barry as its corporate designee (the same counsel and former Vice President who also testified in his individual capacity). To prepare, Barry apparently consulted an employee with SunTrust's Operations Center in Richmond, Virginia, to gain additional information on the Argo Software\n   System, which ran Channel Link, the company's internal banking system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 84 (Def. Opp. to Mot. to Compel), Exh. A (Deposition of John Barry) at 8-10. He asked that employee (1) to do another search for the Scherbans in the Bank's Channel Link system, (2) to explain the precursor bank systems before Channel Link, including one known as the A.M. Teller System, and (3) to describe what the department would do to recover missing information from Channel Link.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on those conversations (and his personal knowledge), Barry testified to some of the basics regarding Channel Link, including how employees logged in, how the software recorded such log-ins, and any modifications to data on that interface.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-38. When pressed, however, he struggled to answer more technical questions about the Channel Link servers and software.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   After SunTrust declined to supplement Barry's testimony, Plaintiffs moved to compel it to produce a \" Rule 30(b)(6) witness who is duly prepared and who is in a position to answer questions, at least on the groups of questions Nos. 6 and 7 in the Notice of the Deposition.\" ECF No. 76 at 19. They also asked this Court to order SunTrust to supplement its discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e), which requires parties to provide additional discovery upon learning that its previous disclosures were \"incomplete or incorrect\" \"in some material respect.\" Specifically, Trudel and Ruslan asked the Court to compel Defendant to (1) supplement, remove redactions, or provide a privilege log with respect to SunTrust's retention policy, and (2) produce extracts from its in-house technical operating instructions for archiving and deleting data regarding accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mot. to Compel at 19\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While that Motion was pending, SunTrust moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs responded with the instant Rule 56(d) Motion, asking the Court to put the proceedings on ice until the Bank complied with their additional discovery requests. The Court turns now to that Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    2. Rule 56(d) Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Under Rule 56(d), a court may defer considering a motion for summary judgment, deny the motion, or allow time for the non-movant to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery if that party \"shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\" Such an affidavit must state \"with sufficient particularity why additional discovery is necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Folliard v. Gov't Acquisitions, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110043,4183933\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/19/\">\n    764 F.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the non-movant's affidavit must: (1) \"outline the particular facts the non-movant intends to discover and describe why those facts are necessary to the litigation,\" (2) \"explain why the non-movant could not produce the facts in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,\" and (3) \"show the information is in fact discoverable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110043,4183933\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/19/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs fail on the first prong. Although they allege a bevy of discovery deficiencies, they cannot show why any of those missing facts are \"necessary\" to the litigation. To wit, Plaintiffs seek the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 To depose another Rule 30(b)(6) witness who is more familiar with the ARGO system, as well as the operations of the Boca Raton branch's Departments of Dormant Accounts and of Returned Mail;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 An unredacted version of SunTrust's policies regarding data retention (or a\n   privilege log justifying the redacted versions); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 Extracts from the in-house operating instructions for archiving and deleting data concerning the accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Pl. Rule 56(d) Mot. at 20. Each of these requests relates, at bottom, to SunTrust's data-retention practices and whether the Bank might still retain (or could recover) information pertaining to Scherban-family accounts. Plaintiffs proffer testimony from four purported IT experts, who attest that the \"accounts' data\" is likely \"recoverable by the IT engineers,\" and that the experts are \"nearly certain ... that the data on the accounts is still contained on SunTrust's servers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110043,4183933\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/19/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Had SunTrust complied with their discovery obligations, they theorize, \"that would have been discovered very quickly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110043,4183933\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/19/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court sympathizes with Plaintiffs' frustration that SunTrust cannot account for their missing million dollars. Even if the most likely culprit is Alexeenko,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , First Scherban Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 10; SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86, it is not unreasonable that they should expect the Bank to shed more light on what transpired. Unfortunately for Trudel and Ruslan, however, the Court's summary-judgment ruling does not turn on whether SunTrust might still recover data from the 5216 account. Rather, even assuming the Bank could do so, the Court granted judgment on the accounting count because no fiduciary relationship exists between the parties. Likewise, it rejected Plaintiffs fraudulent-concealment theories given the statute of repose and discovery showing that neither Iron Mountain nor Viewpointe retains relevant records. At this stage, it is simply irrelevant to these counts whether SunTrust still retains or could recover more information about the 5216 account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In the end, Rule 56(d) is \"intended to prevent railroading a non-moving party through a premature motion for summary judgment before the non-moving party has had the opportunity to make full discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Milligan v. Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270112\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/266/17/#p18\">\n    266 F.R.D. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (D.D.C. 2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Plaintiffs had a full opportunity to conduct discovery on their remaining claims-and, indeed, the Court has granted them significant latitude to do so. Based on that discovery, the Court has all the information needed to rule on summary judgment, and none of Plaintiffs' proposed avenues for discovery could yield facts that would change the outcome. The Court therefore must deny their Rule 56(d) Motion, as well as their related Motion to Compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Leave to Amend\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, in their Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs \"reserve[ ]\" their \"request to be allowed to re-amend the pleadings after the phase of discovery.\" Pl. Opp. to Def. MSJ at 36. As the D.C. Circuit has often reiterated, however, \"[A] request for leave [to amend] must be submitted in the form of a written motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Benoit v. U.S. Dep't of Agric.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550764,3687231\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/608/17/\">\n    608 F.3d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; second alteration in original). Moreover, \"[i]t is well-established in this district that a plaintiff cannot amend his Complaint in an opposition to a defendant's motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Jo v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906121\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/582/51/#p64\">\n    582 F.Supp.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 (D.D.C. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    DSMC, Inc. v. Convera Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879891\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/479/68/#p84\">\n    479 F.Supp.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (D.D.C. 2007) (rejecting plaintiff's attempt to broaden claims and thereby amend complaint in opposition to summary-judgment motion). Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend here (which they acknowledge also fails to include \"a proposed amended pleading\") is therefore improper, and the Court denies it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants SunTrust summary judgment and denies Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion. It also denies Plaintiffs' Motion for Relief under Rule 56(d), as well as their related Motion to Compel. A contemporaneous Order to that effect will issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
