COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Robert McNeil fashions himself a \"21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Century American Revolutionary.\" The target of his revolt is the federal income tax. And his tactics focus on litigation against the Internal Revenue Service, specifically its efforts to collect taxes from him and other individuals who, for whatever their reasons, feel relieved of their duties as citizens to file federal income tax returns. In the past three years, McNeil and a compatriot, Michael Ellis, have been responsible for the filing of at least 13 duplicative lawsuits in this district. They have filed six of these suits themselves. The other seven, including this one, were filed by individuals who McNeil acknowledges recruiting through his website. But while these separate suits were ostensibly brought by new plaintiffs, McNeil openly admits to preparing the complaints and various court filings in these cases themselves. All of these suits allege that the IRS is engaged in a criminal scheme to falsify records associated with non-filers or to misrepresent the process by which the IRS assesses their tax liability. Every case has either been dismissed under the Anti-Injunction Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207421\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which bars suits that have the effect of interfering with the collection of taxes, or is still pending. The D.C. Circuit has affirmed every dismissal that has been appealed. McNeil and Ellis nevertheless boast that more suits are on the way. The United\n   States, seeking to stem the tide of vexatious litigation, has filed a counterclaim in this case seeking a nationwide injunction barring McNeil and Ellis from filing additional suits on this subject matter without prior leave of court, and requiring them to post a copy of the injunction on their website. For the reasons that follow, the Court will enter the requested injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The IRS uses this \"substitute for return\" (\"SFR\") to calculate and eventually collect the amount owed.

Thus far, he has stayed true to his word. On November 18, 2016, McNeil and Ellis filed suit against three federal judges (including this Court) and various IRS attorneys and officials, asserting that the judges unlawfully refused to rule in their favor, and that the IRS continues to unlawfully prepare, falsify, and misrepresent the preparation of SFRs for non-filers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Ellis, et al. v.
