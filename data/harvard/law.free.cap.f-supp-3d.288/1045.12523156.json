INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The work of this court, and more broadly of the federal Judiciary, is to resolve disputes between parties; that is what the court endeavors to do today in ruling on the two motions before it. Plaintiffs in both cases are refugees, who find themselves in dire circumstances, their family members who yearn to be reunited with them, and humanitarian organizations whose fundamental mission is to help these vulnerable refugees resettle in the United States. Plaintiffs in both cases present compelling circumstances of irreparable harm inflicted by the federal agencies' action at issue here. Nevertheless, the fundamental question the court must resolve is did the federal agencies act within their legal authority? If so, the court does not intervene, but leaves the decision to the other two branches of government-Congress and the Executive. Today, however, the court intervenes and preliminarily enjoins the federal agencies' action. It does so because, at this early stage in the proceedings, Plaintiffs show that they are likely to succeed on their claims that the agencies exceeded their statutory authority and also that they meet the other qualifying factors necessary for preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One further note: This is an area of rapidly developing law with related cases presently on appeal and decisions anticipated shortly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs, however, seek a decision now and are entitled to one given the facts in this case. In deciding these motions, the court must rely on the precedent currently available to it. The court understands that appellate courts may issue additional guidance in the days to come. If the parties believe that the court should revisit any portion of today's decision on the basis of subsequent authority, they should raise this to the court's attention through appropriate motions. The court now turns to the motions at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before the court are two motions seeking to preliminarily enjoin certain aspects of Executive Order No. 13,815 (\"EO-4\"), \u00a7 3(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050%2C055\">\n    82 Fed.

(Dkt. # 46) \u00b6 3, Ex. B (attaching a copy of the memorandum) (hereinafter, \"Agency Memo\") ). Plaintiffs John Doe, Jack Doe, Jason Doe, Joseph Doe, James Doe, Jeffrey\n   Doe, the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia, and the Council on American Islamic Relations-Washington (collectively, \"Doe Plaintiffs\") filed the first motion for a preliminary injunction in\n   <em>\n    Doe, et al. v.

Shortly after Doe Plaintiffs filed their motion, Plaintiffs Jewish Family Service of Seattle (\"JFS-S\"), Jewish Family Services of Silicon Valley (\"JFS-SV\"), Allen Vaught, Afkab Mohamed Hussein, John Does 1-3 and 7, and Jane Does 4-6 (collectively, \"JFS Plaintiffs\") filed a separate action in\n   <em>\n    JFS-S, et al. v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trump, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. C17-1707JLR (W.D.

(17-1707 Dkt. # 42).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recognizing that both cases and motions for preliminary injunction concerned EO-4 and the Agency Memo, the court consolidated the cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OSC re: Consol. (Dkt. # 52); Stip. Re: Consol. (Dkt. # 60); Consol. Order (Dkt. # 61).) Following consolidation, Doe Plaintiffs joined JFS Plaintiffs' motion, and JFS Plaintiffs joined Doe Plaintiffs' motion. (Doe Joinder (Dkt. # 62); JFS Joinder (17-1707 Dkt. # 70).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition to the parties' briefing (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doe PI Mot.; JFS PI Mot.; Doe Resp.

(Dkt. # 78) ), the court has considered the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. Further, the court heard oral argument on December 21, 2017. Being fully advised, the court (1) GRANTS Doe Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and (2) GRANTS JFS Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction except for those refugees who lack a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

Approximately 2,500 refugees in the United States are able to reunite with their immediate family members annually through the FTJ process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.1.) The Agency Memo states that most FTJ refugee applicants do not currently undergo the same security procedures as the principal refugee who has already resettled in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The Secretaries of DOS and DHS and the DNI determined that FTJ refugees should not be admitted to the United States until additional screening procedures are in place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Although the Agency Memo does not exempt Kenya and Thailand from its application, Defendants state that FTJ refugees processed at resettlement centers in those two countries are not affected by the Agency Memo because \"adequate review mechanisms are already in place in those countries.\" (JFS Resp. at 5, n.3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doe Resp. at 5; Higgins Decl. (Dkt. # 51-1) \u00b6 11).) At oral argument, Defendants clarified that during the Agency Memo's indefinite FTJ suspension, the Government was not just barring entry of FTJ refugees, but had completely stopped processing FTJ refugee applications-except for FTJ refugees who are processed in Thailand or Kenya.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    b. The SAO Provisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Agency Memo also suspends for at least 90 days refugee admission of nationals of 11 countries on the SAO list, as well as stateless persons who last resided in those countries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agency Memo at 2.) The Agency Memo does not identify the countries, but Plaintiffs assert that the countries are Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, as well as North Korea and South Sudan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JFS PI Mot. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Smith Decl. (17-1707 Dkt. # 44) \u00b6 5.) Countries on the SAO list \"have been assessed by the U.S. government to pose elevated potential risks to national security.\" (Agency Memo Addendum at 1.) The SAO list for refugees was established after September 11, 2001, and has changed over the years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The most recent list was updated in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) USRAP already requires additional\n   screening and procedures for refugees from countries on the SAO list. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) USRAP subjects these refugees to additional vetting through SAOs, which are \"DOS-initiated biographic check[s] conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence community partners.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Agency Memo requires the agencies to \"conduct a review and analysis\" of USRAP for refugees from SAO countries for an additional 90 days-notwithstanding the agencies' review of USRAP pursuant to EO-1 and EO-2. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agency Memo at 2.) Like President Trump's prior EOs, the Agency Memo suspends refugee admission from SAO countries unless resettlement \"would fulfill critical foreign policy interests, without compromising national security and the welfare of the United States,\" a determination made on a \"case-by-case basis\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, the Agency Memo diverts resources dedicated to processing refugees who are citizens of (or stateless persons who last resided in) SAO countries and reallocates those resources to processing refugee applicants from non-SAO countries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During oral argument, Defendants acknowledged that this would impact the pace of processing for SAO refugees. Thus, even if the SAO suspension is lifted after 90-days, it will have a long-term effect. \"Refugees have only a narrow window of time to complete their travel, as certain security and medical checks expire and must then be re-initiated.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawaii v.

Joseph fled Somalia with his family as a young child; he and his family eventually ended up in a refugee camp in Kenya, where Joseph grew up, married, and began his own family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-8.) Joseph's wife and children were unable to come to the United States with Joseph, remaining in Kenya.

Joseph's wife and children have completed their final interviews, security and medical clearances, received a formal assurance from a refugee resettlement agency, and are on the brink of travel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; Joseph Supp. Decl. (Dkt. # 56) \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.) Yet, Joseph's family has not received permission from DHS to travel. (Joseph Supp. Decl. \u00b6 7.) Joseph's two youngest children were born in Kenya and have never been to Somalia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Nevertheless, they are considered to be Somali citizens due to Joseph's nationality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Somalia is an SAO country. (Smith Decl. \u00b6 5.) Thus, the United States embassy in Somalia informed Joseph that although his wife and oldest step-son, who are both Kenyan citizens, could obtain permission to travel to the United States, his 4-year-old and 5-year-old sons cannot because they are considered Somali citizens.

First, Defendants argue that Joseph fails to show any injury because his wife and children are from Kenya, and Kenya is one of two countries in which the Government is continuing to process FTJ refugee applications because screening procedures are already in place to ensure appropriate FTJ scrutiny. (Doe Resp. at 2, 6-7; Higgins Decl. \u00b6 11 (explaining that in Kenya and Thailand \"the security vetting received for a Form I-730 beneficiary is the same as the screening received for principal refugee applicants,\" and therefore the Government is continuing to issue travel authorization to approve FTJ refugees who are processed in those locations).) However, as noted above, two of Joseph's children are considered Somali citizens and are, therefore, subject to the Agency Memo's SAO provisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joseph Supp. Decl. \u00b6 9.) Accordingly, the processing of their FTJ refugee applications remain on hold. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants also argue that Mr. Hussein's family is in Kenya, and thus he has no standing to challenge the FTJ provisions of the Agency Memo. (JFS Resp. at 6 (citing Higgins Decl. \u00b6 11).) However, Mr. Hussein's family members are also Somali nationals, and therefore subject to the SAO provisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hussein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) Because both Joseph's and Mr. Hussein's FTJ refugee applications for their family members are subject to the Agency Memo's SAO provisions, Joseph and Mr. Hussein have standing to challenge the Agency Memo. Indeed, during the December 21, 2017, hearing on Plaintiffs' motions, Defendants withdrew their argument that Joseph lacked standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In any event, Doe 7 also has an approved FTJ refugee application for his 19-year old son to come to the United States. (Doe 7 Decl. \u00b6 4) Doe 7's son is an Iraqi national (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3), and so Doe 7's FTJ application and the processing of his son's FTJ refugee status are subject to both the FTJ and SAO provisions of the Agency Memo (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-10). Accordingly, the court concludes that Doe 7 has standing. One party with standing is sufficient to fulfill Article III's case-or-controversy requirement.\n   <em>\n    Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. &amp; Institutional Rights, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276625\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/47/#p52\">\n    547 U.S. 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52, n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276625\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/47/#p52\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276625\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/47/#p52\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendants argue that it is speculative to infer that the Agency Memo's FTJ and SAO provisions are the source of any delay in the processing of Doe 7's FTJ refugee application as opposed to any other number of factors that might delay a refugee's application. (JFS Resp. at 6.) Whether Doe 7's son's application has other hurdles to cross, however, does not diminish the fact that the SAO and FTJ provisions of the Agency Memo add two more. Removing these hurdles would speed the resolution of any others\n   that may exist since processing of these applications is not presently proceeding at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agency Memo.) In any event, the evidence before the court is that Doe 7's FTJ application for his son has been approved, his son has completed his interview and fingerprinting, has received an assurance from a refugee resettlement agency in the United States, and is waiting to travel. (Doe 7 Decl. \u00b6 4.) At this stage of the proceedings, this is sufficient to establish harm for purposes of Article III standing with respect to both the SAO and FTJ provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants also argue that the individual Plaintiffs have no standing to challenge the SAO provisions because the Agency Memo provides for exceptions on a case-by-case basis. (JFS Resp. at 6-7.) Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate harm until they demonstrate that they \"cannot qualify for this exemption.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276625\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/47/#p52\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.4.) In\n   <em>\n    Hawaii I\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit rejected a virtually identical argument when it concluded that EO-2's discretionary waiver did not undermine Article III standing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276521\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/741/\">\n    859 F.3d at 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Ninth Circuit stated that the plaintiffs would \"face substantial hardship if [the court] were to first require that they try to obtain a waiver before [the court]...consider[ed] their case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276521\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/741/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawaii III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206547095\">\n    2017 WL 6547095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"[EO-3's] waiver provisions are not a sufficient safety valve and do not mitigate the substantial hardships Plaintiffs have already suffered and will continue to suffer due to [EO-3].\") (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    Int'l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , 265 F.Supp.3d at 602 (stating in the context of analyzing the ripeness of challenges to EO-3 that \"the waiver process itself presents an additional hurdle not faced by other visa applicants which would delay reunification, thus creating a harm not contingent on future events\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, Defendants parse the various individual Plaintiffs' declarations and argue \"it is doubtful that these applicants are on the brink of travel such that the 90-day SAO review period will have any concrete impact on them.\" (JFS Resp. at 7.) Whether Defendants are on the brink of travel or not, however, their separation from their family members will be prolonged as a result of the SAO provisions. The Agency Memo specifically states that, during the 90-day review, DOS and DHS will \"take resources that may have been dedicated to processing nationals of, or stateless persons who last habitually resided in, SAO countries and...reallocate them to process applicants from non-SAO countries for whom the processing may not be as resource intensive.\" (Agency Memo at 2.) Indeed, Defendants conceded that during the suspension the Government is redirecting \"processing resources\" away from SAO countries and that refugee applications will not be processed at the same pace. Thus, even assuming refugee applications from SAO countries are processed at all during the review period, they will undoubtedly be slowed by this resource diversion, prolonging the individual Plaintiffs' separation from their family members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that the individual Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated harm due to the SAO provisions and that at least one individual Plaintiff-Doe 7-has sufficiently alleged harm due to the FTJ provisions. The court concludes that the final two aspects of Article III standing-causation and redressability-are also satisfied. These Plaintiffs' injuries are traceable to EO-4 and its accompanying Agency Memo, and, if Plaintiffs prevail, a decision enjoining portions of the Agency Memo would redress those injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Further, Defendants contend that, although the Agency Memo may temporarily alter the composition of refugees entering the country, it does not alter the overall number of refugees entering the country. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, according to Defendants, the organizational mission of the agencies is not impaired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   JFS-S and JFS-SV, however, cannot make up the deficits in the arrival of FTJ refugees and refugees from SAO countries by receiving and serving other refugees. Each organization devoted significant resources to serving Muslim and Arabic-speaking refugees because these refugees represent a large percentage of their clients, including by hiring staff and designing programs specifically devoted to serving these clients. (JFS-S Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7; JFS-SV Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) Yet, the effect of the Agency Memo is likely to be a significant reduction in the admission of Muslim refugees into the United States. Over 40% of all refugees resettled in the United States within the last two fiscal years came from one of the SAO countries. (Smith Decl. \u00b6 15.) Of that group, 99% came from one of the nine Muslim-majority SAO countries, and over 80% identified as Muslim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17.) The Agency Memo's FTJ provisions are also likely to have a disproportionate effect on Muslim refugees because it is generally available only to refugees admitted in the last two years,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20207.7\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), which is the period of time when the admission of Muslim refugees reached a record high. (Burman Decl. \u00b6 41, Ex. NN.) The resources JFS-S and JFS-SV devoted to Muslim and Arabic-speaking refugees cannot simply be shifted to serving other refugees from other parts of the world; instead these resources are wasted, and the agencies' organizational purpose is thereby frustrated.

Plaintiffs do not seek to enjoin the agencies' efforts to implement screening mechanisms for FTJ refugees that are similar to or aligned with the processes employed for principal refugees. Plaintiffs do not seek to enjoin the agencies from conducting their 90-day \"detailed threat analysis and review\" of the SAO countries to determine what additional\n   safeguards the agencies believe are necessary with respect to the admission of refugees from those countries. And finally, Plaintiffs do not seek a guarantee of immediate admission into the United States for the refugees at issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doe Reply at 9.) Rather, as indicated above, they seek an order preliminarily enjoining those provisions of the Agency Memo that (1) prohibit the admission of refugees from SAO countries and impede the processing of their refugee applications for 90-days, and (2) indefinitely prohibit the admission of FTJ refugees and indefinitely suspend the processing of their refugee applications.

Although not determinative, the circumstances in which the courts applied the exception provides context for their decisions. Here, Defendants offer no evidence that the agencies issued the SAO suspension in response to a national security or foreign affairs crisis.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JFS Resp. at 30-31.) This argument is similarly unavailing here. Moreover, the indefinite duration of the \"delay\" in admitting refugees leaves the organizations unable to operate or plan effectively, further deteriorating goodwill and adding to their harms. Defendants also argue that the organizations are not irreparably harmed because \"these organizations already fulfill their missions by representing such clients who are unaffected by the challenged provisions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) The evidence before\n   the court, however, is that JFS-S and JFS-SV are not able to simply shift resources to \"unaffected\" refugees. Rather, these organizations have built programs specifically to serve Muslim and Arabic-speaking refugees. (JFS-S Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; JFS-SV Supp. Decl. \u00b6 4.)
