Hogan, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company (\"Great-West\" or Defendant) has moved to preclude the United States Conference of Mayors and United States Mayor Enterprises, Inc. (collectively, \"the Mayors\" or Plaintiffs) from presenting evidence, testimony, and argument relating to categories of damages that\n   Great-West claims their contract excluded in what Great-West argues is an exclusive remedies provision governing all claims in the contract. Def. Mot.\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   to Exclude Improper Damages Evidence, Testimony, and Argument, at 1-2, ECF No. 98 (hereinafter Mot. to Exclude). Plaintiffs respond that Great-West refers to language that appears in the contract's indemnification section and refers to third-party claims, but not to disputes arising between the parties. Each party argues that the contract unambiguously supports its view. Upon consideration of the motion, opposition, contract language, and relevant case law, the Court agrees with that the contract is unambiguous and finds that Plaintiffs have the better reading. Therefore, Defendant's Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties are familiar with the facts relevant to this motion. Nevertheless, a brief recitation is appropriate. The United States Conference of Mayors (\"USCM\") is \"a non-partisan organization of cities with populations of 30,000 or more.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 5, (ECF No. 22). USCM's wholly-owned subsidiary, United States Mayor Enterprises, Inc., markets certain products to cities and their employees, such as deferred compensation and retirement products and services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6. In 2012, Plaintiffs entered into two contracts with Defendant Great-West relating to USCM's Retirement Program: (1) a License Agreement between USCM and Great-West, and (2) a Joint Marketing and Training Agreement (\"JMTA\") between USME and Great-West (collectively, the \"Agreements\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 16. Both Agreements included an initial ten-year term. JMTA \u00b6 4.1; License Agreement \u00b6 6.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2015, Plaintiffs notified Great-West of their intention to terminate the Agreements for cause due to Great-West's non-payment and other contractual breaches. Am. Compl. \u00b6 28. The parties initially agreed to mediation as set forth in the Agreements' dispute resolution provisions, but were unable to agree whether the mediation should take place in Washington, D.C., or Denver, Colorado. March 15, 2016 Letters to JAMS (ECF Nos. 9-12 &amp; 9-13). Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on April 7, 2016. (ECF No. 1). Defendant challenged venue, but on August 31, this Court found Defendant had failed to show that considerations of convenience and interests of justice weighed in favor of transfer. Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on September 30, 2016, alleging breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-38 (ECF No. 22). Defendant filed its Answer and Counterclaim to the Amended Complaint on October 17, asserting counterclaims for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment, (ECF No. 26), and Plaintiffs filed their Answer on October 28, (ECF No. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Agreements include many provisions not at issue in this Motion. The question currently before the Court is whether the parties contracted to limit the types of damages they could seek if a dispute arose between them. Mot. to Exclude at 4.

Section 6.3 reads as follows: \"Each Party acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy\n   <em>\n    with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement\n   </em>\n   shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2.\" Ex. A at 10 \u00a7 6.3 (emphasis added). The language in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 also refers to indemnifying against \"claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683761\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/905/#p917\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 9 \u00a7\u00a7 6.1, 6.2.

Sections 7.2 and 7.3 use only the terms \"dispute\" to refer to conflict between the parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683761\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/905/#p917\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 10 \u00a7\u00a7 7.2, 7.3. The difference in language shows a different understanding of first-and third-party claims. Section 6.3 refers to \"any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement\"\n   <em>\n    brought by third parties\n   </em>\n   , and Section 7.1 refers to \"[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof\" resulting in a dispute\n   <em>\n    between the parties\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, in context, the second sentence in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 is reasonably read to intend a modification of the sentence before it, thus limiting the types of damages either party can pursue\n   <em>\n    as a result\n   </em>\n   of third party claims, not in a context of breach or dispute between the parties to the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PCH Mut.
