BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute stems from the sale of a used car to Plaintiff by Defendant, a used car dealer. In February 2017, Plaintiff began searching for a car to purchase for his own personal use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [45], at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 19. Plaintiff came across a used 2015 Infiniti Q50 Sport being advertised on Defendant's website for $27,977.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The online advertisement contained certain representations by Defendant, including that: Defendant has \"full-service garages [that] thoroughly inspect and service each new arrival\"; each new arrival is \"sent to [Defendant's] detail departments to be meticulously cleaned\"; the 2015 Infiniti is a \"High Quality Luxury Car\"; and a \"[f]ull inspection [was] performed by [Defendant's] technicians\" on the 2015 Infiniti.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8; ECF No. [44-2]. Based on these representations, Plaintiff contacted Defendant to see the 2015 Infiniti.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [45], at \u00b6 9. On February 15, 2017, an employee of Defendant emailed Plaintiff informing him that the 2015 Infiniti had a \"clean car fax\" and asking when Plaintiff wanted to test drive the car.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. After Plaintiff pointed out to the employee that he had not received a car fax for the vehicle, the employee replied and again told Plaintiff that the car fax was clean and that the 2015 Infiniti had no accidents.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 18, 2017, Plaintiff went to Defendant's auto dealership and met with Mr. Jay Zelaya, one of Defendant's salesmen.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. Mr. Zelaya represented that the 2015 Infiniti was in excellent condition and that it had been thoroughly inspected by Defendant's service department.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. According to Plaintiff, however, Mr. Zelaya did not disclose that Defendant had performed repairs on the 2015 Infiniti, that the 2015 Infiniti was damaged in any way, or that the 2015 Infiniti had been in any accidents.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff proceeded to purchase and finance the 2015 Infiniti.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Prior to visiting Defendant, Plaintiff obtained pre-approved financing from Tropical Financial Credit Union \"for 1.99% for a used car with mileage under 75,000 and an LTV of 89% or less.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. The 2015 Infiniti met these requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, Defendant told Plaintiff that if he chose to use his own financing, he would be charged a $750 \"Draft fee.\"\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Plaintiff chose not to use his own financing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rather than paying the $27,977 price advertised online, Plaintiff ultimately purchased the 2015 Infiniti for $32,912, with a 3.98% interest rate through JPMorgan Chase Bank.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. In connection with the purchase, Defendant prepared a Retail Purchase Agreement (\"RPA\").\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The RPA, which itemized the\n   various costs and prices, included a $699 \"Pre-Delivery Service Charge Dealer Fee/Loan Processing Fee\" and a $47.95 \"DMV E-File\" fee.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24; ECF No. [44-3]. Plaintiff assumed that the DMV E-File fee was a \"required fee that was paid to the Department of Motor Vehicles in order to properly title my vehicle.\" ECF No. [45], at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant also prepared a Retail Installment Sale Contract (\"RISC\") that provided Plaintiff with a breakdown of the financing charges.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25; ECF No. [44-4]. The total amount financed for the 2015 Infiniti (the amount of credit provided to Plaintiff) was $24,551.49.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [44-4]. As part of the financing for the vehicle, Defendant traded in his 2012 Infiniti.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [45], at \u00b6 25. Plaintiff estimated that he owed $10,700 on the 2012 Infiniti.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [44-1], at 104, 108. At some point, Mr. Zelaya called the lienholder, Capital One, and confirmed that the actual pay-off amount for Plaintiff's 2012 Infiniti was $10,317, and that the pay-off amount was good until February 28, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [44-1], at 108, 114; ECF No. [44-8]. Nevertheless, the estimated pay-off figure of $10,700 was included in the RISC and was used to calculate the total amount financed for the 2015 Infiniti.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [44-4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On his way home after purchasing the vehicle, Plaintiff attempted to turn on the fog lights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [45], at \u00b6 26. The fog lights, however, did not function properly.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff proceeded to have the vehicle inspected at an Infiniti dealership, where it was discovered that the 2015 Infiniti had been painted following a repair, the bumper was being held together by a plastic zip tie, and there were missing pieces of the undercarriage that had been previously ripped off.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [45], at \u00b6 26. The total cost of the repairs was estimated to exceed $5,000.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Fla. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Defendant violated the FCCPA as a result of its failure to comply with FDUTPA. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant asserted non-existent legal rights (1) by collecting the dealer and DMV E-File fees \"after it failed to include them in the Infiniti's advertised price\" and (2) for knowingly failing to \"refund the amount it overcharged [Plaintiff] for titling and registering the Infiniti and failing to 'fully' disclose the $47.95 'DMV E-File' fee.\" ECF No. [44], at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Regarding Defendant's first contention, the Court has declined to enter summary judgment on Plaintiff's FDUTPA claim-the predicate to the FCCPA claim-regarding Defendant's failure to include the dealer and DMV E-File fees in the internet price due to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact concerning what price information was disclosed in the advertisement for the 2015 Infiniti. Thus, the Court declines to enter summary judgment on the corresponding FCCPA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court has found, however, that Plaintiff did not receive a refund for the amount that he was overcharged for the titling and registering of the 2015 Infiniti, and that Defendant failed to provide the disclosure under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.976\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (18) when including the DMV E-File fee in the RPA. In order to demonstrate that Defendant did this knowingly, Plaintiff submitted the complaint in a 2015 lawsuit involving Defendant and containing similar allegations and counts as Plaintiff's current action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that the complaint, at a minimum, demonstrates that Defendant was aware of the same exact provisions and statutes of which the Court has now found it to be in violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As there are no genuine issues of material fact in relation to Defendant's knowingly failing to \"refund the amount it overcharged [Plaintiff] for titling and registering the Infiniti and failing to 'fully' disclose the $47.95 'DMV E-File' fee,\" the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on these two FCCPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendant's Affirmative Defenses.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff seeks an entry of summary judgment on both of Defendant's affirmative defenses to his claims. Defendant has not provided any arguments in response. Defendant's first affirmative defense is that Plaintiff's causes of action fail to set forth facts sufficient to state claims upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [9], at 7. Plaintiff has, at the very least, presented a prima facie case for his claims\n   under TILA, FDUPTA, and the FCCPA. Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment as to Defendant's first affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant's second affirmative defense is that \"Defendant and its agents and representatives are protected by the 'bona fide error' defense pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k, since such actions or inactions, if they occurred, were not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding Defendant's maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.976\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiff correctly points out that the bona fide error defense pursuant 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k is a defense to claims brought under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. None of Plaintiff's causes of action have been brought under that federal statute. Accordingly, Plaintiff is also entitled to summary judgment as to the second affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the contents and representations made by Defendant in its online advertisement of the price of the 2015 Infiniti purchased by Plaintiff. Thus, summary judgment is not proper as it pertains to Defendant's alleged violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.976\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16), along with the corresponding FCCPA claim. Plaintiff is, however, entitled to summary judgment on his claim under TILA, his remaining claims under FDUTPA and the FCCPA, and Defendant's affirmative defenses. Therefore it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. [44]\n   </strong>\n   , is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE AND ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Miami, Florida, this 22nd day of December, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Court notes that the parties have failed to comply with the Court's Local Rule 56.1, which mandates that a motion for summary judgment and its opposition be accompanied by a statement of material facts \"as to which it is contended that there does not exist a genuine issue to be tried or there does exist a genuine issue to be tried, respectively.\" S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a). Plaintiff has submitted an affidavit in support of his Motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [45]. Nonetheless, Plaintiff's affidavit is not \"supported by specific references to the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits on file with the Court.\" S.D. Fla. L.R. 7.1(a)(2). Defendant did not file a separate statement of undisputed facts. Thus, the Court sets forth the facts insofar as they are supported by evidence in the record. The Court also notes that, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e), if a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact, the court may \"consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    It is unclear from the record exactly when Mr. Zelaya called Capital One.

On February 23, 2017, one of Defendant's employees called Capital One a second time, confirming that the pay-off amount, which also included a per diem fee that the bank charged until it received the pay-off, was $10,321.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [44-1], at 102-03.

Stat. \u00a7 501.976\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (16) ). Yet assuming without deciding that Defendant's failure to include the dealer and DMV E-File fees in the internet price is a\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    violation-even though Defendant may have explicitly disclosed that the fees were not included in the price, therefore removing any deception-Plaintiff must still show causation and actual damages. Without knowing the complete content of the advertisement, the Court cannot determine what, if any, actual damages Plaintiff suffered given that, by his own admission, he did not seem to have any intention of paying the cash price for the 2015 Infiniti. Put differently, if Defendant is right and the advertisement clearly states that the internet price (1) was for cash purchases only and (2) did not include \"the dealer or DMV E-File fee,\" it is unclear what actual damages Plaintiff incurred as it would not have been reasonable for Plaintiff to expect to purchase the 2015 Infiniti for the lower internet price when Plaintiff, who obtained pre-approved financing prior to visiting the dealership, was not going to purchase the vehicle with cash. Summary judgment is thus not appropriate with the record currently before the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Mr. Viquez did confirm that the DMV does not get paid any portion of the DMV E-File fee.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [44-1], at 100.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Plaintiff also argues that Defendant\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    violated FDUPTA by violating Fla.
