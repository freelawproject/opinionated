Upon consideration of the parties' submissions and the entire record, Winkal's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART without prejudice, and the FDIC's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. In particular, I conclude that Winkal is entitled to summary judgment on its \"unpaid rent\" claim for the expenses associated with repairing the Premises. The particular amount of damages owed to Winkal, however, remains an open question, and I thus deny Winkal summary judgment on the issue of damages without prejudice. With respect to the FDIC's summary judgment motion, I conclude that the FDIC has shown, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that it is entitled to prevail on Winkal's claims for \"Landlord's Work\" expenses and the costs to complete WaMu's \"Tenant's Work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Lease set forth the mutual rights and obligations of Winkal and WaMu, as well as provisions governing the rent due to Winkal from WaMu. Three portions of the Lease are particularly relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, in Article XXV of the Lease, Winkal agreed to perform certain \"Landlord's Work\" prior to turning over the property to WaMu. Specifically, Winkal agreed to: 1) install a new roof; 2) install a new HVAC system; and 3) resurface the parking lot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art.

Winkal argues that such recovery is appropriate under the \"unpaid rent\" provision of FIRREA because the Lease bound WaMu to maintain the Premises as \"additional rent\" for WaMu's occupancy. Lease art. VI. Under that theory, Winkal seeks: 1) its out-of-pocket expenses to repair the Premises, which total $101,046.85; and 2) the $86,352.95 expended by Nails Supply to complete the necessary repairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply 14.

When determining whether a lessee's obligation falls within the scope of the \"unpaid rent\" provision, courts look to the lease to determine whether the obligation was \"a duty assumed by the lessee as consideration for the occupation of the leased premises.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 202. Applying that test, the \"several courts that have delved\n   into the issue have found that repair and maintenance costs qualify as 'unpaid rent' in circumstances where a tenant has assumed the duty to maintain or repair all of the leased premises, or at least the portion of the leased premises at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205 (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Bank Nat'l Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047703\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/362/#p367\">\n    79 F.3d at 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (contractual obligation to \"keep the premises in good condition and repair\" and \"ensure that the premises were maintained lawfully\" constituted \"unpaid rent\" for purposes of FIRREA).

The FDIC asserts that ongoing contractual obligations accrue only at the end of the original contract term. Yet in the context of a repudiation, the appointment of a receiver necessarily occurs prior to the end of the original contract term. Thus, under the FDIC's \"accrual\" theory, it would be virtually impossible for a property-lessor such as Winkal to recover \"unpaid rent\" following a FDIC repudiation, even when a lessee-institution with a contractual obligation to maintain the leased property leaves the property in a state of disrepair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Our Circuit has previously rejected similar FDIC arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Office &amp; Prof'l Emps. Int'l Union, Local 2 v. FDIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706056,10528735\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/598/\">\n    27 F.3d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (fact that employees were not entitled to severance pay until termination, which followed receivership and union contract repudiation, did not mean that employees' contractual rights to severance pay had failed to accrue as of receivership). I do the same here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The fact that the FDIC is liable under the \"unpaid rent\" provision does not answer just how much money Winkal may recover. As discussed, the FDIC's \"unpaid rent\" liability stems from WaMu's contractual obligations to \"keep all parts of the Premises ... in good order, good condition and good repair\" and to \"surrender the Premises ... in as good condition as the same is on the Commencement Date.\" Lease art. VI. As such, the amount of \"unpaid rent\" due is the value of the work: 1) that is necessary to return the Premises to \"as good condition as\" it was on the Commencement Date and 2) that is chargeable to WaMu as \"additional rent\" under Article VI of the Lease, rather than carved out and made chargeable to Winkal under other provisions of the Lease. From those two limitations, it follows that Winkal is not entitled to recover the value of construction work for which it, and not WaMu, was responsible. Nor is Winkal entitled to recover the cost of construction activities beyond the scope of work necessary to repair (rather than upgrade) the Premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under those principles, the question of Winkal's asserted damages remains open. To begin, on Winkal's own admission, \"the parties dispute a $47,507 charge from the Gill Company for reestablishing electrical service to the building and related electrical work,\" and Winkal thus has not pursued summary judgment on that set of expenses. Pl.'s Statement of Genuine Issues Opp'n to FDIC's SOMF 7 n.3 [Dkt. # 37-1]. In addition, and unsurprisingly given that the FDIC's liability was not settled at the time Winkal filed its motion for summary judgment, neither Winkal nor the FDIC has briefed the question of damages in a way that reflects the proper scope of the FDIC's \"unpaid rent\" liability. In general, Winkal has not adequately explained why certain expenses are properly categorized as necessary\n   <em>\n    repairs\n   </em>\n   under Article VI of the Lease-and thus encompassed by the \"unpaid rent\" provision-rather than\n   <em>\n    upgrades\n   </em>\n   contemplated by WaMu's abandoned \"Tenant's Work\" plans. Winkal has not clarified, for example, why it should be entitled to recover expenses associated with installing a \"fire suppression system\" when there was no such system on the Premises when WaMu took possession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rethman Decl. \u00b6 5. The same goes for the expenses associated with bringing the building into ADA compliance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706056,10528735\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/598/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In short, I am not presently convinced, given the current record and briefing, that there remain no genuine issues of material fact with respect to Winkal's damages. After considering this Court's liability holding and, in particular, the issues just discussed, Winkal may file a renewed summary judgment motion addressing damages. The parties may also, of course, seek to resolve the outstanding issue of damages without need for additional intervention by this Court. For now, I will deny summary judgment to Winkal on the question of damages without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Winkal's Claim for Completing \"Tenant's Work\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The final category of damages Winkal seeks is $153,078.33 for hiring a contractor\n   to complete WaMu's abandoned \"Tenant's Work.\" Pl.'s Mem. 15. According to Winkal, that work would have resulted in a \"completely upgraded Premises, including all ADA access requirements, a remodeled exterior, and all new interior improvements as required for a typical bank building.\" Winkal SOMF \u00b6 43. Winkal argues that its \"Tenant's Work\" claim represents \"additional 'unpaid rent' \" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B)(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Winkal's \"Tenant's Work\" claim falters from the start. That is because the claim was not among the categories of claims presented to the FDIC in Winkal's Proof of Claim. Winkal concedes that FIRREA \"requires a claimant to file an administrative claim with the FDIC before it seeks damages in district court.\" Pl.'s Mem. 7 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ). Winkal argues that it satisfied that requirement with respect to its \"Tenant's Work\" claim by filing a Proof of Claim that sought \"[a]ctual direct compensatory damages caused by the Tenant as a result of its partial demolition of the leasehold property which the Landlord is now required to correct and/or restore.\" Proof of Claim Ex. A. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Winkal's Proof of Claim sought reimbursement for the work performed to \"correct and/or restore\" the Premises \"as a result of\" WaMu's \"partial demolition of the leasehold property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the money spent to\n   <em>\n    correct\n   </em>\n   WaMu's demolition damage and\n   <em>\n    restore\n   </em>\n   the demolished property is the subject of Winkal's \"unpaid rent\" claim for expenses associated with repairing the Premises. Nowhere in the Proof of Claim did Winkal put the FDIC on notice of its intent to seek damages associated with completing the additional \"Tenant's Work\"-work Winkal concedes would go above and beyond the construction work necessary to \"correct and/or restore\" the Premises following WaMu's demolition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Therefore, this is not a situation in which Winkal is seeking an additional \"dollar amount\" for \"the same\" claim originally filed with the FDIC.\n   <em>\n    Interlease Corp. v.

It is one in which Winkal is asking this Court to award damages arising from an entirely new claim not presented to the FDIC. Such efforts are barred by FIRREA's administrative exhaustion requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897400,4324280\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1301/\">\n    741 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1303 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Autumnwood Assocs. v.

But this half-a-loaf result is dictated by FIRREA's limitations on the FDIC's repudiation liability-limitations that, according\n   to our Circuit, help advance Congress's \"interest of maximizing the number of creditors who can recover some portion of what they are owed\" by failed institutions such as WaMu.\n   <em>\n    Nashville Lodging Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179179,5867495\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/236/\">\n    59 F.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Winkal's primary counterargument is that (e)(4)(A) narrowly limits recovery of only those damages directly resulting from a repudiation (for example, a termination penalty), leaving (e)(3)(A)'s allowance for a broader range of compensatory damages largely intact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Winkal Mem. 11-12 (citing\n    <em>\n     Pioneer Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

Ill. 1992) ). To begin, Winkal's contention is undermined by the fact that (e)(3)(A)'s general damages provision authorizes damages \"for the disaffirmance or repudiation of any contract\"-the same phrase that, according to Winkal, cabins the scope of (e)(4) to only those damages flowing directly from a repudiation. Winkal has provided no convincing reason to \"abandon [the] usual presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same statute carry the same meaning.\"\n    <em>\n     Henson v.
