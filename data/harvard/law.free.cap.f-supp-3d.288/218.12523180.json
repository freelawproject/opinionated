COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The District of Columbia's Department of For-Hire Vehicles has been on a years-long campaign to modernize the District's taxicab industry. Facing competitive pressure from app-based ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, the Department beginning in late 2016 adopted a series of rules that require taxi operators to transition from traditional analog metering systems to newer systems called \"digital taxicab solutions,\" or \"DTS.\" Like those popular ride-hailing services, the DTS systems are designed to run on mobile devices and calculate fares using GPS technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Classic Cab, Inc., a taxicab operator in the District, along with its owner, brought this eleventh-hour suit on December 29, 2017, seeking to halt the DTS requirement from going into effect on the first day of the New Year. In their motion for a temporary restraining order, they contend that the Department's rulemaking violates several federal constitutional provisions as well as the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act, and that those violations have caused them serious economic harm. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the plaintiffs are not entitled to preliminary relief, and it will therefore deny their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The new rule requires taxicab companies in the District to transition from traditional analog metering systems-known as \"modern taximeter systems\" or \"MTS\"-to DTS systems approved by the Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20D.C.%20Reg.%2011950\">\n    64 D.C.

There is not a single mandatory DTS system, nor is there a requirement that each taxicab company design its own system from the ground up. Rather, each taxicab in the District must use a system supplied by an approved DTS \"provider.\" Any taxicab company in the District can apply to be approved by the Department as a \"provider-meaning that they can supply their DTS system to other companies or use it in their vehicles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20D.C.%20Reg.%2011950\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20D.C.%20Reg.%2011950\">\n    at 11955-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be a provider, the taxicab company must verify that its system meets or exceeds the Department's technological requirements: namely, that it contains (1) a digital taximeter that calculates fares using GPS and integrates with DC TaxiApp, the consumer taxicab application that predates DTS; (2) a passenger console with a digital display; and (3) a credit card processing device.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20D.C.%20Reg.%2011950\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20D.C.%20Reg.%2011950\">\n    at 11958-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A, at 3 (Department Administrative Issuance from Feb. 14, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The notices also spelled out the Department's rationale for imposing the DTS requirement, and for using emergency rulemaking procedures to do so. Citing an uninterrupted decline in taxicab rides for the past year and a commensurate drop in revenues, the more recent, published notices explained that the Department sought to immediately \"alleviate the rapidly-deteriorating competitive position of taxicabs in the District's vehicle-for-hire industry\" caused by the rise of private-vehicle services like Uber and Lyft.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20D.C.%20Reg.%208696\">\n    64 D.C. Reg. 8696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11950. The Department explained that the DTS requirement would aid taxis' competitive position by mirroring the features of those app-based services and by allowing for future innovation through its open-ended design-results that could not be achieved with the MTS.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20D.C.%20Reg.%208696\">\n    64 D.C. Reg. 8696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8698.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Three days before the DTS requirement was set to take effect, the plaintiffs-Classic Cab and its owner, Mushtaq Gilani-filed this suit against the District, its Mayor, the Department, and the Department's director in his official capacity. In their complaint and motion for a temporary restraining order, they claim that the Department's emergency rulemaking violates the U.S. Constitution-specifically, the Due Process and the Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment, and the Contract and Commerce Clauses of Article I-and runs afoul of the D.C. APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that preliminary injunctive relief is necessary because the rule, even before its implementation, has caused them grave economic loss and that, when the rule takes effect, it will likely force Classic Cab to shut down. Pl.'s Mot. \u00b6 37. They explain that, before the DTS rule, a large portion of Classic Cab's revenue derived from MTS. Specifically, for several years prior to August 2017, Classic Cab held an exclusive license from the Department-subject to renewal each year-to provide and maintain MTS. To capitalize on this license, Classic Cab in\n   2013 executed a seven-year contract with a private third party, Creative Mobile Technologies, based in New York. Under that agreement, Creative would install MTS in Classic Cab's fleet of around 1,700 vehicles-consisting mostly of taxis owned by other taxicab operators. The contract granted Classic Cab 0.25% of all credit card transactions, $0.10 per credit card swipe, and a $5 monthly maintenance fee-in total, about $300,000 annually. The plaintiffs claim that the new DTS requirement destroys the value of this contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After reviewing the plaintiffs' motion, the Court instructed the parties to propose a schedule for expedited briefing and a hearing. In response to the Court's request, the District represented that \"through January 31, 2018 [the Department] will not begin issuing fines or penalties for violations of the regulations at issue.\" Def.'s Proposed Br. Sched. at 1 (ECF No. 7). The Court accordingly set a briefing schedule that concluded on January 19 and held a hearing on January 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With the Court having declined to grant the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   -and instead having directed briefing and held a hearing-the Court will evaluate the plaintiffs' motion as one for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. Plaintiffs seeking preliminary equitable relief bear the burden of showing (1) that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim; (2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

To establish a due process violation, the plaintiffs would need to show that (1) they were deprived of a constitutionally protected interest in property (2) through a deficient process.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Propert v.

First is their \"business,\" broadly speaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. \u00b6 89 (referring to plaintiffs' property rights \"in its taxicab business, which consists of its vehicles, contracts, employees, drivers and office\"). Of course, the plaintiffs do have a property interest in Classic Cab\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   , as a business entity. But the DTS regulation does not outright strip the plaintiffs of their business-for example, by seizing Classic Cab, by revoking its taxi license, or by otherwise demanding that it shutter its doors. The regulation instead imposes a condition on the business's continued operation. To the extent that the plaintiffs attempt to characterize their continued operation as a property interest-one \"deprived\" by costly new technological requirements-the Due Process Clause does not help them. Businesses generally do not have property interests in their assets or revenues. Those are \"incidents\" to ownership-goals that are far from guaranteed, and certainly not guaranteed by the government.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the relevant sequence of events belies the notion that the DTS regulation deprived Classic Cab of this license: The plaintiffs at the January 24 hearing represented that the license expired in August 2017, yet the Department's rules did not bar the use of MTS until January 2018. And given the absence of any guarantee that Classic Cab would have its license renewed, it cannot plausibly be argued that the prospective rulemaking affected any\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   property interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Minneapolis Taxi Owners Coal., Inc. v.

But the DTS regulation here does not effect a taking of that contract. In arguing to the contrary, the plaintiffs invoke the three-factor standard used to evaluate whether a government regulation effects a taking: (1) the economic impact of the regulation, (2) the extent to which it interferes with the business's reasonable investment-backed expectations, and (3) the nature of the government action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penn Central Transp.

And while loss so severe that it threatens the \"very existence of the movant's business\" may constitute irreparable injury, a plaintiff must explain concretely why the specific action he challenges is highly likely (if not certain) to immediately cause that loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters of U.S. v.
