Taken together, to satisfy the IDEA the components of an IEP must be \"reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 999. The central question, in other words, \"is whether the IEP is\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   , not whether the court regards it as ideal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Contrary to plaintiffs' arguments, the IHO properly concluded that the April 21, 2015 IEP satisfied the IDEA'S standards. The IHO examined the testimony and evidence regarding the appropriateness of each type of service required under the IEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. at 21-22 (discussing requirement of occupational therapy services);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (discussing requirement of speech-language pathology services);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (discussing requirement of behavioral support services). As to each service, the IHO chose to credit the testimony of DCPS's experts or the recommendations of the independent evaluators, all of which indicated that the amount and nature of the services contained in the IEP were \"appropriate\" or \"needed\" to meet H.P.'s academic and functional goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, 23. Plaintiffs have given this Court no reason to second-guess that decision of the IHO or, for that matter, the relevant school officials and examiners.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rowley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636698\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/176/#p206\">\n    458 U.S. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636698\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/176/#p206\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The IHO also reasonably rejected plaintiffs' request for more integration of H.P.'s support services into the classroom program. The IHO pointed out that H.P.'s receipt of such integrated services at the Auburn School, without more, did not demonstrate that the IEP's provision of the services on a \" 'pull-out' basis\" was inappropriate under the relevant standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. at 23 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.34\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). Similarly, the IHO was correct to reject the argument that the IEP wrongly failed to provide for a dedicated aide or for the use of Applied Behavioral Analysis methodologies. As the IHO noted,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.34\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.34\">\n    at 24-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at the time of the April 2015 IEP, it had not yet been established that H.P. needed those services; thus, the IEP's failure to include them does not render the IEP inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.S. ex rel. Shank v. Howard Road Acad.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3944810\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/585/56/#p66\">\n    585 F.Supp.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66 (D.D.C. 2008) (the IDEA does not countenance \" 'Monday Morning Quarterbacking' in evaluating the appropriateness of a child's placement\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Finally, in evaluating the remainder of plaintiffs' objections to the IEP, the IHO weighed the testimony of the classroom teachers against that of plaintiff Holman and H.P.'s grandmother, concluding that the teachers had superior insight into the functioning of the students in their classrooms and the need for certain sensory integration equipment. A.R. at 23-24. That interpretation of the evidence was more than reasonable. In summary, plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to show that the IHO was wrong to conclude that the April 2015 IEP was \"reasonably calculated to enable\" H.P. \"to make progress appropriate in light of\n   [his] circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/#p994\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For many of the same reasons, I reject plaintiffs' third objection to the R &amp; R-namely, that the R &amp; R incorrectly affirmed the IHO's determination that H.P. was offered a FAPE from April 21, 2015 through January 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beginning with the April 2015 IEP and running through the January 29, 2016 date on which H.P.'s updated IEP was finalized, plaintiffs had a valid and appropriate offer of placement in the CES program at Takoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. at 27-28. That offer was confirmed when plaintiffs wrote DCPS to request a meeting regarding the creation of a new IEP and placement for H.P. and, in response, were informed that H.P. remained welcome to enroll in Takoma \"at any time\" pursuant to the April 2015 IEP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 551 [Dkt. # 11-10]. To be sure, plaintiffs and H.P.'s grandmother continued to object to that option. As the IHO noted, however, the fact that plaintiffs \"just did not agree with the proposal\" does not change the fact that the District was offering H.P. a FAPE at Takoma during the latter half of 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Contrary to plaintiffs' arguments, moreover, the January 2016 update of H.P.'s IEP does not impugn the appropriateness of the April 2015 IEP: As discussed previously, it is well-established that \"the adequacy of an IEP can be measured only at the time it is formulated, not in hindsight.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364948\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/58/#p66\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66 (D.D.C. 2015). I therefore agree with the R &amp; R that the IHO correctly determined that DCPS offered H.P. a FAPE from April 21, 2015 through January 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, in addition to those given by Magistrate Judge Robinson in her R &amp; R, plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law. Accordingly, upon consideration of the entire record and\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the objected-to portions of the R &amp; R, the Court hereby ADOPTS Magistrate Judge Robinson's recommendations, DENIES plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and GRANTS defendant's motion for summary judgment. An Order consistent with this decision accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The IHO determined that DCPS failed to offer a FAPE beginning on January 29, 2016-the date it finalized H.P.'s updated IEP. As a result, the IHO awarded plaintiffs reimbursement for tuition at the Auburn School beginning on that date. With that in mind, the Court understands plaintiffs to be arguing that H.P. was denied a FAPE from the date of the April 2015 IEP through the finalization of the January 29, 2016 IEP.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp'n to Pls.'
