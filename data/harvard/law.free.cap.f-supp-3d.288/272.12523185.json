BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Having watched this case wend its way through many twists and turns, the Court must now determine whether it in fact belongs across the Pacific. Bringing a Motion to Dismiss for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens,\n   </em>\n   Defendants contend that Taiwan, not the District of Columbia, is the appropriate jurisdiction in which to resolve this dispute over the estate of plastics magnate Yung-Ching\n   (Y.C.) Wang. At the time of his death in 2008, Y.C. was worth an estimated $6.8 billion-making him, according to Forbes, the 178\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   wealthiest individual in the world. Although he amassed quite a fortune, he lacked one crucial asset: a last will and testament. In the years since his passing, the distribution of Y.C.'s estate has thus become a significant source of contention among his many putative heirs. These claimants, to further complicate matters, belong to three separate \"families\" derived from Y.C.'s relationships with different women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Nearly eight years ago, Winston Wen-Young Wong, Y.C.'s son from his Second Family, kicked off this modern-day\n   <em>\n    Jarndyce v. Jarndyce\n   </em>\n   when he filed suit on behalf of the First Family, which consists solely of Yueh-Lan Wang, the woman to whom Y.C. had been married since 1935. Winston, whom Yueh-Lan named as her lone heir, alleged that her marital share of Y.C.'s estate had been \"shorted\" by unlawful transfers of funds prior to Y.C.'s death. Asserting that Defendants-a D.C.-based trust and its affiliates-held a portion of these assets, Winston sought to reclaim Yueh-Lan's full disbursement from Y.C.'s estate. After a series of intervening events-including Yueh-Lan's death and the subsequent appointment of Executor-Plaintiffs in Taiwan-and procedural detours, the case returned to this Court's docket last year. This past August, the Court allowed Plaintiffs to file a Second Amended Complaint, and today it turns to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss that Complaint. Finding that Taiwan is an adequate alternative forum and that the relevant interests weigh strongly in favor of dismissal, the Court will grant their Motion under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . It will, however, condition that grant upon Defendants' waiver of statute-of-limitations defenses and potential additional constraints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court also frequently refers to participants by their first name to avoid confusion and not out of any disrespect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To recap briefly: this dispute centers on the disbursement of the estate of Y.C. Wang. When Y.C. died in 2008, his plastics empire made him the second-wealthiest individual in Taiwan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl, \u00b6 18. Yet he had no will-an unfortunate oversight given that he left behind nine children and three putative wives. This suit is brought on behalf of the estate of the first of those partners, Yueh-Lan. Married to Y.C. for 72 years, Yueh-Lan witnessed her husband's meteoric rise, including his founding of Formosa Plastic Group, which is \"one of Taiwan's biggest and most profitable manufacturing conglomerates with annual sales of over $60 billion and operations in five countries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. She, as the \"First Family,\" also witnessed his fathering children with two other women-Wang Yang Chiao and Pao Chu (P.C.) Lee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. While Y.C. and Yueh-Lan had no offspring, his relationship with Wang Yang Chiao resulted in the birth of five children known as the \"Second Family,\" and P.C. Lee produced another four known as the \"Third Family.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As any reader of\n   <em>\n    Bleak House\n   </em>\n   could have been predicted, the matter of Y.C.'s estate and its disbursement has led to some discord among his three families and their various children. Related suits have been brought in Taiwan, Bermuda, New Jersey, Hong Kong, and, of course, before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 38-4 (discussing Taiwan action); SAC, \u00b6 64 (discussing Bermuda action);\n   <em>\n    Shu v.

Oct. 17, 2016) ; ECF 49-21, \u00b6 60 (discussing Hong Kong Action). This case was first filed on October 14, 2010, by Dr. Winston Wen-Young Wong (Winston), a member of the Second Family and Y.C.'s eldest son, who asserted that he was acting through a valid power-of-attorney in bringing the suit on Yueh-Lan's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Complaint). Although Winston is a Second Family member, Yueh-Lan named him as her sole heir, and he thus has a significant interest in the restoration of any assets to her estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 14. Defendants are a trust formed under the laws of the District of Columbia-New Mighty U.S. Trust-as well as its trustee, Clearbridge, LLC, and a beneficiary of the trust, New Mighty Foundation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21. Both the Foundation and Clearbridge, it should be noted, are linked to children of the Third Family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wang II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419999\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/11/#p15\">\n    322 F.R.D. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Yueh-Lan's claims sought the return of property transferred by Y.C. to Defendants during the five years prior to his death, on the ground that Taiwanese and D.C. law would allegedly entitle her to recover these assets as part of her 50% spousal share.\n   <em>\n    Wang I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221628\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/198/#p200\">\n    841 F.Supp.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Yueh-Lan received a portion of Y.C.'s $1.7 billion \"Taiwan Assets\" after his death, she asserted that this sum \"represent[ed] only a fraction of Y.C.'s\" holdings, and that the full Marital Assets were in fact \"greater than double the value of [that] property.\" SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 34-36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47-2 (Decl. of Andrew Muscato), \u00b6 20 (asserting that Yueh-Lan received \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" from Y.C.'s Taiwan Assets).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants initially moved to dismiss these claims on a variety of grounds, and this Court granted that entreaty after finding a lack of diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Wang I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221628\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/198/#p200\">\n    841 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   208 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wang Appellate Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172421\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/487/\">\n    843 F.3d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The D.C. Circuit thus held the case in abeyance while the Taiwanese courts determined who should act in that role. Eventually, Chen-Teh Shu, Dong-Xung Dai, and Robert Shi were chosen by the courts, and the three men moved to substitute themselves as Yueh-Lan's personal representatives under the appropriate Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure while the case was still pending at the D.C.

The Circuit, at the same time, also granted the Executors' substitution motion \"without prejudice to the defendants' ability to renew in district court those arguments they ha[d] pressed before.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172421\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/487/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172421\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/487/\">\n    at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the Executors, this period has elapsed. Pointing out that this case has been pending since October 2010, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants had a number of opportunities to raise FNC earlier, but instead engaged in a \"long-term, deliberate choice to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   move for dismissal on FNC grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.

Their \"eleventh-hour decision to file an FNC motion,\" the Executors maintain, thus \"has the appearance of improper forum shopping and gamesmanship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, they state that \"it would be highly inefficient for the parties and the courts, as well as prejudicial to Plaintiffs, to dismiss the case at this stage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court begins its analysis by noting that, although some courts have held that a defendant must bring an FNC motion within a \"reasonable\" period of time, the D.C.

Although they are correct that this suit has been pending for eight years, this longevity is due not to any dilatory tactics or \"gamesmanship\" by Defendants, but instead is the result of the case's circuitous procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As discussed above, the Court granted Defendants' first Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction in 2012. After Plaintiffs appealed, the Court of Appeals suspended briefing and held the case in abeyance in order to resolve the executorship proceedings after Yueh-Lan's death, a process that took three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wang II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419999\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/11/#p15\">\n    322 F.R.D. at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Restarting the appeal in the fall of 2015, Plaintiffs filed their motion for substitution, and Defendants requested dismissal on the ground that the suit was a \"legal nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419999\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/11/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419999\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/11/#p15\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet the briefing on these claims was again suspended, pending the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Americold\n   </em>\n   , which finally issued in spring 2016. On December 9 of that year, the D.C. Circuit\n   ruled in Plaintiffs' favor and remanded the case to this Court. Plaintiffs then moved to amend their Complaint in March 2017, and Defendants opposed on a number of grounds-including FNC. In August, the Court granted the Motion to Amend and denied FNC dismissal at that time, but permitted Defendants to reassert the defense in later briefing. The Executors filed their Amended Complaint in August 2017, and Defendants responded with the instant Motion to Dismiss, briefing on which was complete in late December. As this recounting demonstrates, the fact that 2018 has now arrived without even the filing of an Answer is hardly the result of Defendants' strategic choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants admittedly\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have sought an FNC dismissal in their initial Motion to Dismiss, but they instead asserted a lack of diversity jurisdiction. This was certainly proper. While \"\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   may justify dismissal of an action though jurisdictional issues remain unresolved,\" the doctrine may also be raised\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   such threshold questions have been addressed.\n   <em>\n    Sinochem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553796\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/422/\">\n    549 U.S. at 429, 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553796\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/422/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that FNC dismissal may precede jurisdictional inquiry, but noting contexts in which court might \"first determine its own authority to adjudicate the case\"). Although Plaintiffs suggest that Defendants were under some sort of obligation to raise FNC when Yueh-Lan appealed from this Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Wang I\n   </em>\n   , this position makes little sense in light of fundamental rules and practices of appellate procedure. This Court's first Opinion addressed a discrete issue of law-whether or not Yueh-Lan had established subject-matter jurisdiction in the District.\n   <em>\n    Wang I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221628\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/841/198/#p200\">\n    841 F.Supp.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Concluding that the citizenship of a trust required consideration of the citizenship of the trust's beneficiaries, this Court found that Plaintiff had not adequately demonstrated diversity and dismissed the First Amended Complaint on that ground. It was that decision that was appealed, and, given the intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Americold\n   </em>\n   , overruled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wang Appellate Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172421\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/487/\">\n    843 F.3d at 494-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' contention that Defendants should have tacked on a novel FNC submission during the course of this proceeding ignores the narrow scope of the issue on appeal and the fact that appellate courts generally do not \"consider an issue not passed upon below,\" particularly when it involves a discretionary, fact-intensive analysis such as\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kingman Park Civic Ass'n v.

Cir. 2003). In sum, Plaintiffs' suggestion that Defendants should be deemed to have forfeited their FNC defense by not raising it in prior stages of this suit-or that their decision to now mount such a defense evinces any gamesmanship or improper motive-holds no water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Similarly unavailing is Plaintiffs' more pragmatic assertion that it would be \"highly inefficient\" to dismiss the case at this stage. It is true that where \"litigation has progressed significantly,\" efficiency concerns may weigh against a belated assertion of FNC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wright &amp; Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3828 (4th ed. 2017).

At bottom, this suit may be aged in years, but it is still young at heart. Although the Court recognizes that Plaintiffs have put in substantial hours and effort on this matter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 26, 45, such a commitment of resources does not justify denying Defendants' Motion as untimely or unduly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    FNC Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Having resolved this preliminary issue, the Court may now focus on the substance of Defendants' attempt to dismiss this case pursuant to\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   .

The Supreme Court has established that only when \"the remedy provided by the alternative forum is so clearly inadequate or unsatisfactory that it is no remedy at all,\" can the district court conclude that \"dismissal would not be in the interests of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Piper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p241\">\n    454 U.S. at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p241\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, too, the evidence does not show that Plaintiffs will be deprived of any \"remedy at all.\" As discussed below, their claims revolve around alleged violations of Taiwan's Civil Code. They do not suggest that the Code provides\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   remedy for their suit, but instead that \"equitable remedies\" will not be available. The Court can hardly deem meaningless the remedies Taiwan has chosen to provide for such infractions in its own courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huertas v.

Indeed, when a New Jersey district court dismissed Plaintiffs' nearly identical claims on FNC grounds, it reached the same conclusion on this issue.

As an initial matter, it notes that this Circuit has not yet addressed the relevance of whether a foreign defendant's forum choice was motivated by \"legitimate reasons\" or \"genuine convenience.\" Plaintiffs instead import these considerations from a line of Second Circuit cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Iragorri v.

The Court focuses its analysis on the first two considerations, as those are the ones most discussed and disputed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   i. Access to Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At the outset, an obvious and substantial obstacle impedes access to relevant evidence in the District of Columbia-the language barrier. This case involves complex questions of Taiwanese law, the resolution of which depends at least in part on the interpretation of various Chinese-language documents and the testimony of non-English-speaking witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 44-45 (listing documents already in record that have required translation); Opp. at 40. Indeed, even at this stage in litigation, the parties dispute the English meaning of certain pieces of evidence, including a 2010 Taiwanese Tax Settlement Agreement regarding the distribution of Y.C.'s estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 37-2, 38-5 (differing translations). According to Defendants, this Agreement states that Yueh-Lan Wang, Yang Chiao-Wang, and P.C. Lee were \"in fact the spouses of Mr. Y.C. Wang.\" ECF No. 42-25 (Su Sur-Reply Decl.), \u00b6 14. According to Plaintiffs, the correct translation of the Agreement is that the three women only \"emotionally,\" \"sentimentally,\" or \"with their emotions\" recognized that they were Y.C.'s wives, not that they were legally so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 18-2 (Decl. of Tsung-Fu Chen I), \u00b6 53; 39-1 (Chen Decl. II), \u00b6 77; 37-1, Exh. J (Decl. of Xin Min Liu). Lacking any familiarity with Mandarin, this Court has no ability to determine which version should prevail. And that is precisely the point: a U.S. court is an inconvenient forum for a case in which substantial decisions may rise or fall on the interpretation of a given Chinese phrase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MBI Grp., Inc. v.

According to Plaintiffs, much of this information is located \"in the U.S., or outside of Taiwan.\" Opp. at 34. Specifically, they assert that evidence regarding the \"purpose, formation, and functioning\" of New Mighty Trust, the \"transfer of Marital Assets to Defendants,\" and Y.C.'s \"ownership interests in the assets\" are all located in the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5596472\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/448/29/#p33\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5596472\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/448/29/#p33\">\n    at 34-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing individuals and documents here).

These individuals include the four NM-US trust managers, the persons who \"direct\" the operations of NMF, the Executor-Defendants themselves, Y.C.'s alleged spouse P.C.

Regardless, the Court does not doubt that \"witnesses with knowledge of [relevant] matters are located in Taiwan.\" Mot. at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Just as the parties dispute the geographic distribution of the relevant proof, they also diverge as to the ease of access to such evidence. Plaintiffs assert that Defendants have failed to demonstrate that they will be deprived of necessary evidence if the case is not dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 40. Noting that Defendants will be able to use letters rogatory to obtain evidence located in Taiwan and that they have \"essentially limitless resources,\" Plaintiffs contend that Defendants will face no great burden in obtaining proof from abroad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 49-35 (Chen Opp. Decl.), \u00b6\u00b6 72-74 (discussing procedures for obtaining evidence in Taiwan pursuant to letters rogatory);\n   <em>\n    Sayles v.

Mar. 23, 2009) (discussing particulars and requirements of letters rogatory under Taiwanese law). Defendants rejoin that they are, in fact, likely to face evidentiary obstacles if this case remains in D.C. They assert that letters rogatory are not a sufficient substitute for trying this case in Taiwan, and that they will therefore be deprived of necessary sources of proof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chang v.

What\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   clear is that whether this suit is brought in D.C. or Taiwan, a certain amount of relevant proof is likely to be located outside the forum. On balance, however, it appears that Defendants have a somewhat stronger argument regarding the location of relevant sources of proof and individuals critical to this action, as is perhaps unsurprising given that the central figures in this case are Taiwanese. The Court therefore concludes that this issue weighs slightly in favor of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   ii. Obtaining Witnesses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As with the question of\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   the relevant witnesses are located, the parties split as to which forum would be better able to compel and procure testimony from these individuals. According to Plaintiffs, \"[T]o the extent there are relevant Taiwan witnesses,\" they consist almost entirely of \"employees, agents, and affiliates\" of Defendants, thus \"obviating any concern that [it] will be difficult to procure\" access to them in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs contend, moreover, that evidence from any \"remaining unwilling witnesses\" can be obtained by this Court through letters rogatory or unspecified \"other powers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. By contrast, they assert (albeit while incorrectly suggesting that this Court would\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   , rather than\n   <em>\n    dismiss\n   </em>\n   , this case under FNC) that \"none of the non-Taiwan witnesses will be subject to compulsory process if the case is transferred to Taiwan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants respond that, if the case is not dismissed,\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   will face significant challenges in compelling evidence for use in trial. Taiwan, as they note, is not a party to the Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters, and there is no ability to compel witnesses in Taiwan to appear in-person in U.S. courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 42;\n   <em>\n    Chang v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223715\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/728/#p735\">\n    599 F.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (7th Cir. 2010) (finding that \"Taiwanese law makes it difficult to gather evidence for use in a trial in a foreign country because Taiwan is not a party to the Convention\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warter v.

[and] could compel testimony and documents from unwilling U.S. witnesses pursuant to [ \u00a7 1782 ]\"). Defendants also dispute that they have meaningful control over the \"numerous Taiwanese witnesses\" such that it would not be difficult to procure their testimony for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 42. Finally, Defendants note that \"many\" of their potential witnesses are elderly, and thus the inconvenience of their travel to the United States would be \"significant and substantial, if not impossible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DNJ Action\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206080199\">\n    2016 WL 6080199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 n.22 (finding that \"P.C. is currently 81 years old, resides in Taiwan, and does not speak English\" and that Plaintiffs \"essentially concede[ ] that Taiwan is a more convenient forum for P.C.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On this factor, as with the location of sources of proof, the Court finds that both sides present viable arguments in favor of their preferred forum. Whether this case proceeds in D.C. or in Taiwan, there will be legal and logistical hurdles to compelling witnesses and obtaining testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DNJ Action\n   </em>\n   at *14 (finding that \"whether the matter is litigated in Taiwan or in New Jersey,\" either forum will be \"unable to compel documents or witnesses who may be relevant to many issues in this case\"). The Court thus concludes that this factor hangs in equipoise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On the whole, therefore, the private interests tilt somewhat toward dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   b. Public Interests\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The considerations governing the public-interest analysis, conversely, include (1) the \"local interest in having localized controversies decided at home\"; (2) the interest in having the trial in a forum that is \"at home\" with the law that must govern the action; (3) the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflicts of laws or in the application of foreign law; and (4) the unfairness of burdening citizens in the current forum with jury duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gulf Oil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354212\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/501/#p508\">\n    330 U.S. at 508-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354212\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/501/#p508\">\n    67 S.Ct. 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Assessing each of these factors, the Court concludes that the public interest in this case tips sharply in favor of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   i. Local Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that \"the citizens of D.C. and the U.S. have a strong interest in this litigation.\" Opp. at 42. They maintain that \"substantial culpable conduct occurred\" in the District, \"including the receipt of property and the establishment of the New Mighty U.S. Trust structure\n   itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. Pointing to the fact that Defendants are incorporated and located in this country, they argue that \"Defendants and their affiliates have benefited substantially from U.S. laws\" and thus \"cannot now complain of the burden ... [that] results from this Court's jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Defendants rejoin that this emphasis on local and U.S. interests is but a smokescreen for the real dispute underlying this case-the correct interpretation of Taiwan's Civil Code regarding marriage and inheritance. They posit that there \"is little to no local interest in the claims asserted,\" and that the \"resolution of this Taiwan-law based action is unlikely to have any impact in the District of Columbia.\" Mot. at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants have the better position. The central question here is whether Yueh-Lan, a lifelong resident and citizen of Taiwan, was denied certain spousal rights under Taiwanese inheritance law. Indeed, each count in the Second Amended Complaint is in some way premised on her claimed entitlement to her full share of Y.C.'s marital estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 71-118. Whichever way this case comes out in the end, its legal impact will be far greater in Taiwan than in the District of Columbia-a forum that would very rarely confront issues of Taiwanese marital law. Although the District may have a weak interest in this dispute given Defendants' local incorporation and business operations, the central claims plainly implicate Taiwanese concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DNJ Action\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206080199\">\n    2016 WL 6080199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (noting that \"citizens of Taiwan likely have a strong interest in the distribution of the estate of one of its wealthiest citizens\"). Indeed, resolving this case would implicate questions of that country's social policies and family law-hardly the \"local interests\" of a federal court located an ocean away.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g,\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 49-35 (Chen Opp. Decl.), \u00b6\u00b6 78-81 (discussing history of bigamy in Taiwan); 39-1 (Chen Decl. II), \u00b6\u00b6 52-55, 72-73 (discussing definition of marriage in Taiwan); 42-25 (Su Sur-Reply Decl.) (discussing determination of relative spousal contributions to a marriage). Just as federal courts may decline to decide diversity-jurisdiction cases involving domestic relations, the subject matter at issue here is particularly ill-suited for determination in the current forum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Ellison v. Sadur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"569337\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/700/54/#p55\">\n    700 F.Supp. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (D.D.C. 1988) (\"Federal courts generally will not accept jurisdiction over a case that involves the resolution of a marital dispute[.]\"). In light of these concerns and the strong Taiwanese interests at stake, this factor tips sharply in favor of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   ii. Applying Foreign Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court next considers \"the interest in having the trial in a forum that is at home with the law that must govern the action\" and the potential for \"unnecessary problems in conflicts of laws or in the application of foreign law.\" On this issue, Plaintiffs contend that \"while some issues of Taiwan law exist in this case, D.C. law will also apply.\" Opp. at 44. Yet their attempt to equate the relevance of Taiwanese and D.C. law is belied by their Second Amended Complaint. That pleading alleges five substantive counts under different sections of Taiwan's Civil Code (as compared to four common-law counts),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 66-101, and the D.C. claims are, at least in part, contingent upon these foreign-law allegations. Without engaging in a full conflicts analysis, it appears that the merits of Plaintiffs' D.C.-law claims likely depend upon the viability of their arguments under Taiwan's Civil Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 102-110 (counts for conversion and unjust enrichment under D.C. law require, respectively, \"unlawful\" control over another's personal property and \"unjust\" retention of benefit by defendant);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p241\">\n    454 U.S. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p241\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that\n   \"the public interest factors point towards dismissal where the court would be required to untangle problems in conflict of laws, and in law foreign to itself\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    Lans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253999\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/786/240/#p293\">\n    786 F.Supp.2d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that \"[w]hile the Court need not definitively resolve the choice of law issue at this point, the likelihood that foreign law will apply weighs against retention of the action\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiffs' contention that this case involves only \"some issues\" of Taiwanese law is thus somewhat disingenuous. Instead, the Court agrees with Defendants that at the core of this suit lie claims under Taiwanese law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court notes, moreover, that Plaintiffs brought many of the same Taiwanese and common-law claims in their New Jersey suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DNJ Action\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206080199\">\n    2016 WL 6080199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 n. 19 (discussing Taiwanese causes of action and identifying New Jersey causes of action as \"conversion,\" \"unjust enrichment,\" \"constructive trust,\" \"accounting\" and \"civil conspiracy\"). In dismissing that case under FNC, the court there found that \"the New Jersey claims are seemingly contingent on ... Taiwanese law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. \"[T]o succeed on any of the New Jersey claims,\" that court held, \"Plaintiffs first need to prove an underlying violation of Taiwanese law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8 n. 19. So, too, do the D.C. claims at issue here seem to rise or fall with Plaintiffs' allegations under Taiwan's Civil Code. The Court therefore concurs with the New Jersey court's determination that \"[t]he dispute here rests entirely on the application of Taiwanese law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   There is no doubt that this Court is \"empowered to resolve questions of foreign law,\" Mot. at 32, and that the need to do so does not compel dismissal under FNC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruise Connections Charter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189069\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/764/155/#p160\">\n    764 F.Supp.2d at 163-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (need to apply foreign law \"alone is not sufficient to warrant dismissal\"). Although \"showing that another jurisdiction's law will apply is not alone sufficient to refuse retention of a case if the court will not have any difficulty applying [such] law,\" this is not such a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253999\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/786/240/#p293\">\n    786 F.Supp.2d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court readily acknowledges that it\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   have some degree of difficulty in interpreting the numerous provisions of Taiwan's Civil Code at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moletech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203151147\">\n    2009 WL 3151147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (finding that application of Taiwan's law \"would be an arduous task as the Court is unfamiliar with Taiwanese law, and this factor weighs heavily in favor of dismissal of this action\");\n   <em>\n    In re Air Crash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201163\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/331/1176/#p1181\">\n    331 F.Supp.2d at 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because Taiwanese law is likely to apply to these actions, and because the court is unfamiliar with Taiwanese law, this public factor ... weighs in favor of dismissal on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds.\"). As the record makes clear, this is no straightforward task here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Su Decl. I, \u00b6\u00b6 78 (noting that no Taiwanese court has previously addressed allocating spousal share among multiple wives); \u00b6\u00b6 149-51 (discussing meaning of Settlement Agreement); Chen Decl. II, \u00b6 117 (noting that Taiwanese courts have never considered application of relevant Civil Code provisions \"to the situation of multiple spouses\"). Parsing and applying the relevant Civil Code provisions will require this Court to gain a significant level of expertise regarding foreign family and inheritance law, and to resolve a number of questions of first impression arising under Taiwanese law. In light of such challenges, the Court concludes that this factor weighs strongly in favor of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   iii. Burden on D.C. Citizens\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In addition to taxing the foreign expertise of this Court, there is also the concern that a trial in this case would\n   \"unfairly\" burden citizens of the District with jury duty. When assessing motions to dismiss under FNC, courts seek to \"avoid[ ] the imposition of jury duty on people of a community which has no relation to the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Wye Oak Tech., Inc. v. Republic of Iraq\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224933\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/941/53/#p58\">\n    941 F.Supp.2d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While this suit has\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   relation to the District-Defendants are D.C.-based entities and Plaintiffs bring claims under D.C. law-the gravamen of the case, as discussed above, involves Taiwan's Civil Code. Fairness to a future D.C. jury therefore counsels in favor of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg), Societe Anonyme v. Mahfouz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825043\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/828/92/#p99\">\n    828 F.Supp. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99-100 (D.D.C. 1993) (finding that \"the District of Columbia's relatively minor interest in the outcome of the dispute does not justify submitting its citizens to the rigors of sitting as jurors\");\n   <em>\n    In re Air Crash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201163\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/331/1176/#p1181\">\n    331 F.Supp.2d at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"it is clear [ ], given Taiwan's significant connection to the actions, and California's minimal one, requiring California citizens to serve as jurors in these cases would be an unfair burden\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Bearing in mind that flexibility is the \"watchword\" and convenience the \"central focus\" of the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   inquiry, the Court concludes that the private interests tip slightly in favor of dismissal and the public interests come out strongly in support of that result. Because it also finds that Taiwan is an available and adequate alternative forum, it will ultimately grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss under\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . The Court will, however, condition such dismissal upon Defendants' continued submission to Taiwan's jurisdiction and waiver of their statute-of-limitations defenses. Recognizing, moreover, that Plaintiffs may have remaining concerns regarding their ability to re-file in Taiwan, the Court will provide them the opportunity to request additional conditions subsequent to the issuance of this Opinion. Defendants will in turn have the chance to respond to any such requests, and the Court will determine if any further constraints to dismissal are warranted. A contemporaneous Order so stating shall issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
