Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Motion to Dismiss, filed November 18, 2016 (Doc. 71)(\"First JN Motion\"); (ii) Defendants' Second Motion for Judicial Notice in Support of the Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint, filed February 23, 2017 (Doc. 91)(\"Second JN Motion\"); (iii) Defendants' Third Motion for Judicial Notice in Support of the Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint, filed May 30, 2017 (Doc. 109)(\"Third JN\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Motion\"); and (iv) the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint and Incorporated Memorandum of Law, filed February 23, 2017 (Doc. 90)(\"MTD\"). The Court held hearings on June 16, 2017 and July 20, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court may consider the items presented in the First JN Motion, the Second JN Motion, and the Third JN Motion without converting the MTD into one for summary judgment; (ii) whether the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Reynolds American, Inc. for claims that were not brought in a North Carolina forum; (iii) whether the Federal Trade Commission's Decision and Order,\n   <em>\n    In re Santa Fe Nat. Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. C-3952,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20783979\">\n    2000 WL 783979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (FTC June 12, 2000), filed November 18, 2016 (Doc. 71)(\"Consent Order\"), requiring Defendant Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc. to use a disclosure that \"No additives in our tobacco does\n   <strong>\n    NOT\n   </strong>\n   mean a safer cigarette\" impliedly preempts the Plaintiffs'\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   claims to the extent that the Defendants' advertising misled the Plaintiffs into believing that Natural American cigarettes are safer or healthier than other cigarettes; (iv) whether \"natural,\" \"additive-free,\" and \"substantially similar terms\" mislead a consumer into believing: (a) that Natural American cigarettes are safer or healthier than other cigarettes, (b) that Natural American's menthol cigarettes do not include any additives; or (c) that Natural American cigarettes undergo fewer engineering processes than other cigarettes; (v) whether the Defendants' use of those descriptors is protected commercial speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America; (vi) whether state law safe harbors shield the Defendants from liability; (vii) whether the Plaintiffs' unjust-enrichment claims fail, because: (a) the descriptors did not deceive consumers, so there is no injustice for equity to correct; (b) the Plaintiffs have an adequate legal remedy under the various state consumer statutes; or (c) state specific law otherwise bars them; (viii) whether the Plaintiffs' breach-of-express-warranty claims are barred, because: (a) the FDA-mandated disclosure and the menthol ingredient modify the warranty such that there is no breach; (b) the Plaintiffs' Consolidated Complaint, filed January 12, 2017 (Doc. 82)(\"Amended Complaint\") does not serve as the requisite pre-litigation notice under California, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, New York, and North Carolina law; and (c) the Plaintiffs failed to allege privity of contract with the Defendants as required by Florida, Illinois, and New York law; and (ix) whether the Memorandum of Agreement Between the United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) and RAI Services Company (RAIS)/Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc. (Santa Fe), dated January 19, 2017, filed February 23, 2017 (Doc. 91-1)(\"Memorandum of Agreement), in which the Defendants agree to remove the descriptors from its packaging and labeling, except for the term natural in its brand name, renders the Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court concludes that: (i) the Court may consider all but one of the documents the Defendants submit without converting the MTD into one for summary judgment, because the documents are incorporated in the Amended Complaint by reference, or they are government documents publically available and capable of ready and accurate determination; (ii) the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Reynolds American, as to the claims filed outside of North Carolina; (iii) the Consent Order does not preempt the Plaintiffs' claims, because (a) a consent order is not a \"law\" under the Supremacy Clause, (b) the Consent Order-as an agreement not to enforce a federal statute-does not permit conduct; (c) the Consent Order only binds the parties to it, so does not bind all of the Defendants; and (d) the Consent Order covers only the Defendants' advertising, so cannot preempt the Plaintiffs' claims targeting the Defendants' labeling; (iv) the descriptors \"natural,\" \"organic,\" and \"additive-free\" would mislead a reasonable consumer into believing that: (a) Natural American Cigarettes are healthier or safer than other cigarettes, because decades of marketing have equated those terms with healthy products; and (b) Natural American menthol cigarettes have no additives, because menthol is a substance that a reasonable consumer would not know much about; (v) the First Amendment does not protect the Defendants' use of the descriptors at issue, because the state action doctrine precludes a First Amendment defense to the claims premised on mutual assent, and the government has a substantial interest in regulating deceptive commercial speech regarding tobacco products; (vi) the state-law safe harbors do not preclude relief, except in Illinois, because the Consent Order does not permit conduct, and the Ohio consumer protection claims are barred for state-specific reasons; (vii) Rule 8 allows pleading in the alternative, but New Jersey and Ohio law do not permit the Plaintiffs' unjust-enrichment claims, because the Plaintiffs cannot allege a remuneration nor can they allege that they conferred a direct benefit on the Defendants; (viii) Florida, Illinois, and New York law preclude the Plaintiffs' express warranty claims, because the Plaintiffs Amended Complaint cannot serve as the requisite pre-litigation notice, and are independently defective under Florida and Illinois law, because there is no privity between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants; and (ix) the Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is not rendered moot, because the Memorandum of Agreement is subject to a lawsuit that might invalidate it. The Court therefore grants the MTD in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court takes the facts from the Amended Complaint.

Amended Complaint \u00b6 58, at 28-29 (quoting Warning Letter at 2). Santa Fe Tobacco previously entered into a Consent Order with the FTC regarding its advertising practices, because the FTC had concerns that the Defendants' advertising mislead consumers into believing that \"Additive-Free\" or \"Chemical-Free\" cigarettes are safer or less harmful than other tobacco products.

The three theories of deception are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) The Safer-Cigarette Theory\n   </strong>\n   : the Plaintiffs argue that the use of the terms organic, natural, and additive-free mislead tobacco consumers into believing that Natural American cigarettes are safer and healthier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 4-8, 47-66, at 2-3, 22-31; MTD at 22-24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) The Menthol Theory\n   </strong>\n   : the Plaintiffs argue that, by labeling Natural Americans cigarettes with menthol \"additive-free\" and \"natural,\" the Defendants mislead menthol consumers, because menthol is an additive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 10, 67-69 at 3, 31-32; MTD at 24-25.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) The Unprocessed-Cigarette Theory\n   </strong>\n   : the Plaintiffs argue that, by labeling Natural American cigarettes as Natural, the Defendants mislead consumers into believing that Natural American cigarettes are not subjected to rigorous engineering processes during production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 9, 70-74, at 3, 32-33; MTD at 25.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Turning to the Defendants' arguments, first, the Defendants assert that the Consent Order preempts the Plaintiffs' state law claims premised on the Safer-Cigarette Theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 6-7. According to the Defendants, the Consent Order \"authorized Santa Fe [Tobacco]'s use of 'Additive Free' and all other 'substantially similar terms' (such as 'Natural')\" in Santa Fe Tobacco's advertisement, as long as it also disclosed in those advertisements that no additives does not mean a safer cigarette. MTD at 6-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants conclude that, because the Consent Order authorized the terms, it preempts the Plaintiffs' state claims under the Supremacy Clause. MTD at 8-10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chamber of Commerce of United States v.

They argue that the FTC, in making its determination, reconciled \"competing interests\"-the speaker's right to make truthful representations versus the consumers' right not to be misled-and that the Plaintiffs seek, with their state claims, to undercut the balance that the FTC struck. MTD at 14. According to the Defendants, the Consent Order, thus, does not set a floor, but creates a scale that the Supremacy Clause prevents from tipping toward the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Defendants also assert that the FDA's Warning Letter does not undermine\n   their preemption arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 15. The Defendants note that, the Warning Letter states that Santa Fe Tobacco's advertising language violated the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20387\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Tobacco Control Act\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 15. Nevertheless, the Defendants argue that the Warning Letter does not change the preemption analysis, because the Warning Letter does not state that the terms \"Natural\" and \"Additive-Free\" are false or misleading; rather, it requires the Defendants to obtain FDA approval before using those terms. MTD at 17. The Defendants also assert that the Warning Letter cannot overrule the Consent Order, because the Tobacco Control Act cannot reasonably \"be construed as limiting or diminishing the authority of the Federal Trade Commission.\" MTD at 17 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387n(a)(1) ). Although they concede that the Tobacco Control Act states that \" '[a]ny advertising that violates' the Act 'is an unfair or deceptive act or practice,' \" the Defendants maintain that the Warning Letter is not a \"binding determination\" that the Defendants have violated the Tobacco Control Act, nor does it abrogate the Consent Order. MTD at 17 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387n(a)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the Defendants argue that the First Amendment shields them from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 20. The Defendants contend that the First Amendment is relevant here, even though it typically protects speakers only from government action, because the First Amendment protects speakers also from state tort suits \"that seek to stifle or punish protected speech.\" MTD at 20 (citing\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

Second, they argue that the \"natural\" and \"additive-free\" labeling is not misleading, given their disclosure that: \"No additives in our tobacco does\n   <strong>\n    NOT\n   </strong>\n   mean a safer cigarette.\" MTD at 21 (emphasis in original). Third, they assert that the Plaintiffs' three theories of deception do not demonstrate that the Defendants' speech is inherently misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 22. They contend that, under established caselaw, the First Amendment does not protect inherently misleading speech, and inherently misleading speech is speech that is incapable of being presented in a non-deceptive way such that it would be misleading under all circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 22 (citing\n   <em>\n    Revo v.

Colo. 2001) (Babcock, J.)). The Defendants argue that \"Natural\" and \"Additive-Free\" can be presented in non-deceptive way, because the FTC-approved disclosure that additive-free cigarettes are not inherently healthier repudiates the inference that Natural American cigarettes are healthier than other cigarettes. MTD at 22-23. The Defendants also argue that it is not inherently\n   misleading to label their menthol cigarettes \"additive-free,\" because \"consumers are not misled by a product's inclusion of an ingredient that serves as one of its primary distinguishing and desired characteristics.\" MTD at 24. They also argue that the \"additive-free\" labeling is not misleading, because it refers to additive-free tobacco and the menthol is added to the cigarette filters and not to the tobacco. MTD at 24. Finally, they assert that the \"Natural\" labeling is not misleading, even though the Defendants subject the cigarettes to an engineering process during production, because \"Natural\" is too expansive a concept to mislead any consumers. MTD at 25-26 (citing\n   <em>\n    Grocery Mfrs. Assoc. v.

They also argue that preventing the Defendants from using \"natural\" and \"additive-free\" does not materially advance the Plaintiffs' interest in preventing consumer deception, because the FTC-mandated disclosure already prevents deception, so imposing liability will not \"\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   advance their interest ... to a\n   <em>\n    material degree\n   </em>\n   .\" MTD at 28-29 (emphasis in original). Finally, the Defendants argue that the relief requested is not narrowly tailored, because an additional disclosure would suffice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Third, the Defendants argue that state safe harbors shield them from the Plaintiffs' statutory claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 30. The Defendants argue that the California, Colorado, Florida Count 1, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Washington claims fail, because federal law-specifically, the Consent Order-permits the Defendants' advertising, and the various states' safe harbors foreclose liability for conduct that federal law permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 31-35, 37-39. The Defendants also argue that the New Jersey and North Carolina claims fail, because those states' safe harbors preclude liability for conduct that has been concretely or pervasively regulated, and, according to the Defendants, the Consent Order \"deal[t] specifically, concretely, and pervasively\" with their advertising. MTD at 35-36, 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Fourth, the Defendants aver that fourteen of the Plaintiffs' nineteen state statutory claims fail, because their advertising is not false or misleading to a reasonable consumer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 39-40. The Defendants contend that a reasonable consumer would not believe that Natural American cigarettes are healthier than other cigarettes based on the \"Natural\" and \"Additive-Free\" labeling, because the labeling disclaims that their cigarettes are safer than other cigarettes. MTD at 42-46. Regarding the Menthol Theory, the Defendants also argue that \"a reasonable consumer ... could not have been misled into believing that [Natural American] cigarettes labeled 'menthol' on the package\n   <em>\n    would not\n   </em>\n   contain menthol.\" MTD at 46 (emphasis in original). Finally, the Defendants argue that a reasonable consumer would not believe that the tobacco in Natural American cigarettes was unprocessed even though Natural American cigarettes are labeled as \"Natural,\" because \"virtually\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   manufactured products undergo some form of processing.\" MTD at 47-48 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Defendants also assert that four of the Plaintiffs' statutory claims fail, because the relevant statutes do not provide relief under these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 49. They contend that: (i) the injunctive relief requested under the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 510, is inappropriate, because\n   injunctive relief requires a likelihood of future harm, and the Plaintiffs admit they will not purchase Natural American cigarettes again; (ii) the Plaintiffs' New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract Warranty and Notice Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2056%3A12-14\">\n    N.J.

As an initial matter, the Defendants argue that the three transferor courts' choice-of-law approaches dictate that the laws of the twelve states where the Plaintiffs purportedly purchased their cigarettes govern the unjust-enrichment analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 53-54. According to the Defendants, the unjust-enrichment claims fail, because the \"Plaintiffs received precisely what they paid for-cigarettes made with additive-free, natural tobacco-and so there is no injustice to be remedied.\" MTD at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sixth, the Defendants argue that ten of the twelve unjust-enrichment claims fail, because the Plaintiffs have an adequate legal remedy-a state law damages claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 55. The Defendants also argue that the Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Ohio unjust-enrichment claims fail, because the Plaintiffs do not allege that they directly purchased the Natural Americans from any of the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD 60-61. The Defendants also argue that the New Jersey unjust-enrichment claim fails, because it sounds in tort, and the New York unjust-enrichment claim fails, because it duplicates the Plaintiffs' statutory claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Seventh, the Defendants argue that they did not breach an express warranty by selling menthol cigarettes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 64. They argue that, under California and New York Law, a breach of an express warranty requires the Plaintiffs to have reasonably relied on a warranty, and the Plaintiffs did not do so here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 64. The Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs' breach-of-express-warranty claims fare no better under Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, or North Carolina law, because those states require a court to read the \"alleged express warranties\" in conjunction with \"potentially limiting language.\" MTD at 65. They argue that, thus, the \"menthol\" language \"necessarily modified any warranty,\" such as the \"Additive-Free tobacco\" warranty to mean that \"the product, in fact, contains menthol.\" MTD at 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Eighth, the Defendants argue that the express warranty claims fail under California, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, New York, and North Carolina law, because the Plaintiffs did not give the Defendants notice before filing suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 66. The Defendants assert that Florida, Illinois, and New York law preclude the express warranty claims, because \"privity is required,\" and the Plaintiffs cannot establish privity. MTD at 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ninth, the Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is rendered moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 68. The Defendants maintain that, because they have entered a Memorandum of Agreement with the FDA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Agreement, under which Santa Fe Tobacco\n   will cease using \"additive-free\" and \"natural\" going forward (except for the \"Natural\" in the \"Natural American Spirit\" brand name), an injunction is inappropriate, because the Defendants have already undertaken the action that the Plaintiffs have requested. MTD at 68-69.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants aver that the Plaintiffs' requested injunction does not satisfy the mootness doctrine's voluntary-cessation exception,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   because, if they resumed using \"Natural\" or \"Additive-Free,\" the Defendants would expose themselves to an FDA enforcement action. MTD at 69-70 n.26. The Defendants argue, accordingly, that the Memorandum of Agreement renders \"moot[ ] Plaintiffs' requests for injunctive relief.\" MTD at 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Tenth, the Defendants assert that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Reynolds American with respect to the five Plaintiffs'\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   claims who were not parties to the North Carolina suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 70. In sum, the Defendants argue that the Court lacks both specific and general personal jurisdiction over Reynolds America.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 73. Turning first to specific personal jurisdiction, they contend that Reynolds American has not purposefully directed its activities at any of the transferor court states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 74. They argue that the Plaintiffs' allegation that Reynolds America is \"intimately involved in the marketing, advertising, and overall business development,\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 27, at 12, of Natural American cigarettes is conclusory, and that the\n   \"mere involvement in nationwide advertising\" does not amount to the requisite directed activity, MTD at 74. Turning to general personal jurisdiction, the Defendants say that general personal jurisdiction is proper only in North Carolina, because Reynolds America has no continuous and systematic contacts with any other state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 75.

The Plaintiffs add that, contrary to the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiffs unjust-enrichment allegation fails in New Jersey because it sounds in tort, New Jersey law has no such requirement and that, regardless, their claim is viable, \"because it could properly be construed as an equitable remedy\" under rule 8(a)(3).

Responding to the Court's observation that \"the Supreme Court is so divided on preemption these days,\" June Tr. at 16:18-19 (Court), the Defendants noted that the Supreme Court focused on only the FTC cease and desist order at issue in\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   , and did not \"enunciate some sort of blanket rule that consent decrees cannot be afforded preemptive effect,\" June Tr. at 16:25-17:1 (Biersteker).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 16:22-18:11 (Biersteker). The Defendants also argued that, in contrast to the\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   consent order, the parties have abided by the Consent Order at issue here, the FTC has not questioned the Consent Order's mandated disclosure, and the Consent Order here, unlike\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   's consent order, has language permitting the advertising language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 18:12-18 (Biersteker);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:17-20:19 (Biersteker).

The Defendants again stressed that the one-hundred-percent additive-free tobacco labeling is true, because the menthol is \"part of the cigarette,\" but \"not part of the tobacco,\" June Tr. at 43:15-16 (Schultz), yet conceded that, when the cigarette is smoked, inevitably the menthol \"is part of and touches the tobacco,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    at 43:19-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Court, Schultz).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 43:6-8 (Schultz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Plaintiffs responded that there is a body of caselaw ruling that a reasonable consumer is not required to turn around a label to verify whether a representation on the front is truthful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 51:25-52:7 (Wolchansky).

They explained that equity fills in the gaps that legal remedies leave, and that, because the Plaintiffs have an available legal remedy from the state statutes, unjust enrichment is improperly pled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 145:8-21 (Biersteker). The Defendants concluded that there is no dispute that legal statutory remedies exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 146:7-8 (Biersteker).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Supplemental Brief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On June 30, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief addressing several issues raised during the June Hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint and Incorporated Memorandum of Law at 1, filed June 30, 2017 (Doc. 117)(\"Supp. Brief\"). They assert three arguments: (i) whether a reasonable consumer is misled is typically a fact question that survives a motion to dismiss; (ii) the Defendants' disclaimer arguments are misplaced; and (iii) they have adequately pled their complaint to survive the rule 12(b)(6) standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief at 1-4. First, they assert that the Court's function is not to weigh the evidence, but to assess whether the Plaintiffs have plausibly stated a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief. at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

They contend that, under longstanding false advertising law, representations must be viewed in the context of the packaging or advertising as a whole,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief. at 11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Penrod Ricard USA, LLC v.

They also argue that the disclaimer is so obscured on the package that it ineffectively warns a reasonable consumer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief. at 12. Finally, they argue that a reasonable consumer is \"impervious to health warnings and disclaimers,\" because Natural American smokers had \"certainly seen and ignored health disclaimers on the packs of other brands\" before switching, so the Court \"should give little, if any, weight\" to the disclaimers in deciding the Motion to Dismiss. Supp. Brief at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Third, the Plaintiffs clarify that they do not argue that natural is misleading \"simply because manufacturing steps must be taken to put their tobacco in cigarette form\"; rather, they argue that the Defendants manufacturing processes do not conform to a reasonable consumers' understanding of the natural term. Supp. Brief at 13. They maintain that the term natural is misleading, because Natural Americans undergo flue-curing processing, artificial blending, and engineering to boost nicotine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief at 14 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 63-66, 72-73, at 30, 32-33). They conclude, thus, that it is plausible that a reasonable consumer would believe that Natural American cigarettes were less chemically enhanced and less nicotine-laced than other cigarettes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Brief at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     The Supplemental Response\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Defendants responded to the Supp. Brief on July 14, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief at 1, filed July 14, 2017 (Doc. 124)(\"Supp. Resp.\").

The Defendants also state that the administrative and academic findings on the Defendants' advertising do not bind the Court on a motion to dismiss, and many of their findings are inapposite, because the reports did not consider the warning disclosure or are not final determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 6-7. The Defendants also argue that the Court can disregard survey data as immaterial where a reasonable consumer would acknowledge that the advertising is not false or misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 8. The Defendants aver that their disclaimer still wards against the Plaintiffs' deceptive arguments as to the natural term, even though the disclaimer does not mention natural, because the disclaimer makes clear that the cigarettes are not safer than any other cigarette.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 10. The Defendants conclude that the Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint does not support the refined processing theory\n   that the Plaintiffs assert in their Supp. Brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     The July Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court held a hearing on July 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Motion Proceedings (taken July 20, 2017), filed August 10, 2017 (Doc. 126)(\"July Tr.\").

They add that unjust enrichment is a \"gap filler,\" and it is likely that those four states' laws narrow the unjust-enrichment remedy, \"because numerous legal remedies already exist for consumers who have suffered as a result of deceptive advertising.\" July Tr. at 11-17 (Biersteker). The Plaintiffs rejoined that, as to Michigan, the direct benefit element is no longer required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July Tr. at 37:10-18 (Wolchansky)(citing\n   <em>\n    In re Automotive Parts Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320211\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/29/982/#p1021\">\n    29 F.Supp.3d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1021 (E.D.

In fact, not only do the plaintiffs not make these allegations, but the plaintiffs also explicitly disavow any such allegations, claiming that they are entirely unnecessary to support their theory of unjust enrichment.

According to the plaintiffs, the class of people with a valid unjust enrichment claim would include the consumer who bought cigarettes and was never injured in any manner by his purchase. It would include the consumer who was satisfied by his cigarette purchase and planned to continue purchasing cigarettes. It would include the consumer who would not have acted any differently had he been fully informed about cigarettes, but bought them anyway regardless of the Defendants' marketing. It would include the consumer who was not deceived by the marketing because he was personally aware of the true nature of cigarettes, but still bought cigarettes despite their addictive and harmful nature-or even because of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   <em>\n    Cleary v.

It concludes that the remaining documents may be properly considered, because they are either referenced in the Amended Complaint or are matters of public record. Second, the Court concludes that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Reynolds American vis-\u00e0-vis the Plaintiffs' claims brought in a non-North Carolina forum, because Reynolds American's involvement with its subsidiary, Santa Fe Tobacco-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , its asset and board member overlap-is not so extensive as to make Santa Fe Tobacco Reynolds American's alter ego. Nevertheless, it will exercise its authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to transfer the claims, instead of dismissing them. Third, the Consent Order does not preempt the Plaintiffs' claims premised on the Safer-Cigarette Theory, because the Consent Order is not law, and an agreement not to enforce a federal law does not evince a clear and manifest purpose to supplant all state-law deceptive-practice claims. Fourth, the Court concludes that Natural American cigarettes' labeling and advertising misleads a reasonable consumer under the Plaintiffs' Safer-Cigarette and Menthol Theories, but not under the Plaintiffs' Unprocessed-Cigarette Theory. Decades-long marketing campaigns have infused the terms natural and organic with safety and health connotations, such that the Defendants' use of the terms would deceive a reasonable consumer. In addition, menthol is not such a common substance\n   that a reasonable consumer would understand that menthol is an additive when faced with a disclosure directly to the contrary. The Court, however, dismisses the claims to the extent that they are premised on the Unprocessed-Cigarette Theory. Fifth, the First Amendment does not shield the Defendant from liability, in part, because the state action doctrine precludes liability for contract-type claims, and, in part, because the descriptors plausibly deceived the plaintiffs. Sixth, the states' safe harbors, except for Illinois', do not preclude liability for largely the same reasons that the Consent Order did not preempt the Plaintiffs' claims. The Ohio statutory claims, nevertheless, must be dismissed, because the Plaintiffs do not satisfy OSCPA's notice requirement, and because consumers do not have standing to sue under ODTPA. Seventh, New Jersey precludes unjust-enrichment relief, because the Plaintiffs cannot allege a remuneration, and Ohio Law preclude unjust-enrichment relief, because the Plaintiffs cannot allege a direct benefit. However, the remaining claims may be pled in the alternative. Eighth, the express warranty claims under Florida, Illinois, and New York law must be dismissed, because the Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint cannot serve as the requisite notice, and must also be dismissed under Florida and Illinois law, because the Plaintiffs lack privity with the Defendants. Ninth, the Plaintiffs' requested injunctive relief is not yet rendered moot, because ongoing litigation may invalidate the Memorandum of Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     THE COURT MAY PROPERLY CONSIDER ALL BUT ONE DOCUMENT THAT THE DEFENDANTS HAVE SUBMITTED WITHOUT CONVERTING THE MOTION INTO ONE FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   The Defendants move for judicial notice of eighteen items, and they are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-401\">\n   (1) The 2000 FTC Complaint filed against Santa Fe Tobacco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. C-3952 Complaint (\"FTC Complaint\"), filed November 18, 2016 (Doc. 71-1)(\"First JN Motion Exhibits\"); First JN Motion Exhibits at CM/ECF 2-4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-402\">\n   (2) Natural American Spirit Advertising attached to the FTC Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. C-3952, Exhibits A-C, filed November 18, 2016 (Doc. 71-1)(\"FTC Complaint's exhibits\"); First JN Motion Exhibits at CM/ECF 6-8.

First, the Consent Order cannot preempt state law, because it was not subject to the APA's or the FTC Act's rigorous procedural requirements for promulgating regulations. Second, even if a consent order could preempt state law without going through the APA or FTC procedural requirements, an agreement not to enforce a federal law does not evince intent to preclude all state law liability. Third, assuming that the Consent Order had preemptive effect, it would only bind parties to the agreement, so the consent order would only prohibit the plaintiffs from bringing suit against Santa Fe Tobacco.

Even her comment that addresses how the disclosures should cure the advertising's deceptiveness is phrased in terms of overall cigarette safety. She says that the disclosures \"make it clear that ... cigarettes without additives are not safe to smoke.\" Press Release 1 at 1. Press Release 1 suggests, thus, that the Consent Order's purpose is to convey to consumers that cigarettes are unsafe.

Both consent orders prohibit descriptors unless a mandated disclosure accompanies them. Alternatively, using the Defendants' chosen rhetoric, both Consent Orders authorize those descriptors if a disclosure accompanies them. That authorization was insufficient for the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   , so cannot be sufficient for the Court here. The Defendants' attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   ultimately pivots on the Consent Orders' slightly different language-the\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   consent order phrases its order in terms of ceasing and desisting, and the Consent Order does not. Although the language enjoining the conduct might be slightly stronger in the Altria II order, the effect of the two orders is the same-prohibiting conduct, unless a disclosure accompanies it. That language difference does not persuade the Court that the FTC's \"clear and manifest purpose\" with the Consent Order was to supplant all state law deception claims, whereas the FTC had no such purpose with the\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   consent order.\n   <em>\n    Medtronic, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   , however, the Supreme Court's historical analysis had no bearing on its consent-order analysis; rather, the Supreme Court conducted a historical analysis to rebut the tobacco companies' argument that the FTC has a longstanding regulatory policy of authorizing the use of \"light\" and \"low tar\" descriptors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Altria II\n   </em>\n   , 555 U.S. at 87-89 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679526\" index=\"1365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/70/#p89\">\n    129 S.Ct. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if such a regulatory policy could provide a bases for obstacle pre-emption, petitioners' description of the FTC's actions in this regard are inaccurate.\").

Noting that the OFPA \"requires states to seek approval from the USDA only if the State wishes to operate an organic certification program,\" the Eighth Circuit determined that \"OFPA more modestly [than the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970] contemplates a certification program designed to effect national standards and to eliminate the preexisting 'havoc for the industry' caused by balkanized state regulations,\" and, therefore OFPA's regulatory scheme is not so pervasive as to suggest field preemption.\n   <em>\n    In re Aurora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783601\" index=\"1390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/781/#p792\">\n    621 F.3d at 793-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segedie v.

May 7, 2015) (Roman, J.). This reasoning persuasive. Merely establishing a national certification program, in and of itself, does not overcome the presumption against preemption.

The Court concludes, accordingly, that that the Plaintiffs' organic-premised claims are not field preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-472\">\n   Impossibility and obstacle preemption similarly do not bar the Plaintiffs' organic-based claims.

It is possible for the Defendants to adhere to these requirements without deceptively suggesting that their cigarettes are healthier than other cigarettes, so impossibility preemption is foreclosed. Regarding obstacle preemption, OFPA's purpose, as recounted previously, is to \"establish national standards governing the marketing of certain agricultural products as organically produced products\" and to \"assure customers that organically produced products meet a consistent standard.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206501\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) - (2).

State-law claims premised on a manufacturer's purported deception pose no obstacle to that effect. As the Eighth Circuit explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-473\">\n   [P]reemption of state consumer protection law may actually diminish consumer confidence that organic products meet consistent standards as consumers become aware that otherwise meritorious claims are being preempted because the certifying agent has not suspended the certification in spite of clear facts to the contrary. Similarly, although broad factual preemption may increase organic production in the short term, consumers may well elect to avoid paying the premium for organic products upon realizing preemption grants organic producers a de facto license to violate state fraud, consumer protection, and false advertising laws with relative impunity, because the OFPA's only remedy for noncompliance is recourse to the USDA for revocation of certification and possibly for a civil penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   <em>\n    In re Aurora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783601\" index=\"1398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/781/#p792\">\n    621 F.3d at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Third, they argue that the Unprocessed-Cigarette Theory is implausible, because a reasonable consumer would know that Natural American cigarettes are subjected to engineering processes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 47-49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-482\">\n   At the outset, the Court determines that it is plausible that a reasonable consumer, seeing the terms organic, natural, and additive free, would erroneously believe that Natural American cigarettes are safer or healthier than other cigarettes. In pleading their Safer-Cigarette Theory, the Plaintiffs rely heavily on several social science studies, which conclude that Natural American smokers are far more likely to believe that their brand is healthier than other cigarette brands, because of those descriptors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 50-54, at 23-27; Supp. Arg. at 4-6. For example, one study concludes that \"[n]early 1 million US adult smokers prefer\" Natural American cigarettes and they \"are 22 times more likely than other smokers to believe that their brand is less harmful than other cigarette brands,\" leading the study authors to conclude that Natural American smokers may choose that brand because of the \"descriptors organic, natural, and additive free on product packaging and advertising.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 52, at 25 (citing\n   <em>\n    Misperceptions\n   </em>\n   at 3). As surely as a Ph.D. cannot be swapped for an Article III commission, an academic study cannot take the place of the Court's judgment on a rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Moreover, a reasonable consumer would look on the packages' sides and top for disclosures such as the one contained on Natural American's packaging. Product packaging commonly has additional information about the product on the back and sides, so a reasonable consumer would look there for disclaimers or qualifying information. A reasonable consumer would not look on the bottom of packaging in the same way, because relevant information is rarely there. That observation is not to say that a reasonable consumer is expected to understand every piece of information disclosed on a package's sides. The Court agrees with\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Gerber Products Co.\n   </em>\n   's reasoning that some information may be too ambiguous to provide a reasonable consumer curative information. Here, however, there is no ambiguity. The disclaimer is clear and express.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   The Plaintiffs also contend that the disclosure is hidden, tucked under barcode, so a reasonable consumer cannot be expected to find it. The Court agrees with this argument to a point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   Above are two representative packages that the Court judicially noticed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gold Label at CM/ECF 78-83; Turquoise Label at CM/ECF 85-90. The disclaimer is located on the right-hand side, underneath the bar code, and, although it is not in the most prominent location, the disclaimer is legible, the Defendants have made the font color white on packaging where white text stands out, and black where black text stands out, and the disclaimer is not buried in a paragraph of text; instead, it is a single, separate sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gold Label at CM/ECF 78-83; Turquoise Label at CM/ECF 85-90.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   American Labeling at 64-111 on CM/ECF. On just those facts, the Court would conclude that a reasonable consumer would be expected to locate, read, and understand the disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-487\">\n   Cigarettes are often sold, however, in a manner such that a consumer cannot inspect the packaging in detail before purchasing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the cigarettes are kept locked in a display next to or behind the counter. The display shows the cigarette pack's front, but not the sides or back. A store clerk sometimes does not even hand the cigarette pack to the consumer before purchase, but places the pack directly in a shopping bag. Based on this, even though a reasonable consumer would inspect other items before purchase, it is not clear that they would have the opportunity to inspect Natural American cigarettes' labeling. Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude that the package's disclosure would cure a deception inflicted upon a reasonable consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-488\">\n   The Plaintiffs do not argue that a reasonable consumer would miss the disclosures on the Defendants' advertising,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 43, and the Court concludes that a reasonable consumer would read and comprehend the advertising disclosures. Unlike the packaging, the advertisement's disclaimer is in a prominent location boxed over the Surgeon General's Warning, and a reasonable consumer would spot it easily.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tobacco &amp; Water Advertisement at 114 on CM/ECF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-489\">\n   Although a reasonable consumer would understand from the disclosure that the lack of additives does not make Natural American cigarettes healthier, that disclaimer says nothing about the natural or organic descriptors. As explained above, those two terms have an independent connotation that a product is healthier or safer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Discount Tobacco City &amp; Lottery, Inc. v.

The Defendants' conflate the natural and additive-free terms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply at 22, and also argue that \"the disclosure plainly disclaims any notion\n   that Natural American cigarettes are safer than alternatives,\" Supp. Resp. at 10. The Court disagrees. The Defendants' argument asks for a hefty inference in light of the disclosure's specificity. The disclaimer states: \"No additives in our tobacco does\n   <strong>\n    NOT\n   </strong>\n   mean a safer cigarette.\" FTC Consent Order at 4. It says nothing about natural; it says nothing about organic. Specific language communicates a specific meaning and a reasonable consumer interprets it with that specific meaning.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Universal Service Fund Telephone Billing Practice Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777645\" index=\"1449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/619/1188/#p1218\">\n    619 F.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1218 (10th Cir. 2010) (ruling that specific terms in a contract governs the contract's meaning). The natural and organic descriptors, accordingly, are deceptive to a reasonable consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-490\">\n   Natural American's additive-free descriptor on menthol cigarettes also misleads a reasonable consumer. The crux of the Defendants' arguments against the Plaintiffs' Menthol Theory is that a reasonable consumer would know that menthol cigarettes contain menthol-an additive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 46. From that premise, they argue that an additive-free descriptor would not be deceptive, because a reasonable consumer knows that she is purchasing a menthol cigarette.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 46. That argument assumes, however, that a reasonable consumer is so secure in her knowledge that menthol is an additive that an express representation to the contrary, on a heavily regulated product,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillip Morris, Inc. v.

Menthol's properties are not commonly known, even among cigarette users.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Scientific Evaluation of the Possible Public Health Effects of Menthol Versus Nonmenthol Cigarettes\n   </em>\n   , Food and Drug Administration, 70-71 (2013) available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/PeerReviewofScientificInformationandAsse/UCM361598.pdf (reporting that menthol users held diverging beliefs on menthol's health and addictive risks). Before this case, the Court did not know much, if anything, about menthol. It knew that it gave a smoother, milder smoking experience, and increased a cigarette's appeal and enjoyment to a broader consumer base, but it did not know what menthol is or whether it is a natural substance or additive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 54:21 (Court)(\"What is menthol?\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314386\" index=\"1451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/24/#p26\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314386\" index=\"1451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/24/#p26\">\n    at 64:10-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Court)(\"But menthol, what is it?

What exactly is menthol?\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concludes that it is plausible that a reasonable consumer would not know whether menthol naturally occurs in tobacco. Many goods have naturally occurring qualities that are prominently labeled separately on the good. For example, caffeine naturally occurs in coffee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gwendolyn Prothro,\n   <em>\n    The Caffeine Conundrum: Caffeine Regulation in the United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Cumb.%20L.%20Rev.%2065\">\n    27 Cumb. L. Rev. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66 (1996). Moreover, even if a reasonable consumer knows that menthol is an additive, it is nonetheless plausible that an additive-free descriptor undermines her knowledge, because menthol is an uncommon good. Unlike the Defendants' reasonable consumer examples,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a reasonable consumer knows that almond milk contains no dairy milk and that veggie bacon contains no pork,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTD at 47, menthol is not milk or bacon; its inherent qualities are not well known. It is plausible that, faced with a contrary descriptor, the reasonable consumer would conclude that\n   her preconceived notions about menthol are mistaken. Indeed, she could conclude that menthol is a type of tobacco or tobacco grown in a specific location, such as perique tobacco.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-491\">\n   The ingredient's list on the product's back, which itemizes tobacco and menthol separately, does not dispel the deception. Without an unambiguous signal that the ingredients list is countermanding another representation on the package, \"reasonable consumers expect that the ingredient list contains more detailed information about the product that confirms other representations on the packaging.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Gerber Products Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012495\" index=\"1453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/934/#p938\">\n    552 F.3d at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Gerber Products Co.\n   </em>\n   is persuasive to the Court, and it concludes that the state Supreme Courts would also find it persuasive; the reasonable consumer is not hyper-vigilant and does not expect the product's packaging to deceive her. Ingredient itemization does not offer the same clear signal that the FTC-mandated disclosure does. It does not, for example, state that \"Menthol is an additive.\" In this case, the packaging indicates only that organic menthol and organic tobacco are ingredients. There are many reasons why a reasonable consumer would conclude that the ingredients list does not contradict the additive-free descriptor. For example, a reasonable consumer could presume that the FDA requires cigarette packaging to separately label menthol. Moreover, faced with conflicting representations, one clear and the other ambiguous, the reasonable consumer follows the clear one.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Universal Service Fund Telephone Billing Practice Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777645\" index=\"1454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/619/1188/#p1218\">\n    619 F.3d at 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-492\">\n   The packaging's and advertising's \"natural\" descriptors do not, however, plausibly mislead a reasonable consumer into believing that Natural American tobacco is less processed than tobacco in other cigarettes. As the Court discusses below, natural is a word with many meanings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at 1243-44. Any meaning is, thus, context dependent. A reasonable consumer comes to the market with a degree of background knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibarrola v. Kind, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290573\" index=\"1455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/751/#p757\">\n    83 F.Supp.3d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757 (N.D. Ill. 2015) (Ellis, J.). In this case, a reasonable consumer knows that tobacco undergoes engineering processes before it is sold in cigarettes. Such awareness is clear from visually comparing a tobacco leaf to a cigarette. In order to mislead a reasonable consumer, the descriptor at issue must, thus, rebut the reasonable consumer's background knowledge. The natural descriptor found on Natural American cigarette's advertising and labeling is not enough to negate a reasonable consumer's understanding that turning tobacco into cigarettes requires processing, nor is it enough to suggest that Natural American tobacco undergoes less processing than other cigarette's tobacco. The term natural most often modifies \"tobacco\" on the Defendants' products and advertising.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Natural American Labeling at 64-111 on CM/ECF; Tobacco &amp; Water Advertisement at 114 on CM/ECF. With that context, the natural descriptor says little, if anything, about the engineering processes; it says something about the type of tobacco. The Defendants' other use of natural is in the brand name: Natural American Spirit. Construing similar statutes, other federal courts have determined that brand names carry less persuasive impact on a reasonable consumer than other product labeling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

The underlying rationale is that reasonable consumers know that brand names are often creative and that substantive information about the product is less likely to be located there. Although conceivable that the natural term and the surrounding American Indian imagery communicates to some consumers that Natural American cigarette's tobacco is less processed than other cigarette's tobacco, the Court concludes that a reasonable consumer would not believe that Natural American tobacco is less processed from the brand name alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-493\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     THE FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSE FAILS\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-494\">\n   The Defendants argue that the First Amendment shields them from all liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 20.

The Court concludes that a cigarette manufacturer could create, package, and sell cigarettes that were natural, organic, and additive-free without lying. The most ready example is a manufacturer who grows tobacco, wraps it up, and sells it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   The Menthol Theory, however, imposes liability for inherently misleading speech. This analysis diverges from the above, because additive-free's meaning exists in direct conflict with the menthol's presence in the cigarette. Menthol is an additive. Therefore an additive-free cigarette cannot have menthol. It is not possible for some other cigarette manufacturer to produce a menthol cigarette that is additive free and truthfully advertise it as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   To rebut that conclusion, the Defendants argue that the menthol is added to the cigarette filters, and not the tobacco, so the additive-free natural tobacco label is truthful, because the menthol is not added to the tobacco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 24. The Defendants admit, however, that, when the cigarette is smoked, inevitably the menthol intermingles with the tobacco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 43:19-23 (Court, Schultz).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June Tr. at 43:6-8 (Schultz). The Court concludes that this eventual commingling makes the menthol modifier inherently misleading. The Court cannot see how another cigarette manufacturer could create a cigarette with menthol in the filter that never commingles with the tobacco. The Defendants' final argument that any misunderstanding could be dispelled through a new disclosure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTD at 24-25, misapprehends the inherently misleading test. The Court cannot assume in new disclosures otherwise no speech would be inherently misleading. Any assumed disclosure could cure deception with a simple explanation that the inherently misleading speech is a lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   Finally, the descriptors are not inherently misleading with respect to the Unprocessed-Cigarette Theory. The analysis largely mirrors the Safer-Cigarette Theory analysis above. It is possible that a cigarette manufacturer could create a cigarette, label it natural, and not subject it to rigorous engineering processes. As explained, a cigarette company could harvest the tobacco, roll it up without adding anything to it, and sell it. Accordingly, under\n   <em>\n    Revo\n   </em>\n   , that modifier is not inherently misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   Those conclusions do not end the Court's analysis, however.

Finally, the plaintiffs allege that Natural American cigarettes are not safer or healthier than other cigarette brands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 59, at 29. Based on the foregoing allegations, the Court concludes that it is plausible that the named plaintiffs were deceived into believing that Natural Americans cigarettes were safer or healthier than other cigarettes, because of Natural Americans branding and advertising.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 12-23, at 4-11. The advertising and labeling disclosures do not undermine this conclusion, because there is no evidence that the plaintiffs read those disclosures. Moreover, even if they had read them, the disclosures speak only to the \"no additive\" modifier and not to the \"organic\" or \"natural\" terms.

In\n   <em>\n    Lorillard Tobacco Co. v.

Comparable reasoning holds true in the Menthol and Unprocessed-Cigarette Theory contexts as well, because removing or modifying the additive-free and natural terms directly targets the deception and would relieve it entirely. A consumer would not believe that a cigarette is additive-free or natural without those terms present. The Defendants contend, however, that money damages or an injunction do not materially advance the interest in protecting consumers from deception, because: (i) the pre-existing disclosures cure any deception whether Natural American cigarettes are safer or healthier; and (ii) the menthol labeling puts menthol purchasers on notice that they are purchasing cigarettes with additives, even though the cigarettes are labeled with \"no additives.\" In sum, they argue that there is no deception. Regarding the pre-existing disclosures, again, the disclosures refer only to the \"no additive\" descriptor, and not the \"organic\" or \"natural\" descriptors, so an injunction or damages would still materially advance the government's interest in dissuading deception arising from the natural and organic adjectives. Moreover, while disclosures or disclaimers usually dispel some deception, some representations are so misleading that disclaimers cannot dispel the misleading information,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381145,3668070\" index=\"1583\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/650/\">\n    164 F.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659 (D.C.

Cir. 1985) (\"This fine-print legend, moreover, often appears in virtually illegible form, placed in an inconspicuous corner of Barclay advertisements.\"). The Court concludes that, in light of the disclosures' placement underneath the barcode and divorced from the Surgeon General's warning, money damages or an injunction would materially advance the state's interest even as to the \"additive-free\" term, because a substantial number of consumers would not think to look there for that disclosure, or would not even see the disclaimer\n   until after they were deceived into paying a premium for Natural American cigarettes. The Defendants' menthol labeling argument fails, because it assumes that a majority of menthol purchasers are so secure in their knowledge that menthol is an additive that an express representation to the contrary does not mislead them into thinking that menthol is not an additive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   In considering the final factor-that the regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve the governmental interest-the Supreme Court has cautioned that it is not a \"least-restrictive-means requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Board of Trustees of State University of New York v.

The money damages requested meet this requirement.

The question in this case is whether the Consent Order permits the descriptors at issue or prohibits them. California caselaw provides little guidance on that distinction, but the test appears to be one of degree and context. For example, legislation expressly immunizing conduct from liability amounts to permission, whereas a robbery law's failure to prohibit murder does not amount to permission to commit murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cel-Tech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1604\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20548\">\n    83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1605\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20P.2d%20527\">\n    973 P.2d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Consent Order is an agreement that, subject to certain conditions, the FTC will not bring an enforcement action. The Consent Order is, thus, not as clearly permissive as the express immunity from suit is, but it also diverges from the robbery example, because the order bears directly on the Defendants' actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-530\">\n   Bearing that test in mind, the Court concludes that the Supreme Court of California would rule that the Consent Order does not authorize the Defendants' allegedly misleading conduct. Although the context suggests that the Consent Order permits the descriptors, the Consent Order's degree of permission is dispositive. As already explained, the Consent Order does not expressly authorize conduct; it states only that the agency will not to bring an enforcement action. An agreement not to enforce conveys, at best, a minimum level of approval and, at worst, indifference. Moreover, a consent order is far more fragile than express legislative authorization. Agencies might disagree, as the FDA and FTC have in this case, or the agency may later change its position for some other reason. Accordingly, an agreement not enforce does not amount to permission. This conclusion is in accord with other federal and State Supreme Court cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Finally, they conclude that two of twelve claims fail for state-specific reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 53.

The Court, thus, must determine whether the federal rule violates the Rules Enabling Act by abridging, modifying, or enlarging a substantive right. There are two possible interpretations of the rule that an adequate legal remedy bars equitable relief. First, it could mean that, as part of providing a statutory,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , legal, remedy, the state legislature displaced judge-made remedies like unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Light Cigarettes Marketing Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264938\" index=\"1759\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/751/183/#p192\">\n    751 F.Supp.2d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it could mean that equitable relief is unnecessary, because a legal claim exists, which makes pleading equitable relief redundant. Regarding the first possible interpretation, if a state legislature displaces all unjust enrichment claims rooted in consumer deception, then such claims will never survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim; rule 8 would have no bearing on the analysis. Regarding the second possible interpretation, however, if state rules regarding the adequacy of remedies at law serve only to eliminate duplicative pleading, then such state rules conflict with rule 8(d). Applying rule 8(d) would grant the Plaintiffs a procedural right that would be unavailable in state court,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the right to plead legal and equitable theories in the alternative. Granting the Plaintiffs a procedural right does not violate the Rules Enabling Act, which prohibits the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure from abridging, enlarging, or modifying substantive rights. Allowing the Plaintiffs to plead in the alternative does not create a new claim or permit double recovery, because, the legal claim will either prove meritorious and the equitable claim will be dismissed, or the legal claim will fail and the equitable claim will proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-584\">\n   The Court concludes that the state laws at issue serve only to eliminate duplicative pleading, so rule 8 applies. Surveying the consumer protection statutes at issue, none bar common-law equitable relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1760\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206-1-101\">\n    Colo.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Erie\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit-or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves-would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point-regardless whether it accurately reflects state law-at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-712\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the judge's identity pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination-the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants-if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion-have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-713\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. Accordingly, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind developments in state law-developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-714\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court concludes that the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding-what the state law was on the day the opinion was published-but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-715\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    . Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive-interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court concludes that the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Erie\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law-in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-716\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Erie\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This formulation may not be the most precise one if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court-the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Laboratories v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court-considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law-may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Erie\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-717\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Erie\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time-forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous)-federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases-even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law-alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-718\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Erie\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree.

The wording suggests two possible readings. First, it could mean that all non-parties to the agreement can pursue state law claims against all parties and non-parties to the agreement without the consent order preempting their claims. Under that reading, the Plaintiffs' claims would not be preempted, because they were not parties to the Consent Order. The other plausible reading is that non-parties claims against parties to the agreement can be preempted, but nonparties claims against non-parties cannot be preempted. The Court concludes that the second reading is the Supreme Court's most likely meaning. The first meaning limits a consent order's preemptive effect to such a degree that a consent order would almost never preempt state law claims.

In that case, the plaintiffs did not argue whether rule 8 applied. The Court notes some tension in that case and this ruling, but the Court there was construing New Mexico law, and not rule 8. In addition, the Court determined there that the unjust-enrichment claim was prudently dismissed, because recovery on the contract claim against one party was highly likely, and preserving the equity claim would inflict an injustice on a third party who would otherwise be dismissed from the action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263246\" index=\"2165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/20/1244/#p1273\">\n     20 F.Supp.3d at 1284-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
