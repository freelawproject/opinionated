Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Opp. to Pl's Mot. for Summary J and in Reply in Support of Def.'s Mot. for Summary J. 4-5 (citing the Second Declaration of Eric F. Stein). Because agency declarations are given a presumption of good faith,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SafeCard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and there is no evidence in the record indicating the contrary, there is no reason to disbelieve that the agency considered and incorporated the source of the interview in its search methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although Judicial Watch's suggestion of simply asking the interviewee about the potential existence and location of the documents appears plausible on its face-indeed, likely much easier than the laborious efforts the State Department actually utilized-to do so would have placed the State Department in a quandary. Judicial Watch has already narrowed the list of potential interviewees to three, one of whom no longer works for the State Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply in Support of Cross-Mot. for Summary J. 2-3. Depending upon whether the interviewee is in fact the former employee, the requisite declaration describing the efforts taken by the State Department would inevitably have either identified the interviewee or narrowed the list to two. FOIA does not require-and in fact expressly exempts-disclosure of the interviewee's identity;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(6), 552(B)(7)(c) ; and this litigation should not be used as a back-door means of discerning the same. Thus, the agency's search of the interviewee's documents, coupled with the other steps taken by the State Department in response to Judicial Watch's request, reflects a search methodology \"reasonably expected to produce the information requested.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   68 : The search efforts undertaken by the State Department appropriately balanced the rights of Judicial Watch to obtain information with the right of the interviewee to remain anonymous. Nothing more is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant's motion for summary judgment will be granted and Judicial Watch's motion for summary judgment will be denied. A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4)(B) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1391.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Judicial Watch did not dispute any statements in the State Department's SOMF. Pl.'s Response to Def.'s SOMF \u00b6\u00b6 \u00a7 I. 1-20. Accordingly, all citations to the State Department's SOMF indicate undisputed facts in this matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The U.S. Department of Justice does have an Office of Legal Counsel (\"OLC\"), but it seems unlikely that OLC would have been involved in this internal State Department issue. In any event, Judicial Watch did not include the Department of Justice in its FOIA request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
