BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Ayman Aishat has been a legal permanent resident of the United States since 1989 and applied for citizenship in 2000. He has spent the two decades since waiting for a resolution. Tired of living in limbo, Aishat recently filed this suit, asking the Court to compel Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to resolve his naturalization application in a timely fashion. The agency counters by moving to dismiss one count of his Complaint for failure to state a claim and then seeking to transfer the remainder to the Eastern District of Texas. Persuaded on both grounds, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion and send this case to the Lone Star State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Complaint, which the Court must presume true at this stage, Aishat is a citizen of Jordan and first entered this country on a student visa in 1989.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 3, 18. He later received a green card through his employer and currently works as a wireless-network engineer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. Plaintiff has also married a U.S. citizen with whom he has three U.S.-citizen children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19. On June 6, 2000, he too sought citizenship, filing his N-400 naturalization application with USCIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. Over the ensuing 18 years, his application has encountered several snares. After interviewing Aishat at the USCIS Dallas Field Office on January 23, 2001, the agency took no action on his application for the next seven years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21. On March 6, 2008, the Dallas Office scheduled another interview with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. Three more years passed before USCIS denied his naturalization application,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22, claiming he had failed to disclose his past affiliation with an organization known as the Holy Land Foundation (which the Treasury Department lists as a fundraising arm for \"a terrorist organization,\" Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. A (N-400 Denial) at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 31, 2011, Aishat filed an N-336 naturalization appeal and has since repeatedly requested that the agency provide any adverse evidence used to deny his original application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 23. USCIS ignored those requests. Id. Instead, it scheduled another interview at the Dallas Office in November of that year and then issued a request for more information related to his application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25. Specifically, it sought \"a list of organizations of which Plaintiff had ever been a member of or affiliated with.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25. Aishat timely complied with all requests by February 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   USCIS stayed silent for the next five years,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26, and Plaintiff, understandably fed up with the delay, filed suit in this\n   Court, naming as Defendants: the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; USCIS; Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of Homeland Security; L. Francis Cissna, the Director of USCIS; William Bierman, the Director of the Dallas Field Office; and Tracy Tarango, Acting Director of USCIS District 33. His Complaint includes four counts: (1) a mandamus claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asking the Court to compel Defendants to promptly adjudicate his N-336 naturalization appeal; (2) allegations that USCIS's \"unreasonably delayed\" action violated the Administrative Procedure Act; (3) allegations that the delay violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA); and (4) a request for a declaratory judgment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Seemingly spurred by the lawsuit, USCIS issued a notice asking Aishat to provide his \"biometrics\" (including fingerprinting) at the Dallas Field Office on December 28, 2017, before scheduling yet another interview at the same location on January 25, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exhs.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's suit revolves around the USCIS Dallas Field Office's delay in processing his naturalization application. Defendants, contending that this Dallas-centric action belongs in the Eastern District of Texas, ask this Court to transfer it there. Before it does so, however, they also seek dismissal of Count III, which alleges that the agency's delay violated the INA. While the D.C. Circuit has counseled that \"normally,\" a court should \"be inclined to transfer the entire case,\" it need not \"follow that path when briefing and argument in [the] court have convinced [it] that [a plaintiff] has stated no claim\" against the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cameron v.

Cir. 1993). Such is the case here, as the Government presents a straightforward case for dismissal of one count. The Court thus begins its analysis there before addressing Defendants' Motion to Transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under Count III, Plaintiff alleges that \"[b]y refusing to adjudicate [his] N-336 naturalization appeal, Defendants are depriving [him] of his statutory right under the INA to seek judicial review of the denial of his N-400 naturalization application.\" Compl., \u00b6 40. By way of background, an applicant for naturalization initiates the process by submitting USCIS's Form N-400.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When, as here, the agency issues an adverse decision, the applicant can appeal it by requesting a hearing before an immigration officer within 30 days of denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Upon receipt of the administrative appeal (also known as the N-336 Form), the agency must schedule a review hearing within \"180 days from the date upon which the appeal is filed\" before a different and higher ranking immigration officer than the one who denied the original naturalization application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20336.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 336.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Despite scheduling several interviews, the Dallas Field Office has yet to issue a decision on his appeal, and Aishat claims that this delay has violated the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. On its face, though, that statute provides no basis for this Court's review until Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201421\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20336.9\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 336.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Aishat, notably, does not argue otherwise. He concedes that section 1421(c), by its plain text, \"permits a denied naturalization applicant to seek judicial review of his naturalization review\n   <em>\n    only after\n   </em>\n   the administrative appeals process has been completed.\" Opp. at 14 (emphasis added); Compl., \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   He nevertheless maintains that this Court should find an\n   <em>\n    implied\n   </em>\n   right of action within the INA statutory scheme, as the agency's delay has otherwise \"made it impossible for Plaintiff ... to seek judicial review of his application.\" Opp. at 13. The Supreme Court has specified four factors when evaluating such an argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted; (2) whether some indication exists\n   of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, to create or to deny a private remedy; (3) whether implying a private right of action is consistent with the underlying purpose of the legislative scheme; and (4) whether the cause of action is one traditionally related to state law, such that it would be inappropriate for the court to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    El Paso Nat.

As the only apparent witnesses at this point all reside in Texas, this factor also tilts toward transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    2. Public-Interest Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The public-interest factors, on the whole, lean the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   a. Transferee's Familiarity with the Governing Laws\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Neither party contests that the legal issues presented here-which involve claims of federal law only-could be handled competently by a court in either district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 11; Reply at 5. This factor is therefore neutral.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663785\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/42/#p49\">\n    437 F.Supp.2d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (D.D.C. 2006) (where \"both courts are competent to interpret the federal statutes involved[,] ... there is no reason to transfer or not transfer based on this factor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   b. Relative Congestion of the Courts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that \"[t]he relative docket congestion between the District and the Eastern District of Texas strongly weighs against transfer of this case.\" Opp. at 2. He highlights that as of September 2017, there were 615 cases per judge pending in the latter district, compared to 263 per judge here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663785\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/42/#p49\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 12 &amp; Exh. A. Those raw statistics, however, may overstate the difference, as they \"provide, at best, only a rough measure of the relative congestion of the dockets in the two districts.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. H &amp; R Block, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5905910\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/74/#p84\">\n    789 F.Supp.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84-85 (D.D.C. 2011) (treating relative congestion of dockets as neutral factor in transfer analysis). \"They do not, for example, reflect the differences in the caseloads carried by different individual judges in each district. Any disparities between the lengths of time from filing to trial may also reflect differences other than congestion, such as differences in the types of cases that are likely to be tried in each district and the level of discovery and pre-trial motion practice required in those cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5905910\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/789/74/#p84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This factor, then, weighs only slightly against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   c. Local Interest in Controversies\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On the other side of the ledger, Defendants argue that the Eastern District's interest in \"resolving local disputes at home\" strongly favors transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 5. The Court agrees. This case turns on whether it should compel the Dallas Field Office to expedite its adjudication of Plaintiff's naturalization appeal. As several courts in this Circuit have concluded, \"[T]he district in which the relevant USCIS Field Office is located is 'better positioned' to be involved in 'dictating the priorities of a local USCIS office' and 'may have a superior interest in doing so.' \"\n   <em>\n    Chauhan v.

The Eastern District of Texas would thus be the sole proper venue for further review of any denial-a decision that might well be bound up in the agency's reason for delaying now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 8 (attributing Defendants' initial denial of his application\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   its subsequent delay to CARRP). That district court, then, has an interest in determining\n   in the first instance whether USCIS has unreasonably delayed the adjudication of Plaintiff's Form N-336 or whether a writ of mandamus should issue directing USCIS to act upon it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   All told, this case involves a Texas-based Plaintiff seeking to compel the USCIS's Texas-based field officers to adjudicate his application. The private factors thus counsel strongly in favor of sending the suit there. While the Court is sympathetic to Aishat's argument about docket congestion (especially given the delay already endured), the public-interest factors ultimately tilt the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss Count III of Plaintiff's Complaint and transfer the remaining counts to the Eastern District of Texas. It will issue a contemporaneous Order so stating.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
