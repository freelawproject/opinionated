Plaintiffs run three seafood businesses in the Municipal Fish Market and bring this action as lessees of property located within the Market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. As previously noted, Plaintiffs initially named as defendants the District, which was the original leaseholder for the properties, and HMW and WHRL, with WFMRL subsequently added as a defendant by WHRL (these three defendants are collectively referred to as \"Initial Developer Defendants\"). Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint also added WDGJV, WHR, HSW, and WDJV (collectively, the \"New Developer\n   Defendants\") as additional defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 23-29, 58 (noting that all the Developer Defendants are \"affiliated\" entities and further, that \"the District assigned Plaintiffs' leases to [the] Developer Defendants, acting through WHRL[,] [which in turn] assigned the leases to WFMRL.\") The commercial leases at issue are: the agreement entered into by The Wharf and the District dated July 12, 2000; the agreement entered into by Captain White and the District dated July 12, 2000; and the agreement originally entered into by Pruitt's Seafood, Inc. and the District, and subsequently assumed by Salt Water (then doing business as W.D., Inc.) from DNM Seafood, Inc. on March 14, 2001, with the consent of then-lessor, the District. Third Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49, 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In their Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs include three claims against the District, including two Fifth Amendment Takings Clause claims (Counts I and II) and a violation of procedural due process claim (Count III). Plaintiffs also raise the following eight claims against all of the Developer Defendants: declaratory judgment (Count IV); specific performance and injunctive relief based on breach of lease (Count V); breach of lease (Count VI); breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count VII), trespass and conversion (Count VIII); nuisance (Count IX); tortious interference with prospective business advantage (Count X); and unjust enrichment (Count XI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before discussing the allegations against the New Developer Defendants that are contained in Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint, it is perhaps useful to examine the triggering event that led the Plaintiffs to add these parties as defendants. Plaintiffs assert that \"shortly after the parties commenced discovery in March 2017, Plaintiffs learned of the existence of additional, affiliated entities associated with the Wharf Project development.\" Pls.' Opp'n. at 2. This occurred after the Initial Developer Defendants produced to Plaintiffs an organizational chart, which not only showed that the New Developer Defendants owned and controlled or were owned and controlled by the Initial Developer Defendants but also that all defendants were \"part of a complex, interwoven corporate network-all working towards the development, financing, and construction of the Wharf Project.\" Pls.' Opp'n. at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fish Market Organizational Chart, ECF No. 119-1, Ex. A. The Fish Market Organizational Chart begins with Initial Developer Defendant HMW, a joint venture and the developer selected for the redevelopment project at issue in this case, and it ends with the other Initial Developer Defendants-WHRL, a limited liability company and former landlord of the Plaintiffs, and WFMRL, a limited liability company and current landlord of the Plaintiffs. Following the Chart from start to finish necessitates movement through three levels of other organizations, all of whom are affiliated with the Initial Developer Defendants and involved in some way with the redevelopment project, and who have been named as New Developer Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The New Developer Defendants concede that Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint adds new factual allegations relevant to them, but they argue that while such allegations may demonstrate overlapping ownership with the Initial Developer Defendants, which encompasses some common officers, directors, office space and management, this is not enough to support alter ego or conspiracy claims. Nor do Plaintiffs allege that such entities were \"formed to perpetrate a fraud on them\" or is there \"any reason to believe that the Original Developer Defendants would be unable to satisfy any judgment\" the Plaintiffs may obtain. New Developer Defs.' Mem. at 3. These New Developer Defendants assert therefore that the claims against them should be dismissed because they are \"premised solely upon Plaintiffs' allegations that [they] are alter egos or co-conspirators\" of the Initial Developer Defendants, and Plaintiffs do not plead sufficient facts to support conspiracy or alter ego claims. New Develop. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The crux of the New Developer Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is a recitation of case law indicating what type of information/evidence Plaintiffs would be required to provide in order to state a claim for alter ego (which they maintain Plaintiffs have not done) as well as an argument that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged a claim of conspiracy. The New Developer Defendants seem to focus on a footnote in the Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint, which states that \"[d]iscovery will show whether the Developer Defendant entities conspired to commit [ ] illegal acts..., or whether the[y] are simply one and the same, such that no conspiracy between\n   them was necessary. For the purpose of this Complaint, and based on the representations by Developer Defendant to the Plaintiffs, the entities are treated as alter egos.\" Third Am. Compl. at 2, n.1.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 32 (alleging that WDGPJV, WHR, HSW and WDJV are alter egos of WHRL and HMW, and giving examples of the interrelated ownership of the entities, common management, and sharing of corporate offices, telephone numbers and websites.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In their Opposition, Plaintiffs present no counterargument with regard to the New Developer Defendants' discussion of alter ego and conspiracy; rather, they begin by clarifying that the New Developer Defendants are mistaken in their assumption that Plaintiffs are \"relying exclusively upon a corporate veil piercing theory\" or that such defendants were named \"solely for satisfaction of judgment purposes.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 4. Plaintiffs assert that while they do incorporate the term \"alter ego\" into their Third Amended Complaint a few times, for the purpose of describing the relationship between defendants, those defendant entities \"are part of a complex, interwoven corporate network in which they each 'play [ ] a role in advancing some aspect of the development, financing, construction and, when finished, the operation of the [Wharf] Project.' \" Pls.' Opp'n at 4-5 (citing Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 34).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs urge this Court to \"consider [the] complaint as a whole\" in determining whether the allegations therein are sufficient to survive the pending motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Matthews v.

In this case, Plaintiffs generally rely on the Fish Market Organizational Chart, attached as Ex. A to their Third Amended Complaint, and various factual allegations contained in their Third Amended Complaint to support their assertion that the Court may \"draw a reasonable inference that the authorization necessary for HMW to direct conduct respecting Plaintiffs' Leases, ..., must flow down and through and be approved by resolutions, delegations, or consents issued by the other entities in the corporate chain, which actually perform the unauthorized acts, or direct or approve performance of the unauthorized acts by their subsidiary entities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Cir. 2015). More specifically, Plaintiffs look to the Wharf District Joint Venture, L.P. Consolidated Financial Statements, ECF No. 119-2, Ex. B, to flesh out the role of some of the New Developer Defendants in this lawsuit. Ex. B indicates that New Developer Defendant HSW entered into the Land Disposition Agreement (\"LDA\") with the District of Columbia on May 13, 2009, and assigned those rights to WDJV in 2014 with the effect that WDJV \"through its wholly owned subsidiaries secured the developer rights\" to the project. Ex. B at 10. New Developer Defendant WDJV was \"formed to serve as 'Developer' under the ... LDA with the District of Columbia\" with authority that included the \"Fish Market redevelopment.\" Ex. B at 6. Plaintiffs highlight Paragraphs 186-192 of the Third Amended Complaint, which reference Plaintiffs' allegations against the developer defendants for actions that occurred after 2014, and they conclude that \"[f]or the Court to refuse to permit joinder of the\n   <em>\n    actual developer\n   </em>\n   of the project for the period beginning in April 2014 to the present would be inappropriate given the specific number of acts alleged to have been undertaken by the developer during this period that were contrary to the Tenant Leases.\" Pls.'
