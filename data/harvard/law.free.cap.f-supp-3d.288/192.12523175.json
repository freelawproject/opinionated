Taking into consideration this trial testimony along with the GSA's failure to produce records proving federal ownership or control of Building 22, plaintiff reached the conclusion that the federal government \"never owned or leased\" it.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Yet plaintiff has remained \"in prison based on the government claiming ownership and jurisdiction over [Building 22]\" for more than 20 years.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     Plaintiff's opposition also cites relevant legal authority regarding an agency's obligations\n     under the FOIA to conduct a good faith search for records responsive to a FOIA request.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Pl.'s Opp'n at 1-2. Missing, however, is any legal argument or reference to any materials in the record to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the adequacy of the GSA's search or its compliance with the FOIA.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     The GSA's supporting declaration is short on details, but it need not \"set forth with meticulous documentation the details of an epic search for the requested records.\"\n     <em>\n      Perry v.
