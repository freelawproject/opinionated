(\"Walmart\"), Charles Komar &amp; Sons, Inc. (\"Komar\"), and Macy's Merchandising Group, Inc. (\"Macy's\") (collectively \"Defendants\"), alleging strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty claims related to injuries she suffered when her clothing caught fire. (R. 69, Fourth Am. Compl.) Before the Court are Defendants' motions for summary judgment as to all remaining counts against them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 146, Macy's Mot. for Summ. J.; R. 150 Walmart Mot. for Summ. J.; R. 153, Komar Mot. for Summ. J.) For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Walmart's and Komar's motions, but grants in part and denies in part Macy's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise stated. The litigation stems from a Style &amp; Co. Sport brand jacket (the \"Jacket\") and a Secret Treasures brand pajama top and bottom (the \"Sleepwear\") that caught fire and injured Plaintiff. (R. 69, Fourth Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is an Illinois resident. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [hereinafter \"SOUMF\"] \u00b6 1.) Macy's is a New York corporation that sells, among other things, clothing, including the Jacket, which Plaintiff believes she purchased from Macy's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 164, Pl.'s Resp. to\n   Macy's SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11, 18.) Walmart is a multinational retailer that conducts business in Illinois and sold Plaintiff the Sleepwear. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 2, 9.) Komar is a New York corporation that manufactured the Sleepwear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime in or before May 2008, Plaintiff's daughter purchased two sets of the same Secret Treasures brand sleepwear in different colors, which included the Sleepwear at issue in this case, and gave them to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12, 16-18.) The Sleepwear was made out of a blended fabric consisting of polyester and cotton. (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s Statement of Additional Material Facts [hereinafter \"SAMF\"] \u00b6 1.) From the date of purchase until January 14, 2014, Plaintiff wore the Sleepwear frequently without incident. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff believes that she purchased the Jacket at Macy's around Christmas in either 2012 or 2013, and she regularly wore the Jacket around the house when she was cold. (R. 164, Pl.'s Resp. to Macy's SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15.) The Jacket was made of an 80% cotton and 20% polyester-blend fabric. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Neither the Sleepwear nor the Jacket had any labels or warnings on them related to flammability. (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 50; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 14, 2014, Plaintiff was cooking breakfast while wearing the Jacket and Sleepwear, and leaned over a lit gas stove to reach for a box of cereal. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 14, 25.) Plaintiff smelled something burning, looked down, and saw fire coming up from the bottom of the Jacket. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) The Sleepwear did not come into direct contact with the stove, but was later ignited by flames from the Jacket. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 25-27; R. 162, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Walmart at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff first tried to unzip the Jacket, but was unable to, so she went to her sink, grabbed a hose from the sink, and sprayed water at the flames, which eventually extinguished them. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) Plaintiff suffered extensive, third-degree burns to approximately 40% of her body. (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 4.) The Sleepwear and Jacket did not have any labels, warnings, or other information on them concerning their flammability although some women's robes and nightgowns have used fire safety warnings since the 1990s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's expert conducted flammability testing on the Sleepwear under a test prescribed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which included five tests on the Sleepwear pajama top and five tests on the Sleepwear pajama bottom. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) Neither the Sleepwear bottom nor top ignited during any of these tests, which involved applying a flame to each garment for one second. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-44.) The expert also conducted flammability testing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201615-16\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a regulation covering flammability standards for children's sleepwear. (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 30, 34.) The Sleepwear, however, ignited and failed these tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Though the exact Jacket that Plaintiff was wearing during the incident was never located, Plaintiff's expert conducted flammability testing pursuant to the standards in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on the same fabric from which the Jacket was made. (R. 164, Pl.'s Resp. to Macy's SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 22, 36-37, 39.) Pursuant to that testing, the fabric ignited and burned for fifteen seconds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Plaintiff's expert also tested the fabric in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201615-16\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the fabric failed that test. (R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There have been no other reported incidents involving alleged burn injuries suffered by people claiming to have been wearing the same style jacket as the Jacket or any other Macy's clothing comprised of the same fabric as the Jacket. (R. 164, Pl.'s Resp. to Macy's SOUMF \u00b6 49.) With respect to the Sleepwear, neither Walmart nor Komar were aware of any complaints regarding the flammability of the Sleepwear, and both have conducted flammability testing on the Sleepwear. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 32-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties do not dispute that most adults understand that their clothing will ignite and burn if exposed to an open flame. (R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6 56;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 164, Pl.'s Resp. to Macy's SOUMF \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.) Clothing made of nylon or polyester often does not ignite and will self-extinguish or burn so slowly that it causes less injury from burns. (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 46;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 42.) Making the Sleepwear or Jacket out of polyester or nylon fabric would cost roughly the same as using cotton fabric. (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 43; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, on February 28, 2014, and Walmart later removed the action to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (R. 1, Notice of Removal; R.1-1, State Court Compl.) On January 11, 2016, Plaintiff filed her fourth amended complaint, which is the operative pleading setting forth her claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 69, Fourth Am. Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the fourth amended complaint, Plaintiff asserts the following causes of action against Macy's, Walmart, Komar, and Rex Garments, Ltd. (\"Rex\"): strict products liability for defective manufacturing (Counts I, VII) and design (Counts II, VIII); strict products liability for inadequate warnings (Counts III, IX); breach of express and implied warranties (Counts IV, V, X, and XI); and negligence (Counts VI and XII). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-130.) On July 13, 2016, the Court dismissed the strict liability claims against Walmart (Counts VII, VIII, and IX) pursuant to 735 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/2-621, an Illinois statute that requires dismissal of strict products liability claims against a non-manufacturer if that party certifies that it is not the manufacturer of the product and names the manufacturer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 121, Min. Entry.) On October 12, 2016,\n   the Court dismissed Rex from the lawsuit based on a lack of personal jurisdiction. (R. 129, Order.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The remaining parties-Macy's, Walmart, and Komar-now move for summary judgment. (R. 146, Macy's Mot. for Summ. J.; R. 150, Walmart Mot. for Summ. J.; R. 153, Komar Mot. for Summ. J.) Komar and Walmart represent that on May 28, 2017, they advised Plaintiff of the basis of their motions for summary judgment, and Plaintiff agreed to withdraw her claims against them for defective manufacturing and breach of express warranty. (R. 150, Walmart Mot. for Summ. J. at 1; R. 153, Komar Mot. for Summ. J. at 1.) Walmart and Komar, therefore, move for summary judgment on the only counts that appear to be pending against them: the breach of implied warranty and negligence claims against both Walmart and Komar, and the strict products liability claims for defective design and inadequate warnings against Komar. (R. 150, Walmart Mot. for Summ. J. at 1; R. 153, Komar Mot. for Summ. J. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Walmart argues that the Court should grant summary judgment against Plaintiff's breach of implied warranty claims because the Sleepwear was not unreasonably dangerous or unfit for its ordinary purpose of \"wearing while sleeping or lounging at home.\" (R. 152, Walmart Mem. at 2, 3-5.) Walmart also contends that the Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's negligence claims because Walmart had no duty to sell fireproof or 100% polyester or nylon adult sleepwear, and because the Sleepwear did not proximately cause Plaintiff's injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 6-8.) Walmart argues that it was the Jacket, not the Sleepwear, that first caught fire and caused Plaintiff's injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8.) Walmart claims that it satisfied its duty of care because the Sleepwear \"passed the only federal flammability standard applicable, 16 [C.F.R. \u00a7] 1610.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Komar advances the same arguments as Walmart for summary judgment on Plaintiff's breach of implied warranty and negligence claims. (R. 155, Komar Mem. at 2-3, 12-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Komar also maintains that the Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's strict products liability claim for defective design because the Sleepwear was not unreasonably dangerous beyond the extent contemplated by an ordinary consumer, and because the utility of cotton or cotton-blend sleepwear outweighs any risk that it will catch fire and injure the person wearing it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-10.) Komar argues that Plaintiff's strict products liability claim for inadequate warnings should suffer a similar fate, because Komar did not have a duty to warn Plaintiff of the Sleepwear's flammability, and, even if Komar did have a duty to warn, Plaintiff fails to advance any evidence that a warning on the Sleepwear would have prevented her injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Walmart's and Komar's arguments miss the mark, because this case concerns not only the aspects of the Sleepwear's design that caused it to ignite, but also aspects of the design that caused the Sleepwear to ignite so easily and produce the fire's intensity and rapid spread. (R. 162, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Walmart at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 163, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Komar at 1-2.) Plaintiff also argues that Walmart's and Komar's reliance on federal regulations, including\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is not dispositive; rather, compliance with those regulations is nothing more than evidence that a jury may consider in its determination as to whether the Sleepwear is defective or Defendants were negligent. (R. 162, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Walmart at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 163, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Komar at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Macy's, like Walmart and Komar, represents that Plaintiff agreed to withdraw the breach of express warranty and strict liability for defective manufacturing claims against it. (R. 149, Macy's Mem. at 1 n.1.) Therefore, like Komar, Macy's does not address those claims and moves for summary judgment only on Plaintiff's strict liability claims for defective design and inadequate warnings, as well as Plaintiff's breach of implied warranty and negligence claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Macy's arguments for summary judgment on the strict liability claims are nearly the same as Komar's, namely, that: the Jacket complied with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the Jacket was not defectively designed under a consumer-expectation or risk-utility analysis; Macy's had no duty to warn Plaintiff of the Jacket's flammability; and, even if Macy's had a duty to warn, a warning or label on the Jacket would not have prevented Plaintiff's injuries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    at 2-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to Plaintiff's negligence claims, Macy's argues that it did not deviate from any standard of care that other manufacturers followed at the time the Jacket was designed, and that Plaintiff has not put forth any evidence that Macy's knew or should have known that the Jacket was unreasonably dangerous. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Macy also contends that it properly tested the Jacket, had no duty to warn Plaintiff about the Jacket's flammability, used safe fabrics for the Jacket, and lacked any duty to conduct surveillance on the Jacket after Macy's sold it to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) Macy's asserts that, as a result, the Court should grant summary judgment against Plaintiff on any negligence claims based on these theories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Macy's argues that it did not breach any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose because the Jacket was fit for Plaintiff to wear as clothing in the ordinary course of her life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that, like Walmart and Komar, Macy's fails to address characteristics of the Jacket's design that caused the fire's ease of ignition, intensity, and rapid spread, and that Macy's compliance with federal regulations, including\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cannot provide grounds for granting summary judgment in Macy's favor. (R. 165, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Macy's at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that \"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

As relevant to Defendants' motions for summary judgment, Defendants object to Spivak's opinions that: (1) the fabrics used to make the Sleepwear and Jacket are made of materials that promote easy ignition, rapid, intense burning, and rapid flame spread, (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 42; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 38); (2) several thousands of injuries have occurred as the result of clothing catching fire, (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11); (3) the standards of flammability and testing for flammability set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201610\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are insufficient to protect against fire risks related to clothing, (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 20; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 24); (4) had the Jacket and Sleepwear been made of either nylon or polyester, there would have been little or no ignition, and any fire would have burned more slowly and been more easily extinguished resulting in little or no injury to Plaintiff, (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 48; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 44); and (5) the public generally knows that their clothing will ignite, but does not know or appreciate the ease of ignition, rapid flame spread and engulfing fire that can result from the ignition of cotton-polyester blend clothing, (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court concludes that the first four opinions are relevant to the present motions for summary judgment, as they are relevant to the broad considerations the Court must weigh in its analysis under the risk-utility test, which requires the Court to weigh the following factors in assessing a defective-design claim: \"(1) the availability and feasibility of alternate designs at the time of the product's manufacture; or (2) that the design used did not conform to the design standards in the industry, design guidelines provided by an authoritative voluntary organization, or design criteria set by legislation or governmental regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Jablonski v.

The last opinion to which Defendants object, that the public does not appreciate the dangers of cotton-polyester blend clothing, is also relevant to this case because the Court, for purposes of Plaintiff's strict liability claims, must analyze whether the Jacket and Sleepwear are unreasonably dangerous because they \"failed to perform as an ordinary consumer would expect.\"\n   <em>\n    Calles v.

(R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 6-14.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 161-3, Spivak Report \u00b6 49 (\"This result for all polyester and all nylon garments is substantiated by my peer reviewed published research on alternative testing of women's sleepwear and night dresses.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, his opinions that thousands of injuries have occurred from clothing catching fire, and that the public generally does not know or appreciate the ease of ignition, rapid flame spread, and engulfing fire that can result from the ignition of cotton-polyester blend clothing, are supported by research and experience.

(R. 164-4, Diller Aff. \u00b6 2; R. 161, Pl.'s Resp. to Walmart's and Komar's Joint SOUMF \u00b6 49.) Defendants object to Diller's opinion that once the Jacket and Sleepwear ignited, they burned at a rate and intensity that injured Plaintiff without affording her an opportunity to stop the burning. (R. 175, Walmart's and Komar's Joint Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 40; R. 172, Macy's Resp. to Pl.'s SAMF \u00b6 36.)

Diller has over 45 years of professional experience in biomedical engineering and specializes in the area of burn injuries. (R. 161-4, Diller Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) He has published over 280 research papers in medical, scientific, and engineering journals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) His opinion is based upon his broad experience and research. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) His report uses mathematical formulas from other scientific research and data from testing conducted by Plaintiff's flammability testing expert, Elizabeth Buc, to conclude that ten seconds of exposure to fire produced from cotton-polyester clothing would cause nearly complete necrosis, or death, of Plaintiff's skin tissue. (R. 161-4, Diller Report at 5.) Because Buc's experiments showed that the Sleepwear and Jacket were on fire for 13 seconds or more, Diller concludes that the fire caused Plaintiff's injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) To support his opinion, Diller also points to research finding that ignition of one's clothing occurs\n   before that person feels pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The Court, therefore, permits Plaintiff to oppose summary judgment using Diller's affidavit because it provides enough research, facts, and a process of reasoning leading to Diller's conclusion that Plaintiff would have suffered third degree burns or serious injury without having an opportunity to extinguish the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201304082\">\n    2017 WL 1304082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

Any injury caused by the Sleepwear, however, was not the result of cooking or coming into contact with a flame from kitchen appliances; rather, it was the result of another garment being set on fire.

(R. 163, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Komar at 1-2, 7.) Plaintiff has produced expert testimony supporting this argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6 94; R. 161-3, Spivak Report \u00b6\u00b6 37, 64 100.) Plaintiff has also produced evidence showing that the Jacket ignited quickly and burned rapidly and intensely, and that it was foreseeable that the Jacket might catch fire as a result of one's ordinary use of the Jacket near open flames in the kitchen. (R. 161-2, Buc Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 32 (noting that, in flammability testing, the Jacket ignited in three seconds and spread flames ten inches in seven seconds); R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) This evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Jacket performed as an ordinary consumer would expect when exposed to or placed near a flame in the kitchen while cooking, which a reasonable jury could find is foreseeable and within the ordinary use of the Jacket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Ill.%20Dec.%20383\">\n    309 Ill.Dec. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=864%20N.E.2d%20249\">\n    864 N.E.2d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ruling that child's use of a lighter was reasonably foreseeable because an ordinary consumer would expect that a child could take a lighter and try to use it).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Macy's argues that Plaintiff had knowledge that the Jacket would catch fire if exposed to an open flame, and that an ordinary consumer would likewise expect the Jacket to catch fire if exposed to an open flame. (R. 149, Macy's Mem. at 3-6.) Therefore, Macy's maintains there was nothing unexpected about the way the Jacket performed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The question under the consumer-expectation test in this case, however, is not whether the Jacket could catch fire, a danger that Plaintiff agrees is generally well-known, (164, Resp. to Macy's SOUMF \u00b6 53), but whether an ordinary consumer would expect that the Jacket would\n   <em>\n    so easily\n   </em>\n   catch fire and result in a type of burning that would almost guarantee serious injuries. (R. 165, Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n to Macy's at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 148-4, Macy's 30(b(6) Dep.

Plaintiff has advanced evidence showing that the ordinary consumer would not be aware of the Jacket's claimed danger to more easily provoke an intense, rapid-spreading fire that is difficult to extinguish when coming into contact or close contact with a stove, a foreseeable use, (R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 94; R. 161-3, Spivak Report \u00b6\u00b6 37, 64 100; R. 161-4, Diller Aff. \u00b6 29.)

Turning to the risk-utility factors in this case, Plaintiff has presented evidence of an alternative design and its feasibility. Plaintiff has proposed alternative designs of the Jacket and Sleepwear that were available to Macy's at the time the Jacket was manufactured. (R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 81, 84.) Plaintiff's expert opines that these alternative designs for the Jacket would have cost roughly the same, not ignited as easily, burned more slowly, and created a fire that would have been more easily extinguished. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-85, 89.) With respect to promulgated design standards, Plaintiff does not provide much, if any, evidence that Macy's failed to abide by government regulations, industry standards, or criteria set by authoritative voluntary associations, and instead points to the fact that the Jacket failed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201615-16\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   's flammability standards, a standard applicable to children's sleepwear and not the Jacket.

Plaintiff also points out that other companies in the industry place flammability warnings on adult clothing. (R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.) Nonetheless, that Plaintiff has minimal evidence on this point does not require summary judgment in Macy's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.D.O. ex rel.

Plaintiff has provided evidence showing that thousands of persons die each year or seek emergency room treatment due to their clothing catching fire, (R.161-3, Spivak Report \u00b6\u00b6 98-100), and that the Jacket is designed in a way to almost guarantee serious injury if it catches fire, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 161-4, Diller\n   Aff. \u00b6 29). Plaintiff also points to evidence showing that the Jacket could have been designed differently at roughly the same cost to eliminate its unsafe character. (R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.) Macy's raises yet another factor the Court may consider in the risk-utility test-Plaintiff's anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the Jacket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Ill.%20Dec.%20383\">\n    309 Ill.Dec. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=864%20N.E.2d%20249\">\n    864 N.E.2d at 260-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has also submitted evidence to create a genuine dispute of fact as to this factor, as Plaintiff's expert opines that the general public does not know or appreciate the latent dangers concerning how easily the Jacket can ignite and result in a rapidly spreading fire. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 161-3, Spivak Aff. \u00b6 94; R. 161-3, Spivak Report \u00b6\u00b6 37, 64 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Balancing all of the factors above, the Court is unable to conclude that no reasonable jury could find in Plaintiff's favor. A reasonable jury could attribute substantial weight to Plaintiff's expert testimony and find that the Jacket, as it is designed, poses an unreasonable risk of harm to consumers that they are not fully aware of, and which can be eliminated by an alternative design at little cost to avoid what Plaintiff's experts claim, is a very high probability of serious injury in the event the Jacket catches fire. In short, Plaintiff has created disputes of fact that are material to several of the factors under the risk-utility test, and the Court determines, after balancing the factors, that Plaintiff has produced enough evidence to survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hasan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204124254\">\n    2014 WL 4124254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (denying summary judgment because the plaintiff provided expert testimony concerning an alternative design that would have prevented the plaintiff's injury);\n   <em>\n    Calles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Ill.%20Dec.%20383\">\n    309 Ill.Dec. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=864%20N.E.2d%20249\">\n    864 N.E.2d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying judgment as a matter of law because there was a dispute of fact as to factors under the risk-utility test).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Macy's argues that the risk-utility factors weigh in its favor to the extent Plaintiff's expert advocates an alternative design of the Jacket that is entirely made of polyester or nylon, which Macy's argues deprives consumers of choosing cotton-polyester blend clothing for its comfort and style. (R. 171, Macy's Reply at 6-9; R. 174, Komar's Reply at 5-6.) In support, Macy's points to Plaintiff's expert testimony in which he states that consumers should be able to choose cotton-blend clothing. (R. 148-5, Spivak Dep. Tr. at 113-14, 126-27.) Plaintiff's expert, however, does not advocate removing cotton or cotton-blend clothing entirely from the market, but only some cotton-blend products, like the Jacket, which pose latent dangers of flammability that most consumers do not appreciate. (R. 148-5, Spivak Dep. Tr. at 118 (opining that he proposes eliminating only some cotton-blend fabrics that are \"full cover, wide, loose and flowing\" from the marketplace), 126-27 (opining that not all cotton-blend clothing is unreasonably dangerous, and that \"[i]f you were wearing a pair of cotton/polyester leotards, the likelihood of ignition, given the propensity of the garment, the fit of the fabric, it's very low risk, very low likelihood\"); R. 161-3, Spivak Report \u00b6 64 (opining that the clothing at issue \"combines easily ignitable cotton blend fabrics, plus a resultant scaffolding effect contributed by the combination of a charring component cotton fiber plus a melting component polyester fiber; intimately blended together in yam and fabric\").) These are disputed factual issues that must be resolved at trial, not on a motion for summary judgment where the Court cannot weigh conflicting evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    J.D.O. ex rel.

But when the predominantly cotton fabric of J.D.O.'s dress is considered in combination with the open and flowing design, the lightweight quality of the cotton, and potentially safer alternative designs, a reasonable jury could conclude that J.D.O.'s dress was unreasonably dangerous.\"). Thus, neither this Court's decision herein, nor Plaintiff's expert testimony, lead to the simple conclusion that a particular type of fabric is categorically dangerous; rather, there is a dispute of fact as to whether the Jacket at issue in this case was unreasonably dangerous considering its design, fabric, and other factors under the risk-utility test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Macy's argument merely highlights factual disputes in this case that militate against summary judgment in its favor. While consumers may want to choose the Jacket for its style and comfort, this consideration does not give Macy's license to design a product that is unreasonably dangerous, as the risk-utility test looks at whether \"the risk of danger inherent in the design of the product\n   <em>\n    outweighs the benefits of the design.\"\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferraro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755737\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/842/#p848\">\n    721 F.3d at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted, emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suarez v.

While the fabric used for the Jacket may have been selected for style and comfort, these benefits must be weighed against the danger inherent in its design, and Plaintiff has presented evidence that creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the style and comfort benefits of the Jacket outweigh any danger that may cause it to ignite too easily or catch fire in a manner that would make it very difficult to avoid severe injury.

(R. 69, Fourth Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.) With respect to Macy's alleged failure to properly manufacture the clothing, Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence that the manufacturing of the Jacket, as opposed to its design, was defective in any way. Instead, Plaintiff appears to have relinquished her claims based on a theory of defective manufacturing.
