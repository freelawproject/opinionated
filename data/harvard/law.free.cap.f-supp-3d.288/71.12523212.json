Before the Court is Plaintiffs' Amended Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, which requests that the Court order Defendants to provide additional resources to Capitol View Library, make changes to its renovation plans, and enjoin its re-opening, which is scheduled for December 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19-1 (\"Am. Mot.\"). There is little doubt that Plaintiffs are dissatisfied with the way in which Capitol View Library's renovation has proceeded. That is unfortunate, but it is not a basis to grant their motion. The Court finds that they are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claims here, nor will they suffer irreparable injury absent the injunctive relief sought. Moreover, the balance of the equities and the public interest weigh against the relief. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Reply to Def. Opp. at 5.

Plaintiffs appear to allege that DCPL has not yet spent the $700,000 that has been allocated for interim services, Am. Mot. at 11-12, and may never spend it. They further allege that DCPL may spend the funds on other community needs, citing a meeting on September 19, 2017, in which DCPL \"presented a proposal that would give the community a choice between getting an interim service modular trailer by Jan/Feb 2018 or keeping the $700K and investing the funds in other ways,\" Am.

Alleged Library Renovation Budget Disparities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In seeking to demonstrate that Defendants engaged in intentional discrimination,\n   Plaintiffs compare Capitol View Library's renovation budget to that of a single other branch library, Cleveland Park Library. They point out that Capitol View Library, which serves a neighborhood \"cluster\" that is 95% black and 1% white, had its renovation budget reduced from $10.5 million to $4.5 million in the FY 2016 budget. Am. Mot. at 3-4. Meanwhile, Cleveland Park Library, which serves an area that is 80% white and 4% black, had its renovation budget hold steady at $18.5 million.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305245\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/27/171/#p184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But Plaintiffs fail to mention that in the FY 2018 budget, the Council increased Capitol View Library's renovation budget from $4.5 million to $7.2 million; DCPL then increased it by another $726,000, bringing the current renovation budget to approximately $7.9 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 6. The funding for Capitol View Library's renovation, then, has\n   <em>\n    increased\n   </em>\n   by over 75% since the time Plaintiffs seek to use as a point of comparison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even using up-to-date funding totals, however, this single library-to-library comparison selected from a larger program of many library renovations across the District of Columbia reveals next to nothing about whether Defendants have intentionally discriminated against Plaintiffs based on race. Moreover, expanding the library-to-library comparison beyond Cleveland Park Library to all five branch library renovation projects currently underway significantly undercuts Plaintiffs' allegations of racial discrimination. For example, the current budget for Capitol View Library's renovation is virtually identical to (and in fact marginally greater than) that of Palisades Library, which Plaintiffs concede serves a neighborhood \"cluster\" that is 4% black and 80% white.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 21; ECF No. 24-6; Am. Mot. at 3. In addition, the branch library with the largest budget for an ongoing renovation-$20 million-is Lamond Riggs Library, located in Ward 5, which the 2010 census recorded as being 77% black.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Surrep. at 6; ECF No. 24-6. Expanding the data set even further-to all branch library renovations completed over the last decade or so-the budget for Capitol View Library's renovation is\n   <em>\n    greater\n   </em>\n   than the budget that was allocated for Chevy Chase Library located in Ward 3, which the 2010 census recorded as being 5% black and 84% white.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To be sure, these additional one-to-one library comparisons are of limited analytic value, as well. They do not, for example, account for non-racial differences among these renovation projects-such as the size of the library to be renovated and the number of items each circulates-that could explain funding disparities. They do, however, expose Plaintiffs' comparison between Capitol View Library and Cleveland Park Library as a cherry-picked example that provides scant evidence of discriminatory intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs argue that Capitol View Library's renovation budget is well below the average budget for a DCPL library renovation. Am. Mot. at 4. Again, standing alone, this fact-even if accurate-does not demonstrate intentional racial discrimination. There could be many differences among these projects that explain why Capitol View Library's renovations have a lower-than-average budget. Plaintiffs allege nothing that would connect this departure from the mean to racial discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs cite a purported comparison of certain \"funding streams\" between libraries they identify as \"east of the Anacostia River in predominantly African-American neighborhoods\" and libraries elsewhere in the District of Columbia. Am. Mot. at 5. In response, Executive Defendants assert that over the course of the last decade, the District of Columbia's disproportionately black neighborhoods have, in the aggregate, received\n   <em>\n    above\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   funding for library renovations. Def. Opp. at 21. They attach exhibits that cite publicly-available information illustrating that libraries in Wards 7 and 8-the two wards \"east of the Anacostia River\"-received\n   <em>\n    more than\n   </em>\n   the per-ward average of approximately $28 million during that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27-5; ECF No. 27-6. Capitol View Library, as noted earlier, is located in Ward 7. This is, once again, hard to square with intentional discrimination against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should adopt a \"weighted average\" approach that accounts for the number of libraries in each ward. Reply to Def. Opp. at 6. However, Plaintiffs do not indicate the source for the data they cite, and they employ an unclear and inconsistent methodology in making their calculations. In any event, their calculations are not illustrative of intentional racial discrimination. For example, it appears that they conclude that the ward with the\n   <em>\n    highest\n   </em>\n   per-branch library renovation funding is Ward 5,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the 2010 census recorded as being 77% black.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-2; Def. Surrep. at 6; ECF No. 37-2. Plaintiffs' calculations do not come close to illustrating a \"pattern as stark as that in\n   <em>\n    Gomillion\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Yick Wo\n   </em>\n   \" from which, without additional evidence, the Court could infer racially discriminatory intent on the part of Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Alleged Interim Library Services Disparities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs turn to other services connected with the Capitol View Library renovations to demonstrate intentional racial discrimination. But Defendants supply non-discriminatory reasons for their actions that effectively negate Plaintiffs' assertions of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that Defendants' failure to provide interim library services while Capitol View Library was closed for renovation is further evidence of intentional discrimination against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Mot. at 3, 5, 6-9, 14; Def. Opp. at 23 n.13. They also assert, in a conclusory fashion, that \"the other libraries in the northwest quadrants of the city, and with significantly more affluence and resources, were provided prompt interim services,\" including Georgetown Library, Tenley Library,\n   Cleveland Park Library, West End Library, and Mount Pleasant Library. Am. Compl. \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In response, Executive Defendants assert that the decision to provide interim services is affected by whether the renovation project's budget includes sufficient funding for those services. Def. Opp. at 23; Reyes-Gavilan Decl. \u00b6 5. So to some degree, Plaintiffs' argument about interim services simply rehashes their unpersuasive argument concerning the size of various branch libraries' renovation budgets. In any event, Executive Defendants explain that DCPL did in fact provide interim services by assigning Capitol View Library staff members to nearby libraries, visiting neighborhood schools, and conducting outreach to daycare and early learning facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 7; Reyes-Gavilan Decl. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The real thrust of Plaintiffs' argument is that Defendants failed to provide an interim library\n   <em>\n    facility\n   </em>\n   . But Executive Defendants provide non-discriminatory reasons for not providing such a facility. They explain that whether an interim facility is provided by DCPL depends on the length of the library's closure and the library's proximity to other branch locations. Reyes-Gavilan Decl. \u00b6 6. They concede that they generally provide an interim facility for library closures lasting longer than one year and where there is no other DCPL branch library within a mile.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305245\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/27/171/#p184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But in this case, they assert, the budget for Capitol View Library's renovation project did not account for an interim facility, the library has been closed for less than ten months, and it is within a mile of Benning Library. Def. Opp. at 23. Therefore, by their non-discriminatory criteria, the closing of Capitol View Library would not typically qualify for an interim facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even so, Executive Defendants maintain, they tried to establish an interim facility in a nearby church, but the church turned down their proposal. Reyes-Gavilan Decl. \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Mot. at 7. Moreover, when Capitol View Library closes again, DCPL plans to open an interim facility on the grounds of J.C. Nalle Elementary School, pursuant to an interagency Memorandum of Agreement that is already in place. Reyes-Gavilan Decl. \u00b6 13; ECF No. 27-21. Finally, Executive Defendants cite numerous examples in which neighborhoods served by libraries in Ward 8 (Anacostia Library) and Ward 7 (Benning Library and Francis A. Gregory Library) that were closed for more than a year\n   <em>\n    received\n   </em>\n   interim library facilities, further undermining any claim of racial discrimination. Def. Opp. at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In their reply, Plaintiffs argue that the neighborhood served by Palisades Library, which will be closed for a similar amount of time, will get \"more\" interim library services-but do not elaborate further on the nature of these additional services. Reply to Def. at 8. And Defendants have proffered, and Plaintiffs have not disputed, that the Palisades Library will not receive an interim library\n   <em>\n    facility\n   </em>\n   -the clear focus of Plaintiffs' concern-because it will be closed less than a year. Def. Opp. at 24. In this critical respect, Palisades Library will be treated identically to Capitol View Library. Plaintiffs also rehash their allegation that it is somehow improper that the $700,000 allocated for interim services for Capitol View Library in FY 2018 has not yet been spent, but fail to explain the relevance of this allegation to their racial-discrimination claim. Reply to Def. at 8. Finally, they argue that Benning Library is in fact more than a mile away from Capitol View Library and is an unacceptable substitute library for that and other reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305245\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/27/171/#p184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs are clearly displeased with the interim services that DCPL has provided-and the interim facility\n   it plans to provide-for their neighborhood during the Capitol View Library renovation process. But considered collectively, this evidence of record does not remotely suggest intentional racial discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Alleged \"Opening Day Collection\" Budget Disparities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to provide \"opening day collection\" funding for Capitol View Library commensurate with such funding for branch libraries that serve predominantly white neighborhoods. Am. Mot. at 9-10. Again, Plaintiffs rely heavily on a comparison with a single other branch: Cleveland Park Library.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305245\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/27/171/#p184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs assert that Capitol View Library was allocated $50,000 for its \"opening day collection,\" yet Cleveland Park Library was allocated $500,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305245\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/27/171/#p184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Executive Defendants do not contest these funding amounts, but explain that, in general, this funding is tied to how long the library is closed: the longer the closure, the more dated its materials are upon reopening, and the more \"refreshing\" of these materials is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Am. Mot. at 21-22. But enjoining the re-opening of Capitol View Library would\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   the public from having access to those resources. Indeed, upon re-openi\n   ng, Capitol View Library is slated to become the first renovated or rebuilt DCPL branch to feature a dedicated computer lab for public technology training. Reyes-Gavilan Decl. \u00b6 12. To date, DCPL has spent $4.5 million to renovate its interior. Def. Opp. at 33. And going forward, DCPL has included funding in its budget to more than double the number of computers in the lab (to forty-four) and to hire additional staff to manage computer services. Reyes-Gavilan Decl. \u00b6 12. For these reasons, the balance of the equities and the public interest weigh strongly in favor of allowing Capitol View Library to re-open for the benefit of the entire neighborhood it serves, notwithstanding Plaintiffs' dissatisfaction with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, the other relief sought by Plaintiffs, such as ordering additional resources for Capitol View Library, mandating that its windows be renovated in a particular manner, and requiring that Defendants incorporate Plaintiffs' input into the renovation process, would change, rather than maintain, the status quo, and therefore represents \"an even more extraordinary remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Abdullah v.

Ordering this relief would likely force them to reprogram funds designated for other projects, and could encourage piecemeal private litigation over the District of Columbia's budget.
