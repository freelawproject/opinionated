Plaintiff Stephen Emmet O'Brien filed a Response on July 8, 2017, (\"Response,\" D.E. 52), to which Defendant filed a Reply on June 17, 2017, (\"Reply,\" D.E. 54). Upon review of the Motion, Response, Reply, and the record, the Court finds as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 7, 2015, Plaintiff was a passenger aboard Defendant's cruise ship, the Norwegian\n   <em>\n    Sky\n   </em>\n   . (Def.'s Facts \u00b6 1.) According to Plaintiff's deposition testimony, he walked into a shallow children's pool and splashed water on his face, chest, back, and head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) He testified that the water smelled \"really chlorinated, ... like a heavy smell of chemicals.\" (O'Brien Dep. at 63:14-16.) He also testified that he observed a \"white foamy\" substance, \"like a soap residue,\" near the children's pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69:10-16.) Later the same day, Plaintiff felt a burning pain in his feet, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:25), and noticed his feet were blistering, (Def.'s Facts \u00b6 11). There were no other similar injuries reported on the day of the incident or during the subject cruise, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20), and there were no other similar burn incidents being reported on the Norwegian\n   <em>\n    Sky\n   </em>\n   for the three years prior to the subject incident, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 3, 2016, Plaintiff filed the operative Corrected Amended Complaint for Negligence, (D.E. 22), in which he alleges to have sustained chemical burns to his feet from exposure to \"caustic\" chemicals used to clean Norwegian's decks and used at unreasonable levels in Norwegian's Jacuzzi,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and from the hot pool deck. (Def.'s Facts \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To clean the decks, Norwegian uses only soap and water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) To clean the pools, Norwegian utilizes the ProMinent water treatment control system which allows for the continuous monitoring and automatic delivery of pool chemicals based upon predetermined levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Norwegian further performs manual chemical checks at each swimming pool every four hours and at the Jacuzzi every hour in order to validate the automatic readings of the ProMinent system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was diagnosed with type-two diabetes about eight years prior to the subject cruise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Although Plaintiff disputes Norwegian's statement that \"Plaintiff has a long and well-documented history of not controlling his diabetes,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4), Plaintiff's treating endocrinologist, Vivian Rose, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.E. 80 \u00b6 32), testified at her deposition that when she saw him on May 29, 2015, his blood sugar was \"unacceptably high,\" indicating that \"he had not had any control of his diabetes [.]\" (D.E. 54-1 at 21:22-25.) Additionally, Plaintiff's primary care physician, Dr. James Prine, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.E. 80 \u00b6 23), testified at his deposition that when he saw Plaintiff in 2010 and 2012, Plaintiff's diabetes was out of control, (Prine Dep. at 16:21-24; 18:2-8). Prior to the subject cruise, two of Plaintiff's doctors advised him to take precautions with regard to his feet. (Def.'s Facts \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Although Plaintiff has produced an expert that will testify that she suffers from exposure to a toxic substance, there is simply no evidence as to where that exposure may have occurred.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.E. 78.) First, the Court found that Plaintiff was precluded from eliciting expert testimony from his treating physicians under Rule 37(c)(1) because he failed to provide a written expert report as required by Rule 26(a)(2)(B). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7-8.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Second, the Court struck the deposition testimony of Plaintiff's treating podiatrist, Dr. Daniel Bell, opining as to the cause of Plaintiff's injuries. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15.) The Court found that opinion to be \"outside the scope of Dr. Bell's lay witness testimony as a treating physician because, by his own admission, he did not need to determine causation to treat Plaintiff.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15 (citing\n    <em>\n     United States v.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16.) However, the Court provided Plaintiff leave to amend his witness disclosures to come into compliance with Rule 26(a)(2)(C).

Defendant has again moved to exclude Plaintiff's treating physicians from offering certain testimony, arguing that the Amended Witness Disclosures are still inadequate. (D.E. 94.) That motion remains pending. However, the Amended Witness Disclosures do not state that any of Plaintiff's treating physicians intend to testify that Plaintiff suffered chemical burns. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.E. 80.) Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(C), when a plaintiff seeks to introduce lay testimony from his treating physicians, he must disclose \"(i) the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705 ; and (ii) a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify.\" Because the Amended Witness Disclosures do not disclose that any of Plaintiff's treating physicians intend to testify generally as to what caused Plaintiff's injuries or more specifically that Plaintiff suffered a chemical burn, they would be precluded from doing so under Rule 26(a)(2)(C).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Nor did he disclose that any of his treating physicians intended to testify regarding the cause of his injuries.
