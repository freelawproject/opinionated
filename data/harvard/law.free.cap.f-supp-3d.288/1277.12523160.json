Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Glen L. Brawley (\"Dr. Brawley\") originally filed this insurance action\n   in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, on August 1, 2017. (Doc. 1-1 at 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Brawley claims that he is disabled and can no longer work as an orthodontist. His case against Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"Northwestern\") and two resident insurance agents-Jack Wright (\"Dr. Wright\") and Robert F. Kerr (\"Dr. Kerr\")-stems from a denial of long-term disability benefits sought by Dr. Brawley under several different disability policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dr. Brawley's lawsuit contains 6 separate counts. Count One is for breach of contract against Northwestern only. Count Two is for fraud in the inducement against all three Defendants. Count Three is for negligent and/or wanton training and supervision against Dr. Wright and Northwestern. Count Four is for suppression against all three Defendants. Count Five is for bad faith against Northwestern. Finally, Count Six is for negligent procurement and failure to notify against Messrs. Kerr and Wright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Northwestern removed this litigation to this Court on September 6, 2017, asserting diversity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as the basis for federal jurisdiction. (Doc. 1 at 1). Critical to its Notice of Removal on diversity grounds, Northwestern contends that Messrs. Kerr and Wright have been fraudulently joined by Dr. Brawley and, as a result, their presence in the lawsuit cannot defeat jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332. (Doc. 1 at 4 \u00b6 11). Consistent with Northwestern's fraudulent joinder allegations, Messrs. Kerr and Wright have filed a Motion To Dismiss (doc. 8) (the \"Dismissal Motion\"). Dr. Brawley opposed the Dismissal Motion on October 6, 2017. (Doc. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court also has before it Dr. Brawley's Motion To Remand (doc. 11) (the \"Remand Motion\") filed on October 6, 2017. Northwestern filed its opposition (doc. 17) to Dr. Brawley's Remand Motion on October 27, 2017, and Dr. Brawley followed with his reply (doc. 18) on November 10, 2017. Because the Court concludes that Messrs. Kerr and Wright have been fraudulently joined, complete diversity does exist in this case. Consequently, the Remand Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and the Dismissal Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Dr. Brawley's Allegations Against Messrs. Kerr and Wright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dr. Brawley's Purchase of Five Northwestern Disability Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Brawley asserts that Mr. Kerr \"was a special agent of Northwestern, and subject to the control of both Northwestern and [Mr.] Wright.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 9 \u00b6 4). Mr. Wright \"was the Northwestern general agent responsible for training, supervision and conduct of Special Agent [Mr.] Kerr.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Brawley purchased his first disability policy from Northwestern through an agent other than Mr. Kerr or Mr. Wright. (Doc. 1-1 at 9 \u00b6 7). That first policy, number D-216-477, was issued on April 10, 1981 (the \"1981 Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Prior to purchasing the 1981 Policy, Dr. Brawley explained to the agent that he \"wanted what is referred to as an 'own occupation' policy that would pay benefits if he became disabled and unable to perform as a specialist in orthodontics.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 9-10 \u00b6 7). The 1981 Policy \"remained in full force and effect until April 10, 2017, long after [Dr. Brawley] became disabled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the purchase of the 1981 Policy, Dr. Brawley \"began developing a business rapport in 1987\" with Mr. Kerr when he \"became [Dr. Brawley]'s Northwestern agent for disability insurance.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 10 \u00b6 8). Dr. Brawley and Mr. Kerr met in October of 1987 to discuss Dr. Brawley's disability insurance needs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Brawley claims that Mr. Kerr \"represented to [him] that Northwestern's policies were the top of the line and true 'own occupation' policies in the sense that [Dr. Brawley] would receive disability benefits if he could not perform, on a full time basis, the primary activities of his specific specialty (orthodontics)-that is, the physical activities performed by orthodontists on a routine and daily basis (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , bending wire)[.]\" (Doc. 1-1 at 10 \u00b6 10). This assurance was vital to [Dr. Brawley] because he was developing a very demanding and successful specialty practice ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Kerr recommended that Dr. Brawley purchase a second Northwestern disability policy. (Doc. 1-1 at 11 \u00b6 11). Dr. Brawley agreed and the second policy, number D-560360, was issued on November 10, 1987 (the \"1987 Policy\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The 1987 Policy \"remained in full force and effect until April 10, 2017, long after [Dr. Brawley] became disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In December of 1989, Mr. Kerr and Dr. Brawley met again to discuss Dr. Brawley's disability insurance needs. (Doc. 1-1 at 11 \u00b6 12). Because Dr. Brawley's \"practice-based income had increased,\" Mr. Kerr recommended a corresponding adjustment to Dr. Brawley's monthly benefit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Kerr further indicated that the proposed policy was \"virtually identical to his previous Northwestern policies in terms of its definition of 'total disability.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Brawley accepted Mr. Kerr's recommendation and the third policy, number D-727-724, was issued on January 10, 1990 (the \"1990 Policy\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The 1990 Policy \"remained in full force and effect until April 10, 2017, long after [Dr. Brawley] became disabled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In March of 2002, Mr. Kerr and Dr. Brawley met again to discuss Dr. Brawley's disability insurance needs. (Doc. 1-1 at 12 \u00b6 13). Because of the continued growth of Dr. Brawley's practice, Mr. Kerr again recommended a corresponding adjustment of Dr. Brawley's monthly benefit, but this time he proposed that Mr. Kerr purchase two policies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Kerr \"confirmed that the policies he was recommending were essentially the same as the prior policies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Again, [Dr. Brawley] accepted [Dr.] Kerr's recommendation and \"the fourth and fifth policies, numbers D1-451-476 and D1-451-480, were issued on March 10, 2002 (the '476 Policy' and '480 Policy' respectively, and collectively, the '2002 Policies').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 \u00b6 14).

(Doc. 1-1 at 12 \u00b6 15 (emphasis added)). \"Unbeknownst to [Dr. Brawley], the definition of total disability in the two new policies added a provision to the definition that [did not appear] in the three previous policies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13 \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The new provision stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   If the Insured can perform one or more of the principal duties of the regular occupation, the Insured is not totally\n   disabled; however, the Insured may qualify as partially disabled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Concerning Dr. Brawley's purchase of the multiple Northwestern policies, Dr. Brawley further asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   17. At no time did [Mr.] Kerr, or any other Northwestern agent, including [Mr.] Wright, ever disclose the following facts to [Dr. Brawley]:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   a. That Northwestern would not pay any disability benefits so long as [Dr. Brawley] could perform incidental and insignificant duties of his specialty, even if he could not perform the most significant activity or activities of his specialty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   b. That Northwestern would deny an insured orthodontist's disability claim even if said specialist could not perform the work within his specialty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   c. That Northwestern would deny an insured orthodontist's disability claim even if said specialist could only work 18 hours per week in his specialty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   d. That Northwestern would deny an insured orthodontist's disability claim even if said specialist could only perform a few of the procedures within his specialty, so long as he could still supervise technicians, prepare treatment plans and/or perform administrative work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   e. That, after 1989, Northwestern incurred excessive losses in claims on policies like [Dr. Brawley]'s first three policies, and subsequently changed its policies to where it would deny disability claims as long as an orthodontist could teach, prepare treatment plans, supervise technicians or perform administrative work, even though said specialist was unable to regularly perform the significant procedures within his specialty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   f. That once a disability claim was filed, Northwestern would ignore statements from its insured orthodontist about the level of pain he experienced while performing repeated orthodontic procedures;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   g. That Northwestern would not pay partial disability benefits if an insured orthodontist could only perform orthodontist procedures for 18 hours per week;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   h. That, during the claims process, Northwestern would \"cherry-pick\" certain information (or select bits and pieces of information) from the insured orthodontist's medical record and/or the reports of its paid experts that might support a claim denial, and then rely on that information to deny a claim while refusing the insured access to the potentially negative information so that he could respond to [ ]it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   i. That, during the claims process, Northwestern would \"cherry-pick\" certain information (or select bits and pieces of information) from the insured orthodontist's medical record and/or the reports of its paid experts that might support a claim denial, and then refuse the insured access to parts of the paid expert reports supporting a disability claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   j. That, during the claims process, Northwestern would rely on a 3-4 hour Functional Capacity Evaluation (\"FCE\") to deny claims submitted by an insured orthodontist, despite the fact that the insured's disability was based, in large part, not only on increased paid and fatigue as a single work day progressed, but also chronic pain and fatigue as consecutive days of work accumulated[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   k. That, during the claims process, Northwestern would ignore evidence\n   from its own independent medical examiners supporting disability if it could find an internal \"specialist\" who would support a claim denial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   i. That because Northwestern chose not to define the phrase \"principal duties\" in its disability policies, and because it ignored the insured's own statement of his principal duties in his application, Northwestern considered itself free to deny claims so long as the insured was still capable of performing some duty of his pre-disability occupation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Doc. 1-1 at 12-15 \u00b6\u00b6 13-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Dr. Brawley's Injury and Processing of His Disability Benefits Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"On February 5, 2013, [Dr. Brawley] was involved in a brush saw accident\" and suffered a severe injury of his right hand that required surgery. (Doc. 1-1 at 15 \u00b6 19). Due to the work-related impact of this injury, Dr. Brawley filed a disability claim with Northwestern on February 21, 2013, under all of five policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As for the claims process, Dr. Brawley alleges that Northwestern first denied his claim for disability benefits on February 25, 2015 (doc. 1-1 at 21 \u00b6 40), but that he appealed that denial on March 20, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). The record confirms that Northwestern's February 25, 2015, correspondence advised Dr. Brawley that he had a 30-day window to file an appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   If you disagree with this decision and want to appeal it, please submit within 30 days any information or documentation that you would like for us to consider and that you believe supports your decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Doc. 1-2 at 126).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In Dr. Brawley's appeal letter,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Dr. Brawley] also requested that Northwestern provide him with copies of the documentation that it relied on in denying his claim, so that he could respond fully to the allegations and comments allegedly contained therein. On or about March 24, 2015, Northwestern wrote [Dr. Brawley] a letter in which it refused to produce the requested documentation. Following the letter, [Dr. Brawley] made numerous phone calls to Northwestern, to learn what action it was taking, but heard nothing. Finally, on or about April 28, 2015, [Dr. Brawley] was told that he needed to file a written request \"to move forward with the appeal,\" which he did on April 29, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Doc. 1-1 at 21 \u00b6 41 (footnote omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After sending Northwestern confirmation \"to move forward\" on April 29, 2015, Dr. Brawley allegedly made \"numerous phone calls seeking information about the status of his appeal[.]\" (Doc. 1-1 at 21 \u00b6 42). \"Northwestern did not respond to [Dr. Brawley] until December 23, 2015, approximately eight months after his appeal was filed\" and \"reiterated Northwestern's claim denial ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Subsequent to receiving the December notice denying his appeal, Dr. Brawley \"submitted a 3-page letter to Northwestern, along with a new Request for Disability Benefits under all five of his Northwestern disability policies\" on March 27, 2016. (Doc. 1-1 at 22 \u00b6 43). Northwestern followed with a letter on June 15, 2016, \"den[ying] any disability benefits to [Dr. Brawley].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44 (emphasis omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. Brawley \"continued pursuing his appeals and making numerous phone calls to Northwestern to determine its final decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45). At some point after a telephone conversation with Northwestern\n   that occurred on October 7, 2016, Dr. Brawley \"received notice that Northwestern would not pay him any benefits beyond which it had already paid.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 23 \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

More importantly,\n   <em>\n    because the removing defendants have not come forward with a federal case finding fraudulent joinder in a situation like the present, where liability is predicated on misrepresentations-or the suppression of information-during the adjustment or handling of a claim\n   </em>\n   , and the Alabama courts post-\n   <em>\n    Foremost\n   </em>\n   have signaled that the statute of limitations should be decided as a matter of law only at the summary judgment stage or later, after the close of all discovery, this Court should decline at this point in the proceedings to make such a finding as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203870392\">\n    2012 WL 3870392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Mattox\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Brawley's fraud claims against Messrs.

As a result, [Dr.] Brawley never read the 2002 Policies, even though he had reviewed his three previous policies, nor did he ever have any actual knowledge of the true nature of the coverage provided under the 2002 Policies. Under these circumstances, it is possible that\n   an Alabama state court would find that [Dr.] Brawley's reliance on [Mr.] Kerr's added assurances about the 2002 Policies was reasonable, despite his failure to read the policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   (Doc. 18 at 5-6 \u00b6 6 (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The problem with this argument is that the Alabama Supreme Court rendered the\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   special-relationship exception inapplicable to the very type of fraud claims asserted by Dr. Brawley here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Under those circumstances [in\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   ], we concluded that there was evidence of a special relationship between the plaintiffs and their acknowledged real-estate agent, together with evidence indicating that the agent had employed an artifice at the closing that lulled the plaintiffs into a false sense of security as to the contents of a document the plaintiffs were unable to read. We reversed the summary judgment in favor of the real-estate agent and her company.\n   <em>\n    The exception to the rule discussed in\n    <em>\n     Potter\n    </em>\n    does not apply in this case, however, because Smith[,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the insured] and Jeffrey[,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the agent] do not have the kind of special relationship that was present between the plaintiffs and the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Potter\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .

Kerr and Wright are time-barred by a two-year statute of limitations period. (Doc. 17 at 29);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henson v. Celtic Life Ins.

Therefore, Northwestern contends that the limitations period for that count expired in 2004. (Doc. 17 at 29);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booker v. United Am. Ins.

(Doc. 17 at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In support of these negligence claims, Dr. Brawley maintains that he was not \"damaged by either act of negligence\" until Northwestern finally denied his appeal on February 16, 2017. (Doc. 11 at 20).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court easily rejects Dr. Brawley's position as it pertains to his negligent training and supervision claim because it is directly counter to\n   <em>\n    Booker.\n   </em>\n   In particular, Dr. Brawley has made no effort to discount\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   or point to contrary Alabama authority regarding the accrual of a negligent training and supervision claim. Thus, because Dr. Brawley's negligent training claim under the 2002 Policies is stale, Northwestern has satisfied the fraudulent joinder standard as to that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The limitations analysis of Dr. Brawley's negligent procurement count is less straightforward. Dr. Brawley alleges that he \"advised [Mr.] Kerr ... that he wished to obtain true 'own occupation' disability insurance coverage to protect him in the event that he became unable to perform the primary activity of his specialty.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 33 \u00b6 72). Dr. Brawley further asserts that he \"relied on the expertise and judgment of [Messrs.] Kerr, [and] Wright ... in purchasing the type of disability coverage that he needed, and monitoring the status of the coverage, the carrier providing coverage, and the carrier's claim practices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11919116\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/700/1333/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Northwestern relies upon the Rule 12(b)(6) case of\n   <em>\n    Toffel v.

(Doc. 17 at 30). Northwestern further maintains that the untimeliness of this claim is without any uncertainty such that the demanding fraudulent joinder standard applies to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   However, factually absent from\n   <em>\n    Toffel\n   </em>\n   is any indication that the finality of the denial of that insurance claim was impacted by the claimant's right (and decision) to appeal.

While an Alabama court might ultimately agree with Northwestern's position that Dr. Brawley's negligent procurement claim accrued on the earlier date of February 25, 2015, despite his appeal, none of the cases that Northwestern cites establishes such an unambiguous holding under Alabama law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18 at 7 \u00b6 7 (\"Even if the Court rejects that position, and finds that Brawley should have discovered the fraud prior to the final denial, it would nevertheless have been reasonable for [Dr.] Brawley to not suspect foul play until December 23, 2015, the date upon which Northwestern denied the appeal invited by its February 25, 2015 letter.\")). Further, the Eleventh Circuit law on fraudulent joinder leaves no room for doubt that any state-law legal uncertainties are to be resolved in Dr. Brawley's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pacheco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11851770\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/1368/#p1380\">\n    139 F.3d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he district court must evaluate factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and resolve any uncertainties about the applicable law in the plaintiff's favor.\"). Therefore, the Court rejects this portion of Northwestern's opposition of the Remand Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   However, Northwestern alternatively maintains that Dr. Brawley's tort claims against Messrs. Kerr and Wright are non-cognizable because he had a duty to read his 2002 Policies under\n   <em>\n    Foremost\n   </em>\n   (and its progeny) and has admitted in his complaint that he never did.

[Dr. Brawley] admits that he received his policies. (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 15, Ex. A).

Moreover, the case he cites to argue that the Policies are ambiguous does not even employ the same language. Here, [Dr. Brawley] admits receiving the Policies, which specifically set forth the definition for \"Total Disability.\" If [Dr. Brawley] did not understand what the term \"principal duties\" meant, then he should have exercised the free look provision set forth on the first page of the Policy and received a full refund from Northwestern. [Dr. Brawley] failed to do so. Given that [Dr. Brawley] received the Policies, had a duty to read them, and elected to keep them for decades, [Dr. Brawley]'s negligence claims against [Messrs.] Wright and Kerr are barred as a matter of law by his contributory negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   (Doc. 17 at 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Court is persuaded by Northwestern's alternative position (that includes several decisions by the undersigned) and\n   finds that Dr. Brawley has no possible negligent procurement claim under the 2002 Policies in light of his own negligent failure to read them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20492992\">\n    2017 WL 492992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7, *11 (finding that insured's contributory negligence in not reading policy prevents recovery on negligent procurement claim as a matter of law and ultimately finding the presence of fraudulent joinder as to all claims asserted against the insurance agent).

Additionally, Dr. Brawley has not cited to any Alabama (or other) authority in which the term \"principal duties\" or other language used to define \"total disability\" within the 2002 Policies was determined to be ambiguous. Without such a window of possibility, the Court is convinced that no Alabama court would conclude anything but that the definition of \"total disability\" contained in the 2002 Policies is unambiguous.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    The Court alternatively agrees with Northwestern that, if Dr. Brawley's fraud claims against Messrs.

First, they have not cited to a binding Eleventh Circuit decision that establishes their right to a with-prejudice dismissal based upon fraudulent joinder.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miller Brewing\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1171249\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/663/545/#p549\">\n     663 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    550 ) (\"We believe that jurisdictional inquiry [of fraudulent joinder]\n    <em>\n     must not subsume substantive determination\n    </em>\n    .\") (emphasis added).\n    <em>\n     But cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Florence v.

Second, this Court customarily treats a dismissal based upon fraudulent joinder as a non-merits-based one. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brown\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20492992\">\n     2017 WL 492992\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *11 (granting fraudulently-joined party's motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), but dismissing that party without prejudice));\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fowler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9116217\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/256/1243/#p1249\">\n     256 F.Supp.2d at 1249\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (dismissing fraudulently-joined defendant without prejudice).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
