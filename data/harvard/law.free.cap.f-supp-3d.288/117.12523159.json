More importantly for these purposes, they also allege, although somewhat conclusorily, that the official capacity defendants named in the lawsuit \"were acting under the color of state authority and/or the actual and/or apparent authority of [d]efendants DRC and Kabila\" when they attacked plaintiffs, and that the DRC is \"liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior and/or via direct order and/or via command responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119, 130, 148, 154, 175.

Here, plaintiff Miango requests $20,214.69 for his medical bills and expenses. Pls.' Am.

Miango Aff. \u00b6 10. He has substantiated these assertions by submitting medical records from Patient First, Baltimore Back and Pain Center, Good Samaritan Hospital, and his dentist, Dr. Mitcherling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Att. B, C, D, and E to Miango Aff. [Dkt. # 129-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Miango also provided the Court with a list of \"Medical Expense Records,\" which details the amount of each medical bill he has received since the incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 to Pls.' Am. Mot. [Dkt. # 129-8] (\"Medical Expense List\"). The list is a somewhat sloppy attempt to calculate his total medical expenses, and it contains numerous errors that arise from the double counting of various bills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For example, Miango was treated by Dr. Mitcherling right after the incident in order to repair the damage to his teeth and mouth. According to the bill from Dr. Mitcherling's office dated September 13, 2014, as well as the Statement of Benefits from plaintiff's insurance company dated September 4, 2014, the total cost of Miango's dentistry work was $2,216.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 2 and 4 to Medical Expense List. Over the next several months, Miango received multiple statements reflecting an outstanding balance due to Dr. Mitcherling, some of which included late service charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 5, 9-11, 16-17 to Medical\n   Expense List. Instead of adding the service charges to the original balance, plaintiff includes each statement balance on the Medical Expense List, and he adds them together to request a total of approximately $13,490.00 for \"out-of-pocket\" expenses owed to Dr. Mitcherling. This must be reduced to reflect the actual price of the dental care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Miango is entitled to recover the cost of his dentistry work, and the Court is inclined to award him the $221.06 in additional charges he incurred in late fees and service charges since he should not be penalized for his inability to pay for costly injuries caused by defendants. Additionally, plaintiff received lab work at Dr. Mitcherling's request, billed by Quest Diagnostics, for $225.28, and he appears to have received dental care at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry at a cost of $147.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 8 and 18 to Medical Expense List. So, the Court will award plaintiff Miango a total of $2,809.34 for the costs incurred for dental care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With regard to the other injuries Miango suffered, plaintiff averred that he \"went to Patient First where [he] was evaluated, diagnose[d] with [a] Cervical Sprain and an x-ray of [his] Cervical spine [was] done.\" Miango Aff. \u00b6 10. Plaintiff includes two entries from Patient First on his Medical Expense List, but because he counted the cost of his prescriptions ($30) twice, his request for damages is too high. Based on the Court's review of the Patient First bill, plaintiff's out-of-pocket expense for his treatment was $453.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1 and 7 to Medical Expense List.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff also went to Good Samaritan Hospital, where he was treated in the Emergency Room on August 7, 2014, and where he later returned for physical therapy.
