Shugrue (\"Shugrue\") violated his Eighth Amendment rights when Shugrue accosted him, 2) Scott W. Black (\"Black\") violated his incorporated First Amendment rights when Black retaliated against Dyette for filing a grievance against Shugrue and 3) Kurt Demoura (\"Demoura\") violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by obstructing Dyette's attempt to obtain evidence of the alleged battery. In addition, Dyette alleges that Shugrue, Black and Demoura engaged in a civil conspiracy to commit the underlying acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before this Court is defendants' motion for summary judgment. For the following reasons, that motion will be allowed with respect to plaintiff's procedural due process claim but will otherwise be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At all times relevant to this action, plaintiff was housed by the Massachusetts Department of Correction at MCI-Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts. On June 1, 2014, plaintiff was order by Corrections Office Hope Hill to comply with a \"pat search\" while he was leaving the dining\n   area. During that process, Shugrue approached the plaintiff and the two exchanged words. Shugrue ordered plaintiff to enter a nearby room to be strip searched. Plaintiff contends that, as he was complying with that order, he was grabbed by Shugrue and other Corrections Officers and then punched by Shugrue in the face (\"the incident\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result of that incident, plaintiff was placed in solitary confinement for 30 days and classified for placement in a maximum security prison. Plaintiff filed a grievance concerning the incident and the subsequent placement and classification. That grievance was assigned to Black, a Department of Correction investigator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Black attempted to coerce plaintiff to drop the grievance in return for a guarantee that he would not be classified for a maximum security prison. Dyette declined that offer. Black filed a disciplinary report against plaintiff that alleged that the initial grievance constituted providing false information against a staff member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a part of his investigation for the grievance, plaintiff requested a copy of the video tape of the incident. Plaintiff asserts that DeMoura refused to provide that video in bad faith and took actions to prevent plaintiff from obtaining the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The role of summary judgment is \"to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesnick v.

Summary judgment is appropriate if, after viewing the record in the non-moving party's favor, the Court determines that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count I-Excessive Force Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Shugrue violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Defendants respond that Shugrue's use of force was reasonable, and thus not in contravention of the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides in part that \"nor [shall] cruel and unusual punishments [be] inflicted.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Conversely, a reasonable jury could also find that Shugrue acted to restore and maintain good order and discipline.

Count II-Retaliation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dyette submits that Black retaliated against Dyette's exercise of his First Amendment rights by 1) suggesting that he could avoid a maximum security classification by withdrawing his grievance and 2) issuing a disciplinary ticket to Dyette for \"lying\" about the Lt. Shugrue incident. Defendants rejoin that Sgt. Black acted in good faith while reviewing the disciplinary record and that Dyette would have been classified to a maximum-security facility regardless of Sgt. Black's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Prisoners have a First Amendment right to petition the prison for the redress of grievances and prison officials may not retaliate against prisoners for exercising that right.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Corsini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773193\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/657/296/#p305\">\n    657 F.Supp.2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (D. Mass. 2009). To establish a retaliation claim, the prisoner must demonstrate that: 1) he engaged in constitutionally protected conduct, 2) prison officials took adverse action against him, 3) with the intent to retaliate against him for engaging in the constitutionally protected conduct and 4) he would not have suffered the adverse action \"but for\" the prison officials' retaliatory motive.\n   <em>\n    Partelow\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694918\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/442/41/#p51\">\n    442 F.Supp.2d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (D. Mass. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants contend that plaintiff cannot establish the \"but for\" prong because plaintiff was classified for maximum security before meeting with Black. Although defendants' are correct with respect to the attempted \"deal\" Black offered, they are incorrect with respect to the disciplinary ticket that Black issued. Plaintiff alleges Black promised him a medium security classification if he would withdraw the grievance, that plaintiff declined that \"offer\" and that, frustrated with that result, Black issued a trumped-up disciplinary ticket. Because a reasonable jury could find that the ticket would not have been issued \"but for\" Black's retaliatory motive, defendants' motion for summary judgment will, with respect to Count II, be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Count III-Due Process Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dyette asserts that DeMoura violated his right to due process by intentionally\n   obstructing him from obtaining video of the incident. Defendants contend that plaintiff's claim fails as a matter of law because he was not deprived of a protected liberty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Fourteenth Amendment provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   U.S. Const. amend.
