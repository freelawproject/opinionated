The Status of TNT Propane, Inc. as a Defendant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In their Objections, Defendants assert that TNT Propane, Inc. is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claims because none of Plaintiffs were ever employed by the company. (ECF No. 81 at 3.) In response to Defendants' assertion, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants neither timely moved for summary judgment \"regarding Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants operated as an 'integrated enterprise' or single employer for purposes [of] liability under Section 1981\" nor made \"any legal argument which would warrant entry of summary judgment on this issue.\" (ECF No. 82 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Upon its review, the court observes that even though Defendants consistently maintained that Plaintiffs were not employed by TNT Propane, Inc., Defendants never made a specific request for summary judgment on behalf of TNT Propane, Inc. in their summary judgment submissions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 70-1 at 2, 4, 5 &amp; 15 n.7.) Thus, there is merit to Plaintiffs' suggestion that Defendants' failed to timely move for summary judgment regarding TNT Propane, Inc. Notwithstanding the timeliness issue, Defendants' entitlement to summary judgment is undermined by their failure to provide legal opposition to Plaintiffs' argument that \"McMillan operated [ ] [C]orporate Defendants as a single employer.\" (ECF No. 74 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this regard, there are a \"variety of tests by which a defendant who does not directly employ the plaintiff may still be the plaintiff's 'employer' \" for civil rights purposes.\n   <em>\n    Jarallah v.

Defendants did not address either of these tests or their elements in the filings submitted to the court. Moreover, Defendants did not provide the court with any legal support allowing it to disregard these tests and award them summary judgment based on the simple assertion that Plaintiffs were never employed by TNT Propane, Inc. Therefore, the court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants' mere argument that none of Plaintiffs were employed by TNT Propane, Inc. is insufficient to demonstrate error on the part of the Magistrate Judge.

Instead, Plaintiff Elam consistently stated that his need to make more money is why he quit his job with Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 71-2 at 11:44:13-17 &amp; 19:74:8-11.) As a result, the court grants summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiff Elam's claim for constructive discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs Dunlap, Good and Neal do present evidence that they quit their jobs in response to McMillan's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 71-1 at 15:59:8-16:61:14; ECF No. 71-3 at 19:76:23-20:78:10; ECF No. 71-4 at 4:16:24-5:17:10.) Construing this evidence and all other evidence presented in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs Dunlap, Good and Neal, the court finds that McMillan's actions create an inference of deliberateness. More specifically, there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that the resignations of Plaintiffs Dunlap, Good and Neal were a reasonable foreseeable consequence of McMillan's conduct. The court further finds that the evidence presented is sufficient to raise a factual issue about whether the conditions of Plaintiffs Dunlap, Good and Neal's employment were so intolerable that a reasonable person would have found working for Defendants intolerable. These issues for the jury include a determination of what weight, if any, should be given to any delay of time that occurred before each Plaintiff's resignation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.

Therefore, the court sustains the Objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation of Plaintiffs Dunlap, Good and Neal as to their claim for constructive\n   discharge. Accordingly, the court denies Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to the claim for constructive discharge brought by Plaintiffs Dunlap, Good and Neal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
