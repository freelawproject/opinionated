(\"Searles\" or \"defendant\") has violated the Clean Water Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., by failing to comply with the requirements of its Stormwater Permit. In its counterclaim, defendant asserts that plaintiff's filing of this suit is an abuse of process intended for ulterior motives extraneous to the proceeding. Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the counterclaim is now pending before the Court. For the reasons that follow, plaintiff's motion to dismiss will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Searles operates an automobile salvage yard on Easthampton Road in Northampton, Massachusetts (\"the Facility\"). When rainwater or snowmelt accumulate on the Facility, the subsequent stormwater runoff is contaminated with pollutants because the Facility conducts several of its industrial operations outside. The polluted stormwater flows from the Facility into catch basins located on Easthampton Road, and eventually into Mill River through connected pathways of wetlands and waterways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May, 2016, CWA sent Searles a \"60-day Notice of Violations and Intent to File Suit Regarding NonCompliance with Federal Clean Water Act Industrial Stormwater Discharge Requirements\" (\"the notice\"). After receiving the notice, Searles retained professionals, who investigated the Facility and prepared a Notice of Intent for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Industrial Activity. In July, 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued Searles a Multi-Sector General Permit ID: MAR 053878 (\"Stormwater Permit\" or \"Permit\") pursuant to the Clean Water Act's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Among other things, the Permit requires in \u00a7\u00a7 2.1 and 2.5 that Searles \"minimize effluent discharges\" by implementing adequate \"control measures\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August, 2016, Searles notified CWA that the EPA had issued to it a Stormwater Permit to demonstrate its compliance with the Clean Water Act. In October, 2016, CWA filed a complaint alleging that Searles was in violation of that very Act. Shortly thereafter, Searles filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n   pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) contending that Searles was in compliance of the Clean Water Act when CWA filed suit and still is. The motion was denied by this Court on August 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Searles filed its answer and counterclaim on August 28, 2017. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss defendant's counterclaim for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). That motion is the subject of this memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Although a court must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in a complaint, that doctrine is not applicable to legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CWA moves to dismiss Searles' counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on the grounds that (1) the Court has already rejected Searles' contention that CWA knowingly pursued a groundless claim and (2) Searles failed to allege sufficient factual matter to state the ulterior motive element in its claim for abuse of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Court's Ruling on CWA's Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CWA first contends that the Court previously concluded that CWA's allegations were made in good faith, plausible and supported by sufficient factual matter when it denied Searles' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. CWA suggests, therefore, that the Court cannot find abuse of process on its part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CWA's argument does not, however, consider the proper standard of review for a motion to dismiss. When a claim is challenged under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court views the pleadings in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679105\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/246/\">\n    555 U.S. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679105\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/246/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679105\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/246/\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). When the Court ruled on Searles' motion to dismiss, the pleadings were viewed in the light most favorable to CWA. In considering CWA's motion to dismiss the counterclaim, this Court will view the pleadings in the light most favorable to Searles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Ulterior Purpose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CWA also contends that Searles has not pled sufficient factual matter to support its claim for abuse of process. Specifically, CWA claims that Searles has not alleged an \"ulterior purpose\" to CWA's filing suit, an element necessary to succeed on a claim for abuse of process. Searles responds that its counterclaim is well-pled and maintains that CWA instituted a baseless suit with the intent to \"use it as a club\" to coerce Searles to pay (or settle to pay) monies to CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its counterclaim, Searles asserts that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   despite having received notice of Searles' compliance with the Clean Water Act, CWA initiated the instant action for the ulterior purpose of obtaining fees and penalties from Searles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Abuse of process is a form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage that is not properly involved in the proceeding itself.\n   <em>\n    Vittands\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sudduth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94989\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/49/401/#p406\">\n    49 Mass.

If a citizen prevails in a suit brought under the CWA, the district court may award attorney's fees and injunctive relief, and impose civil penalties on the defendant, payable to the United States Treasury.\n   <em>\n    Paolino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    JF Realty, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552735\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/31/#p35\">\n    710 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35(1st Cir. 2013) (citing \u00a7\u00a7 1365(a) &amp; (d)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Even if CWA has instituted this action in order to obtain attorneys' fees, such fees would be incidental to the successful action under the Clean Water Act.\n   <em>\n    Vahlsing\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commercial Union Ins.

In actions for abuse of process that have survived motions to dismiss, plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show that process was used to gain a collateral advantage outside of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vittands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94989\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/49/401/#p406\">\n    49 Mass App. Ct. at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20N.E.2d%20325\">\n    730 N.E.2d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that defendant stated a claim for abuse of process against plaintiff who brought suit to prevent defendant from legally building on her own land);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mahlowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668956\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/627/\">\n    456 Mass. 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20N.E.2d%20513\">\n    925 N.E.2d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (determining that attorney stated a counterclaim for abuse of process against defendant who brought suit in order to disqualify the attorney from representing his wife in a divorce proceeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, fees and penalties are not a collateral advantage outside of the proceeding because there will be an award only if plaintiff has correctly employed the citizen suit provision in the Clean Water Act and prevails on the merits of its claim. Searles does not allege that CWA brought the instant action in order to coerce Searles into doing something that cannot\n   be achieved pursuant to the Clean Water Act. Any award of attorneys' fees received by CWA will be incidental to its success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restat. 2d of Torts, \u00a7 682(b)(there is no action for abuse of process when the process is used for the purpose for which it is intended but there is an incidental purpose of benefit to the party bringing suit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Searles' counterclaim also suggests that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   CWA has willfully misused the declaratory judgment remedy in an attempt to accomplish purposes not warranted by the process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Searles expands on that claim in its opposition memorandum, asserting that CWA's suit is an abuse of process because its \"demands exceed any potential relief it could get\" by bringing suit and it \"attempts to achieve through use of the court that which the court is itself powerless to order\". Searles cites no Massachusetts case law in support of that contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even so, the Court has authority to grant the relief that CWA seeks. The Clean Water Act gives district courts jurisdiction to enforce effluent standards and to apply any appropriate civil penalties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). CWA properly brought this action in the district court which has the power to grant civil penalties and a declaratory judgment and accordingly, bringing suit was not an abuse of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its opposition memorandum, Searles also claims that CWA's alleged misuse of discovery is considered an abuse of process. The Court will not address that issue because Searles did not allege such facts in its counterclaim, instead raising them, for the first time, in its opposition memorandum.\n   <em>\n    Nollet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11460639\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/83/204/#p208\">\n    83 F.Supp.2d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the Court may look only to the facts alleged in the pleadings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Request for Leave to Amend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
