DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In opposition to Plaintiff's motion, Defendants squarely address three of the factors that the Court must consider in deciding whether to grant the Motion to Amend, namely undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of the amendment. The Court also considers previous amendments to the complaint, and need not reach the bad faith factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To begin with undue delay, Plaintiff offers little explanation as to why he did not seek leave previously to add the IIED claim. In prior briefing, Plaintiff admitted that \"Plaintiff has not sought to amend his Second Amended Complaint,\" but maintained that \"Plaintiff's position, as it has always been, is that he can seek emotional distress damages ... stemming from the causes of action originally set forth in the Complaints that have been filed.\" Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. 401, at 15 n.3 (quoting Pl.'s Reply to Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.'s Resp. [ECF No. 399], ECF No. 400, at 4). The Court has since concluded that Plaintiff cannot seek emotional distress damages under the Second Amended Complaint. Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. 401, at 19. And as discussed above, the events giving rise to the proposed amendment occurred long ago. The D.C.

Context would support an inference that they contain further bald assertions of emotional distress owing to Defendants' actions.

Even if the documents produced by Defendants could show that Defendants were on notice of Plaintiff's eventual IIED claim, there would be no reason to expect Defendants to take discovery of emotional distress-related issues at the time if the issues were legally irrelevant under the operative complaint, and Plaintiff would have had good reason to object to such a \"fishing expedition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Court can only find prejudice if his proposed amendment \"substantially changes the theory on which the case has been proceeding and is proposed late enough so that the opponent would be required to engage in significant new preparation.\" Mot. to Amend at 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Djourabchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3968056\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/240/5/#p13\">\n    240 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   13 ).

As Plaintiff admits, the stress that he suffered was attributable to multiple causes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. to Amend at 4 (\"The termination of health insurance, in conjunction with Defendant Judicial Watch's disparagement and other outrageous conduct, his recent divorce, and the serious nature of his back injury, all worked in concert and gave rise to emotional distress, which Defendants intended to vindictively inflict.\"). Accordingly, it is quite likely that expert testimony would be necessary for Plaintiff to be able to accurately identify Defendants' actions as the proximate cause. But given the length of this case, the completion of discovery, the rapidly approaching trial, and Plaintiff's record of obstreperous behavior during discovery, the Court is not prepared to reopen discovery in order to remedy the prejudice that would be caused by these unduly delayed allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even if this motion were timely and its granting would not prejudice Defendants, Plaintiff's proposed amendment would be futile. Plaintiff makes no attempt to supply the level of factual detail necessary to sustain his allegations of IIED in the event of a motion to dismiss. Opp'n Mem. at 7-8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Plaintiff provides nowhere near the degree of specific allegations necessary to sustain a claim that Defendants engaged in behavior \"outrageous\" and \"extreme\" enough \"to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.\" Plaintiff does not raise the possibility that the standard should be different in what may be more properly deemed a\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   -employment context, nor is the Court otherwise moved to draw such a distinction.

The following allegations of breach contract asserted in Counts Seven and Eight of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint remain viable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) Defendants' alleged failure to make a good faith effort to remove Plaintiff as guarantor of a lease for Judicial Watch's headquarters;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2) Defendants' failure to pay health insurance for Plaintiff's children;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (3) Defendants' filing a motion to strike Plaintiff's appearance in a Florida litigation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (4) Defendants' failure to provide Plaintiff with access to documents regarding a client; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (5) Defendants' alleged disparagement of Plaintiff and misrepresentations of the reasons for his departure from the organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Mot. for Leave to Amend the Second Am.

Accordingly, there have been no discovery requests or discovery produced as to this claim. Clearly discovery would need to be reopened for Defendants, and likely for the Plaintiff as well. The Court's sanctions orders against Plaintiff relate to discovery that was already conducted and with which Plaintiff repeatedly did not comply, and to his noncompliance with the Court's requirements for the revised Joint Pretrial Statement.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Klayman\n    </em>\n    , 628 F.Supp.2d at 96 (Plaintiff may not \"testify[ ] to or introduce[e] into evidence any documents in support of his claims for damages or in support of his defenses to Defendants' counterclaims.\");\n    <em>\n     Klayman v.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court is fully aware that this sanction precludes Klayman from presenting any affirmative evidence in support of his claims or in defense to the counterclaims asserted against him.\"). If discovery were reopened to address the new IIED claim, the sanctions orders would not apply in that context.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
