INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2017, the President of the United States signed Executive Order 13,799, which established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (the \"Commission\"). Approximately one month later, that Commission issued letters to each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia requesting that they provide certain publically available voter roll information so that the Commission might \"fully analyze vulnerabilities and issues related to voter registration and voting\" in the United States. These requests have been the subject of substantial public attention and have generated several lawsuits challenging their legality. This is but another one of those lawsuits. In this case, Plaintiffs, United to Protect Democracy and The Protect Democracy Project, Inc., challenge the Commission's failure to adhere to the notice and comment procedures specified by the Paperwork Reduction Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203501\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .

The President's Executive Order charged the newly constituted Commission with \"study[ing] the registration and voting processes used in Federal elections\" and mandated that the Commission submit a report to the President on various topics, including \"vulnerabilities in voting systems and practices used for Federal elections that could lead to improper voter registrations and improper voting, including fraudulent voter registrations and fraudulent voting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00a7 3(c). The Commission, however, is to be \"solely advisory\" and must dissolve within thirty days after it submits its report.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 28, 2017, in furtherance of its mandate, the Commission sent substantially similar letters to Secretaries of State and other election officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. These letters invited recipients to provide information and opinions on seven broad policy questions relating to the administration of elections. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. For example, the Commission sought opinions on potential changes to federal election law related to election integrity, \"evidence or information\" relating to voter fraud, information on \"convictions for election-related crimes\" since November 2000, and recommendations for preventing voter intimidation or disenfranchisement. Compl. \u00b6 29. In addition, the Commission requested that recipients voluntarily \"provide to the Commission the publicly-available voter roll data\n   for [their states].\" Compl. \u00b6 30. Specifically, the Commission requested \"the full first and last names of all registrants, middle names or initials if available, addresses, dates of birth, political party (if recorded in [that] state), last four digits of social security number if available, voter history (elections voted in) from 2006 onward, active/inactive status, cancelled status, information regarding any felony convictions, information regarding voter registration in another state, information regarding military status, and overseas citizen information.\" Compl. \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. Kris W. Kobach, Ex. 3 (\"June 28 Letter\"), ECF No. 21-2. The Commission purportedly sought this data \"in order for the Commission to fully analyze vulnerabilities and issues related to voter registration and voting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 28 Letter. The Commission requested that recipients respond to the letter by July 14, 2017 and directed recipients to submit their responses either via email or through a secure electronic file transfer protocol site that the federal government uses for transferring large data files. Compl. \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Commission's request for voter data has become a subject of significant public debate. For example, voting rights experts have articulated a broad set of concerns about how the requests might be used to suppress voters and cybersecurity experts have identified risks inherent in consolidating sensitive voter data without a clear security plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. These requests have also been the topic of several legal challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 40. And the recipients of the letters have been far from unanimous in how they plan to respond. Indeed, as of September 27, 2017, seventeen states had indicated that they would provide the requested data while eight states had declined. Compl. \u00b6 33. An additional eleven states had stated that they would only release data subject to certain restrictions. Compl. \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Present Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 29, 2017, Plaintiffs, United to Protect Democracy and The Protect Democracy Project, Inc., filed suit in this Court asserting that the Commission's request for voter data constituted a violation of the PRA. According to Plaintiffs' Complaint, the Commission violated the PRA when it failed to undertake the appropriate notice and comment procedures prior to issuing its request for voter data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-76. As non-profit advocacy organizations engaged in public education and outreach, Plaintiffs claim that they have been injured by the Commission's failing because they have been deprived of certain information that they claim the Commission was required to disclose pursuant to the terms of the PRA. Compl. \u00b6 73. Although Plaintiffs premise their claims on the text of the PRA, the PRA does not provide for a private right of action. Thus, Plaintiffs instead seek declaratory relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 02 and mandamus relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-76, 84-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint also challenges the inaction on the part of the OMB and the Director of OMB (collectively the \"OMB Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-83.

On July 3, 2017, Plaintiff United to Protect Democracy allegedly sent a letter to the Director of OMB explaining the ways in which the Commission had allegedly violated the PRA's procedural requirements and, pursuant to \u00a7 3517, requested that the Director review the matter and take necessary remedial action as soon as possible. Compl. \u00b680. Because more than 60 days have elapsed since United to Protect Democracy sent its letter and the Director has neither responded nor taken any other remedial action, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the OMB and its Director under section 706(1) of the APA for unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying action on its request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Two motions are now pending before the Court. First, on October 11, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. Plaintiffs request that this Court issue a preliminary injunction requiring that (1) the Commission cease its collection of data and delete and/or sequester any information collected unless and until it satisfies the procedures prescribed by the PRA; and (2) the Director of OMB to review the Commission's alleged violation of the PRA and take appropriate remedial action to cure that violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. Defendants opposed the motion and simultaneously filed their own motion to dismiss the action on various grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Pls.' Mot.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the Court can reach Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs must first overcome two fundamental obstacles presented by Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. First, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have somehow been injured by Defendants' actions and that they have standing to bring this suit at all. The Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have met this burden, having alleged that they have been deprived of certain information that works a particularized and concrete harm upon them. Next, Plaintiffs must allege facts from which this Court can determine that the Commission is actually subject to the PRA's requirements, as the Plaintiffs claim. On this second obstacle, however, Plaintiffs stumble. The PRA applies only to \"agencies,\" as it defines that term. Based on the current state of the record, the Court cannot find that the Commission is an \"agency\" for purposes of the PRA because the pleadings and other evidence provided to the Court support the notion that the Commission works solely to advise and assist the President and there has been no allegation or other showing that the Commission has any substantial authority independent of the President. Accordingly, the Court cannot find that the Commission is subject to the terms of the PRA and thus Plaintiffs' claims-all of which are based on this premise-must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court must first begin with the threshold question of whether Plaintiffs have constitutional standing to assert their claims at all. Article III of the United States Constitution grants the Judiciary authority to adjudicate only \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const. Art. III. One of the hallmarks of the \" 'Case[s]' \" and 'Controversies' that are of the justiciable sort referred to in Article III ... is the doctrine of standing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

To assess whether such a claim might exist, the Circuit has advised that a \"plaintiff suffers sufficiently concrete and particularized informational injury where the plaintiff alleges that: (1) it has been deprived of information that, on its interpretation, a statute requires the government or a third party to disclose to it, and (2) it suffers by being denied access to that information, the type of harm Congress sought to prevent by requiring disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of Animals II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336649,12409754\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/989/\">\n    828 F.3d at 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Plaintiffs meet both elements necessary to show informational injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, under the Plaintiffs' interpretation of the PRA, the Commission was required to disclose certain information prior to issuing its request for voter data and materials, but it failed to do so. Section 3507(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the PRA states, in unequivocal terms, that an agency \"shall not conduct or sponsor the collection of information unless in advance ... of the collection of information the agency has ... published notice in the Federal Register ... setting forth a title for the collection of information; a summary of the collection of information; a brief description of the need for the information and the proposed use of the information; a description of the likely respondents and proposed frequency of response to the collection of information; an estimate of the burden that shall result from the collection of information ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203507\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D). If, as Plaintiffs contend, the Commission constitutes an \"agency\" and its requests for voter data constituted a \"collection of information,\" as those terms are defined under the statute, then the Commission would have had a statutory obligation to disclose this information prior to making its requests. It is undisputed, however, that the Commission made no such disclosures. Thus, plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that they have been deprived of information that, under their interpretation of the law, they were entitled to obtain. This is sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the informational injury inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court thus turns to the second prong of the test-whether denial of information caused Plaintiffs to suffer the type of harm that Congress sought to prevent by requiring disclosure.

In passing the PRA, Congress enumerated nearly a dozen purposes that it was meant to serve. Two are of particular relevance here.

Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   prohibits a finding of informational injury merely because the statute conferring the right to information also happens to be associated with the statute's notice and comment procedures. In\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   , the sole injury alleged by plaintiffs was the deprivation of a right to\n   <em>\n    comment\n   </em>\n   in a proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/\">\n    555 U.S. at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679298\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/438/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With the exception of certain enumerated exclusions not applicable here, the PRA defines the term \"agency\" to mean \"any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203502\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The Commission quite clearly does not fall into most of these categories. Indeed, it is readily apparent that the Commission is not one of the fifteen executive departments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , any of the three military departments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not fall within the definitions of \"Government corporation\" or \"Government controlled corporation\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and is not one of several enumerated \"independent regulatory agenc[ies],\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203502\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). Accordingly, whether the Commission constitutes an \"agency\" for purposes of the PRA will necessarily turn on whether it falls within the PRA's catchall category of \"other establishment[s] in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The parties fundamentally disagree, however, about whether or not the Commission actually falls within that group. Notably, the PRA does not specify what that category includes or excludes and no court has previously addressed whether the PRA may be interpreted to reach entities such as the Commission. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs argue that the text and purpose of the PRA suggest that the Commission should be considered an \"agency\" under the PRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21. Plaintiffs contend that the Commission is most certainly an establishment in the executive branch given that the Commission was established by Executive Order, is chaired by the Vice President, and is charged with producing a report for the President himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21. Plaintiffs also contend that the PRA's definition of agency should be viewed broadly given that Congress's overarching purpose in enacting the PRA was to reign in government collection activities, which the PRA sought to accomplish in part by extending its applicability to more agencies than its predecessor statute, the\n   Federal Reports Act of 1942.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21-22. Defendants, on the other hand, point out that the PRA's definition of \"agency\" is nearly identical to the definition of \"agency\" under FOIA. Defs.' MTD at 17. For this reason, Defendants urge that the terms should be interpreted coextensively. Because FOIA has been interpreted not to include staff and units that serve solely to advise the President, Defendants argue that this limitation should apply equally to the PRA. The Court finds that Defendants have the better of the arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"There is a presumption that Congress uses the same term consistently in different statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Treasury Emps.

Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that when two statutes contain the same language, it is a \"strong indication\" that they \"should be interpreted\n   <em>\n    pari passu\n   </em>\n   ,\" that is, on equal footing.\n   <em>\n    Northcross v.

Thus, under circumstances where statutes parallel one another, ordinarily a \"common term should be construed consistently under each statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3454996,3329607\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/839/\">\n    452 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   858 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kooritzky v.

Cir. 1999) (explaining that similar language in different statutes is a strong indication that the language should be interpreted alike). In this case, the definitions of \"agency\" under the PRA parallels the definition of that term under FOIA. Indeed, under FOIA, the term \"agency\" \"includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). Given the parallel nature of the FOIA's and the PRA's definitions of \"agency,\" they are most naturally understood to be coextensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Reading the PRA consistently with FOIA sheds light on the otherwise undefined contours of the term \"other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President).\" Indeed, it is well settled that, while the text itself does not admit of any limitations, it does not extend to \"the President's immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office [of the President] whose sole function it is to advise and assist the President.\"\n   <em>\n    Kissinger v.

Significantly, this \"advise and assist\" limitation was the settled law at the time the PRA was enacted. The Supreme Court has advised that \"when judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its ... judicial interpretations as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

Thus, there is added force to the argument that Congress intended the \"advise and assist\" limitation to apply equally to the PRA when it invoked the FOIA's definition of \"agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs attempt to resist this conclusion by seizing on a single distinction between the PRA's definition of \"agency\" and FOIA's definition of that term. Specifically, Plaintiffs point out that FOIA's definition cross-references\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), which is the Administrative Procedure Act's (\"APA's\") definition of \"agency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 19. According to Plaintiffs, this additional reference means that \"agency\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   under the PRA should not be read coextensively with the definition under FOIA, despite all other language being equal. To fully comprehend Plaintiffs' argument, one must first understand the history and relation between FOIA and the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In 1966, Congress enacted FOIA as an amendment to the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Then, in 1974, Congress amended FOIA to expand its definition of \"agency\" without expanding the overall definition of the term under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 93-502,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Stat.%201561\">\n    88 Stat. 1561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974). That amendment clarified that, for purposes of FOIA, an \" 'agency' as defined in section 551(1)\" of the APA \"includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While Plaintiffs concede, as they must, that the definition of agency under the PRA is nearly identical to this amendment, Plaintiffs focus on the fact that the FOIA amendment, unlike the PRA, cross-references the APA's definition of \"agency\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). This is critical, Plaintiffs contend, because FOIA's \"exemption for units in the Executive Office that 'advise and assist' the President derives solely from\" that provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 20, ECF No. 26. Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, this is simply not the case. While FOIA does reference the APA's definition of agency under \u00a7 551(1) and the language of that provision is the source of\n   <em>\n    the APA's limitation\n   </em>\n   on staff and units that advise the President, \u00a7 551(1) is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the source of FOIA's limited applicability. Indeed, the limitation on FOIA's definition of \"agency\" comes from how Congress intended the term \"Executive Office of the President\" to be interpreted under \u00a7 552(f) of FOIA. The Conference Report for the 1974 FOIA amendments indicates that \"[w]ith respect to the meaning of the term 'Executive Office of the President[,]' the conferees intend the result reached in\n   <em>\n    Soucie v. David\n   </em>\n   ....\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1380, at 15 (1974). Thus, it made clear that \"\n   <em>\n    [t]he term\n   </em>\n   [was] not to be interpreted as including the President's immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As this history shows, FOIA's limited applicability comes-not from any interpretation of \u00a7 551(1) -but from how Congress intended the term \"Executive Office of the President\" to be interpreted under \u00a7 552(f) -FOIA's definition of \"agency.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is confirmed by the\n   Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , which based its understanding of FOIA's limited applicability on this very legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p156\">\n    445 U.S. at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p156\">\n    100 S.Ct. 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the source of the \"advise and assist\" limitation under FOIA is derived from the term \"Executive Office of the President,\" a term that is shared by the PRA, Plaintiffs have failed to show why FOIA's reference to \u00a7 551(1) requires the Court to reject the normal presumption that common terms in parallel provisions should be construed consistently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court is convinced that the term \"agency\" under the PRA should be construed conterminously with that term under FOIA and that FOIA's \"advise and assist\" limitation applies equally to the PRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Having found that the definition of agency in the PRA is to be construed conterminously with the definition of \"agency\" found in FOIA, the Court must determine whether the Commission constitutes an agency under that definition. In the years since the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit has propounded various tests designed to answer the question of whether a unit within the Executive\n   Office of the President (\"EOP\") is subject to FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v.

Cir. 2009). But, \"[h]owever the test has been stated, common to every case in which [the D.C. Circuit has] held that an EOP unit is subject to FOIA has been a finding that the entity in question 'wielded substantial authority independently of the President.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647626,3542541\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sweetland v.

Consequently, the Court finds that this is the same inquiry that should control whether or not the Commission constitutes an \"agency\" for purposes of the PRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on the present record and the relevant case law, the Court cannot conclude that the Commission constitutes an \"agency\" for purposes of the PRA. The Executive Order at issue indicates that the Commission is purely advisory in nature and that it shall disband shortly after it delivers a report to the President. Moreover, the Order does not grant the Commission any authority independent of the President and there is no evidence that it has ever exercised any such authority. The Commission's request for information from state officials is not a command for information that state officials must obey and there is no evidence that the Commission has sought to compel compliance by any means. This Court finds that these considerations lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Commission is not an \"agency\" for purposes of the PRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs allege no additional facts in their complaint or provide any other information that would otherwise persuade this Court to reach a different result. Indeed, Plaintiffs all but concede this point, having made no argument that the Commission in fact exercises any authority independent of the President. Because the Court cannot conclude that the Commission is an \"agency\" for purposes of the PRA, it also cannot find that the Commission was under any \"clear duty to act\" in accordance with the PRA's mandates. Without the showing of such a duty, Plaintiffs' claims for mandamus relief must necessarily be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baptist Mem'l Hosp. v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3548999,4227863\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/603/57/\">\n    603 F.3d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (affirming dismissal of mandamus action because, among other reasons, the statute at issue \"cannot provide the 'clear duty to act' necessary to sustain the hospitals' requests for mandamus relief.\"). Likewise, Plaintiffs cannot sustain a claim for declaratory relief, so those claims must be dismissed as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2. Claims against the OMB Defendants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims against the OMB fare no better than their claims against the Commission. Indeed, the same finding that the Commission is not an agency pursuant\n   to the PRA necessarily dooms these claims too.

Plaintiffs' claim against the OMB Defendants must fail because the PRA only requires the Director to take action when requested to review a collection of information conducted \"by or for [an] agency,\" as defined under the PRA. Because the Court has already concluded that Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that the Commission satisfies that definition, they have also necessarily failed to show that the OMB Defendants were under any obligation to take any action under the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' APA and declaratory judgment claims against the OMB Defendants must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because the Court finds that it is appropriate to grant Defendants' motion to dismiss, there is therefore no need to reach Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 22) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 10). The Court also\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Declaration in support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 24). As discussed above, the basis for the Court's decision is that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege or otherwise show that the Commission constitutes an \"agency\" subject to the PRA. Plaintiffs have requested that, in the event that the Court makes just such a finding, that it be granted leave to file an amended complaint to demonstrate the reasons why the Commission meets the standard that the Court adopts today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 21, n.6. Plaintiffs also note that this very question is pending in parallel litigation in this Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 21, n.6. Based on these representations, the Court is satisfied that leave should be given. Accordingly, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs request for leave to amend their Complaint orders that they file their\n   amended complaint within 30 days. An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that a disclosure requirement can be inferred from two provisions found in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203506\">\n     44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3506\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nevertheless, because the materials that Plaintiffs allege must be disclosed under that provision are substantially the same as what is explicitly required under \u00a7 3507(a), the Court finds it sufficient to limit its discussion to \u00a7 3507(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, a plaintiff need only \"\n    <em>\n     espouse a view of the law\n    </em>\n    under which the defendant (or an entity it regulates) is obligated to disclose certain information that the plaintiff has a right to obtain.\"\n    <em>\n     Am.

For example, in\n    <em>\n     Akins\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiffs in that case challenged the Federal Election Commission's determination that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (\"AIPAC\") was not a \"political committee\" for purposes of the FECA and, consequently, that it did not have to disclose information concerning its donors and contributions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Akins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/#p21\">\n     524 U.S. at 13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/#p21\">\n     118 S.Ct. 1777\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The Supreme Court held that plaintiffs in that case had standing to challenge the agency's interpretation, but did not actually resolve the predicate question of whether the AIPAC was, in fact, a political committee.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/#p21\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Rather, the Court was able to find an injury in fact consisting of plaintiffs' inability to obtain information based purely on their \"view of the law\" which would require the disclosure plaintiffs sought.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/#p21\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thus, even though the Plaintiffs in this case have espoused a view sufficient to find an informational injury, that view is not necessarily the correct view of the law. And, in fact, as described in greater detail\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , the Court finds Plaintiffs' view is not correct because the Commission does not constitute an \"agency\" for purposes of the PRA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In a related case,\n    <em>\n     Electronic Privacy Information Center. v.

Contrary to Defendant's intimations, this case does not stand for the broad proposition that there can\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    exist a right to information if that right is conferred by a statute setting forth notice and comment procedures. As its language suggests, the case addressed only the particular circumstances underlying the ARA. The present suit, of course, does not concern the ARA and, as described above, the Court is satisfied that at least part of PRA's purpose\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    to disclose information to the public. Moreover, the case law in the D.C. Circuit has found informational injuries based on notice statutes on multiple occasions, which critically undermines Defendants' absolutist position.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that it would be \"unnecessary and superfluous to understand the language of \u00a7 552(f) to incorporate the 'advise and assist' limitation, when the limitation was already present and operative for FOIA in \u00a7 551(1) at the time Congress passed \u00a7 552(f).\" Pls.' Opp'n at 21-22. The Plaintiffs are wrong on this score. The FOIA Amendments expressly expanded the definition of \"agency\" so that it would extend\n    <em>\n     beyond\n    </em>\n    the constraints imposed by \u00a7 551(1).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1380, at 14-15 (1974) (\"The conferees state that they intend to include within the definition of 'agency' those entities encompassed by 5 U.S.C. 551\n    <em>\n     and other entities,\n    </em>\n    including [list of entities] .... Expansion of the definition of 'agency' in this subsection is intended to broaden applicability of the Freedom of Information Act ....\") (emphasis added). It would be illogical to understand \u00a7 552(f) as both broadening \u00a7 551(1)'s definition of \"agency\" while simultaneously being constrained by its restrictions. Indeed, the only logical understanding of FOIA's \"advise and assist\" limitation is that it emanates from \u00a7 552(f) itself.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Plaintiffs other arguments are also unavailing. First, Plaintiffs argue that \"Congress knew how to indicate that a subsequent statute should follow both parts of FOIA's definition, bud did not include an indication of that sort here.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 23. As evidence of their claim, they point to the Privacy Act, which incorporates FOIA's definition of 'agency' by cross-reference.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Opp'n at 23 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a ). As an initial matter, the Court finds the Privacy Act's use of a cross-reference rather unsurprising given that the APA, FOIA, and the Privacy Act all reside within Title 5 of the U.S. Code. The PRA, on the other hand, is found in Title 44. Nevertheless, there is no rule of construction suggesting that, absent a cross-reference, statutes with similar language must be interpreted differently. And the mere fact that Congress did not include a cross-reference in this instance does not seem to otherwise suggest that Congress perceived a difference between agencies for purposes of FOIA and the PRA when, in fact, Congress used the exact same words for both statutes. Plaintiffs also contend that Congress \"did not indicate in any way that it intended to minimize burdens imposed on the public only by those segments of the federal government that wield substantial independent authority from the President.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 24. This is plainly incorrect. As discussed above, Congress adopted the same language that it had crafted for purposes of FOIA, which it had enacted only a few years earlier, and did so only after its terms had been settled by the Supreme Court. So, while Congress may not have explicitly stated its intentions as succinctly as Plaintiffs might like, the import of Congress's actions is undeniable. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that a finding that the PRA's definition of \"agency\" does not extend to the President's advisors would somehow undermine the purpose of the PRA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Opp'n at 23-24. But, Plaintiffs do not point to anything indicating that Congress intended the PRA to apply to every establishment in the Executive Branch without exception or that Congress specifically wanted the PRA to reach the President's advisors. Thus, it is hard to understand how the Court's finding in this regard necessarily does harm to the PRA's broader purpose. Congress intended FOIA to apply broadly but, similarly, was not troubled that not applying it to the President's advisors would undermine its purpose.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    This conclusion is in accord with how the Court of Appeals has addressed similar bodies that advise the President in the FOIA context.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rushforth v.
