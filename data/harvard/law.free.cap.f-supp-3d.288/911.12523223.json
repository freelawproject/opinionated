Jackson\n   </em>\n   's propulsion system from steam- to diesel-powered. He sued the ship's owner, The Interlake Steamship Company, alleging negligence under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (the \"Act\" or \"LHWCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20905\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), as well as Fraser Shipyards, Inc., where the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   was dry-docked for the upgrade, and Capstan Corporation, Fraser's parent corporation, for negligence under \u00a7 933 of the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These three defendants highlight different provisions of the Act: \u00a7 905(b), the exclusive remedy against vessels;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 904, 905(a), the exclusive remedy against employers; and \u00a7 933, the remedy against third parties. Before the court are defendants' motions for summary judgment (dkt. ## 50, 72, 78), along with plaintiff's related request to disregard new evidence and argument in Fraser's reply (dkt. # 124).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Interlake, the owner of the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , is a Delaware corporation that maintains its principal place of business in Ohio. Beginning in 2006, Interlake started a ten-year project to upgrade five ships in its fleet, including converting four to diesel-powered. The last ship due for an upgrade was the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   . To facilitate this, Interlake entered into a contract on September 30, 2015, with defendant Fraser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fraser is a Wisconsin corporation with its principal place of business in Superior, Wisconsin, which provides shipyard services, such as construction, repairs and inspections. Fraser's work on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   was its \"first major repowering [project] ... since the mid-1980s.\" (Press Release (dkt. # 101-2) 5.) The majority of the work Fraser performs occurs at its property in Superior, Wisconsin. Defendant Capstan is Fraser's sole shareholder and parent corporation and it is a Wisconsin corporation, but with an office in Duluth, Minnesota.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants Capstan and Fraser are separate corporate entities, with separate workspaces, email domains, corporate logos and websites. They do, however, share a CEO and chairman (Todd Johnson), as well as a treasurer and CFO (Scott Brantly).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Nicholas Minardi, who is allegedly familiar with Capstan's corporate structure between 2014 and 2016, Capstan and Fraser shifted their approach in 2014 to safety management, so that Capstan would manage safety for Fraser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since February 18, 2011, Fraser had a Client Services Agreement with Tradesmen International, under which Tradesmen would assign workers to Fraser. By its terms, this agreement specified that Fraser would be \"solely responsible for directing, supervising and controlling Tradesmen employees as well as their work.\" (Client Services Agreement (dkt. # 15-1) \u00b6 3(a).) This agreement also detailed that Fraser had the right \"in its sole discretion, [to] release a Tradesmen employee back to Tradesmen at any time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 14, 2015, Holder applied for a job as a \"ship fitter\" with Tradesmen, believing that the job consisted of working for Tradesmen in Superior, Wisconsin. As part of the application process, Holder acknowledged that he would be subject to a background check, including signing off on execution of a background check release form, which referred to Tradesmen as the employer. Holder also received a Tradesmen Employment Orientation Recap, which involved reviewing OSHA training and the Tradesmen Employee Safety Handbook, watching a safety video, and discussing fringe benefits. In addition, he was instructed to report injuries and accidents to Tradesmen for investigation and to direct questions about the Field Employee Policy Manual to his manager. Finally, Holder understood that Tradesmen would manage his employee withholdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beginning in January 2016, Tradesmen assigned workers to Fraser Shipyards for the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   upgrade, including Holder. Holder disputes that: (1) the Fraser-Tradesmen Client Services Agreement was followed in practice; (2) he acknowledged Fraser's responsibility and authority for his direction and supervision; and (3) he acknowledged being a Fraser employee. Fraser paid Tradesmen for the work done by Holder based on a bill-out rate, multiplied by the number of hours Holder worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Holder's Work on the\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Holder worked aboard the ship at Fraser's dry dock for 37 days, from January 5 until February 29, 2016. On the 5th, Holder signed a notice agreeing to abide by Tradesmen's policies, as well as acknowledging that Tradesmen or he could terminate his employment \"with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time.\" (Holder Personnel File (dkt. # 102-1) 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Holder's work involved \"removing and replacing the bottom and side shell on the vessel and also framework,\" which required him \"to burn out the old steel with a torch,\" make \"final cuts, take whatever framework had to be taken out, and go ahead and replac[e] everything with new steel.\" (Holder Dep. (dkt. # 85) 98:4-15.) He only worked on the turn-of-the-bilge/ballast area of the ship. Holder avers that his supervisors were Chris Duncan and Joe Kutzler (apparently misspelled as Cunsler) and that they directed his work, although Fraser and Capstan dispute this. The parties also dispute whether Duncan and Kutzler were employees of Reuben\n   Johnson &amp; Sons (\"RJS\") or Chris Jensen &amp; Sons, and whether they were working for Fraser on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   project. Fraser avers that no RJS employees were on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regardless, Holder believed that he was working for Tradesmen, not Fraser. Moreover, the parties agree that Holder was paid by Tradesmen during the course of his work at the Fraser Shipyards, although they dispute whether Fraser provided Holder with tools or whether Holder brought his own, with the exception of heavy equipment which they agree was available at the job site. The parties also dispute whether Fraser made available safety and protective equipment. Holder contends that when he checked out equipment, he identified himself as a Tradesmen employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Fraser asserts that Holder worked on a different project unrelated to the repowering project-specifically, one replacing shell plates, which was covered by a different Interlake purchase order-while Holder maintains that he worked on the repowering project. In either case, Holder maintains that he was exposed to lead during his work on the project. He also avers that: (1) a Fraser representative informed him respirators were optional; (2) no one told him about designated changing areas, to vacuum his clothing, or other preventive hygiene; (3) the respirator he used at work was not fit tested; and (4) on January 29, 2016, Farkas informed him that \"there is no lead paint\" (Holder Dep. (dkt. # 85) 164:6-165:5). Holder does not recall speaking with anyone from Interlake while working on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Work Performed on the\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The goal of the contract between Interlake and Fraser Shipyards was to convert the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   from steam- to diesel-powered. For the price of $9,784,295, plus costs for equipment, the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   repowering project included the installation of new diesel engines, operating and main decks, propeller and blades, control room and console, and a tailshaft, plus related piping, electrical components and equipment. During the work, the propeller blades, rudder, hub, unloading diesel generators, and stack were removed; the propeller shaft cut; the main propulsion turbine, propulsion boilers, propulsion controls, and reduction gear were demolished; and the outer hull below the waterline had a 7-foot by 4-foot hole in it. The ship was unable to propel itself and was no longer watertight and or capable of floating while in dry dock. Holder himself testified about \"holes all over the shell of the boat,\" such that it looked like \"Swiss cheese,\" and there was \"no way in the world that boat was going to float if you flooded the dry dock at that point.\" (Holder Dep. (dkt. # 85) 151:3-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As a result, the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   was in dry dock from December 15, 2015 until May 31, 2016, and could not have been used for transport during this time. The\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   entered a Fraser \"graving\" dry dock, such that it was out of water and did not have a captain in service onboard. Although this repowering project was supposed to take approximately six months, and actually took nine, the parties agree that it was typical for a Great Lakes ship to be out of use during at least a few of the winter months, when maintenance is routinely done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties dispute who controlled the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   during this upgrade. Holder argues that the ship remained in Interlake's active control, while Interlake points to Fraser. They likewise dispute whether Interlake controlled the details of the work performed by Fraser. They also disagree whether there was crew aboard. Holder avers that Mike Wolny was working on the ship on behalf of Interlake, while Interlake\n   responds that Wolny was a \"field project manager,\" who updated Interlake on the status of the project, but did not reside on the ship and was provided office space by Fraser. Holder contends Wolny's presence practically gave Interlake the ability to intervene in the work being completed and to direct workers on how to do their jobs, while Interlake contends that Wolny was merely a \"technical advisor,\" who advised about the positioning of valves. Interlake maintains further that it only had the right to approve and inspect work, material and workmanship, to assure conformance with the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Still, the parties agree that Wolny met weekly with Fraser's Currelli and that Interlake needed to pre-approve additional work. Wolny also created \"Weekly Repower Reports\" for Interlake's director of fleet projects, Ian Sharp, in which he regularly reported that Fraser \"require[d] a procedure to deal with the discovery of lead paint\" and that no testing for lead paint had been performed. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Weekly Reports (dkt. # 100-2) 27, 36, 64, 84.) According to plaintiff, Fraser relied on Grant Huttel, a Capstan employee, for safety management during the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   repowering project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The ship was returned to Interlake on September 25, 2016, a Certificate of Inspection was issued on September 23, 2016, and an American Bureau of Shipping Certificate for the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   was issued on December 15, 2016. The parties dispute whether the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   needed these certificates before it could sail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Knowledge of Lead\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties next dispute whether Fraser assumed the ship had lead paint based on its age, but Interlake expressly warned Fraser in the contract that \"there may be asbestos and lead paint\" on the ship\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the \"responsibility to safely remove any and all asbestos and lead paint that is disturbed as a result of this conversion\" fell to Fraser. (Shipbuilding Contract for the Re-Powering of the Str. Herbert C. Jackson and Attachments (dkt. # 81-1) 43.) Moreover, a kick-off meeting between Fraser, Interlake, Seeley Electric, Toromont, MAST, Northern Engineering, Bay Engineering, Robinson Brothers, and Benson Electric was held on October 12-13, 2015, at which they discussed asbestos abatement. At that meeting, Interlake avers it again warned Fraser that lead paint was likely to be found on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , to which Fraser responded that it had a procedure for handling lead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 30, 2015, Robinson Brothers gave Fraser a price quote on lead paint removal from the engine room of the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   . Interlake contends that this quote addressed only a \"localized spot,\" and such work was completed. Plaintiff alleges that Interlake chose not to repaint the engine room because the cost of removing and replacing the paint was too high and would take too long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At a meeting on December 15, 2015, Interlake again informed Fraser that there likely was lead paint on the ship, this time pointing out that other shipyards working on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   during prior winters had developed procedures for detecting lead paint and ensuring worker safety by monitoring air quality. Plaintiff disputes Interlake's assertion that Fraser's Tom Currelli assured that a system was in place for dealing with toxins, including lead paint, that was similar to other shipyards'.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff further hypothesizes that Fraser's allegedly written, lead compliance program was only created after the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   project was terminated, disputing the assertion that Fraser informed Interlake at a January 8, 2016, meeting of its intent to activate its lead detection and remediation procedures. Plaintiff also disputes Interlake's\n   assertion that it did not know Fraser had failed to act to protect workers from lead paint and other toxic substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    E. OSHA Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Workers complained to defendants Capstan and Fraser about the air quality aboard the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   . When Capstan and Fraser did nothing, workers then turned to OSHA. OSHA conducted air sample testing on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   on February 10-11, 2016, resulting in a citation and notice of penalty on July 29, 2016. (OSHA Citation (dkt. # 101) 36.) On both days, OSHA found \"[t]he employer did not ensure that employee(s) exposure to lead did not exceed 40 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) of air, as a reduced 10-hour time weighted average (TWA) for the extended work shift.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those violations occurred when an employee was welding in Ballast Tank # 5. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 10th, the employee's exposure was approximately 11.66 times permissible exposure; on the 11th, the exposure was approximately 4.05 times permissible exposure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) OSHA conducted additional air sample testing on March 23, 2016, again finding lead exposures greater than the permissible level. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20905\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20905\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) OSHA found several violations. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   OSHA Citation (dkt. # 101).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Holder's Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After Holder stopped working on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   on February 29, 2016, a former colleague advised him to have his blood tested because others had been exposed to lead. When Holder did so on April 1, 2016, his blood test revealed a blood-level of 36.5 \u00b5g/dL. In contrast, a normal blood lead level (BLL) for adults at that time was considered to be less than 5 \u00b5g/dL, with an average of 1.2 \u00b5g/dL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) Program Description, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Aug. 10, 2017), https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ables/description.html (hereinafter \"NIOSH ABLES\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Holder applied for benefits under the Act on January 9, 2017, identifying Tradesmen as his employer and Chris Pooler as his supervisor. (LHWCA Claim Form (dkt. # 102-2) 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The U.S. Department of Labor notified Tradesmen of the claim. Holder has yet to receive workers' compensation benefits from any defendant. Tradesmen is not covered by Fraser's LHWCA insurance. Likewise,\n   Fraser's insurance policy covers neither Chris Jensen &amp; Son Co. nor RJS Construction as a related or alternate employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dr. David Parker, a licensed physician with a master's of public health in occupational epidemiology, who has consulted with labor and industry about worker health and safety, spoke with Holder on the phone and reviewed his medical records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also created and used an Adult Lead Survey to examine Holder's exposure during his work on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   .

Second, it is unknown for\n   <em>\n    how long\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   was practically incapable of maritime transport and how this amount of time related to plaintiff's work on the ship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed expert John Sullivan opined that \"[t]he Jackson never stopped being a vessel while it was in the dry dock\" because \"[t]he work on [it] was not, in any way, comparable to a vessel being taken out of service and permanently moored to the shore or the ocean\n   floor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Sullivan Aff.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.)

Following the court's invitation to address Interlake's waiver argument, plaintiff responded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Over fourteen months ago, in response to Interlake's motion to dismiss, counsel for the plaintiff stated in a footnote: \"If for any reason the Court disagrees [with plaintiff's argument LHWCA Section 905(b) governs plaintiff's claims against Interlake], plaintiff moves for leave to file a second amended complaint, in order to state claims for relief against Interlake and others under state law.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (Pl.'s Sur-Reply (dkt. # 136) 1 (quoting Pl.'s Mot.

Accordingly, the question is whether he was performing work for Fraser or for the employer of Duncan and Kutzler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The dispute over whether Duncan and Kutzler were employees of CJS or RJS is immaterial. Regardless of who legally employed plaintiff's supervisors, Holder's supervisors were directed by Fraser and doing work for its benefit. Certainly, Holder offers no evidence to support any other inference. The ship was still at Fraser's shipyard and the work-whether part of the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   repowering project or requested under a separate work order-was performed on Fraser's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Duncan Aff. (dkt. # 124-1) \u00b6 6 (\"It was my understanding that RJS Construction Group, LLC had been hired as a subcontractor to Fraser Shipyards in order to provide construction foremen to supervise work on the Herbert C. Jackson.\").) Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of borrowed employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Was there an agreement, understanding, or meeting of the minds between the original and the borrowing employer?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   There is no dispute that since February 2011, Fraser and Tradesmen had a written agreement under which Tradesmen would provide workers to Fraser, and Fraser would be \"solely responsible for directing, supervising and controlling Tradesmen employees as well as their work.\" (Client Services Agreement (dkt. # 15-1) \u00b6 3(a).) This agreement also details that Fraser had the right \"in its sole discretion, [to] release a Tradesmen employee back to Tradesmen at any time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's complaint that there was no explicit language about borrowing employees is unfounded. This factor weighs strongly in favor of borrowed employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Did the employee acquiesce in the new work situation?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   While Holder argues that he believed himself to be, and held himself out to be, an employee of Tradesmen while working on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , the question of employee acquiescence is an objective one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Langfitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049215\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/1116/#p1122\">\n    647 F.3d at 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[R]egardless of the employee's subjective intent, consent may be gleaned from the employee's conduct and the nature of the employee's relationship with the borrowing principal.\").

There is no dispute that the agreement between Tradesmen and Fraser gave Fraser the right \"in its sole discretion, [to] release a Tradesmen employee back to Tradesmen at any time.\" (Client Services Agreement (dkt. # 15-1) \u00b6 3(a).) Holder's argument about signing a document permitting himself or Tradesmen to end his employment\n   <em>\n    with Tradesmen\n   </em>\n   does not create a question of fact. Therefore, this factor, too, weighs in favor of borrowed employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Who had the obligation to pay the employee?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   While there is no dispute that Tradesmen paid plaintiff's wages and managed his tax withholdings, the inquiry does not end there. Rather, the question is intended to be broader: who provided the\n   funds to pay the Holder?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548181\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/784/615/#p616\">\n    784 F.2d at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Since [borrowing employer] paid [lending employer] at an hourly rate for [plaintiff's] work, and then [lending employer] paid [plaintiff] at a lower hourly rate, [borrowing employer] in essence paid [plaintiff].\");\n   <em>\n    Melancon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10551378\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/834/1238/#p1243\">\n    834 F.2d at 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Fraser paid Tradesmen for the work done by Holder, and from those funds, Tradesmen presumably paid his salary. Thus, this factor similarly weighs in favor of borrowed employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Accordingly, even assuming that the control factor is open to some factual dispute, seven of the other eight factors weigh in favor of borrowed employee status and the remaining factor is neutral. Accordingly, the court finds that any reasonable jury would find plaintiff was the borrowed employee of Fraser and therefore his only recourse is a workers' compensation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Claim against Capstan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Like the claim against Fraser, plaintiff brings a \u00a7 933 claim against Capstan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3d Am. Compl. (dkt. # 106) \u00b6 66.) Seeking summary judgment, Capstan argues that it \"is so interrelated with Fraser ... [that] it is treated as a single entity for purposes of the [LHWCA's] exclusive remedy provision.\" (Capstan Summ. J. Br. (dkt. # 73) 1.) Capstan adds that the two companies \"are so interrelated[ ] that a suit against one is essentially a suit against the other\" because of their shared management employees and corporate offices, and the fact that Capstan is the parent corporation and sole shareholder of Fraser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) For this reason, Capstan argues it is entitled to immunity to the same extent as Fraser. (Capstan Reply (dkt. # 113) 1.) Plaintiff argues that Capstan is not entitled to immunity whether or not Fraser is entitled to immunity. (Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 98) 57-58.) Specifically, plaintiff argues that Fraser and Capstan are different corporate entities (with different workspaces, websites, logos, and email domains) that played different roles on the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , with Capstan having responsibility for safety.

Similarly, these same defendants repeatedly object on relevance grounds to plaintiff's proposed findings of fact for no apparent purpose. While the court understands that defendants consider many of plaintiff's proposed facts to be \"completely irrelevant to the grounds for [their] summary judgment motions,\" plaintiff only had one opportunity to submit contrary proposed findings of fact to marshal his evidence and attempt to show a genuine, material dispute of fact. Whether objecting or not, defendants were free to argue the relevant facts.

Because the defendants have failed to put forward evidence disputing plaintiff's assertions, however, the court will take them as true for purposes of summary judgment, leaving the court perplexed as to how the defendants consider these proposed facts \"irrelevant,\" particularly when Capstan argues it is entitled to summary judgment because of its business being interrelated with Fraser's.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Fraser disputes plaintiff's reliance on the subsequent citation based on these findings because Fraser entered an agreement with OSHA to resolve their disputes, which agreement and actions taken pursuant thereto were expressly not to be deemed admissions. Moreover, the parties to that agreement agreed that OSHA's findings could not be used for any purpose other than proceedings and matters arising under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. However, the plaintiff was not a party to that agreement, and regardless, the \"findings\" referred to in the agreement appear to refer to the findings referred to\n    <em>\n     within the agreement itself\n    </em>\n    , which amends the citations and notifications to include the agreement, not the other way around. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    OSHA Stipulation (dkt. # 118-1) 4, 11.) Although some objection might be made to admission of the citation itself (or even OSHA's underlying findings) on foundation or hearsay grounds, the court will assume for purposes of summary judgment that plaintiff can clear that hurdle at trial, or at minimum an expert could rely on the citations in forming his own opinions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    Even if one considered the guidance for adults for 2009-2015, normal BLL was = 10 \u00b5g/dL.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    NIOSH ABLES.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Defendants Fraser and Capstan point out that the claim form was not signed by Holder, but rather by Tommy Dulin, his attorney for his LHWCA claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    For purposes of summary judgment, Interlake does not challenge Dr. Parker's qualifications or analysis, but reserves the right to do so at trial.
