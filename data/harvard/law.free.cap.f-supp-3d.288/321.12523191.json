PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; DRPSMF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; DSMF \u00b6 9; PRDSMF \u00b6 9.

Imperial is ExxonMobil's Canadian subsidiary. PRDSAMF \u00b6 203; PRDSMF \u00b6 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   PPLC added to its pipeline system in 1950 by constructing and then operating an eighteen-inch pipeline. PSMF \u00b6 3; DRPSMF \u00b6 3; DSMF \u00b6 5; PRDSMF \u00b6 5. PPLC added to its pipeline system again in 1965 by constructing and then operating a twenty-four-inch pipeline. PSMF \u00b6 4; DRPSMF \u00b6 4; DSMF \u00b6 5; PRDSMF \u00b6 5. PPLC decommissioned and ceased operating the original twelve-inch line in 1982. PSMF \u00b6 10; DRPSMF \u00b6 10. PPLC now uses the twelve-inch line as a sacrificial anode to protect its 18- and twenty-four-inch lines from external corrosion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The nominal capacities of the remaining 18- and twenty-four-inch lines are approximately 192,000 barrels per day and 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil, respectively. DSMF \u00b6 6; PRDSMF \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With a few exceptions of short distances, all three of PPLC's pipelines follow the same route, along the same rights of way, and pass largely underground between South Portland and the Montreal East oil refineries. PSMF \u00b6 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the pipeline system began operating in 1941, PPLC has operated the portion of the pipeline that lies within the United States, while MPLL has operated the portion that lies within Canada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSMF \u00b6 6; DSMF \u00b6 3. The only\n   exception was a period from 1987 to 1999, when PPLC and MPLL leased the eighteen-inch line to Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State), which operated the line for natural gas transmission.

PPLC transports oil from Pier 2 to Montreal East through PPLC's above-and below ground infrastructure, including storage tanks in South Portland, utilizing six pumping stations across Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont to move oil along the pipeline route. PSMF \u00b6 9; DRPSMF \u00b6 9. Specifically, the crude oil is offloaded from marine tank vessels at Pier 2 and transported to crude oil storage tanks in the City, four of which are located on two parcels in close proximity to Pier 2 (the Waterfront Tanks) and nineteen of which are located at the \"Main Tank Farm\" on Hill Street, approximately 2.7 miles inland from Pier 2. DSMF \u00b6 8; PRDSMF \u00b6 8. PPLC's eighteen-inch and twenty-four-inch pipelines move the crude oil northward from the South Portland tank farm to refineries in Montreal. DRPSMF \u00b6 8. Since 1999, both PPLC's eighteen-inch and twenty-four-inch pipelines have been configured primarily for the northbound transportation of crude oil from South Portland to Canada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSMF \u00b6 11. The eighteen-inch and twenty-four-inch pipelines do not extend to Pier 2; the Main Tank Farm and Pier 2 are connected by three subsurface lines running under Broadway, and other streets, and Mill Cove in the City.

As recently as 2010-the last year the eighteen-inch line was in active service-PPLC accepted 132 deliveries from tankers. PSMF \u00b6 15; DRPSMF \u00b6 15. That year, PPLC transported 27,969,719 barrels of crude oil northward to Montreal East through its eighteen-inch pipeline, for an average of 76,629 barrels per day, as well as 72,231,154 barrels of crude oil northward to Montreal East through its twenty-four-inch pipeline, for an average of 197,894 barrels per day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to PPLC's president, Thomas Hardison, \"PPLC has operated continuously since 1941 in part due to its ability to respond and adapt to changing market conditions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSMF \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The 2008-2009 Oil Sands Proposed Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   During the approximately one-decade period beginning in 1999, when PPLC reversed the flow of its eighteen-inch line back to a northbound orientation and began again shipping crude oil in that line, through 2008, when PPLC began pursuing the flow reversal project, PPLC moved an average volume of 394,000 barrels per day (\"b/d\") of crude oil through its pipeline system. PSAMF \u00b6 243; DRPSAMF \u00b6 243. In 2007-2008, PPLC determined that demand for transportation of crude oil from the Harbor to the Montreal East refineries was likely to decline because the boom in crude oil production in Alberta's \"oil sands\" fields meant that Montreal East refiners would need less foreign oil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSMF \u00b6 24.

DSMF \u00b6 133; PRDSMF \u00b6 133.

This could include the use of \"conditional zoning\" or the creation of a special development district tailored to a specific development proposal.

Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-642\">\n   The Court turns to whether the City's Ordinance is preempted by the PSA. On this issue, there is less of a genuine factual dispute between the parties than meets the eye. The parties are in general agreement about the effect of the Ordinance on PPLC, namely that PPLC is unable to legally load crude oil at the Harbor. The parties dispute the purpose of the Ordinance and the motives of its backers. They also dispute whether the effect of the Ordinance is to entirely prevent pipeline flow reversal. The City insists that PPLC could still reverse the flow of the pipeline and move the oil by rail once it reaches South Portland, but PPLC convincingly maintains that the City's alternative is uneconomic. Nevertheless, these disputes do not prevent the Court from concluding that the PSA does not preempt the Ordinance. This is because by its exact terms, the PSA prevents states and municipalities from imposing \"safety standards\" for interstate pipeline facilities or interstate pipeline safety.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060104\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 60104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

PPLC can and currently does operate the pipeline in compliance with both the PSA and Ordinance. Furthermore, even though the Ordinance prohibits the loading of crude oil onto tankers, PPLC cited no provision of the PSA or its regulations that requires pipeline operators to load crude oil.

This is true despite any contrary language in the approaches taken by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Washington Gas Light\n   </em>\n   and the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Texas Midstream\n   </em>\n   . The Court is bound by First Circuit precedent. The purpose or intent of the local law may be relevant in some limited circumstances where the federal statutes themselves appear particularly focused on local legislative purpose, like nuclear power and occupational health and safety. But in general,\n   preemption doctrine and First Circuit precedent focus on the intent of the federal law and the effect of the local law on that federal law's goals. Given the encompassing nature of myriad federal regulatory regimes, the more aggressive approach that PPLC urges would potentially invalidate a wide range of state and local laws, even though facially proper under state and local police power.

First, it is not impossible to comply with both the PWSA Title I and the Ordinance. The Ordinance does not provide any duties or restrictions related to vessel navigation or traffic in ports. Although it prohibits the loading of crude oil, the Ordinance creates no affirmative duties at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Celexa &amp; Lexapro Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011407\" index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/34/#p41\">\n    779 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (1st Cir. 2015) (explaining \"that [t]he question for impossibility is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it\"). Nor does the Ordinance impinge on conduct that federal law mandates. Tankers currently can and do navigate into the harbor following federal traffic controls and navigation requirements in compliance with both the PWSA and Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-700\">\n   Second, as the Court understands the purposes underlying the PWSA, the Ordinance does not stand as an obstacle to the goals of the PWSA. The PWSA seeks to increase the safety of tanker operations and port transfer facilities, and the PWSA is agnostic as to the amount of crude oil loading and the number of transfer facilities in operation. There is no indication that it is a goal of the statute to maintain or proliferate the number of facilities and the\n   amount of crude oil transfers in ports. Instead, it is concerned with improving the safety of tankers and transfer facilities and operations, wherever and however frequently they may occur. A ban on one kind of transfer and new structures associated with that transfer does not conflict with the goal of promoting uniform tanker specifications or navigation and traffic rules. In a general sense, PWSA's goals of \"protecting the marine environment\" and minimizing accidents is consistent with the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-701\">\n   Third, Title II of the PWSA does preempt a field of regulation, but the Ordinance is not within that field. The statutory provisions and regulations, while voluminous, follow the same general pattern present in the PSA \"safety standards.\" The PWSA and regulations generally: (1) impose training programs and inspection routines, (2) mandate the use of certain precautionary equipment, (3) establish minimum technical specifications for that precautionary equipment and other infrastructure, and (4) regulate \"operations\" in the sense that they require operating manuals, minimum personnel levels, or restrict personnel from conducting certain activities until others are complete.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"478\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20151.45-4\">\n    46 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.45-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (regulating \"cargo handling\" by mandating \"the person in charge of the transfer operation shall inspect the barge and other cargo equipment to assure himself that ... [a]ll sea valves are properly set and those connected to the cargo piping are closed\"). If this case were about whether the City could enact an ordinance that regulated these types of specific conduct, PPLC would have made out an excellent case for federal preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-702\">\n   But, it is not. The Ordinance does not resemble the kind of design, safety, personnel, and navigation restrictions on tankers held preempted in\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   Court said, \"Of course, that a tanker is certified under federal law as a safe vessel insofar as its design and construction characteristics are concerned does not mean that it is free to ignore otherwise valid state or federal rules or regulations that do not constitute design or construction specifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2796\" index=\"479\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/151/\">\n    435 U.S. at 168-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2796\" index=\"480\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/151/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ordinance does not contain any technical specifications nor does it mandate additional safety equipment; the same ships continue to use the Harbor just as they did before the Ordinance was enacted. At most, the Ordinance has an indirect effect on tankers by outlawing one specific activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-703\">\n   The Court's conclusion is consistent with that of the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Hammond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929686\" index=\"481\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/483/#p499\">\n    726 F.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1984).

To the contrary, Congress has repeatedly recognized the need for collaborative federal/state regulation of the marine environment within three miles of shore. Thus, we find that the federal marine environmental protection scheme as a whole does not prohibit stricter state standards regulating water pollution in a state's territorial waters, but in fact, through the [Clean Water Act], would enforce those standards. Moreover, nothing inherent in the comprehensiveness or complexity of the regulations under the PWSA/PTSA implies a preemptive intent on the part of Congress as to the regulation of deballasting within three miles of shore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-705\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929686\" index=\"483\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/483/#p499\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929686\" index=\"483\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/483/#p499\">\n    at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   Court specifically noted that \"the mere fact that a vessel has been inspected and found to comply with the Secretary's vessel safety regulations does not prevent a State or city from enforcing local laws having other purposes, such as a local smoke abatement law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2796\" index=\"484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/151/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Transfer Facility Regulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-708\">\n   Even if the Ordinance is not an impermissible tanker regulation, that does not answer whether it is preempted by the provisions covering on-shore transfer facilities. This question, however, is an easier call. In concluding that federal tanker safety and design regulations were impliedly meant to be exclusive, the\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   Court relied, in part, on the fact that Congress explicitly allowed States to impose stricter regulations for on-shore transfer facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2796\" index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/151/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2796\" index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/151/\">\n    at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2796\" index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/151/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Furthermore, \u00a7 1222(b), by permitting the State to impose higher equipment or safety standards 'for structures only,' impliedly forbids higher state standards for vessels\"). The\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   Courts noted that the federal regulation of tankers have greater preemptive effect than those covering on-shore facilities because maritime tanker operations are not historically regulated by state police powers, whereas on-shore facilities are within a state's historic powers and expressly left untouched by Title I.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508214\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/89/\">\n    529 U.S. at 107-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508214\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/89/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (For tanker safety \"there is no beginning assumption that concurrent regulation by the State is a valid exercise of its police powers,\" in contrast to \"Title I of that Act\" where there is \"the historic role of the States to regulate local ports and waters under appropriate circumstances\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-709\">\n   The express savings clause for stricter state regulations covering on-shore transfer facilities makes this an easier call. The PWSA creates legal duties specifying how a company must construct and operate a transfer facility, including a VCU, if it wishes to transfer crude oil onto tankers. The Ordinance prohibits the loading of crude oil, and new construction of any more of those structures. The Ordinance does not mandate any conduct that conflicts with prohibitions established by federal law. But even if the Ordinance were a stricter safety regulation on transfer facilities, Congress expressly indicated that states and localities retained their power to enact such restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-710\">\n   On-shore state and local siting restrictions and even prohibitions on industrial activities, large structures, and pollution are quintessential examples of the use of historic police powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huron Portland Cement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165132\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/440/#p442\">\n    362 U.S. at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165132\" index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/440/#p442\">\n    80 S.Ct. 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Legislation designed to free from pollution the very air that people breathe clearly falls within the exercise of even the most traditional concept of what is compendiously known as the police power\"). Those powers are only to be displaced by clear congressional intent.

The City argues that crude oil from North Dakota will flow down Line 9, and the Ordinance would apply with equal force to that crude oil as it does to crude oil originating in Alberta.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 163-64. It applies with equal force to crude oil headed to Philadelphia as it does to crude oil destined for Europe.

It is true that state law must yield to the needs of a uniform federal maritime law when this Court finds inroads on a harmonious system. But this limitation still leaves the States a wide scope. State-created liens are enforced in admiralty. State remedies for wrongful death and state statutes providing for the survival of actions, both historically absent from the relief offered by the admiralty, have been upheld when applied to maritime causes of action. Federal courts have enforced these statutes. State rules for the partition and sale of ships, state laws governing the specific performance of arbitration agreements, state laws regulating the effect of a breach of warranty under contracts of maritime insurance-all these laws and others have been accepted as rules of decision in admiralty cases, even, at times, when they conflicted with a rule of maritime law which did not require uniformity ...

The First Circuit reasoned that there was a federal interest in limiting the available remedies to unburden maritime commerce but upheld the Rhode Island law because the State interest \"in avoiding pollution in its navigable waters and on its shores, and in redressing injury to its citizens from such pollution, is a weighty one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844511\" index=\"585\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/623/#p627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844511\" index=\"585\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/623/#p627\">\n    at 629-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-761\">\n   Applying this caselaw to the Ordinance, the Court concludes the Ordinance is not preempted under\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. First, the Court notes that PPLC can point to no case under\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   striking down a local restriction on the loading or unloading of a particular good, or prohibiting new on-shore structures. The Ordinance simply does not resemble the compensation laws, damages rules, or tort causes of action that courts analyzed for possible\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   \"harmony and uniformity\" conflict with maritime law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-762\">\n   Second, the federal interest in uniformity is weak here. The Ordinance restricts on-shore facilities and conduct, and therefore, only incidentally affects a tanker during the narrow window of time in which it is docked in the Harbor. The Ordinance does not regulate the activity of tankers and sailors at sea. There is no indication that the federal government has sought to remove local control over the siting of on-shore structures like docks and transfer facilities. Numerous coastal localities restrict or entirely prohibit these structures for environmental, health, or aesthetic reasons.\n   <em>\n    See e.g. Defs.' Mot.\n   </em>\n   at 25 (discussing prohibitions in other Maine localities). There is a federal interest in the flow of maritime commerce, but PPLC does not cite any cases suggesting this has ever given vessels unrestricted access to any stretch of shoreline for any purpose they wish. Any ban on goods or conduct within a coastal jurisdiction will affect maritime vessels by prohibiting them from unloading or loading that good or participating in that conduct while docked. But this broad an interpretation of maritime preemption under\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   would \"push the line shoreward\" and \"engulf everything\" historically left to coastal jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Askew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10326\" index=\"586\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/325/\">\n    411 U.S. at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10326\" index=\"587\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/325/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-763\">\n   Third, the local interests are particularly strong here.

The City claims the ultimate effect of the Ordinance is not to block pipeline reversal because crude can be exported by other means, including by rail. PPLC maintains the practical and intended effect is to block its plan for pipeline reversal and therefore block the flow of Canadian oil to other markets.

If this threshold is not met, summary judgment in favor of the defendant is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-803\">\n   Applying these standards to this case, the Court concludes that PPLC failed to meet its burden of showing it was \"treated differently than others similarly situated\" by the City or the Ordinance. The Ordinance's provisions are generally applicable to any entity seeking to load crude oil or build new structures associated with that activity. The record does not clarify whether there are other oil terminal operators operating in the City to which the Ordinance would apply. For the Court to find a violation of equal protection, PPLC as the proponent would have to supply the factual underpinnings for its claim. Here, on that point, the record is at best unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-804\">\n   In any event, even if the Ordinance did make a distinction between similarly situated entities, PPLC's \"class of one\" claim fails because there is no evidence in the record of bad-faith, malicious intent, gross abuse of power, retaliation, or ill-will against PPLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    301\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-805\">\n   Even if PPLC could survive these initial hurdles, the Court concludes that rational basis review would apply. Rational basis scrutiny applies in \"class of one\" cases, and PPLC's argument that strict scrutiny applies because the Ordinance is \"anti-Canadian\" is unavailing. While there is a potential dispute in the dormant Commerce Clause context regarding impermissible intent to inhibit commerce from Canada based on extraterritorial environmental concerns, there is no suggestion the City sought to discriminate against PPLC as a Canadian entity. To the contrary, the Councilor who spoke directly about Canada explicitly denied any anti-Canadian bias.\n   <em>\n    See Tom Blake Remarks\n   </em>\n   DSAMF \u00b6 287; PRDSAMF \u00b6 287 (\"This is not about Canada; this is not about America. This is about the health and the safety of our community. I don't care if this crude comes from Timbuktu ... I support Canada and many things they do....\"). At the same time, the City Councilors expressed significant concern about the tar sands method of extracting oil and its impact on the environment in general, and the record reveals that PPLC intended to pump oil from Montreal, some of which was produced using this method of extraction. Nevertheless, for purposes of the \"anti-Canadian\" argument, there is a difference between challenging oil that comes from tar sands and oil that comes from Canada. The City Councilors who spoke to this issue were concerned with the former, not the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-806\">\n   Under the deferential rational basis scrutiny, a locality has legitimate interests in aesthetics, controlling development, and preventing new sources of air pollution. A ban on loading oil is rationally related to that goal, because, as the City contends, loading oil expels the volume of air inside the tank that has become saturated with hydrocarbons and creates pollution from these vapors, while unloading does not produce this pollution. Therefore, even if PPLC had presented evidence sufficient to clear the initial hurdles of an equal protection claim, it would fail under the deferential scrutiny that applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-807\">\n   Accordingly, the City is entitled to summary judgment on the equal protection issue of Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-808\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The Plan instructs the City:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-817\">\n   to promote future development in harmony with ... a diverse mixed-use waterfront community; a green city that protects its air quality; an education community where schools and a waterfront college campus are not impacted by incompatible adjacent uses, including new or expanded sources of significant air pollution; and a city that is a desirable destination and a desirable, livable community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-818\">\n   PSMF \u00b6 148(a). Regarding waterfront industrial facilities, including PPLC's terminal and tank farm, the comprehensive plan instructs the City that \"[i]n the longer term, if demand for these facilities declines or the type of activity needs to change and the owners of these facilities desire to explore other uses for these facilities, the City, in conjunction with the owners, should reevaluate the best use of these waterfront sites.\"\n   <em>\n    Plan\n   </em>\n   at Section 6(B)(4) and 6(B)(6)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-819\">\n   The City could have rationally concluded the Ordinance was in harmony with these goals and instructions. It is undisputed that demand for PPLC's facilities has declined. The City could have concluded it was free to take steps to prevent new sources of air pollution and the construction\n   of new facilities, like seventy-foot VCUs, that might adversely affect the \"desirab[ility]\" of its waterfront community and its specific development goals for a \"diverse mixed-use waterfront\" and a \"green city.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-820\">\n   Other specific statements in the Plan are not to the contrary. There is language about a \"development-minded atmosphere,\" areas where \"the City wants growth and development to occur,\" and goal statements that the City wishes to \"retain and grow existing South Portland businesses.\"\n   <em>\n    See e.g. Plan\n   </em>\n   at Section 5(B), 6(D)(1). The Plan also indicates that in the Shipyard Development District \"the City's development regulations should continue to allow existing marine and oil facilities to upgrade or expand on parcels that are already used for this purpose\" and that in Marine Industrial Areas, \"[i]n the short term, the City's marine terminals and related marine industrial areas are maintained and improved while minimizing their impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7954646\" index=\"721\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/451/308/#p312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 6(B)(4). While these statements and goals exhibit some tension with the goals and effects of the Ordinance, they are not so inconsistent as to invalidate the Ordinance.

The DEP findings in the License focus on technical safety compliance, not zoning considerations about compatible uses and air emissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. There is no indication in the statute that the State intended to remove local home rule authority over facility siting and use prohibitions through these DEP licenses certifying compliance with the safety procedures and inspection requirements. The statute repeatedly refers\n   to these DEP decisions as \"licenses\" and not as \"orders.\" The only other places in the statute where the term \"order\" is used are the following: \"the commissioner may issue a clean-up order\" following a prohibited discharge; 38 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 548, 550 ; the Governor may issue \"orders\" in emergency situations;\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 547; a vessel may be detained for violating an \"order\" of the board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-836\">\n   The Court concludes that for purposes of preemption, the Legislature did not intend the \"licenses\" specifically described throughout the statute to be \"orders\" preempting further local restriction. If the licenses had the preemptive effect PPLC claims, there is virtually no room for local regulation in this realm at all, since every single transfer facility must have a license. This result would directly contradict the express savings clause in section 556, which contemplates local restrictions in addition to the state conditions imposed through the licenses. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that it is not impossible to comply with both the Ordinance and the License. The License certifies that PPLC's transfer equipment complies with the state requirements on transfer operations, either to unload or load oil products. The Ordinance only permits loading or unloading of refined oil, and unloading crude oil. It is not impossible to operate in compliance with both. There might be a \"direct conflict\" if the DEP affirmatively ordered PPLC to conduct loading operations and the Ordinance prohibited those operations, but that is not the situation here. The stated purposes of the state law and the Ordinance are also consistent with one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-837\">\n   Finally, the conclusion that PPLC's license does not preempt the City's power to prohibit loading and new transfer structures is consistent with Maine caselaw.

The DEP was to make \"adequate provision for fitting the proposed solid waste facility harmoniously into the existing natural environment and the proposed solid waste facility will not unreasonably adversely affect existing uses, scenic character, air quality, water quality or other natural resources.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unsurprisingly, the Supreme Judicial Court decided this \"comprehensive regulatory scheme\" preempted local zoning prohibitions.\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183097\" index=\"738\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/760/257/\">\n    2000 ME 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183097\" index=\"739\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/760/257/\">\n    760 A.2d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It was rebuffed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-848\">\n    Instead, the parties presented the Court with a highly contentious, voluminous record. The Court dutifully trudged through and ruled on over three hundred objections to purportedly undisputed statements of material fact. In its initial filing, PPLC proposed 197 supposedly undisputed statements of material fact; the City admitted only twenty-six of them. In its initial filing, the City proposed 179 supposedly undisputed statements of material fact; PPLC admitted only sixty-nine of them. PPLC proposed sixty additional statements of supposedly undisputed fact; the City admitted twelve. The City proposed 111 additional statements of supposedly undisputed material facts; PPLC admitted seventy. In sum, despite Local Rule 56(b), which requires the parties to submit only facts \"as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried,\" D. ME. LOC. R. 56(b), the parties submitted a total of 547 statements of supposedly undisputed material facts of which 370 are disputed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-849\">\n    To give a concrete example, the ownership of PPLC is a demonstrable fact, but it provoked the following exchange. The City included a statement asserting that one of three parent companies of PPLC is Imperial Oil Limited, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation. DSAMF \u00b6 203. PPLC denied this statement as unsupported by the record. PRDSAMF \u00b6 203. To support its paragraph, the City cited portions of the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of PPLC. DSAMF \u00b6 203 (citing\n    <em>\n     Third Decl. of Jesse Harlan Alderman, Esq. in Support of Defs.' Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. for Summ.

Three Canadian companies-Shell Canada Limited, Suncor Energy Inc., and Imperial Oil Limited-in turn are the sole owners of MPLL.\" PSMF \u00b6 7. Strangely, the City denied this paragraph, stating that it \"lacked specific knowledge to admit or deny PPLC's ownership,\" a denial which itself is improper. DRPSMF \u00b6 7. Then, the City went on to state that it \"understand[s] that the ultimate parents of PPLC are ExxonMobil Corporation, Shell, and Suncor.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"356534\" index=\"750\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/768/5/#p11\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-856\">\n    Piecing together the statements and the supporting material in the record, the Court concludes (1) that MPLL is a Canadian corporation; (2) that MPLL, a Canadian corporation, is the sole owner of PPLC, (3) that Shell Canada Limited, Suncor Energy Inc., and Imperial Oil Limited are the sole owners of MPLL, and (4) that Imperial is the Canadian subsidiary of ExxonMobil.

PPLC denies this statement, citing other evidence that tugboats do in fact assist self-propelled tankers as they navigate in the harbor. PRDSAMF \u00b6 213.

In contrast, these statements have no bearing other than for their truthfulness about the real market demand from refineries in other U.S. ports, which is the proper subject of expert testimony or at least requires a foundation.
