Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Millennium is a natural gas transportation company that owns and operates an interstate natural gas pipeline system extending across southern New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 9. Several years ago, Millennium was contracted to build a 7.8-mile pipeline (the \"Pipeline Project\") connecting its interstate system with an electric power generation facility (the \"Valley Energy Center\") that is currently under construction in Orange County, New York.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. The Valley Energy Center, which is being built by CPV Valley, LLC (\"CPV\"), is expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 650,000 homes, while reducing New York electricity costs by more than $400 million per year and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly a half-million tons per year.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 2015, Millennium submitted an application to the FERC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, which was required in order to begin construction of the Pipeline Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-3. Later that month, Millennium submitted a Joint Application to NYSDEC for certification under Section 401 of the CWA, as well as two permits under New York State Environmental Conservation Law (\"ECL\"): a stream disturbance permit and a freshwater wetlands permit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-4. In December 2015 and June 2016, NYSDEC sent notices to Millennium requesting additional information related to its Joint Application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 38. In November 2016, the FERC provisionally granted Millennium's application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity so long as certain conditions were met, including approval of the Section 401 certification by NYSDEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-7 at 56. The FERC conditions did not require that Millennium receive stream disturbance or freshwater wetlands permits from NYSDEC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After receiving FERC's provisional approval for the Pipeline Project, Millennium wrote to NYSDEC requesting a decision on its Joint Application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 43. According to Millennium, NYSDEC had one year to make a decision on the Joint Application from the time it was first submitted in November 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. But NYSDEC argued that it had one year from the date that Millennium's Joint Application was fully submitted-according to NYSDEC, it was not fully submitted until August 2016, when Millennium responded to NYSDEC's final request for additional information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24-1 at 8. Millennium disagreed and petitioned the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit seeking a declaration either requiring NYSDEC to render a decision or stating that NYSDEC had waived its right to make a decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. The D.C. Circuit dismissed the petition, stating that Millennium should first have sought a declaration from the FERC, and that any adverse FERC decision could then be appealed to the D.C. Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millennium Pipeline Co., L.L.C. v. Seggos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276274\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/696/#p701\">\n    860 F.3d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 701 (D.C. Cir. 2017). In July 2017, Millennium followed the D.C. Circuit's suggestion and asked the FERC to declare that the NYSDEC had waived its section 401 authority because it failed to render a decision on Millennium's Joint Application within one year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In August 2017, the NYSDEC denied Millennium's Joint Application for the Section 401 certificate, as well as the stream disturbance and freshwater wetlands permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-10. NYSDEC also sent the FERC a motion to reopen the review of Millennium's application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 19-9. FERC did not reopen the application; instead, on September 17, 2017, FERC issued an order declaring NYSDEC waived its authority to deny Millennium's Section 401 certification by failing to render a decision within one year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 45. In response, NYSDEC petitioned the Second Circuit for a writ of prohibition, arguing that it did not waive its Section 401 authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-3503 (2d Cir.). Meanwhile, Millennium petitioned the Second Circuit to review NYSDEC's denial of the Section 401 certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millennium Pipeline Co., L.L.C. v. N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conserv.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-3465 (2d Cir.). Both of those petitions are currently pending before the Second Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 27, 2017, the FERC issued a Notice to Proceed with Construction, which authorized Millennium to begin construction on the Pipeline Project without a Section 401 certificate from NYSDEC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-17. After FERC refused to stay the Notice to Proceed, NYSDEC petitioned the Second Circuit for an emergency stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-3503 (2d Cir.). On November 2, 2017, the Second Circuit granted an administrative stay pending consideration of the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276274\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/696/#p701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 35 (2d Cir. Nov. 2, 2017). On December 7, 2017, after expedited briefing and oral argument, the Second Circuit denied NYSDEC's request for an emergency stay and dissolved the administrative stay preventing Millennium from beginning construction of the Pipeline Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276274\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/696/#p701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 95 (2d Cir. Dec. 7, 2017). Which brings us to the proceedings before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 27, 2017, Millennium filed the complaint in this action, which seeks to\n   prevent NYSDEC from enforcing state law in an attempt to prevent the construction of the Pipeline Project. Essentially, Millennium brought this case in the Northern District to ensure that there would be no additional obstacle to construction of the Pipeline Project if and when the Second Circuit lifted the stay. In particular, Millennium seeks an injunction from the Court preventing NYSDEC from using the stream disturbance and freshwater wetlands permits-which, along with the Section 401 certification, were a part of the Joint Application that was denied by NYSDEC-to prevent Millennium from proceeding with construction. According to Millennium, it is critical that construction proceeds immediately. A certain portion of construction and tree clearing must be complete by December 31, 2017, in order to avoid jeopardizing a bald eagles nest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-1 at 10. If construction is not completed by December 31, 2017, Millennium may have to delay construction until November 2018, which would prevent Millennium from delivering gas to the Valley Energy Center until late 2018 or early 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276274\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/696/#p701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additional tree clearing must be completed by March 31, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-21 at \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 15, 2017, Millennium filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18. Millennium seeks a preliminary injunction \"enjoining the Defendants from enforcing any state permitting requirements in a manner that would delay or interfere with construction or operation of the Valley Lateral Project Pipeline approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276274\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/696/#p701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants oppose the motion and filed a cross-motion to dismiss. Defendants argue that the complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Alternatively, Defendants argue that even if Millennium has standing, it has failed to meet the heightened standard necessary to establish the need for a preliminary injunction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The question is whether Millennium is seeking review of a \"State administrative agency acting pursuant to Federal law\" in this case. The Court finds that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Second Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to review NYSDEC's rejection of Millennium's application for Section 401 certification because it was an action \"pursuant to federal law\"-collateral review of that action is not available in this Court. But this case does not challenge NYSDEC's denial of the Section 401 certification; Millennium has filed a separate petition in the Second Circuit challenging that denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millennium Pipeline Co., L.L.C. v. N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-3465 (2d Cir.). Here, Millennium challenges NYSDEC's authority to independently stop construction of the Pipeline Project through denial of state permits, particularly the stream disturbance and freshwater wetlands permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants argue that the state permits are \"associated\" with the Section 401 certification and thus fall under the Second Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24-1 at 13. However, denials of the state permits are not \"actions pursuant to federal law\" that would trigger the Second Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction under the NGA. With a few clear exceptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the NGA generally preempts state laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Constitution Pipeline Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263767\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/87/#p100\">\n    868 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One of these exceptions is a state's authority under the CWA to deny Section 401 certification because of a potential project's failure to comply with that state's environmental laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (\"No license or permit shall be granted if [Section 401] certification has been denied by the State ....\"). States may deny Section 401 certification based on state environmental standards that have been approved by the EPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Constitution Pipeline Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263767\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/87/#p100\">\n    868 F.3d at 100-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Section 401 certification provides a mechanism for states to enforce their environmental standards when evaluating potential natural gas pipelines, but states are preempted from independently enforcing those standards through the denial of state permits. Therefore, NYSDEC's rejection of the Section 401 certification was \"an action pursuant to federal law\"; its rejection of the stream disturbance and freshwater wetlands permits was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants also argue that even if its review of the stream disturbance and freshwater wetlands permits would not normally be an action pursuant to federal law, it was transformed into an action pursuant to federal law by instructions from the FERC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24-1 at 13-14. When FERC issued its environmental assessment of the Pipeline Project, it concluded that the project \"would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\" Dkt. No. 18-6 at 125. According to NYSDEC, that conclusion was contingent on Millennium complying with applicable state permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24-1 at 6. Thus, Defendants argue, the denial of those permits was transformed into an action pursuant to federal law. But while Defendants cite to examples of state permits being referenced in the FERC's environmental assessment, Defendants do not cite any portion of the environmental assessment stating that Millennium would be required to obtain state permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263767\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/87/#p100\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the FERC's provisional Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity-the approval that is required before construction may begin-does not state that Millennium would be required to obtain state permits. In an appendix, the FERC noted that its approval was contingent on Millennium meeting a series of environmental conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-7 at 53. It is clearly stated that Millennium would be required to show \"that it has received all authorizations required under federal law,\" but the state permits do not appear in the list of environmental conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because the denial of the stream disturbance and freshwater wetlands permits was not an action pursuant to federal law, this case does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Second Circuit.

In\n   <em>\n    Constitution Pipeline\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was a pipeline company seeking to build a 100-mile natural gas pipeline in New York State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.

After the plaintiff received a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the FERC, NYSDEC issued a letter denying Section 401 certification but did not render a decision on the state permits, which they left pending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

The court found that there was no injury in fact because the NYSDEC had already denied the Section 401 certification and that denial prevented the plaintiff from moving forward with construction, regardless of the status of the state permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Moreover, the permits had not yet been denied.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court found that the plaintiff's \"complaint [did] not allege an actual or imminent injury, but rather a 'purely hypothetical case in which the projected harm may ultimately fail to occur.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Baur v.

Now that the Second Circuit has dissolved the administrative stay and denied NYSDEC's motion for an emergency stay, the denied state permits are the only impediment to construction of the Pipeline Project. Second, the state permits were actually denied in this case, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Constitution Pipeline\n   </em>\n   they were still pending. New York State Environmental Conservation Law is clear that the denial of stream disturbance or freshwater wetlands permits acts as a bar to construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.Y.E.C.L. \u00a7 15-0501 (\"Except as provided [herein], no person or public corporation shall change, modify or disturb the course, channel or bed of any stream ... without a permit issued pursuant to subdivision 3 of this section\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9297452\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/352/625/#p632\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24-0701 (\"After issuance of the official freshwater wetlands map of the state ... any person desiring to conduct on freshwater wetlands as so designated thereon any of the regulated activities set forth in subdivision two of this section must obtain a permit as provided in this title\"). Therefore, NYSDEC's denial of those permits means that Millennium is barred from beginning construction of the Pipeline Project under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   NYSDEC argues that Millennium's injury is still speculative because NYSDEC has not yet taken a position on whether it will enforce the denial of the state law permits and prohibit construction of the Pipeline Project.

No. 18-1 at 21. First, there is a bald eagle nest that was discovered in the vicinity of the Pipeline Project, and Millennium must complete all construction activities within 660 feet of the nest by December 31, 2017, due to United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\") restrictions relating to bald eagle nesting season.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

The Second Circuit has found a heightened standard appropriate where: \"(i) an injunction is 'mandatory,' or (ii) the injunction 'will provide the movant with substantially all the relief sought and that relief cannot be undone even if the defendant prevails at a trial on the merits.' \"\n   <em>\n    N.Y. ex rel.

In this case, however, the Court finds that the potential harm to CPV is relevant to the irreparable harm analysis. Here, the fate of CPV is closely tied to the fate of Millennium; a delay that pushes CPV into bankruptcy could imperil the entire project and thus impact Millennium.

Bason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11434019\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/507/#p521\">\n    303 F.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521 (4th Cir. 2002). Second, Defendants argue that construction will cause significant environmental harm-including seventeen water bodies, twenty-five wetlands, and various trees and shrubs-and that permanent environmental damage outweighs temporary economic damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24-1 at 23 (citing\n   <em>\n    League of Wilderness Defenders/Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308984\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/755/#p767\">\n    752 F.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (9th Cir. 2014) ). But the proposed pipeline is just 7.8 miles long and Defendants have not shown that it would cause sufficient\n   environmental damage to outweigh the harm that would be caused by a delay in construction. Additionally, FERC has outline specific environmental conditions that Millennium must comply with in order to begin construction on the Pipeline Project, and FERC has found that the project \"would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" if Millennium abides by those conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-7 at 53-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, the public interest would not be disserved by granting an injunction. If construction of the Pipeline Project is delayed until November 2018, the operation of the Valley Energy Center will also be delayed, which will come at a significant cost to the public. By displacing the older sources of power generation that are currently available, the Valley Energy Center is projected to save ratepayers an estimated $730 million per year and decrease CO2 emissions in the region by approximately a half-million tons per year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18-22 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to their environmental concerns, Defendants argue that it would not serve the public interest to allow Millennium to proceed with construction before Defendants' arguments regarding Section 401 certification are heard before a court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24-1 at 22. But all of the contested issues relating to the Section 401 certification are before the Second Circuit, not this Court. The Second Circuit has already considered the question whether construction should be allowed to proceed while issues relating to the Section 401 certification are being litigated, and the Second Circuit denied NYSDEC's motion for an emergency stay of construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
