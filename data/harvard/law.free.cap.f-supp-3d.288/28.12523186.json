As recounted above, the D.C. Circuit has ordered the FCC \"to give petitioners an opportunity to seek to negotiate a cure for the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control the FCC found that DISH exercises over them.\"\n   <em>\n    SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266660,12266671\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/1021/\">\n    868 F.3d at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, one of the following two scenarios will occur.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , after re-auctioning of licenses that Defendants did not retain, Defendants will pay the United States the difference between the bid and re-auction prices.\n   <em>\n    Or second\n   </em>\n   , the FCC proceedings will result in a restructuring of the agreements between DISH and the defendants, curing the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control the FCC found, and Defendants will be able to purchase the licenses at the original Auction price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266660,12266671\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/1021/\">\n    868 F.3d at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that opportunity-to-cure remedy was consistent with FCC precedent where it gave \"small companies a chance to modify their contractual agreements with large investors, in an effort to give the small companies enough independence to satisfy the FCC\" such that they would qualify for bidding credits). Relator insists that regardless of whether Defendants pay the government back, damages will still be present because the reverse false claim occurred when Northstar allegedly underpaid for the bidding contracts, an act that would be unaffected by subsequent contractual renegotiations between Northstar and DISH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    United States v.

This is an issue for another day. The important point, for purposes of the stay, is that in either scenario, Defendants will have paid in full the amount that they were properly required to pay for the licenses. Consequently, the FCC proceedings are unlikely to have any effect on the amount of money\n   <em>\n    remaining due to the government\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, from a factual standpoint, the amount of money that the government has been deprived of is settled. In Defendants' view, the government has been paid in full. In Relator's view, because the original $3.3 billion in bidding credits must be trebled, substantial damages remain even if Defendants pay in full. The ossification of this factual issue counsels in favor of denying a further stay.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nonetheless, other prudential factors do counsel in favor of waiting for the FCC proceedings to unfurl. To the extent the FCC decides that Defendants\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   cure, and to the extent this means\n   <em>\n    they could have cured had they been given the opportunity to do so\n   </em>\n   , and to the extent the FCC was\n   <em>\n    required to provide this opportunity\n   </em>\n   , Defendants may be in a stronger litigating position on a motion to dismiss with respect to liability and damages. Further guidance from the FCC on these issues would also be of assistance to the Court in ruling on a motion to dismiss. The benefit of this guidance, however, is not without its temporal limits. Relator asserts that a further stay \"inevitably will prejudice Relator's presentation of its case\" and result in \"a material and irreparable financial loss on both the United States and Relator.\" Rel.'s Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Extend Stay and in Supp. of Rel.'s Mot. to Set Deadlines for Resp. to Compl. and Briefing\n   Schedule, ECF No. 56, at 11-12. As before, because Relator's position assumes a fully favorable outcome at such an early stage in the proceedings, the burdens Relator may suffer from a further stay remain highly speculative, although certainly not non-existent. Conversely, Defendants suggest that the administrative proceedings before the FCC could \"substantially impact the nature of this matter\" and \"the outcome of the FCC proceedings could provide additional grounds to dismiss this matter altogether.\" Defs.' Mot. to Extend Court-Ordered Stay Pending Further Administrative Proceedings, ECF No. 54, at 6-7. The Court agrees that denying a stay of proceedings in this action before the FCC proceedings are completed could prejudice Defendants in crafting a motion to dismiss, and if the FCC proceedings are completed subsequent to the filing of the parties' responsive pleadings, the parties may seek to amend their pleadings and engage in supplemental motion practice, which would strain judicial resources. Nonetheless, the longer this case remains stayed, the less the benefit of delay outweighs the burden on Relator. Consequently, the uncertainty surrounding the length of the administrative proceedings counsels against granting an indefinite stay pending the conclusion of those proceedings.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rather, the Court shall adopt an alternative suggested by Defendants. Defendants' Reply Memorandum alternatively suggested an intermediate remedy, namely, that the parties provide the court with a status update every 90 days after the deadline for which the parties have to seek\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review of the D.C. Circuit's opinion. Defs.' Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Extend Court-Ordered Stay, and Mem. in Opp'n to VTel's Mot. to Set Deadlines, ECF No. 57, at 7. As discussed above, this matter shall be stayed for an additional 90 days from the issuance of the D.C. Circuit mandate, until January 22, 2018, or until the FCC proceedings conclude, whichever is earlier. If the FCC proceedings remain ongoing, the parties shall file a Joint Status Report on January 22, 2018, updating the Court on the status of those proceedings, and when they are likely to conclude. At that time, Defendants may request a further stay of proceedings for 90 days, but their position must be justified in terms of the likelihood of FCC proceedings concluding in the near future, and of those proceedings having a substantial impact on the motion practice in this case. Absent substantial justification, the Court is disinclined to further delay this matter.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">\n<strong>\n    III.
