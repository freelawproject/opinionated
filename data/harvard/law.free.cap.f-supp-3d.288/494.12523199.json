(Docket No. 52). Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss (and a supplement) under rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Docket Nos. 53; 72).

Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs were correctional officers at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 52 at 4-5). While they were employed, in February 2013, a fellow guard was murdered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. A day later, the FBI interviewed Plaintiffs and transported them and their families to a safe house somewhere in Puerto Rico, and later, to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Once in the United States, Plaintiffs moved with their families to locations where friends or relatives lived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Eventually, the Bureau of Prisons reassigned Plaintiffs to facilities at those locations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, they were assigned to work with inmates at those locations and placed in direct and imminent danger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ensuing facts provided in the complaint are presented confusingly and, fortunately, are not dispositive at this stage. The main takeaway, however, is that Plaintiffs filed administrative tort complaints between 2014-15.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12. Eventually, in March 2016, Plaintiffs filed the first of four complaints in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   If one were to print the four versions of Plaintiffs' complaint, the corresponding motions to dismiss, responses, and requests for leave to amend the complaint, the stack of papers would, as Winston Churchill once said, \"by its very length defend[ ] itself against the risk of being read.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Originally, Plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Docket No. 1). Months later, they filed the first of three amended complaints. (Docket No. 22). When Defendants replied by filing their first motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs amended their complaint again, replacing the FTCA claims with claims under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA). (Docket Nos. 23; 28; 29). In due time, Defendants moved to dismiss the CSRA claims because Plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies; the Court agreed and dismissed the CSRA count. (Docket Nos. 38; 42) When Defendants moved to dismiss the surviving\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim in a separate motion, Plaintiffs asked to amend their complaint again. (Docket Nos. 43; 47). The Court acquiesced. In the third amended complaint, Plaintiffs substituted their claims under the CSRA for claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). (Docket Nos. 51; 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thus, the third amended complaint asserts claims under the APA and\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs allege that the APA allows them to seek judicial review for the decision to transfer them from the MDC to other prisons without adequate notice. (Docket No. 52 at 15). In their second count, Plaintiffs allege that\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   entitles them to recover damages for Defendants' negligence\n   for failing to consider the threats they received, as well as the health problems that arose as a result.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For the third time, Defendants move to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.

Plaintiffs also concede that the CSRA governs their claims. (Docket No. 26 at 1 (\"Defendant alleges that Plaintiffs' claims under the Federal Torts Claims Act are preempted by the Civil Service Reform Act. We agreed [sic].\")).

Plaintiffs are not entitled to circumvent their failure to prosecute their case under the CSRA by bringing a claim under the APA.

In\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit rejected an attempt to sue coworkers and supervisors-federal employees-in their individual capacities under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Addressing plaintiffs' discrimination claims, the First Circuit explained that \"the CSRA and Title VII, with their regulatory accoutrements, form a comprehensive remedial network fully capable of protecting federal employees against acts of discrimination in the workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. Thus, when the CSRA provides an adequate remedy \"[t]here is no justification for implying a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   -type remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiffs concede that the CSRA applies. To their misfortune, they failed to adequately prosecute the CSRA claims. But this \"accident\" does not entitle them to relief under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   because it does not defeat the fact that an adequate remedy existed under the CSRA, a dispositive factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 53 (even assuming the case does not apply\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to a new context, \"plaintiffs hit a roadblock at the next step of the analysis, that is, whether there exists an alternative process that Congress reasonably may have viewed as an equally effective surrogate for an action brought directly under the Constitution,\" in this case the CSRA). Therefore, Plaintiffs' second claim is also\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Articles 1802 and 1803\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims under Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code are dismissed as well. \"[A] plaintiff may only pursue an Article 1802 claim when it is based on 'tortious or negligent conduct distinct from that covered by the specific laws invoked, or which have an independent basis to support them.' \"\n   <em>\n    Irizarry v.

Jan. 21, 2016). An 1803 claim asserts the same conduct but holds superiors accountable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Here Plaintiffs base their Article 1802 and 1803 claims on tortious conduct that they allege is covered by the APA and\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   . Therefore it is not \"conduct distinct from that covered by the specific laws invoked.\" Nor do Plaintiffs have \"an independent basis to support [their 1802 and 1803]\" because the CSRA establishes the exclusive remedy for the type of conduct that Plaintiffs are suing for.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres-Medina v.
