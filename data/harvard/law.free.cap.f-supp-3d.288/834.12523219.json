Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals, alleges that Defendant violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (\"BIPA\"), 740 ILCS 14/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and is liable for negligence. Plaintiff seeks (1) a declaratory judgment that Defendant violated BIPA and acted negligently; (2) injunctive and other equitable relief as is necessary to protect the interests of the class, including an order requiring Defendant to collect, store, and use biometric identifiers or biometric information in compliance with BIPA; (3) statutory damages under BIPA, as well as attorneys' fees and costs; (4) pre- and post-judgment interest, and (5) any other relief that the Court deems reasonable and just. Defendant contends that the time-clock in issue does not collect or store an employee's fingerprint or any other biometric identifier or biometric information to establish any statutory liability under the BIPA on behalf of Plaintiff or a purported class. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff cannot succeed on his claims because he has not suffered any injury and is therefore not a \"person aggrieved\" by a violation of the BIPA, and cannot succeed on a claim for negligence under Illinois law. Defendant has further set forth several affirmative defenses, including but not limited to the statute of limitations, equitable doctrine of laches, equitable doctrines of estoppel, waiver,\n   ratification and/or acquiescence, assumption of the risk, good faith and substantial compliance and superseding/intervening causes in connection with Plaintiff's knowledge of, implicit consent to and continued use of the time-clock in issue during the course of his employment with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 2, 2017, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). R. 16. On November 6, 2017, Defendant moved to withdraw its motion to dismiss and sought leave to file an amended version raising only Rule 12(b)(6) arguments for dismissal. R. 22. The Court granted that motion on November 8, 2017. R. 26. On November 22, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion to remand the case to state court. R. 29. Briefing on Plaintiff's motion to remand was completed on December 15, 2017. For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's motion to remand is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue before the Court is whether Defendant's removal of this class action lawsuit from state court was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The removal statute states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States\n   <em>\n    have original jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   , may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).

According to Defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [T]he fatal flaw in Plaintiff's argument is that the Article III standing issue has not been agreed upon and remains undecided. In particular, this Court may determine from the case-specific allegations of Plaintiff's Complaint that Plaintiff has established standing under Article III. Alternatively, this Court may determine that Plaintiff is entitled to amend his Complaint or that later resolution of the Article III standing issue is more appropriate than determining such issue at the dismissal stage.

In other words, Defendant's post-withdrawal position is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   that the Court lacks Article III case or controversy jurisdiction; instead, Defendant argues only that it remains to be seen whether the Court has jurisdiction under Article III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The problem with this position is that Defendant's \"wait and see\" approach negates the basis on which it filed its removal petition.
