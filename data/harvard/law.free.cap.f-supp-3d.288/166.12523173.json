In the underlying arbitration (\"the Arbitration\"), petitioners alleged that Costa Rica's decision to expropriate their beachside properties-and thus deprive them of their residential real estate property investments-violated the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (\"CAFTA\"),\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a five-day hearing, the Arbitration Tribunal (\"the Tribunal\") issued an interim award (\"the Interim Award\" or \"the Award\") on jurisdiction, finding that it: (1) lacked jurisdiction to hear claims with regard to one of petitioners' properties; (2) had jurisdiction to hear claims with respect to two of petitioners' properties; (3) and needed more briefing on whether it had jurisdiction to hear claims regarding petitioners' two remaining properties. The Berkowitz claimants then filed a Petition to Vacate the Interim Award in this Court, pursuant to Section 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on the ground that the Tribunal exceeded its authority in issuing the Award.

The Interim Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 25, 2016, the Tribunal issued an Interim Award regarding its jurisdiction over petitioners' claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. i. In the Award, the Tribunal first noted that CAFTA imposed two temporal limitations on the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    at \u00b6 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, Article 10.3 of CAFTA holds that its provisions do not bind Costa Rica \"to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before\" Costa Rica implemented the agreement on January 1, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAFTA, art. 10.1.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4011. Second, CAFTA makes clear that \"[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration ... if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged ... and knowledge that the claimant ... has incurred loss or damage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at art. 10.18.1. The Tribunal then proceeded to assess petitioners' claims with these limitations periods in mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Tribunal first determined that the Berkowitz claimants had constructive knowledge of the expropriation of their lots as of November 27, 2006. Interim Award \u00b6\u00b6 96(c), 265. As a result, the Tribunal\n   concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear any of petitioners' expropriation claims under CAFTA Article 10.7 because the alleged expropriations occurred\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the effective date of CAFTA, and because petitioners knew about the alleged breach over three years before they sought arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 265-268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tribunal went on to conclude, however, that even if petitioners could not pursue claims under CAFTA Article 10.7 for expropriation, they could pursue claims under CAFTA Article 10.5 for violations of the minimum standard of treatment, provided that the Costa Rican judgment assessing compensation for their expropriated property was entered within the limitations period and there was evidence that the judgment was made with \"manifest arbitrariness and / or ... blatant unfairness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n    at \u00b6 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, because Costa Rica entered judgments with respect to Lots B3 and B8 in 2013 and 2012, respectively, which were both prior to the commencement of arbitration but within the limitations period, the Tribunal concluded that the Berkowitz claimants could pursue claims under CAFTA Article 10.5 for those properties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204001\">\n    at \u00b6 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Tables 10, 13.

Annex G lists the designated recipients of service and their addresses for the seven member states of CAFTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAFTA-DR, Ch. 10, \u00a7 B, Annex G.

Resp. in Opp'n to Mot. to Vacate Entry of Default [Dkt. # 24] 12. Unfortunately for petitioners, this too, proved to be ineffective service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Courts have interpreted the \"special arrangement\" language of Section 1608 narrowly, such that a special arrangement exists only where the language is \"all encompassing\" rather than \"confined to the contract or agreement at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Orange Middle E. &amp; Africa v.

May 18, 2016). The plain text of Annex G makes clear that it does not apply to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   attempts to serve Costa Rica in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   matter; instead, it is limited to communications made pursuant to the dispute settlement section of Chapter 10 of CAFTA.

As such, Annex G plainly is not an \"all encompassing\" provision that governs all communications between a claimant and a CAFTA member state. Instead, Annex G covers communications between a claimant and a CAFTA member state regarding arbitration disputes under the treaty. Annex G\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   apply to the service of judicial documents in subsequent vacatur proceedings in United States domestic courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Orange Middle E.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202894857\">\n    2016 WL 2894857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"[T]he Agreement provided for dispute resolution through ... binding arbitration[, which was] the outer limit of the [Agreement's] reach.

Similarly, in the Tribunal's letter dated April 17, 2017, the Tribunal again noted that it \"considers that it is not\n   <em>\n    functus officio\n   </em>\n   , being still seised of the dispute between the Parties.\" Letter, Apr. 17, 2017 [Dkt. # 28-4]. And in the Procedural Order, the Tribunal stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the Tribunal reached a decision on the question of its jurisdiction regarding Lot B1, it is not\n   <em>\n    functus officio\n   </em>\n   and remains seised of the matter. The decision of the Tribunal was expressly designated to be an \"interim\" award, not a \"final\" award. That Interim Award contemplated further proceedings involving all Claimants, including both the Berkowitz Claimants and Respondent. All parties thus remained subject to the arbitral jurisdiction of the Tribunal even after the Interim Award issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Procedural Order \u00b6 35.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This order makes clear that the Tribunal considered itself to be \"seised\" of the dispute, which is not surprising, given that the Interim Award merely resolved some jurisdictional issues, while expressly contemplating the Tribunal's intent to review additional evidence and assess the merits of the dispute at a later time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Award \u00b6 308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Petitioners concede that the \"Interim Award is not the ultimate, conclusive arbitral award on all claims submitted to arbitration,\" but they argue that the Interim Award was sufficiently final for this Court's review because it resolved claims as to Lots B1 and B8 and \"most claims as to Lots B3, B5, and B6.\" Pet'rs' Pet. \u00b6 42. But petitioners mischaracterize the nature of the Interim Award. In that Award, the Tribunal ruled that (1) it lacked jurisdiction to hear any claims with respect to Lot B1; (2) it had jurisdiction to hear claims relating to Lots B3 and B8 to the extent that petitioners alleged arbitrariness or unfairness under CAFTA Article 10.5; and (3) \"the Parties should be afforded an opportunity to be heard\" on whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over judgments respecting Lots B5 and B6 that were rendered after June 10, 2013. Interim Award \u00b6 308. The Interim Award also expressly\n   contemplates \"consultation with the Parties\" regarding \"further proceedings\" to allow the Tribunal to decide these remaining issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5319922\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/422/240/#p246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, the Interim Award included no final rulings as to liability or damages, but instead principally addressed questions of the Tribunal's \"jurisdiction and the justiciability of the Claimants' case under the CAFTA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 300. This language regarding \"further proceedings\" makes unequivocally clear the Tribunal's intent to adjudicate the merits of the parties' dispute upon its consideration of additional argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Therefore, because the evidence clearly demonstrates that the Tribunal did not believe that its \"assignment [was] completed,\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney Restoration\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189988\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/867/#p871\">\n    392 F.3d at 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I find that the Interim Award was not a final, appealable judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Berkowitz claimants' Petition to Vacate the Interim Arbitration Award is DENIED, and petitioners' case is DISMISSED with prejudice. A separate Order consistent with this decision accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Tribunal referred to the lots at issue by combining the first letter of the last name of the claimant and a number.

Interim Award \u00b6 5 n.7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In 2013, Brett Berkowitz gave Lots B1 and B8 to his sons, Trevor Berkowitz and Aaron Berkowitz.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189988\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/867/#p871\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 5 Table 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Brett Berkowitz also purchased Lots B2 and B4 in September of 2003, but these lots were subsequently sold to third parties and were not at issue in the Arbitration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Notice of Arbitration \u00b6 43 n.49. Similarly, Brett Berkowitz sold Lot B7 to another private individual in 2004, and thus that lot also did not feature in the Arbitration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Interim Award \u00b6 5 Table 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    This authority is available at https://www.hcch.net/en/states/authorities/details3/?aid=1068.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In its Procedural Order, the Tribunal noted that the Berkowitz claimants decided \"to withdraw their remaining claims,\" so it accordingly \"order[ed] the termination of the proceeding with respect to the Berkowitz Claimants and their remaining Lots B1, B3, B5, B6, and B8.\" Procedural Order \u00b6 46. Petitioners argue that the Tribunal's \"termination of the arbitration proceedings weighs strongly in favor of reviewing the Interim Award in this Court.\" Reply in Supp. of Pet'rs' Pet. [Dkt. # 31] 6. Petitioners take the position that the Tribunal's termination of proceedings-upon their request-rendered the Interim Award final.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189988\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/867/#p871\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But the fact that petitioners voluntarily withdrew their claims before the Tribunal-after filing their Petition for vacatur in this Court-does not transform the Interim Award into a final decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    This is especially true in light of the fact that the Corrected Award did not resolve any of the jurisdictional or merits issues still pending before the Tribunal at the time of petitioners' withdrawal of their claims. In fact, the only substantive change the Tribunal made in the Corrected Award was its finding that it\n    <em>\n     might\n    </em>\n    have jurisdiction to hear claims related to Lot B1. In this way, the Corrected Award rendered the Interim Award\n    <em>\n     less\n    </em>\n    final than it was at the time of Petitioners' filing for vacatur in this Court. At bottom, petitioners' argument on this point is nothing more than an attempt to evade the Tribunal's jurisdiction, and I find that it is unavailing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
