As to her claim under the Jones Act, which pertains to injured seamen, the Court found Grant had insufficiently pled that cause of action, but permitted her leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n    at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. She has now done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before explaining her new allegations, the Court pauses to note that, as Defendants correctly point out, the Order accompanying the prior Opinion incorrectly stated that \"[a]ll causes of action in both cases are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE, with the exception of Count II.\" ECF No. 29. The dismissal of the Jones Act claim, as the Opinion expressly noted, was actually \"\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Grant I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522594\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/114/#p116\">\n    282 F.Supp.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204675737\">\n    2017 WL 4675737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (emphasis added). As a result, Grant is clearly within her rights to seek amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her prior Amended Complaint, the heading for Count IV had included language saying, \"Pursuant to Personal Injury, U.S. Code 46 \u00a7 30104, Federal Maritime Law, Based on Negligence.\" No. 17-1410, ECF No. 16 at p. 13. The body of the count, however, said nothing about the Jones Act, which is indeed found at \u00a7 30104, or how Grant satisfied the elements of pleading such a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grant I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522594\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/114/#p116\">\n    282 F.Supp.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204675737\">\n    2017 WL 4675737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. This time around, she alters the language in the heading of Count IV, which now refers to \"U.S.C. Title 46, Appendix-Shipping, Chapter 18-Merchant Seamen (\u00a7 668), Subchapter VII-Protection and Relief, Recovery for Injury to or Death of a Seaman ... Admiralty, Maritime, and Prize Cases and General Maritime Law.\" ECF No. 33 at ECF p. 14. In addition, in the body of the count, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants behaved negligently on the April 15 cruise, thereby causing her injuries. The cruise lines contest such amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

P. 15(a)(2). In deciding whether to grant leave to file an amended complaint, courts may consider \"undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    Foman v.
