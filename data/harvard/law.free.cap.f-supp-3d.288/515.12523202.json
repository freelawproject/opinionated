Underhill, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of an insurance coverage dispute between Preferred Display, Inc. (\"PDI\"), and Great American Insurance Company of New York (\"Great American\"). The loss at issue resulted from a fire at PDI's premises, and Great American acknowledges that there is coverage for that loss. The parties' disagreement revolves around the amount payable for the loss pursuant to the terms of the Great American policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The principal issue raised by this case is whether the \"Other Insurance\" and \"Coinsurance\" clauses of the Great American policy operate in combination to cumulatively reduce the amount payable to PDI. At my suggestion, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment addressing that issue. Great American also seeks dismissal of various claims in PDI's complaint for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, I grant summary judgment in favor of PDI on the declaratory judgment and breach of contract claims (Counts One and Two) and deny in substantial part Great American's cross-motion for summary judgment, a portion of which I treat as a motion to dismiss certain of the causes of action in PDI's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In or about 2015, Great American issued its Select Business Policy (the \"Policy\") to PDI. At the relevant point in time, the Policy provided up to $4,000,000 in coverage for damage to business personal property in PDI's possession at 32 Roaring Brook Plaza, East Glasonbury, Connecticut (the \"Property\"). PDI also purchased $2,000,000 of similar insurance from The Hartford Insurance Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about November 11, 2015, during the coverage period of both policies, a fire caused damage to and destruction of PDI's business personal property located at the Property. For the purposes of this motion, the parties agree that the value of the covered property at the time of the loss was $7,907,217, and the actual cash value (\"ACV\") of the loss to PDI's covered property was $6,392,119.

Great American has taken the position that, under the terms of the Policy, it owes PDI substantially less than the $4,000,000 coverage limit of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Great American's coverage position relies on two policy provisions, namely the \"Other Insurance\" and \"Coinsurance\" clauses.

Because the amount of the loss ($6.39 million) exceeds the total insurance available from all insurers ($6 million), neither of the other insurance provisions in the Policy can operate to reduce Great American's liability to PDI below the Policy's coverage limit of $4 million. Put differently, because Great American's pro rata share of liability is calculated by the proportion its coverage limit bears to the total combined coverage limits of both policies, and because the total loss exceeds the total combined coverage limits, Great American's actual pro rata share must be higher than its coverage limit, and its liability will default down to its coverage limit. For the same reason, the amount Great American must pay PDI is not reduced even if The Hartford is required by the Policy's excess other insurance clause to pay its policy limits before Great American begins to pay: Because the loss is more than the combined policy limits of both policies, first fully subtracting The Hartford's policy limit from the amount of the loss will still leave more loss than Great American's policy limit. The order of payment in this case is therefore inconsequential and each insurer is liable for the full amount due under its policy. The example cited in COUCH to demonstrate the effect of the loss exceeding the available insurance resembles this case: \"[W]here the amount of a fire loss exceeded the total amount recoverable under two fire policies, the insured could recover the full amount of the policy from each insurer\", notwithstanding an other insurance clause in one of the policies. 15 COUCH \u00a7 219:31 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Great American's argument that the Other Insurance clause can somehow, in tandem with the Coinsurance clause or otherwise, reduce the amount it owes PDI in this case is simply wrong. As COUCH notes, other insurance clauses \"govern the relationship between insurers, they do not affect the right of the insured to recover under each concurrent policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=606%20A.2d%20990\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 219:1 (citations omitted).

Policy, Select Business Policy-Coinsurance, Form SB 87 23 (Ed. 07/02) XS at 1 (doc. # 56-5). However, because the amount payable by Great American after application of the Coinsurance clause still exceeds the $4 million Limit of Insurance under the Policy, the Coinsurance clause has no practical impact in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Coinsurance clause potentially limits Great American's exposure in this case because the value of Covered Property at the time of the loss (approx. $7.9 million), multiplied by the 80% Coinsurance percentage shown on the Declarations, results in a sum (approx. $6.3 million) that is greater than the ($4 million) Limit of Insurance for the property. The Coinsurance clause provides, therefore, that Great American will pay the lesser of the result of a calculation set forth in the clause or the $4 million Limit of Insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Specifically, the calculation called for by the Coinsurance clause has four steps:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   1. Multiply the value of Covered Property at the time of loss by the Coinsurance percentage:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   $7,907,217 \u00d7 80% = $6,325,773.60\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   2.

Multiply the total amount of loss, before application of any deductible, by the figure determined in Step 2:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   $6,392,119 \u00d7 0.6323 = $4,041,736.84\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   4.

The Coinsurance clause further provides that \"[t]he most we will pay is the amount determined in Step (4) or the Limit of Insurance, whichever is less.\" Because the $4,000,000 Limit of Insurance is less than $4,016,736.84, a straightforward application of the terms of the Coinsurance clause requires Great American to pay PDI the $4 million Limit of Insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Great American's Misguided Interpretation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Great American argues that it owes PDI only $2,680,250.23 under the terms of the Policy. It reaches that facially erroneous result by inventing an additional step for the calculation described in the Coinsurance clause: reduction of the amount payable to PDI pursuant to the Coinsurance calculation by an additional one-third, based on the unrelated Other Insurance clause. In short, Great American seeks to rewrite the terms of the Coinsurance clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Great American seeks to justify its contractual sleight of hand with two versions of the Coinsurance calculation, both of which employ numbers inappropriately modified by Great American in place of the numbers actually called for by the terms of the clause. In the first version, Great American improperly reduces by one-third\n   the \"total amount of loss\" figure used in the Step 3 calculation before applying Step 3 to multiply that incorrectly-reduced number by the figure determined in Step 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 18. In the second version, Great American properly calculates Step 3, but then, rather than heeding Step 4's instruction to use \"the figure determined in Step 3\", instead reduces the figure determined in Step 3 by one-third and uses that reduced number in the Step 4 calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply Br. at 5 (doc. # 61). Neither of the one-third reductions advocated by Great American is required-or permitted-by the terms of the Coinsurance clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Great American ineffectively justifies its distortion of the Coinsurance calculation by arguing that the Policy requires the application of the Other Insurance clause's two-thirds/one-third apportionment as part of the Coinsurance calculation,\n   <em>\n    without pointing to any language in the Policy that calls for such application\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are multiple problems with Great American's approach. Most importantly, the Coinsurance calculation does not call for the Other Insurance clause's two-thirds/one-third ratio to be used as an input in Step 3 of the calculation-it calls for the \"total amount of loss\" to be used in Step 3, before moving directly to Step 4. The policy does not define the phrase \"total amount of loss\", so it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457662\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/394/#p406\">\n    269 Conn. at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20A.2d%201165\">\n    848 A.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Throughout the Policy, the term \"loss\" refers to the damage or harm suffered by the insured, not to the amount payable to the insured under the coverage afforded by the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Policy, Cap on Losses from Certified Acts of Terrorism, Form IL 09 52 (Ed. 03/08) XS at 1 (doc. # 56-5) (\"The terms and limitations of any terrorism exclusion ... do not serve to create coverage for any loss which would otherwise be excluded ....\"; Policy, Select Business Policy Condition G.2., Form SB 86 01 (Ed. 07/02) XS at 1 (doc. # 56-5) (\"If there is other insurance covering the same loss or damage ....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plain meaning of the phrase \"total amount of loss\" must therefore be the entirety of PDI's losses, $6,392,119. It is fundamentally improper for Great American to insert an extra reduction, contrary to the plain terms of the Policy, into the Coinsurance clause calculation. If the policy were intended to operate as Great American claims, it was incumbent on Great American to write that reduction into the detailed calculation set forth in the Policy. Because the calculation depends on the \"total amount of loss\", Great American cannot simply invent a one-third reduction by either modifying the plain meaning of \"total amount of loss\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   or adding an additional step between Steps (3) and (4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In addition to clashing with the plain meaning of the Coinsurance clause, Great American's approach is also in conflict with the terms and purpose of the Other Insurance clause. As a preliminary matter, other insurance clauses are not intended to be used for the purpose advocated by Great American-other insurance provisions prioritize payouts among insurers, they do not reduce the coverage provided to the insured.\n   <em>\n    Aetna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525925\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/221/779/#p783\">\n    221 Conn. at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=606%20A.2d%20990\">\n    606 A.2d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, as Great American itself acknowledges, other insurance clauses are only valid under Connecticut law where their enforcement does not reduce the coverage available to the insured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 16 (\"[O]ther insurance clauses do not violate public policy if there is no denial or diminution of coverage.\");\n   <em>\n    Aetna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525925\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/221/779/#p783\">\n    221 Conn. at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=606%20A.2d%20990\">\n    606 A.2d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" '[O]ther insurance' clauses are valid for the purpose of establishing the order of coverage between insurers,\n   <em>\n    as long as their enforcement does not compromise coverage for the insured\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added)). That limited purpose is consistent with the recognized fact, discussed above, that other insurance clauses have no practical effect in cases like this one, where the total amount of loss exceeds the total amount of insurance, because there is nothing to apportion among multiple insurers-each must pay its full policy limits unless some other provision of the policy calls for a lesser payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put differently, if Great American wants to apply the pro rata Other Insurance clause, it must apply its two-thirds responsibility against the total loss; doing so results in Great American being responsible (before consideration of the policy limits) for more than $4 million of the more than $6 million in covered losses. Unsurprisingly, Great American can point to no language in the Other Insurance clause that suggests it should be applied to the Coinsurance calculation rather than the full loss. The plain language of the Policy and the familiar operation of pro rata other insurance clauses thus both require that the pro rata reduction be taken against total losses, not against the amount otherwise payable by\n   Great American to its insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The only decision cited by Great American in support of its contra-contractual mathematics is\n   <em>\n    Sun Ins.

Pl.'s Local Rule 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 6. The remaining $1,025,000 is being withheld by Great American as a result of the dispute regarding the application of the Other Insurance and Coinsurance provisions. PDI does not allege any facts to support a theory that PDI has been denied any benefit under the policy separate and apart from their dispute over the application of those provisions. For example, one of PDI's allegations is that Great American failed to reimburse PDI for a security service that was retained shortly after the loss at Great American's insistence. Another is that Great American improperly disregarded PDI's expert's opinion regarding the ability to restore the damaged property. Those allegations are irrelevant to whether Great American has denied a benefit under the policy (namely, the approximately $1.025 million) in bad faith because Great American's denial of that benefit is based solely on its interpretation of the Coinsurance and Other Insurance provisions. Moreover, because the loss significantly exceeded the coverage here, it does not appear that the disputes regarding the claim handling could have any material impact on the amount due to PDI. Accordingly, the remaining allegations regarding Great American's claim settlement practices do not state an independent bad faith claim and that portion of the bad faith count is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    CUTPA/CUIPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   PDI's CUTPA/CUIPA claim rests on the allegation that Great American has violated CUIPA with sufficient frequency to constitute a general business practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

The dissimilarity between this case and PDI's cited cases makes it implausible that the complained-of conduct in this case has been committed with sufficient frequency to constitute a general business practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because PDI may be able to amend the complaint to plead a sufficient CUTPA claim, however, PDI's CUTPA claim is dismissed without prejudice to filing an amended complaint within thirty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, and treating PDI's motion for partial summary judgment (doc. # 53) as a motion for summary judgment on Counts One and Two of the Amended Complaint, PDI's motion is granted; Great American's motion for summary judgment (doc. # 56) is granted in part and denied in part. Great American's motion is granted to the extent that it seeks dismissal of PDI's bad faith claim based on claim handling and PDI's CUTPA/CUIPA claims, and is denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although the parties only agreed to the facts regarding the estimated loss amount for the purposes of this motion, it appears that there are no facts that would warrant a judgment in favor of PDI on the breach of contract claim for any amount other than the balance of Great American's $4,000,000 limit of liability. Because Great American has already issued $2,975,238.61 in partial payments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Local Rule 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 6, it appears that judgment should enter in favor of PDI in the amount of $1,024,761.39 plus prejudgment interest on Count Two. If either party wishes to challenge that amount, it must file a notice of an intent to do so within fourteen (14) days of this ruling. Absent timely filing of such notice, the court will enter judgment in the amount of $1,024,761.39 plus prejudgment interest in favor of PDI as well as a declaration that it is entitled to that sum under the terms of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The parties shall meet and confer regarding appropriate deadlines for completion of discovery and filing of dispositive motions addressing the remaining claims. Within fourteen days of this ruling, they shall file a proposed scheduling order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   So ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Great American does point out that the Coinsurance clause states, in prefatory language, that it applies \"in addition to the Common Policy Conditions and the Select Business Conditions\",\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Br. at 17 (citing Policy, Select Business Policy-Coinsurance, Form SB 87 23 (Ed. 07/02) XS at 1 (doc. # 56-5)), and the Other Insurance clause is indeed one of the Select Business Conditions. However, that generic language, which merely cautions that the Coinsurance clause does not apply to the exclusion of the Other Insurance clause, does not effect the one-third reduction Great American seeks.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Most striking is the Other Insurance Condition G.1 itself, which states that, where PDI has other insurance, Great American will only \"pay [its] share of the covered loss or damage\". Form SB 86 01 (Ed. 07/02) XS at 1 (doc. # 56-5). That language shows, first, that the term \"loss\" is intended to refer to the entirety of PDI's loss, not just that portion of the loss payable to PDI by Great American. It also suggests that even the narrower phrase \"covered loss\" refers to the entirety of PDI's losses to covered property from covered causes, and does not refer more limitedly to some amount payable by Great American under the Policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Following the text of the Coinsurance clause, the Policy lists three examples that are intended to show how the Coinsurance provision applies. Notably absent from any of those examples is any suggestion that the \"total amount of loss\" should be calculated as Great American's pro rata share of responsibility with another insurer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Policy, Select Business Policy-Coinsurance, Form SB 87 23 (Ed. 07/02) XS at 1-2 (doc. # 56-5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    As implied in Section III.A,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , had the total insurance ($6,000,000) exceeded the total loss, the Other Insurance clause's stipulation that Great American only pay two-thirds of the total loss would apply to reduce Great American's liability to less than the $4,000,000 Policy limit (because two-thirds of an amount less than $6,000,000 is less than $4,000,000). Separately, in such circumstances, the Coinsurance clause would reduce the amount that Great American must pay to PDI even further-but not due to any cumulative interaction between the Other Insurance and Coinsurance clauses. For example, if the loss had been $599,999 (i.e., one dollar less than $600,000), the Other Insurance clause would ensure that Great American would owe no more than $399,999.33 (two-thirds of the total loss) while The Hartford would owe the remaining $199,999.67 (one-third of the total loss). Under those circumstances, application of the\n    <em>\n     unrelated\n    </em>\n    Coinsurance clause calculation would result in a reduction of more than $45,000 from Great American's payout, because the result from Steps (3) and (4) of the Coinsurance calculation would be $354,379.37 (Step (3): $599,999 \u00d7 0.6323 = $379,379.37; Step (4): $379,379.37 - $25,000 = $354,379.37), which is less than the $4,000,000 policy limit, and less than the $399,999 result of the Other Insurance clause, and that lower number would further cap the amount payable to the insured.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The unreasonableness of Great American's position is demonstrated by the fact that, under Great American's approach, PDI is much worse off because it purchased additional insurance from The Hartford. But for that purchase, Great American would have to concede that it owes PDI $4 million, because the Other Insurance clause could not apply to reduce the Coinsurance calculation (there being no other insurance). However, far from leveraging other insurance to penalize PDI and diminish Great American's liability, the Coinsurance clause specifically anticipates a different role for other insurance-supplementing any shortfall in coverage that results from the Coinsurance calculation: The clause provides that, where the full amount of any loss is not covered after application of the Coinsurance clause, PDI must cover the remainder with \"other insurance or absorb the loss [it]self\". Select Business Policy-Coinsurance, Form SB 87 23 (Ed. 07/02) XS at 1-2 (doc. # 56-5). Great American's interpretation of the Policy would perversely encourage PDI to purchase other insurance to fill in any shortfall in Great American's coverage, and then utilize that additional other insurance to further reduce Great American's liability to PDI.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    It is unfortunate that a leading insurance treatise has suggested the\n    <em>\n     Sun Insurance\n    </em>\n    decision stands for a broad proposition that is not supported by modern policy language and case law. Couch suggests, incorrectly in my view (and inconsistently with statements made elsewhere in the treatise), that: \"Where a policy sets forth the insurer's maximum liability in terms of a percentage of the value of the property destroyed and also has a pro rata 'other insurance' clause, the percentage liability of the insurer is further reduced.\" 15 Couch \u00a7 220:20. That result was dictated by the unusual language in the\n    <em>\n     Sun Insurance\n    </em>\n    policy, and will not generally be true. Indeed, the\n    <em>\n     Sun Insurance\n    </em>\n    decision itself implicitly recognizes that, in the absence of express policy language providing otherwise, when the loss exceeds the total amount of insurance, a pro rata clause is rendered inapplicable.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20S.W.2d%20675\">\n     90 S.W.2d at 679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Even if any of Great American's arguments were convincing, they would, at most, suggest some ambiguity concerning the intended interpretation of the Policy.
