[96] and [104]. The Third Party Defendants move to strike Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts, ECF No. [86], and its attached exhibits, apparently in their entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [96] at 1. Reliastar moves to strike three affidavits attached to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts, ECF Nos. [86-11], [86-12], and [86-13]. Reliastar argues that the Court should strike these affidavits because they contain hearsay and because they contain information outside the administrative record. Reliastar claims this contravenes the standard for review articulated in\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647633\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1350/#p1354\">\n    644 F.3d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1354 (11th Cir. 2011), which requires a deferential standard applied in claims brought under ERISA seeking review of an administrative decision denying benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Third Party Defendants, in turn, make several arguments in their motion to strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [96]. First, similar to Reliastar, they argue that under the administrative review standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the Court must strike any facts that were \"not been part of the administrative record when the decision was made,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Third Party Defendants also argue the affidavits attached to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF Nos. [86-11], [86-12], and [86-13], contain \"immaterial facts regarding intent\" and must be stricken,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3; that certain paragraphs of Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts contain inadmissible evidence and must be stricken,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4; that certain paragraphs contain more than one fact per paragraph, \"do not have separate numbering,\" and/or do not have pinpoint line numbers and must be stricken,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; and that Plaintiff failed to file\n   an index of exhibits and therefore the exhibits must be stricken,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   All of these arguments are without merit. First, as more fully explained below in the Court's analysis of the Motions for Summary Judgment,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the framework set forth in\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   does not apply here. To the extent Reliastar had the discretionary authority to determine plan benefits, here it has explicitly declined to do so and instead has filed its action in interpleader seeking judicial determination of the rightful beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moerbitz Tr. at 83 (Q: ReliaStar does not have a position one way or the other as to whether the designation form that was submitted in 2013 is sufficient, right? A: Correct). While Reliastar and Third Party Defendants urge the Court to limit its review to the administrative record, Reliastar has stated not only that the administrative record used to render its decision denying Nawal's claim was incorrect due to administrative errors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Moerbitz Tr. at 40-41, but also that it has declined to take a position on the beneficiary forms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 82-83, 120, 152. On both those bases, neither Reliastar nor the Third Party Defendants are entitled to review under\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   , and accordingly the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Reliastar's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Supporting Affidavits based on hearsay is also misplaced. \"The general rule is that inadmissible hearsay cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Reliastar argues that the affidavits, each of which is based on the personal knowledge of the affiant, should be stricken. However, it asserts no plausible arguments as to why the affiants, including Plaintiff herself, will not be available at trial, or why another hearsay exception, such as the state of mind exception as argued by Plaintiff in opposition to the motions, would not apply to the statements regarding Walid's intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [109] at 6-7. The Court denies the motion to the extent Reliastar seeks striking of certain testimony based on hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, Third Party Defendants' arguments that the Court should strike Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts and its exhibits because Plaintiff failed to comply with the Local Rules and the Court's Orders regarding certain numbering and indexing requirements are, at best, petty. While the Court reserves the right to enter appropriate orders or sanctions for failure to comply with its Orders or the Local Rules, a motion to strike is an inappropriate vehicle to remedy the noncompliance argued here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, the Motions to Strike, ECF Nos. [96] and [104], are denied. The Court will therefore review the record consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 in addressing the Motions for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Plaintiff further argues that under the standard articulated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, Plaintiff has demonstrated that Walid successfully designated her as the beneficiary because the 2013 Beneficiary Form was signed with a thumbprint, a valid signature under state law, and because Walid substantially complied with the requirements of the Policy to change a beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In response, Reliastar argues that Plaintiff fails to follow certain procedural requirements, fails to show why summary judgment should not be granted on Reliastar's interpleader complaint, and fails to show why\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [102] at 3-11. In response to Plaintiff's arguments regarding the efficacy of the thumbprint, Reliastar argues that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the 2013 Beneficiary Form was signed by Walid because \"there is nothing on the 2013 Beneficiary Designation Form indicating or evidencing that the decedent voluntarily placed (or was assisted in placing) his thumbprint on the document with the intent to change beneficiaries. There is no admissible evidence that the decedent had even adopted his thumbprint as his signature on legal documents in 2013.

ECF Nos. [82] \u00b6 5; [84] at 4-5. Under\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   , the Court applies the following framework to review an administrator's benefits decision under ERISA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (1) Apply the de novo standard to determine whether the claim administrator's benefits-denial decision is \"wrong\" (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator's decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   (2) If the administrator's decision in fact is \"de novo wrong,\" then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (3) If the administrator's decision is \"de novo wrong\" and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \"reasonable\" grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator's decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator's decision was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647633\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1350/#p1354\">\n    644 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the Policy is governed by ERISA, Plaintiff's claim in this case is not a claim regarding a\n   <em>\n    plan administrator's decision\n   </em>\n   . The only administrative decision rendered by Reliastar to which the Court could apply\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   is the 2016 Denial, which denied Nawal's claim and found that Labeeb is the proper beneficiary pursuant to the 1996 Enrollment Form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. [86-6] and [86-9]. However, as noted above, the weight of the record before the Court indicates that Reliastar has effectively abandoned that administrative decision because it dismissed Labeeb from this case after it located the 2006 and 2013 Beneficiary Forms and determined that the 1996 Enrollment Form does not control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Moreover, while Reliastar muddies the waters by arguing in its Summary Judgment Motion that the Court should affirm the June 2016 Denial, the record is replete with statements by Reliastar that it has not rendered a decision on the 2013 Beneficiary Form or on the proper beneficiary of the Policy proceeds. In fact, that position is the entire basis of Reliastar's Interpleader Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. [84] at 11 (\"[T]his Court should grant ReliaStar's Motion for Summary Judgment, because its denial of Nawal Hassoun's claim was not \"\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong.\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   [101] \u00b6 19-20 (\"ReliaStar has not made a determination as to the validity of the 2013 Beneficiary Designation Form.... [Reliastar] admit[s] that [it] has not taken a position in this litigation as to whether the thumbprint that purports to be on the 2013 Beneficiary Designation Form constitutes a signature, because it has deposited the funds into the Court Registry, and therefore, is a disinterested stakeholder.\"); [54] at \u00b6 27 (\"ReliaStar is unable to determine the person or persons entitled to the Policy's proceeds without hazard to itself and without exposing itself to double or multiple liability from claims by Nawal Hassoun, Labeeb Hassoun, Kayria T.

Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Reliastar and Third Party Defendants on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that Walid placed his thumbprint on the 2013 Beneficiary Form with the intent to sign it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [86-12]. Plaintiff has introduced documentary evidence of the mark in the proper place for a signature and testimonial evidence through an affidavit\n   that the mark was made by the insured with the intent for the mark to serve as his signature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783761\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/530/#p535\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff has further introduced evidence that Walid used his thumbprint because he was unable to move his hands and arms as a result of ALS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. [86-11], [86-12], [86-13]. Thus, the record evidence is undisputed that the thumbprint constitutes a valid signature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Neither Reliastar nor Third Party Defendants have introduced any evidence to create an issue of fact regarding the thumbprint or Walid's intent. To the extent that they argue to the contrary, it is only with conclusory statements questioning whether the mark is a thumbprint at all, whether the mark was made by Walid, and whether the mark was made voluntarily. For example, in its Statement of Material Facts in Opposition to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts, Reliastar denies that Walid's thumbprint appears on the document or that the mark on the 2013 Beneficiary Form can be identified as a thumbprint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [101] \u00b6 13 (\"Denied that the corporate representative admitted it was a thumbprint\"); Moerbitz Tr. at 140-41 (\"I don't know if that's a thumbprint\"). However, Reliastar also states multiple times in the record-including in its same Statement of Material Facts in Opposition to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts-that it has made no determination regarding the \"thumbprint\" or the validity of the 2013 Beneficiary Form.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. [101] \u00b6 20; Moerbitz Tr. at 137, 156; ECF No. [86-8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Similarly, Third Party Defendants state that the 2013 Beneficiary Form was \"unsigned,\" but offer no record evidence to dispute that the mark found on the 2013 Beneficiary Form is not Walid's thumbprint or was not made by him intentionally. ECF No. [83] \u00b6 8. Third Party Defendants state that \"Plaintiff has disclosed no experts in fingerprint analysis to even say that the finger print was the owner's,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, but ignore the statements in the Nayef, Hamed, and Nawal Affidavits based on personal knowledge that Walid used his thumbprint to sign the 2013 Beneficiary Form and that Walid used his thumbprint to sign legal documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. [86-11], [86-12], [86-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Finally, both Reliastar and Third Party Defendants argue that the evidence produced by Plaintiff in support of her Motion for Summary Judgment is hearsay, and thus cannot be considered by the Court. However, as already explained above, as is permitted on summary judgment, the Court may rely upon the facts in the Nayef, Hamed, and Nawal Affidavits that can be reduced to admissible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Reliastar's Approval of the Beneficiary Is Permissive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Having found that the 2013 Beneficiary Form was validly executed, the Court now turns to whether Reliastar was required to affirmatively approve the executed 2013 Beneficiary Form for it to take effect. The Policy provides that \"[a]ll requests are\n   <em>\n    subject to our approval\n   </em>\n   . A change will take effect as of the date it is signed but will not affect any payment we make or action we take before receiving your notice.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. [54-1] at 11. Reliastar and Third Party Defendants argue that this language requires that Reliastar affirmatively approve any change of beneficiary form.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. [82] \u00b6 6 (\"In this case, there is a two-step process to effectuate a change in beneficiaries. First, a signed, completed, and dated Beneficiary Designation Form needs to be received by Reliastar. Next according to the Plan documents, the form must be accepted\n   and acknowledged by Reliastar. In this case, neither step was reached for the 2013 Beneficiary Designation.\"). Plaintiff argues that the language is permissive, allowing Reliastar to reject the form but not requiring affirmative approval. ECF No. [87] at 8. Plaintiff further argues that because there is no specified time frame for approval, Reliastar could approve the form at any time, including when it discovered three years after receipt that it had logged but not processed the 2013 Beneficiary Form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As the Supreme Court of Florida has observed, \"subject to\" is defined \"as 'contingent on or under the influence of some\n   <em>\n    later action\n   </em>\n   ( [e.g.,] the plan is subject to discussion).' \"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Read in conjunction with the second sentence which states that \"[a] change will take effect as of the date it is signed but will not affect any payment we make or action we take before receiving your notice,\" it is unclear whether this reservation requires the affirmative approval of each change of beneficiary form-contemporaneous or otherwise-or whether it simply allows Reliastar to reject a beneficiary form should it so choose. While on the one hand the second sentence seems superfluous if approval is required in all instances, on the other, the second sentence could be read to simply reflect the administrative reality that while the change in beneficiary is effective immediately, because of required processing-and approval-such changes cannot be reflected until received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   While this Court has not located a case within this District interpreting similar language, the Seventh Circuit has had occasion to do so.

Under the terms of the policy-like Walid's policy-the proceeds would first pass directly to the surviving spouse of the insured where no beneficiary was specified. However, the insureds' three children located a beneficiary form\n   after the insureds' death which named them as beneficiaries. Like Walid's policy, this policy in\n   <em>\n    Kagan\n   </em>\n   stated: \"[a] request to add or change a beneficiary must be made in writing. All requests are subject to our approval.

Reviewing the contract language, the Seventh Circuit observed.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   [T]he children do seem to have a point when the phrase, \"A change will take effect as of the date it is signed,\" is viewed in isolation. By itself, this phrase suggests that all a policyholder needs to do is complete and sign the Beneficiary Designation form in order to change beneficiaries. Under this line of reasoning, as long as Minnesota Life receives the form before it is obligated to pay the death benefit to the policyholder's beneficiaries, the company should not care who sent back the Beneficiary Designation form, how they sent it back, or when they sent it back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   When the phrase, \"A change will take effect as of the date it is signed,\" is read in context of the rest of the policy terms, it becomes clear that a policyholder's responsibilities do not end after completing and signing the Beneficiary Designation form. Rather, the signing of a Beneficiary Designation form is merely the first step in \"request[ing] to add or change a beneficiary.\" And that request is not guaranteed to be successful; on the contrary, the request is \"subject to [Minnesota Life's] approval.\" The juxtaposition of the words \"request\" and \"approval\" with the phrase in question indicates that new beneficiaries are not set in stone as soon as a policyholder completes and signs a form. Additional action is required; a policyholder must request Minnesota Life's approval for the desired change. But in the present case, there is no evidence that [the insured] ever attempted to request Minnesota Life's approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Thus, after considering the language of the death benefit information section as a whole, we believe that the phrase, \"A change will take effect as of the date it is signed,\" must mean that only an\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   change will take effect as of the date it is signed. In other words, a change that follows all policy requirements-including the policyholder submitting a request for Minnesota Life's approval-will take effect as of the date it is signed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068517\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/843/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068517\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/843/#p851\">\n    at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees with the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Kagan\n   </em>\n   that Walid did not change the Policy beneficiary merely by signing and dating the 2013 Beneficiary Form, without more. Rather, the Policy required that Reliastar receive the change of beneficiary form in order for the change to be effectuated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. [54-1] at 3 (\"Your beneficiary is the last beneficiary you named, according to the records on file in our Home Office or on file by the Plan Administrator, if applicable\"). However, because the insured in\n   <em>\n    Kagan\n   </em>\n   never mailed the change of beneficiary form to the insurance company, the\n   <em>\n    Kagan\n   </em>\n   Court did not reach the question of whether such a change requires the affirmative approval of the form, or whether the phrase simply reserves the insurer's right to do so. Because both interpretations are reasonable, the Court finds the term ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Under Florida law, \"[i]f a written contract is ambiguous or obscure in its terms, so that the contractual intention of the parties cannot be understood from a\n   mere inspection of the instrument, extrinsic evidence of the subject-matter of the contract, of the relations of the parties to each other, and of the facts and circumstances surrounding them when they entered into the contract may be received to enable the court to make a proper interpretation of the instrument.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington Nat.

Accordingly the Court will review the extrinsic evidence in the record to construe the ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   First, the Court examines the change of beneficiary form itself. The 2013 Beneficiary Form states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    Instructions:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    Insured/Owner:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   \u2022 Type of print legibly in ink.

Also send copies of all previous beneficiary changes, assignment forms, and a copy of the insured's enrollment form or application. The insurance company will return a copy of the approved form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   \u2022 For forms that do not require insurance company approval, retain a copy of the approved form with the insured's records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   ECF No. [54-5] at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Under the plain language of the beneficiary form, approval by Reliastar is not required in all cases. If it were, the directions to the plan administrator would be superfluous-if not nonsensical. Approval is only required in the enumerated circumstances listed on the form. However, none of those circumstances are applicable here. First, the wording on the 2013 Beneficiary Form comports with the required language on the back of the form for designation of an individual beneficiary because both Nawal's and Rima's full legal names are listed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [54-5] at 2. Second, there is no evidence of assignment of the Policy, and Moerbitz stated in her deposition that the Policy had no irrevocable beneficiaries. Moerbitz Tr. at 108. It is undisputed that the Policy is a group, and not individual, policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. [9-1], [22-1], [54-1], [86-1], [90-1], and [92-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Additional extrinsic evidence supports this conclusion. While Moerbitz testified that \"[a]ll requests are subject to approval-to our approval\" (Moerbitz Tr. at 122;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   126, 146, 151), that statement is inconsistent with her subsequent testimony that a change of beneficiary for which was not approved or acknowledged would still \"matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146 (Q: So, if you receive a change of beneficiary form but there is neither approval or an acknowledgement, that change of beneficiary form\n   just doesn't matter?... A: It does matter but it's not the beneficiary of record.\") Further, Reliastar also stated that it only \"attempts to send a letter to the insured within ten (10) days either accepting or denying the form.\" ECF No. [101] \u00b6 4. Accordingly, while approval may have been required in some instances and Reliastar may have reserved the right to reject a beneficiary form, no affirmative approval was required under the circumstances here to validate the 2013 Beneficiary Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Conclusion on the Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Walid complied with all Policy requirements to change his beneficiary designation for the Policy. Although he could not use his hands to write, he brought a blank beneficiary form to the home of his sister-in-law, who also held power of attorney. Walid then asked her assist him with filling out the 2013 Beneficiary Form per his wishes. Walid affixed his thumbprint below the signature line with the intent to authenticate the document, and he instructed his sister-in-law to mail the form to the U.S. to be sent to Reliastar. It is undisputed that Reliastar received the 2013 Beneficiary Form, but due to human error, never processed it. The 2013 Beneficiary Form cannot be avoided-and Walid's wishes defeated-simply because of Reliastar's administrative error. Taking all the facts in the light most favorable to non-moving parties Reliastar and the Third Party Defendants, there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding the signing of the 2013 Beneficiary Form or the approval requirements. Accordingly, the 2013 Beneficiary Form is enforceable and summary judgment is granted in favor the Plaintiff. Reliastar and the Third Party Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment are denied. The Court has considered the remaining arguments of the parties and finds them without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   1.

For simplicity, the Court will use \"Reliastar\" to refer to the current entity and any relevant predecessor entities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    In support of their respective motions for summary judgment, the parties have submitted statements of material facts, ECF Nos. [83], [85], and [86], and have also filed opposing statements of material facts, ECF Nos. [90], [92], [98], and [101]. Based on these statements, as well as the evidence in the record, the following facts are not genuinely in dispute unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    Copies of Policy have been filed on the docket at ECF Nos. [9-1], [22-1], [54-1], [86-1], [90-1], and [92-1]. The handwritten form was only attached to those versions filed by Reliastar.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [9-1], [22-1], [54-1]\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    [86-1]. [90-1], and [92-1]. The Court also notes that the handwritten form appears to state that the Planholder is Law Engineering, Inc., not the Law Companies, Inc., Walid's former employer. ECF Nos. [86] \u00b6 1, [98] \u00b6 1, [101] \u00b6 1. In addition, the Schedule of Benefits Booklet has numbered pages, many of which are missing from all copies presented to the Court. For example, the pagination jumps from page 3 to pages 8 (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No, [54-1] at 4) and from page 25 to page 52 (\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    at 13). However, no party disputes the completeness or accuracy of the Policy filed with the Court, and the Court will treat it as such.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    <em>\n     But see\n    </em>\n    [98] \u00b6 5. The Third Party Defendants dispute Reliastar's characterization of its own duties to maintain the forms for an insured that is \"on waiver,\" but cite no facts to support this contention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Neither Reliastar nor Third Party Defendants have introduced any evidence to create an issue of fact regarding the 2008 Power of Attorney.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Neither Reliastar nor Third Party Defendants have introduced any evidence to create an issue of fact regarding the statements in Dr. Hamed's affidavit. The Third Party Defendants admit that Walid was diagnosed with ALS and could not use his hands, and do not raise an issue of fact as to the remainder of the statements in the Hamed Affidavit. ECF No. [98] \u00b6 9. Rather, on summary judgment, Third Party Defendants object to the statement on evidentiary grounds that his statements are both hearsay and immaterial.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Similarly, Reliastar does not dispute the facts contained in the Hamed Affidavit, but rather objects to them based on hearsay. ECF No. [101] \u00b6 9. However, as explained further in addressing Reliastar's and Third Party Defendants' Motions to Strike and the Motions for Summary Judgment,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , the Court may consider on a motion for summary judgment any facts in the record which may be reduced to an admissible form for trial-such as the live testimony of Dr. Hamed.\n    <em>\n     Jones v. UPS Ground Freight\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894355\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/1283/#p1293\">\n     683 F.3d 1283\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing\n    <em>\n     Macuba v.

Neither Reliastar nor Third Party Defendants have set forth any record evidence for the Court to consider in contravention to the Hamed Affidavit. Accordingly, the Court will treat the Hamed Affidavit as undisputed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Both Reliastar and Third Party Defendants question whether the mark on the 2013 Beneficiary form is a thumbprint and whether it was made intentionally by Walid. However, neither has introduced any record evidence to create an issue of fact beyond their speculation or conclusory denials. In addition, like the Hamed Affidavit, Reliastar and Third Party Defendants also object to the Nayef Affidavit on evidentiary grounds. Again, because the content of the affidavit can be reduced to admissible testimony-namely the testimony of Nayef-the Court may consider these facts on summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894355\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/1283/#p1293\">\n     683 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1293-94 (citing\n    <em>\n     Macuba\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11567478\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/1316/#p1322\">\n     193 F.3d at 1322\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    Third Party Defendants attempt to dispute Reliastar's assertion that it never processed the 2013 Beneficiary Form and that it takes no position on its validity (\n    <em>\n     see e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Moerbitz Tr. at 135-37; ECF No. [101] \u00b6 20) by arguing a hypothetical statement. Principally, Third Party Defendants argue that if Reliastar had processed the 2013 Beneficiary Form, Reliastar would have rejected it because the thumbprint would not be accepted as a valid signature. ECF No. [82] \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.

The only administrative decision in the record before it is the 2016 Denial, which denied Nawal's claim and found that Labeeb is the proper beneficiary pursuant to the 1996 Enrollment Form.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    2016 Denial, ECF Nos.
