After his employment ended in 2010, Braun brought administrative claims that he had been subject to employment-related misconduct, including discrimination based on disability. Those claims were heard by an\n   administrative judge, who granted summary judgment for the agency. DOI adopted the administrative judge's decision. Braun subsequently appealed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"EEOC\"), which affirmed the dismissal. Braun has brought suit against DOI, the Secretary of the Interior,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the EEOC, alleging misconduct in his employment and the post-employment administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss Braun's claims against the EEOC for failure to state a claim. They also ask the Court either to dismiss the claims against DOI and the Secretary of the Interior for improper venue, or to transfer them to the District of New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17. For reasons set forth below, the motion will be granted. Braun's claims against the EEOC will be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, the Court agrees that this District is not a proper venue for Braun's remaining claims against DOI and the Secretary of the Interior. Therefore, the case will be transferred to the District of New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Braun makes similar allegations in the Complaint, including that the administrative judge and the EEOC ignored his arguments, improperly limited his discovery requests, obstructed and slow-walked his case, and \"gave the unwavering impression to the Plaintiff that they were protecting the US Department of the Interior by its [sic] lack of action, lack of ethics and attitude.\" Compl. at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the claims against the EEOC for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17. Defendants also argue that venue is improper with respect to the remaining claims against DOI and the Secretary of the Interior, and that these claims should either be dismissed or transferred to the District of New Mexico pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17.

In the second, Braun provides additional reasons why the Eastern District of Virginia would be a proper forum. ECF No. 42.

The Court agrees that venue is not proper here, and will grant Defendants' request to transfer the case-including Braun's remaining Rehabilitation Act claims against DOI and the Secretary of the Interior, as well as any non-Rehabilitation Act claims against those Defendants-to the District of New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Braun's Rehabilitation Act Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rehabilitation Act claims are governed by Title VII's venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slaby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3806599\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/901/129/#p132\">\n    901 F.Supp.2d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under that provision, Title VII and Rehabilitation Act claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   may be brought [i] in any judicial district in the State in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, [ii] in the judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such practice are maintained and administered, or [iii] in the judicial district in which the aggrieved person would have worked but for the alleged unlawful employment practice, but if the respondent is not found within any such district, such an action may be brought [iv] within the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3). Venue is proper under the fourth, residual prong of the statute \"[o]nly if the defendant is not found within any of [the first three] districts.\"\n   <em>\n    Herbert v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328710\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/925/13/#p18\">\n    925 F.Supp.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (D.D.C. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Braun argues that venue can and should lie in this District because his EEOC appeal was processed here, and because it would be a burden on him to litigate the case in New Mexico when he resides in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23 at 4-5. Under the statute, the only possible relevance of these arguments is that certain records related to Braun's employment may have found their way to the District of Columbia in the course of the EEOC proceedings. However, \"[c]ourts in this district have 'rejected the argument that the location where plaintiff's EEO complaints were initiated and processed provides a basis for venue under prong [two] of \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3).' \"\n   <em>\n    Herbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328710\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/925/13/#p18\">\n    925 F.Supp.2d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ellis-Smith v.

But that prong does not apply to this case. Under the plain language of \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3), venue under the first and third prongs is proper in the District of New Mexico, the place where Braun was employed during the alleged misconduct. And because DOI can be found in New Mexico, it is plain that the fourth, residual prong of the statute does not apply. Therefore, Braun's arguments are unavailing, and the Court agrees with Defendants that venue does not lie in this District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Given that venue is improper here, the Court must consider whether and where to transfer the case. \"Generally, the 'interest of justice' instructs courts to transfer cases to the appropriate judicial district, rather than dismiss them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    James v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9307057\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/227/16/#p20\">\n    227 F.Supp.2d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (D.D.C. 2002). Given that Defendants have presented no argument for why dismissal would be preferable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 at 6, the Court concludes that transfer to a proper venue is the more appropriate path forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As discussed above, it is clear that venue is proper in the District of New Mexico under prongs one and three of the statute. Less clear is venue under prong two, which is proper in the \"judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such practice are maintained and administered.\" Prong two could potentially support venue in one of two additional jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The first possibility is the Southern District of Illinois, where the relevant employment records are now archived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Carruthers Decl. But courts in this District have disagreed on whether venue would be proper there. One court has held that, when a plaintiff's records were moved to storage after her employment, they were not \"maintained and administered\" at the storage location for purposes of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saran v. Harvey\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-cv-1847 (JDB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201106347\">\n    2005 WL 1106347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.D.C. May 9, 2005). Other courts, however, have disagreed, reasoning that the statute speaks in the present tense and holding on that basis that the place where the records were archived provided a venue under prong two.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jyachosky v. Winter\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-cv-01733 (HHK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201805607\">\n    2006 WL 1805607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.2 (D.D.C. June 29, 2006). Ultimately, however, the Court does not need to decide that issue, because neither party has expressed an interest in litigating this case in the Southern District of Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The other potential venue under prong two is the Eastern District of Virginia, where the records were previously located during Braun's employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Carruthers Decl. But in light of the facts as they stood when Braun filed suit, it is doubtful whether venue lies there. The statute authorizes venue where the relevant records \"are maintained and administered,\" but Braun's records are not presently there, and have not been at any time during this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Saran\n   </em>\n   could be read as implicitly blessing venue there, since the court in that case declined to recognize venue in the district to which the records had been sent for archival purposes. However, the court did not reach the issue because the records in that case had been located in Germany (outside any judicial district) during the plaintiff's employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201106347\">\n    2005 WL 1106347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. In the end, neither party has brought to the Court's attention a case that squarely supports venue in the Eastern District of Virginia on the facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Therefore, in light of all of the above, the Court will transfer the case to the District of New Mexico. Although transfer there may be somewhat inconvenient for Braun, it is the only district in which venue clearly lies. Moreover, it is the only venue with a meaningful nexus to the facts of the case. The events related to Braun's employment allegedly took place there, and Defendants have proffered that at least two important witnesses are located there. Therefore, the Court finds that it is in the interest of justice to transfer the case to the District of New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Braun's Non-Rehabilitation Act Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Braun invokes a large number of other statutes and authorities to support his claims against DOI and the Secretary of the Interior. For many of these authorities, in particular the criminal statutes that Braun cites, it is doubtful that he has a valid cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lee v. USAID\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276271\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/74/#p78\">\n    859 F.3d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78 (D.C.

For others, such as the CSRA, it appears that this Court may lack subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Elgin v. Dep't of Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p23\">\n    567 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p23\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p23\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (holding district courts generally lack jurisdiction under the CSRA). And Defendants suggest that all of these claims should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 at 3 n.2.
