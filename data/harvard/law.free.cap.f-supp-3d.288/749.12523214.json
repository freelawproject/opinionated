Dkt. 36. Having considered the motion, objections, response, reply, record evidence, and applicable law, the court is of the opinion that the objections should be SUSTAINED IN PART and OVERRULED IN PART and the motion for summary judgment should be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case relates to Dunn's employment at NCC. Dkt. 1. Dunn started working for NCC as a service engineer in December 2013. Dkt. 31, Ex. A. He received a \"very good\" performance evaluation approximately sixty days after beginning work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 37-4 (performance evaluation). The person completing the evaluation form noted that he saw Dunn as a leader and that he was reliable and completed tasks well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There was, however, a notation made that Dunn \"needed improvement\" in \"patience as pertaining to co-workers\" and that there were some \"ongoing issues\" with regard to \"2nd shift.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, the evaluator rated Dunn on the low end of \"very good\" on the \"interpersonal relationships\" factor of the evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dunn asserts that after this evaluation, he started performing various supervisory-type tasks and that it appeared he was being considered for a supervisor opening. Dkt. 36 (submitting evidence that Dunn was conducting interviews and was copied on emails to department employees). On March 6, 2014, when Dunn asked his facilities manager, John Coffman, if a choice on \"the supervisor position\" was forthcoming, Coffman responded, \"LOL, come see me. Will cover this.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 37-8. By April 11, 2014, Dunn still had not been promoted. Dkt. 36. He sent Coffman another email asking about getting \"more involved with responsibilities as a Supervisor\" and inquiring whether he could \"get a head start on some training,\" and Coffman informed Dunn that he had signed Dunn up for \"all the supervisor training they offer Tooling U.\" Dkt. 37-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   About a month later, Dunn noted in a diary of events he kept at work that an \"Asian guy Loc\" told him that \"they...were not going to make [Dunn] a full time supervisor and that they were using [Dunn].\" Dkt. 37-15. Loc allegedly told Dunn that the night supervisor had said there was \"no way in the hell they will make that boy supervisor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 17, 2017, Dunn noted that he asked Coffman about this issue and Coffman told him that he would \"check in to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 26, 2017, Dunn wrote in the same diary that Coffman called him into his office and told him that the company had just hired a \"white kid straight out of college with no [training] and made him head of a department\" and that the managers above Coffman had told him to \"get rid of [Dunn's] black ass\" and that it was \"racial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite this discussion, on June 6, 2014, Dunn wrote that Coffman told him he needed to take classes on being a supervisor and that Coffman would order some books for Dunn. Dkt. 37, Ex. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 10, 2014, Dunn was locked in a machine while he was performing maintenance on it. Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 27. Dunn contends the door accidentally closed and locked. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-12 (Dunn's statement regarding the accident). He had inserted a rag to keep the door from locking, but the rag fell out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dunn said that he yelled for another employee to open the door, and the other employee was able to let him out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   NCC considered this a \"Near Miss,\" and it requires employees to report near misses on a form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 36, Exs. A-16, A-17. Dunn told Coffman about the incident but did not complete the form. Dkt. 36 at 23; Dkt. 31, Ex. A-13 (Coffman's account of the near miss).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 13, 2014, Dunn sent two emails to NCC's corporate office. Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 29. The first provides a phone number and states that he \"just want[s] to make a living for [his] family, and if they are intimidated by [him] ok just transfer [him] to another facilit[y].\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A-20. Attached to that email is a list entitled \"Update\" that contains a diary of events from May 23, 2014 through June, 13, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His note on June 9, 2014, after discussing the promotion of a white employee, states: \"It is for sure, that if you have knowledge and you are of color; your chances of being promoted are slim to none.\" Dunn's entry for June 6, 2014, discusses how Coffman wanted him to take classes on being a supervisor and how Coffman did not understand why there was such a delay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He then stated, \"maybe my skin is my sin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The other email notes that he wanted to let somebody outside of the facility know what was happening. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-21. Dunn noted that a transfer may be helpful as \"no person should feel unwelcomed in his/her work place.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The corporate office forwarded both emails to Waggoner, and Waggoner met with Dunn the following week to discuss. Dkt. 31, Exs. A, A-20, A-21. Waggoner reports that she, NCC's president Dane Tipton, and Dunn had a seventy-five minute meeting during which Dunn \"spoke in generalities and did not answer direct questions.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 32. She asserts that Dunn did not provide any specific information to investigate and \"asked to be left alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 18, 2014, Dunn and Coffman had a discussion about Dunn failing to clock out. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-24. Coffman forwarded the email to Waggoner. Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 34. Dunn received a written warning for this incident which indicates he was violating company policies. Dkt. 31, Exs. A, A-25. Dunn's \"employee statement\" on this warning is \"complete retaliation.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 19, 2014, Dunn sent another email to the corporate office. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-28. He informed them that the problems \"just will not stop\" and he had been \"forced to seek legal representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He notes that since his initial complaints he had been written up and harassed and other employees had been asked to write statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He reiterated that all he \"asked was for it to stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 20, 2014, Dunn's employment was terminated. Dkt. 37, Ex. 17. Waggoner, Tipton, and Hillary LaManna (the Human Resources manager at corporate who had received Dunn's complaints)) made the decision. Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. The reason for separation, according to the separation notice, was that Dunn \"refused to cooperate in 3 separate investigations and [was] insubordinate to [management].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The separation notice has a final employee evaluation section, and the following categories are marked \"unsatisfactory\": reliability, adherence to policy, interpersonal relations, and judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dunn received \"satisfactory\" ratings with regard to quality, productivity, job knowledge, attendance,\n   independence, creativity, and initiative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There is a \"yes/no\" check box after the question \"Would you rehire?,\" and \"No\" is checked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dunn filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and received a right-to-sue notice on March 22, 2016. Dkt. 1 &amp; Ex. A. Dunn timely filed his complaint in this court on June 17, 2016. Dkt. 1. He asserts the following claims: (1) race discrimination in violation of Title VII and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) hostile work environment in violation of Title VII and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) racial harassment; (4) disparate treatment in violation of Title VII; (5) vicarious employer liability for harassment by supervisors in violation of Title VII and \u00a7 1981 ; (6) retaliation in violation of Title VII and \u00a7 1981 ; (7) vicarious liability; (8) negligence; and (9) intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dunn requests compensatory and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 31, 2016, NCC filed a motion to partially dismiss. Dkt. 5. On October 24, 2016, the court granted the motion and dismissed Dunn's state-law negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and vicarious liability claims. Dkt. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 30, 2017, NCC filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking summary judgment in its favor on Dunn's remaining claims. Dkt. 31. NCC argues that Dunn cannot make out a prima facie case of race discrimination because he fails to identify a valid comparator and because there was not even a promotion available.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   NCC asserts that Dunn's harassment claims fail because he cannot establish that the alleged racial comments were severe or pervasive enough to affect a term or condition of employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It additionally notes that Dunn did not take advantage of NCC's \"remedial opportunities,\" so Dunn cannot establish that NCC knew or should have known about the alleged harassment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, NCC claims that is had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Dunn's employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 7, 2017, Dunn filed a response to the motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 36. Dunn contends that he has direct evidence that he was denied a promotion because of his race and that he therefore does not need to meet the prima facie burden that plaintiffs proving discrimination through circumstantial evidence must meet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With regard to unequal pay, Dunn argues that Coffman (Dunn's supervisor) is an appropriate comparator and that Coffman made more than Dunn.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dunn contends that he can prove disparate treatment by showing that other similarly situated employees outside of his protected class were treated more favorably under nearly identical circumstances because Dunn was disciplined \"for the smallest of perceived infractions\"-reporting an incident orally instead of in writing-and other workers were not disciplined for more serious infractions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With regard to hostile environment, Dunn contends he was described using a racial slur multiple times and called a slave, a monkey, and a mayate (a Spanish word that allegedly translates into a racial slur), and that people used the term \"black ass\" with regard to Dunn more than once.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dunn asserts that racial epithets and comments \"were constant, almost daily as to be considered both severe and pervasive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dunn contends that he reported the harassment pursuant to NCC's reporting procedure because he told Coffman \"almost daily,\" he sent an unsigned email to corporate, and he reported the use of the \"mayate\" term to Human Resources.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dunn additionally argues he was terminated\n   after these reports in retaliation for engaging in protected activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   NCC argues in reply that Dunn does not provide any direct evidence that he was discriminated against for failure to promote and cannot establish pretext. Dkt. 44. NCC argues that Dunn does not identify any comparators who were treated differently under nearly identical circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With regard to pay, NCC asserts that Dunn may not say that Coffman is his comparator, thus creating a new comparator, at this stage to attempt to create a fact issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, NCC contends that even if Dunn got past the prima facie case, Dunn has no evidence indicating that NCC's legitimate reason for terminating Dunn's employment is pretext.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   NCC argues that Dunn cannot maintain a claim for disparate impact and fails to establish a genuine issue of material fact with regard to harassment because his evidence is unsupported and does not establish a prima facie case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, NCC argues that Dunn's retaliation claim fails for the same reasons his discrimination claim fails-because he has no evidence of pretext.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dunn also asserts various objections to NCC's summary judgment evidence. Dkt. 36. The court will first rule on the evidentiary objections and then determine whether NCC is entitled to summary judgment on each of Dunn's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dunn moves to strike the following evidence attached to NCC's motion for summary judgment: (1) affidavit of Jennifer Waggoner (Ex. A), which Dunn contends was not made under penalty of perjury or with personal knowledge; (2) a job description that post-dates Dunn's employment date (Ex. A-4); (3) a payroll record (Ex. A-5), which Dunn contends should not be admitted if Waggoner's affidavit is not made on personal knowledge; (4) a record of a co-worker's complaint (Ex. A-9) because the translation of the complaint did not indicate it was a true and correct translation and it is therefore hearsay; (5) various reports and emails relating incidents at work (Exs. A-11 through A-15), which Dunn contends were prepared in anticipation of filing the motion for summary judgment and are thus untrustworthy; (6) more emails and one of Dunn's training records (Exs. A-18 through A-24), which Dunn contends have not been authenticated; (7) Dunn's separation notice (Ex. A-29), which Dunn contends lacks authenticity under the doctrine of optional completeness; (8) a description of the NCC position of assistant coupling supervisor (Ex. A-30), which Dunn contends cannot be authenticated and was prepared solely for the motion; and (9) a transcript (Ex. G-1) of a tape that contains a disclaimer because it cannot be considered an accurate reproduction of the conversation recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   NCC asserts that the Waggoner affidavit (Ex. A) is valid evidence because it is a sworn affidavit that was notarized and thus does not need to state it was made \"under penalty of perjury.\" Dkt. 44. NCC argues that Waggoner appropriately authenticated all of the documents attached to her affidavit as business records and that she may authenticate the documents as business records as a \"qualified person\" under Federal Rule of Evidence 902(11).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   NCC additionally provides specific reasons all of Dunn's other objections should be overruled.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Dunn objects to this exhibit because the document was issued by Paychex of New York LLC and thus cannot be within Waggoner's personal knowledge. Dkt. 36.

R. Evid. 801(c)(2) (\" 'Hearsay' means a statement that...a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"). The translation must be considered more closely. In general a translator is a \"mere conduit\" and \"does not create an additional level of hearsay.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cordero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513865\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/1248/#p1253\">\n    18 F.3d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253 (5th Cir. 1994). However, in unusual circumstances, such as when the accuracy of the confession is legitimately questioned, courts must scrutinize the translation more closely. Courts in the Fifth Circuit consider the following factors when determining \"whether to treat the translator as a mere language conduit\": \"(1) which party supplied the interpreter; (2) whether the interpreter had any motive to mislead or distort; (3) the interpreter's qualifications and language skill; and (4) whether actions taken subsequent to the conversation were consistent with the statements as translated.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, NCC supplied the interpreter, and the court has no information regarding the interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 25 (noting that Exhibit A-9 is a copy of a complaint and \"the translation from Spanish to English\").

Exhibits A-11 to A-15\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Exhibits A-11 through A-15 are statements from various individuals relating to Dunn being locked in a machine while performing maintenance, which NCC characterizes as a \"near miss,\" or Dunn's interactions with other employees. Dkt. 31, Exs. A, A-11-A-15. Exhibit A-11 is an email from Coffman to Waggoner dated May 21, 2014, in which Coffman discusses how he addressed an issue relating to an employee in the maintenance department-Mr. Cortes. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-11. Exhibit A-12 is a statement by Dunn about the \"accident\"-being locked in the machine; it is not dated. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-12. Exhibit A-13 is a statement by Coffman about what Dunn reported regarding being locked in the machine; it is dated June 17, 2014. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-13. Exhibit A-14 are notes by James Vau, who was investigating the near miss; the notes were prepared from June 17 through June 20, 2014. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-14. Exhibit A-15 purports to be a record of an interview of Dunn that occurred on June 18, 2014 and appears to have been signed by Dunn on June 20, 2014. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Dunn argues that these statements must all be stricken from the record because they lack trustworthiness and were prepared in anticipation of filing the motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 36. He also contends that Exhibit A-15, which appears to contain Dunn's signature, \"was not signed by Dunn but by someone else.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022861\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/628/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   NCC first notes that it is unclear how the documents could have been prepared in anticipation of litigation when they were prepared in 2014. Dkt. 44. It then points out that Exhibit A-12, the statement by Dunn that is not signed, is an excerpt from\n   Dunn's own notes, the entirety of which are dated and attached as Exhibit E to the motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022861\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/628/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With regard to the allegation of forgery, NCC states that it \"takes seriously Dunn's allegation of forgery and objects to Dunn's baseless assertion that his signature was forged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022861\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/628/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court first addresses Dunn's objection that these exhibits are not trustworthy because they were prepared in anticipation to filing a motion for summary judgment. The documents were prepared several years ago and almost immediately after a complaint and an incident in the workplace. It was reasonable for Dunn's employer to investigate the incident and for Coffman to forward his resolution of the complaint to human resources. There is no reason to believe that the documents are untrustworthy because NCC potentially anticipated that it would be filing a motion for summary judgment in future litigation several years ago. This objection is\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court next addresses the forgery allegation. Dunn asserts that he need not introduce affirmative evidence of untrustworthiness, but only needs to raise the issue, citing the notes to Federal Rule of Evidence 803. Dkt. 36. Dunn does not provide an affidavit to support the contention in his response that the notes from his interview on June 18, 2014 were not signed by him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022861\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/628/#p646\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   NCC does not provide any citation or defense to the allegation; it merely notes that Dunn has presented no evidence of forgery and that it takes the allegation seriously and \"objects to Dunn's baseless assertion.\" Dkt. 44 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 803 is a list of exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Fed. R. Evid. 803. NCC presumably offers the document at issue under Rule 803(6), which is the business records exception. The notes to the rule indicate that this exception exists because of the \"element of unusual reliability of business records\" due to \"systematic checking, by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation.\" Fed. R. Evid. 803, note to para. (6). The 2014 notes, which Dunn references, state that \"if the proponent has established the stated requirements of the exception-regular business with regularly kept record, source with personal knowledge, record made timely, and foundation testimony or certification-then the burden is on the opponent to show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022861\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/628/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In meeting the burden, the opponent \"is not necessarily required to introduce affirmative evidence of untrustworthiness,\" and the \"determination of untrustworthiness necessarily depends on the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022861\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/628/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, Dunn appears to assert that his burden is simply to assert that the document is forged or that the documents are untrustworthy and that the court must then completely disregard the documents. However, as the notes to the Rules of Evidence state, the trustworthiness or lack thereof is dependent on the circumstances. The court finds that Dunn has not satisfied his burden by merely stating documents are prepared in anticipation of litigation or conclusorily alleging that he did not sign a document. While certainly the court will not treat Exhibit A-15 as a statement that was signed by Dunn since he disputes signing it, Dunn has given the court no reason to question the substance of the document, which seems to describe what happened on June 10 from Dunn's perspective. Dkt. 31-3, Ex. A-15. Whether Dunn signed the document or not, the business records affidavit states it is a\n   \"true and correct copy of Mr. Dunn's interview regarding the near miss incident.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 27. Dunn's objection to this exhibit is\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Exhibits A-18 to A-24\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dunn objects to exhibits A-18 through A-24 because he contends these exhibits are electronically stored information that has not been authenticated. Dkt. 36. He contends that Waggoner's affidavit does not adequately indicate that the records reflect the electronically stored information or that the method of generation is reliable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022861\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/628/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Lorraine v.

NCC points out that Exhibit A-18 is not electronically stored information and all of the other exhibits are emails that provide circumstantial evidence that the email was written by the person identified by the sender's email address. Dkt. 44. It also notes that Exhibits A-19, A-20, A-21, A-22, and A-24 all contain Waggoner as either a recipient or sender, so her affidavit authenticates them not only as a custodian of record but as a recipient or author of the email.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2924284\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/241/534/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As to Exhibit A-23, NCC notes that (a) Waggoner authenticates this email as custodian of records; and (b) regardless, Dunn himself cites to the email in his response to the motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2924284\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/241/534/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 36 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, with regard to exhibit A-18, it is not electronically stored information, so Dunn's objection based on it being electronically stored information that was not properly authenticated is\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   . Second, with regard to all of the emails which Waggoner sent or received, she states in her affidavit that they are true and correct copies. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a), in order to authenticate an item of evidence, \"the proponent must produce the evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\" Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). Since Waggoner sent or received these emails, she is an appropriate person to testify as to their authenticity. The non-binding case cited by Dunn,\n   <em>\n    Lorraine v. Markel\n   </em>\n   , supports this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lorraine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2924284\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/241/534/#p542\">\n    241 F.R.D. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Lorraine\n   </em>\n   , the United States District Court for the District of Maryland noted that a \"party seeking to admit an exhibit need only make a prima facie showing that it is what he or she claims it to be\" under Rule 901 and that \"[c]ourts considering the admissibility of electronic evidence frequently have acknowledged that it may be authenticated by a custodian or other qualified witness with personal knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2924284\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/241/534/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dunn's objections that Exhibits A-19, A-20, A-21, A-22, and A-24 are not properly authenticated are therefore\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   . Third, with regard to Exhibit A-23, the court finds the fact that Dunn also relies on the evidence is dispositive.

R. Evid. 106. Generally, under this rule, the court would simply require NCC to submit the packet to which the document refers to ensure the information in considered in its complete form. However, NCC did not respond to Dunn's objection under the doctrine of optional completeness, and it did not submit the packet to complete the exhibit. The court cannot determine whether it ought to in fairness consider the packet without having the opportunity to review the packet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, Dunn himself relies on this allegedly incomplete exhibit in his response to the motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 36 at 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 36, Ex. 17 (the separation notice).

Dunn contends that this document cannot be authenticated and was prepared solely for the purpose of summary judgment. Dkt. 36. He also argues that it is undated, the print is new, and the font on pages three to four is different than the font on pages one and two.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2924284\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/241/534/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He argues that the \"authenticity of the document having been questioned, the Court must strike the document from the record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2924284\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/241/534/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   NCC argues that none of these allegations support Dunn's assertion that this document was prepared for the motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 44. It additionally contends that the font does not change\n   within the document and that perhaps Dunn had a problem with his printer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2924284\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/241/534/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Like NCC, the court does not perceive a change in font within the document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31, Ex. A-30. Nothing other than Dunn's conclusory assertion that the document was prepared in anticipation of the motion for summary judgment supports his suspicion that it was so prepared. Waggoner, who is a human resources manager with NCC, stated in the context of discussing the person who was promoted to Assistant Coupling Test Supervisor during Dunn's tenure that \"Exhibit A-30 is a true and correct copy of the job description for the Assistant Coupling Test Supervisor position.\" Dkt. 31, Ex.

The Fifth Circuit viewed the plaintiff's argument as asking that the panel member's \"hunch\" as to the decisionmaker's motives be viewed as direct evidence of racial animus, which requires inference and thus \"is improper in the direct evidence context.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   While, as Dunn points out,\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   is an unpublished case and thus not precedential,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   5th Circuit R. 47.5.4, the court agrees with its reasoning. However, it is not exactly on point. According to NCC's human resources manager, Coffman, similar to the panel member in\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   , had the ability to interview candidates and make recommendations for hire and promotion, but his manager, Lee Currier, had the ultimate decisionmaking power to hire or promote. Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 15. According to\n   Dunn's notes, Coffman told him that Currier and others were \"very narrow minded\" and, when Dunn asked why, Coffman stated that it was \"racial\" and asked Dunn \"not to repeat it.\" Dkt. 36, Ex. 15 (May 26, 2014 notes). Dunn wrote in his notes that Coffman \"said they just hired a white kid straight out of college with no training and made him head of a department\" and that \"they told him to get rid of [Dunn's] black ass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Coffman's report that the decisionmaker or decisionmakers were narrow minded and that it was racial may be similar to the \"hunch\" that the panel member had in\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   that the decisionmaker \"had a diversity issue,\" in this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   , Dunn reports that Coffman said a lot more. Dunn's notes state that Coffman gave him an objective reason for saying it was racial-because the people making the promotion decisions had hired a person who was not a member of the protected class who Coffman perceived to be unqualified and because these same people allegedly said to \"get rid of [Dunn's] black ass.\" No level of inference is needed to determine that this statement is racial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The statement meets all elements of the\n   <em>\n    CSC Logic\n   </em>\n   test: it is related to African Americans, it occurred shortly before Dunn's termination, it was made by an individual who had an objective basis for believing the individual in charge of employment decisions had racial animus, and it was related to not promoting Dunn and eventually terminating his employment. NCC's evidence that it offered Dunn training after this statement was allegedly made is certainly evidence that will be of interest to the jury in evaluating the case, but it is not dispositive. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Dunn, as the court must at this stage, this offer could have been a made to placate Dunn. The court finds that the statement that the decision not to promote Dunn was \"racial\" is direct evidence of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Promotion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Dunn contends that he can show by direct evidence that he was denied a promotion because of his protected characteristic. Dkt. 36 at 15. He asserts he was already being groomed for the position and NCC's assertion that it was not soliciting applications for a supervisor position is \"hogwash.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dunn contends that he completed an application for supervisor as instructed by Coffman and that he finished his \"Tool and One Management\" training.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 36, Ex. 14 at 49, 81, 182). He argues that NCC did not need to solicit applications because Dunn was in the process of getting the job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. He points out that Coffman stated in an email that Dunn was not a supervisor \"yet,\" citing Dkt. 36, Ex. 5, and that Coffman said the lack of action by management was \"racial\" on two occasions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 36, Ex. 15; Dkt. 36, Ex. 14 at 168). Dunn additionally argues that NCC's purported reasons for not promoting him are inconsistent and that the court should therefore infer that the proferred reason is pretextual.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Gee v.

Dunn then points out the ways in which he contends that he and another person who was promoted (Jacob Rutt) are appropriate comparators, how NCC's assertion that no other supervisors were needed because Coffman was the supervisor is inconsistent with Coffman's title as a facilities manager; and how Dunn could have been promoted to the position that his alleged comparator was promoted to because promotions do not have to be vertical at NCC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In reply, NCC argues that Dunn has no legal support for his position that not being promoted after six months of employment is sufficient to establish discrimination\n   for failure to promote. Dkt. 44. It also argues that even if the evidence about the failure to promote being \"racial\" is considered direct evidence, which it should not be, NCC may establish that it would have made the same decision regardless of any alleged discriminatory animus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241072\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/987/#p992\">\n    427 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   992 ). NCC notes that it has provided evidence that it was not seeking a supervisor in Dunn's department during Dunn's employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241072\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/987/#p992\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing the Waggoner affidavit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   First, the court agrees that if Dunn's only complaint was that he worked for six months and was not promoted, he would not have a claim for disparate treatment. Moreover, if it were clear that NCC just was not interested in hiring a supervisor for Dunn's department, Dunn would not have a failure-to-promote disparate treatment claim. However, there is enough evidence in the record, taken in the light most favorable to Dunn, for a fact finder to conclude that NCC was considering promoting Dunn to a supervisory position and that racial animus may have played a role in the decision not to do so. For instance, one could easily infer from Coffman's response to Dunn's email asking if the promotion was forthcoming (\"LOL, come see me. Will cover this.\" (Dkt. 37-8)) that there was an actual position available, and NCC provided training to Dunn relating to becoming a supervisor. There are enough disputes of material facts in the record to make summary judgment inappropriate on the failure to promote claim. NCC's motion for summary judgment on this claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Equal Pay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In Dunn's complaint, Dunn alleges that \"Caucasian employees...received better and superior compensation than the Plaintiff.\" Dkt. 1 at 10. There is no direct evidence that Dunn was paid less than employees outside his protected class because of race. Thus, Dunn must make out a prima facie case of discrimination for this claim. \"To make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination in compensation, a plaintiff must show that he was a member of a protected class and that he was paid less than a non-member for work requiring substantially the same responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

As Dunn notes, both jobs use the ERP System. Rutt's job as an Assistant Coupling Supervisor does require the employee to \"[u]tilize ERP System to perform everyday Job Processes.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A-30. Dunn's required the employee to \"[u]tilize the existing ERP integrated modules to maintain data integrity and material inventory\" and \"[u]se ERP to complete preventative maintenance documentation as required.\" Dkt. 31, Ex.

Moreover, Dunn was not paid less than Rutt. Waggoner states that Dunn's base rate was $30 per hour. Even without overtime, if Dunn were to work 40 hours per week for 52 weeks a year, he would make $62,400. That is\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than the $48,000 that Rutt made.

Dkt. 36 t 18-19. Dunn contends that he did the \"exact same job as Coffman,\" and that they were actually co-supervisors, though Coffman had the title of supervisor or facilities manager and Dunn did not. Dkt. 36 at 19-20. NCC asserts that Dunn cannot allege a new comparator in an attempt to create a fact issue and that Dunn provides no support for his contention that he performed work with substantially the same responsibilities as Coffman, who he recognizes was his supervisor. Dkt. 44. NCC argues that the facts Dunn provides to support his claim that he and Coffman were actually co-supervisors are cherry-picked and mischaracterized.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684100\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/510/#p522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The court has reviewed the evidence submitted by Dunn asserting that Coffman is his comparator and finds that while it appears that both Dunn and Coffman had some general supervisory functions, Dunn has not met his burden of showing that he and Coffman were in \"nearly identical\" circumstances. There is actually very little information in the record about what Coffman's job responsibilities were. Moreover, there is nothing in the record about Coffman's pay other than Dunn's conclusory assertion that the \"Defendant cannot rebutt [sic.] the fact that Coffman was paid more than Dunn.\" Dkt. 36 at 20. And, it is clear that Coffman (and Rutt) both had worked at NCC substantially longer than Dunn. Dunn has not shown that Coffman is a valid comparator for Dunn's prima facie case of pay discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Additionally, Dunn asserts as part of his discrimination claim that he was performing supervisory functions but that NCC did not give him supervisor pay.

NCC contends that Dunn does not identify these minor infractions and that, regardless, Dunn has not identified any Caucasian or non-African-American employees who were treated differently under similar circumstances. Dkt. 31 at 14. NCC asserts that Dunn's examples include a Hispanic employee being able to steal tools from the shop and an employee named Ray not having to clock in and clock out, but NCC asserts that Dunn was disciplined regarding clocking in and out because of \"his defensive and uncooperative behavior when asked to adjust his time.\" Dkt. 31 at 14 (citing Dkt. 31, Ex. A-25). NCC points out that Dunn also admitted during his deposition that other employees were disciplined for violating company policy. Dkt. 31 (citing Dkt. 31, Ex. B (Dunn Dep.) at 232-34). In Dunn's deposition, he stated that an employee named Cortes was written up for saying he \"did not like working for black men.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. B at 232. He also testified that an employee named Damien \"was an alcoholic\" and that Dunn had to give Damien warnings for coming to work drunk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 233. Dunn hypothesized that if he had come to work drunk, he \"would have been out the door,\" but he never came to work drunk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 234.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Dunn responds that summary judgment is precluded on his claim of disparate treatment as to disciplinary procedures because Dunn was disciplined for \"the smallest of perceived infractions\" yet other employees who were not members of the protected class were not disciplined when they did the following: (1) called Dunn a [racial slur] and asked if Dunn was a slave; (2) referred to Dunn as \"Byron N,\" which allegedly stood for a racial slur; (3) called Dunn a \"mayate,\" which allegedly is a racial slur in Spanish; (4) called Dunn a \"monkey\"; (5) asked a co-worker why Coffman hired Dunn's \"black ass\"; and (6) left the machine that Dunn was working on, resulting in Dunn being locked inside and having to bang on the machine to get help. Dkt. 36 at 24. Dunn, on the other hand, was disciplined for not completing a form after he was locked in the machine, which Dunn contends he was not required to do, and for \"stealing time\" by not clocking out when he had to leave for a transient ischemic attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dunn contends that this is disparate treatment and it \"does not have to arise from the exact same conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   While the court agrees that the disparate treatment does not have to arise from the exact same conduct, the Fifth Circuit has \"explained consistently that for employees to be similarly situated those employees' circumstances, including their misconduct, must have been 'nearly identical.' \"\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

While the court finds it troubling that Dunn's coworkers were not disciplined when reports were made about racial comments, these comments simply cannot be compared to an issue with failing to clock out or an issue with failing to complete a form for being locked in a machine. Thus, Dunn fails to make a prima facie case for discrimination based on disparate discipline.

The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Dunn received the employee handbook, including the anti-harassment policy. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-1. The anti-harassment policy states that an\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   employee who feels that he or she is a victim of unlawful harassment based upon any protected class or characteristic...by any supervisor, management official, other employee, customer, supplier or any other person in connection with employment at the Company, is encouraged to immediately inform the alleged harasser that the behavior is unwelcome.

The policy submitted by NCC as an exhibit also includes a \"problem solving procedure\" page that provides the following steps:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Step One: Discuss the problem with your immediate supervisor. If this does not provide satisfaction, or if your immediate supervisor is part of the conflict, go to Step Two.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Step Two: Discuss the problem with your immediate supervisor and a Production Supervisor or divisional manager.

After discussing retaliation and anonymous letters, which the problem solving procedure page states the company will not investigate, the procedure requires:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    ANY PROBLEM INVOLVING SAFETY OR HARASSMENT MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY TO A MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBER, OR TO THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT.

Did Dunn Comply with the Policy?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   NCC argues in its reply that Dunn did not comply with NCC's procedure for lodging a complaint because he reported the harassment to his supervisor rather than human resources. Dkt. 44 at 10. However, NCC's policy is not completely clear regarding the reporting procedure. The \"anti-harassment policy\" page states that the employee \"must immediately report\" harassment to human resources or a director if informal means do not work. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-2 at NCC 000127. But the \"problem solving procedure\" page states that problems should be discussed with managers first and that the employee \"is encouraged to request a meeting\" with human resources if discussing it with the manager does not work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457044\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/295/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NCC 000159. The imperative is missing in the problem solving procedure, and the initial meeting with the supervisor is missing from the anti-harassment policy page. The bold-face summation on the problem solving procedure page states that the employee must report any problem involving harassment to a management team member\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   human resources.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457044\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/295/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   It is clear that if Dunn reported harassment on an almost daily basis for the six months he was employed and the harassment was still occurring, Dunn did not get immediate relief from his supervisor. Thus, under the procedure, his next step would be to go up the line. However, Dunn's\n   supervisor allegedly told him that he had been told to get rid of Dunn's \"black ass\" by the people in charge of promotions. In\n   <em>\n    Harvill\n   </em>\n   , the court did not believe the employee had a sufficient excuse not to comply with the procedure just because her direct supervisor had told her not to go to human resources. Here, however, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Dunn, Dunn had a reason to believe that any complaints to individuals who he perceived to have racial animus would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Dunn eventually sent two emails to the corporate office in June. Dkt. 31, Exs. A-20, A-21. Dunn's notes outlining various office happenings from May 23, 2014, through June 13, 2014, are attached to one of the emails. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-20. These notes primarily about other issues in the workplace, but Dunn notes that on June 9, 2014, Coffman told him that a young Caucasian person with no experience was promoted in another department despite there being an African-American with experience in that department, to which Dunn opined in his notes that \"if you have knowledge and you are of a color; your chances of being promoted are slim to none.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A-20 at NCC 000334. He also stated in these notes that it was difficult to work at NCC because of the \"hostile environment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457044\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/295/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (June 13, 2014 entry). In the other email, Dunn stated that he felt \"that it needed to be addressed to someone outside this facility, that is neutral.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The corporate representative appears to have forwarded the emails back to the local facility, and Waggoner stated that she would meet with Dunn the next Monday. Dkt. 31, Exs. A-20, A-21. Waggoner immediately emailed Dunn and told him that the company takes \"this very seriously\" and said they would \"address it on Monday\" when everyone was back in the office. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-22. Dunn met with Waggoner and Dane Tipton, who according to Dunn's note is the \"president,\" on or about June 17, 2014, and Dunn recorded the conversation. Dkt. 31, Exs. F, G-1. Dunn asserts that Waggoner and Tipton attacked him for getting corporate involved. Dkt. 31, Ex. F. During his conversation, Dunn stated that he contacted corporate because he \"felt that it was the right thing to do because [he] had nobody else.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. G-1 at 107. He indicated that he did not \"like coming to human resources\" and that he thought that things had gotten worse since he had talked with Waggoner. Dkt. 31, Ex. G-1 at 5. Later in the conversation, Dunn noted that he had talked to his manager and Waggoner told him that there were people above that and reminded him that they had discussed that during orientation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Tipton told Dunn that he \"took their cards\" away from them and did not give them the opportunity to correct things.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. He stated, \"I have a big issue with that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He reminded Dunn that \"if there's an issue, these two doors are always open.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. He then told Dunn that now that he had \"played this card\" they had to \"do a complete investigation of everybody.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Dunn's employment, however, was terminated about a week later because, according to the separation notice, Dunn \"refused to cooperate in 3 separate investigations and insubordinate to mgt!\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A-30. Thus, while the employer's response was certainly prompt upon receiving these complaints, there can be no determination regarding whether remedial action was reasonably calculated to end the harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   NCC asserts Dunn should have reported the harassment to Waggoner, and Dunn contends that he did report the \"mayate\" incident to Waggoner and she did nothing. In his deposition, Dunn testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   Q: So did you ever go report to Jennifer Waggoner any of the racial comments?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   A: Yes.

What it shows is that Dunn reported something, Waggoner took some\n   action, and Dunn did not believe the action she took cured the issue. The court finds that there is a question of material fact as to what Dunn reported to Waggoner, what she did to remedy the situation, and whether it was effective. Additionally, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Dunn, the court finds that a reasonable juror could find that it was reasonable for Dunn to believe reporting future harassment to Waggoner would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Because there are questions of material fact as to both the elements in dispute, NCC's motion for summary judgment on Dunn's hostile work environment claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Adverse Employment Action and Prima Facie Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   First, as NCC appears to concede, if the court accepts the adverse employment\n   action discussed in the response, then there appears to be a prima facie case. While the court agrees that Dunn's plain assertion of an adverse employment action under the \"retaliation\" cause of action in his complaint is different than the adverse employment action he alleges in his response, the court finds that, reading the complaint as a whole, it can be construed broadly enough to allege that the termination was also in retaliation for Dunn's reports. The evidence, construed in the light most favorable to Dunn, demonstrates that Dunn complained to Waggoner about at least the \"mayate\" incident and he sent the emails to corporate alleging that \"[i]t is for sure, that if you have knowledge and you are of color; your chances of being promoted are slim to none.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A-20. Though Dunn did not sign the emails, he sent them from his email address and corporate easily ascertained who he was. Thus, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Dunn, the emails were actual complaints by Dunn to management of unlawful activity (failing to promote individuals merely because they were members of a protected class). They were in very close temporal proximity to Dunn's termination, and the termination is unquestionably an adverse action. Accordingly, Dunn has established a prima facie case of retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   NCC argues, however, that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Dunn's employment, and Dunn cannot show that its reason is pretext and that the retaliation is the but-for case of his termination. Specifically, NCC asserts that if Dunn contends that the adverse action is his termination, its nondiscriminatory reason for the termination is Dunn's failure to participate in three ongoing investigations and insubordination. Dkt. 31 at 24 (citing Ex. A-29). These are the reasons cited in Dunn's separation notice. Dkt. 31, Ex. A-29. In Waggoner's affidavit, she states that she met with Mr. Tipton and Hillary LaManna, the former General Manager of human resources, to discuss Dunn's conduct. Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6 37. Waggoner states that during this meeting they \"determined that [Dunn's] employment should be terminated because he had not cooperated in the investigation into his Near Miss incident, the harassment allegations he initiated, or the incident regarding his clock in and clock out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. There is some evidence in the record regarding this failure to cooperate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31, Ex. A-14 (statement from James Vau regarding his attempt to interview Dunn about the near miss, in which Vau reports that Dunn walked out of his door saying \"F this\"); Dkt. 31, Ex. A-26 (statement signed by Dunn and Coffman in which Coffman reports that, when Coffman and James Vau attempted to talk to Dunn about failing to clock out, Dunn \"became defensive about the questioning and was uncooperative\"). The court finds that NCC's purported reason for the termination is a legitimate, nondiscrimnatory reason to terminate Dunn's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Pretext\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The question is, however, whether NCC's purported reason is the real reason or whether there is enough evidence in the record to create an issue of material fact as to whether this reason is mere pretext and the real reason Dunn's employment was terminated is because he complained about discriminatory treatment. The court finds that the timing of the termination combined with the other evidence in the record about the employer desiring to terminate Dunn's \"black ass\" and being somewhat perturbed that Dunn \"took their cards away from them\" by reporting to\n   corporate could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that the real reason Dunn was fired\n   <em>\n    at the time he was fired\n   </em>\n   was because he complained about discriminatory treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The court finds there is a question of material fact in regard to whether Dunn's termination was in retaliation for his reports about discrimination. Accordingly, NCC's motion for summary judgment on Dunn's retaliation claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Dunn's objections (Dkt. 36) are SUSTAINED IN PART and OVERRULED IN PART. Dunn's objection to NCC's Exhibit A-9 is SUSTAINED, and the court did not consider Exhibit A-9 when ruling on NCC's motion for summary judgment. Dunn's objections to NCC's other exhibits are OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   NCC's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 31) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. NCC's motion for summary judgment with regard to Dunn's discrimination claim for failure to promote, hostile work environment claim, and retaliation claim is DENIED. NCC's motion for summary judgment with regard to Dunn's discrimination claims for pay discrimination and disparate treatment with regard to discipline and Dunn's disparate impact claim is GRANTED.
