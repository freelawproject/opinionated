B.D. attended GPS under an Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"IDEA\") and the Massachusetts Special Education statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71B. The Doucettes have brought this action individually and on behalf of their son, alleging that B.D. suffered serious physical and emotional harm, including five stress-induced, life-threatening, tonic-clonic seizures, due to the defendants' failure to provide him with appropriate services in school, in violation of his federal and state law rights. The seizures allegedly stopped once B.D. was removed from the Georgetown schools, and the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages only against the entities and individuals involved in providing B.D. services\n   while he was at GPS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition to asserting state law claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count I), negligence (Count II), loss of consortium (Count III), and negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count VI),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in their Amended Complaint (Docket Nos. 20-2 at 6-15, and 20-3) (\"Am.

In support of their \u00a7 1983 claim, the plaintiffs challenge,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the defendants' failure to \"evaluate[ ] the extent of B.D.'s visual impairment to determine the implication on his fine motor skills, education and related services\" as well as the defendants' initial refusal to approve an in-district or out-of-district placement despite the inadequacies of the services available at GPS.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 15). As described in the Amended Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   As a consequence of this syndrome, B.D. has a number of substantial educational limitations, including global developmental delay, with a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disability, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD, NOS), autistic spectrum disorder, seizure disorder, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder and gastrointestinal issues. B.D. also has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a history of choking, low muscle tone and balance defects, together with a high threshold for pain, limited ability to report injury or discomfort, sensory process disorder, visual problems, decreased personal safety awareness, maladaptive behaviors such as bolting and aggression, cognitive impairment, and communication deficits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, of significance to the issues before this court, \"[c]hildren with Chromosome 15q Duplication Syndrome have an increased risk of sudden unexpected death (SUD)\" caused by respiratory or cardiac arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). The plaintiffs contend that this increased risk \"is typically correlated with seizure activity[,]\" as a result of which \"the prevention of seizures in such children is of critical importance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2009, when he was almost three years old, B.D. began attending Perley Elementary School (\"Perley\") in Georgetown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). At Perley, B.D. received special education and related services provided by GPS under an IEP developed pursuant to the IDEA and the Massachusetts Special Education statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71B. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Pursuant to his IEP,\n   B.D. received individual instruction, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language services both within and outside the classroom, home training by an aide, and ... a 1:1 aide trained in CPR and Heimlich maneuvers because of a risk of choking and a risk of bolting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Also pursuant to his IEP, B.D. attended school both during the regular school year and over the summer as part of an \"Extended School Year\" (\"ESY\") program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.D.'s parents were not satisfied with the services that B.D. was receiving at GPS. For example, but without limitation, as early as October 2009, three months after B.D. began attending Perley, B.D.'s parents expressed concerns to GPS, its administrators, educators and staff, based on Mrs. Doucette's personal observations, \"that B.D. was not receiving the educational programming and services required under his IEP and these failures were placing his safety and well-being at risk.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). When B.D. was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and a seizure disorder in December 2009, B.D.'s parents requested that his IEP be amended to include a Seizure Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). While the Seizure Plan was eventually added, according to B.D.'s parents, the appropriate personnel were never properly trained, and the Plan was not appropriately followed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   From January to early March 2010, B.D.'s parents had B.D. evaluated by a number of medical specialists who recommended that an educational program that utilized, to a substantial degree, applied behavior analysis (ABA) methodology, including structured sensory breaks and discrete trials, be added to B.D.'s IEP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). On March 29, 2010, B.D.'s parents complained at an IEP team meeting at which the Superintendent and the Principal were in attendance, that B.D.'s placement at GPS was inappropriate because B.D. was not making educational progress and his developmental delays were increasing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). They also argued that B.D. should be immediately placed in an in-district or out-of-district placement that incorporated ABA methodologies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Members of B.D.'s IEP team \"disagreed that B.D. was not making educational progress, that he needed structured sensory breaks, or that GPS was an inappropriate placement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the March 2010 IEP team meeting, B.D.'s parents continued to complain verbally and in emails to GPS, its administrators, educators and staff, that B.D.'s safety and well-being were at risk because the school \"was not implementing the kinds of interventions he needed to learn, that his aides were not appropriately trained, that he was not receiving sufficient sensory therapies, that he was not being monitored closely and was bolting from class, that he was becoming more aggressive toward other students, and that, after falling and hitting his head, his medical condition and disability were not taken into consideration and he was not provided proper care.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). As a result of these concerns, on May 10, 2010, B.D.'s parents removed B.D. from Perley, and B.D. remained out of school until September 2, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The 2010 BSEA Hearing\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 12, 2010, B.D.'s parents filed a Request for Hearing with the Massachusetts Bureau of Special Education Appeals (\"BSEA\"), seeking an out-of-district placement for B.D. for the 2010-2011 school year on the basis that GPS's proposed IEP was inappropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). B.D.'s parents also sought compensatory services for the time B.D. had been out of school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After conducting hearings in late August 2010, the BSEA hearing officer found that B.D.'s proposed IEP \"was not appropriate and not reasonably calculated to provide\n   B.D. with a free and appropriate public education (\"FAPE\") in the least restrictive environment[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Nevertheless, the hearing officer found that GPS was an appropriate placement because \"GPS could amend the IEP to make it appropriate through additions and modifications,\" and because GPS \"had the capacity to develop an appropriate ABA-based substantially-separate classroom placement for B.D. at the start of the 2010-2011 school year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs allege that based on the BSEA decision and on explicit assurances from GPS \"that it would develop an ABA-based, substantially separate Transition classroom that would be ready for the September 2010 start of school, and that an Individual Student Safety Plan and Seizure Plan would be integrated in his IEP,\" they allowed B.D. to return to Perley in September 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). As detailed below, the plaintiffs were of the opinion that the defendants never fulfilled their obligations under the IEP or provided the services that B.D. needed and to which he was entitled. However, they never filed any additional administrative claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     B.D.'s Service Dog\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B.D.'s seizure activity increased after he returned to school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). B.D.'s parents allege that despite assurances to the contrary, the defendants were not prepared to handle B.D.'s seizure activity appropriately. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32). As a result, B.D. was inappropriately sent home on occasion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33). This caused B.D. to lose educational and developmental opportunities and to suffer a disruption in his schedules and routines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In September 2011, B.D. began attending Kindergarten at Perley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). Shortly thereafter, in or about November 2011, B.D. privately received a specially trained and certified service dog that provided \"autism assistance service, facilitated guide, search and rescue, and assistance with behavior disruption, anxiety, balance and seizure alerting, all of which were of benefit to B.D.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). B.D.'s parents allege that \"[t]he service dog permitted B.D. to develop some independence and confidence and helped him bridge social barriers\" and that \"B.D.'s behavior in social situations improved when his service dog was present.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36). Nevertheless, B.D. was not permitted to bring his service dog to school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). This denial constitutes the basis of the plaintiffs' Rehabilitation Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In or about the spring of 2012, B.D. began exhibiting increased anxiety, staring, and inattention, and the Principal and B.D.'s mother discussed whether the use of B.D.'s service dog in school would help with B.D.'s anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). However, the plaintiffs allege that the School Committee and Superintendent \"blocked B.D.'s access to his service dog.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, B.D.'s parents allege that \"[i]n order for B.D. to have access to his service dog with GPS as the handler, [B.D.'s parents] were requested to sign and agree to a School Committee approved policy that was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). B.D.'s parents allegedly declined to sign and agree to the policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). B.D.'s parents also allege that the Superintendent \"directed the performance of a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) to determine whether B.D. required the use of a service dog as an accommodation and to determine whether the IEP would be amended to include a service dog as an accommodation. The FBA data was to be collected in a trial period to take place during the academic school year, not during ESY and with B.D.'s mother present as the [dog's] handler.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). No further details regarding this FBA are provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The 2012 ESY Program and B.D.'s Seizures\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The 2012 ESY program was held at Penn Brook Elementary School (\"Penn\n   Brook\") as opposed to its previous location at B.D.'s school, Perley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). As represented by the parties at oral argument, the location change was due to necessary repairs at Perley. B.D.'s parents were very upset by the location change, and were very concerned that Penn Brook would not be a safe facility for B.D. and that GPS would not be able to implement B.D.'s IEP appropriately there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46). In their view, the defendants never lived up to their assurances that the ESY program would be ready and appropriate for B.D. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that from the start of the 2012 ESY program, GPS failed to appropriately implement B.D.'s IEP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-48). For example, B.D.'s parents allege that pursuant to his IEP in effect at that time, B.D. was to have:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   limited environmental stimuli, special consideration for his sensory processing needs in any larger group environment, a \"quiet area\" such as a \"tent and/or pillow area\" for \"quiet time,\" picture schedule, picture supports such as a choice board, first/then board, mini schedules, \"consistent routine,\" transition cues, preferential seating for sensory needs, a slant board, supported seating that provided 90/90/90 degree angles (Rifton chair), discrete trials, preparation \"for planned changes in staffing/schedule,\" [and] structured sensory breaks[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47). Nevertheless, \"many of these accommodations were not provided.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, B.D. was faced with an unfamiliar setting and improperly trained staff who failed to follow his IEP, and he was placed with unfamiliar students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49). As alleged, \"[t]hese drastic changes were overwhelming for B.D., then six (6) years old and suffering from an anxiety disorder, visual impairment, sensory process disorder and autistic spectrum disorder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). The problem was exacerbated by the fact that \"B.D. was not permitted to be accompanied by his service dog, with whom he had been working since 2011, and who could have helped him visually comprehend this new environment and minimize the stress from his new environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 5, 2012, while at ESY at Penn Brook, B.D. experienced a tonic-clonic seizure, which lasted over twenty minutes and required the administration of Diastat gel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51). 911 was called and B.D. was transported by ambulance to Lawrence General Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As a result of this seizure, B.D.'s doctor prescribed Keppra in addition to his other medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On July 6, 2012, B.D.'s parents \"demanded that B.D.'s IEP be amended and that his service dog be added as an accommodation effective immediately.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). GPS and the School Committee \"denied the Parents' request and refused to amend B.D.'s IEP to include a service dog as an accommodation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, they allowed B.D. to bring his service dog to school with his mother as the dog's handler, on a trial basis beginning on or about July 10, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.D.'s parents continued to express their concern that B.D.'s aide/special education teacher was not appropriately trained, and that \"the constant program changes and inconsistencies in how his IEP was being implemented\" contributed to increased aggressive behavior and anxiety on the part of B.D. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-54). However, nothing improved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). On July 18, 2012, while attending the ESY program, B.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   suffered a second tonic-clonic seizure \"reported as two (2) separate seizures, one lasting forty-five (45) seconds and a second lasting twenty-five (25) minutes, and require[ing] the administration of Diastat gel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55). 911 was called and B.D. was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital (\"MGH\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). B.D.'s doctor adjusted his medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 26, 2012, one of B.D.'s doctors noted that B.D. had \"regressed a bit in his development over the summer with less academic support\" and that his gastrointestinal issues had worsened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). On July 30, 2012, B.D.'s parents met with the Special Education Director, the Principal, and the Superintendent and took the position that B.D.'s \"continued placement at GPS was inappropriate, that B.D. was at risk [there], and that GPS had failed to take actions to effectively mitigate those risks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). B.D.'s parents allege that \"GPS continued to refuse to consider the continuum of educational placements for B.D. as required under his IEP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 31, 2012, while attending his ESY program, B.D. suffered a third tonic-clonic seizure which lasted approximately eight minutes and required the administration of Diastat gel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59). 911 was called and B.D. was transported to Lawrence General Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Then, on August 6, 2012, while attending his ESY program, B.D. suffered a fourth tonic-clonic seizure which lasted approximately eleven minutes and required the administration of Diastat gel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). 911 was called and B.D. was transported to MGH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On that same day, B.D.'s mother communicated to the Superintendent, the Principal, and the Special Education Director that \"the most probable cause for B.D.'s extraordinary increase in seizure activity over the past month\" was GPS's \"extremely poor and ineffective\" implementation of B.D.'s IEP and GPS's \"unacceptable\" \"lack of planning, training and execution [of his IEP].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). B.D.'s mother also expressed her concern that B.D.'s ESY placement was not only inappropriate, but was also unsafe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). B.D.'s parents would no longer \"subject their son to unsafe, unhealthy and life threatening situations at GPS, and wanted answers as to GPS's proposed plan to implement the agreed upon services and education in a safe and appropriate learning environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). B.D.'s parents then removed B.D. from GPS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On August 13, 2012, the Superintendent advised B.D.'s mother that \"her questions needed to be answered by 'the team' \" and that \"input from medical personnel should also be considered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). The Superintendent also advised that she would work with the Principal and the Special Education Director to determine if GPS would offer compensatory services, and stated that she believed that GPS could provide \"the program detailed in his IEP beginning in September without an out-of-school placement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). Despite input from B.D.'s doctor recommending that B.D. be removed from his current classroom setting, and kept out of school until an appropriate placement was located, on August 30, 2012, the Special Education Director advised B.D.'s parents that B.D.'s placement would remain at GPS, that GPS was expecting B.D. to attend the start of school on September 5, 2012, and that any \"extended absences will be considered truancy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Shortly after arriving at Perley for the first day of school on September 5, 2012, B.D. suffered a fifth tonic-clonic seizure, which lasted approximately four minutes before the administration of Diastat gel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66). 911 was called and B.D. was transported unresponsive to MGH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After B.D. suffered the fifth tonic-clonic seizure, his parents rescinded his educational\n   placement at GPS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67). He has not returned to the Georgetown schools since then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     B.D.'s Eye Examinations\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition to defendants' refusal to allow B.D. to have his service dog, the plaintiffs further challenge the defendants' treatment of his visual impairment as being in violation of his constitutional rights. On March 23, 2012, B.D.'s parents had taken him to his pediatric ophthalmologist because he had failed a school vision screening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). B.D.'s doctor found B.D. to have depth perception issues and recommended that B.D. be evaluated by a Developmental Optometrist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). B.D.'s parents then requested that GPS pay for the recommended evaluation, but \"their request was denied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). B.D.'s parents further allege that they \"continued to request that B.D. be evaluated by a Developmental Optometrist\" but \"the request was declined by GPS\" until July 6, 2012, the day after B.D.'s first tonic-clonic seizure at GPS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On that day, GPS informed the parents that GPS would pay for B.D. to be evaluated by an optometrist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On or about July 19, 2012, B.D. was evaluated, at GPS's expense, by an optometrist, Dr. Robin S. Blair, who found his \"vision performance 'unskilled,' his focusing ability 'passable,' and his eye teaming ability 'unskilled,' \" recommended further testing, and referred B.D. to a practitioner who specialized in behavioral and developmental optometric vision care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56). B.D.'s parents allege that the Special Education Director \"denied the recommended further evaluation[,]\" advising B.D.'s mother that GPS had \"only agreed to the initial eye exam.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These facts form the basis of plaintiffs' allegation that GPS violated the IDEA's \"child find\" provision\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   by failing to appropriately identify and evaluate B.D.'s visual impairment. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Out-of-District Placement and Subsequent Health Issues\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In November 2012, GPS and the School Committee agreed to place B.D. in an extended evaluation in an out-of-district placement, and, after the evaluation period, agreed to an out-of-district placement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67, 69-70). As of the filing of the amended complaint in this matter, B.D. has remained in an out-of-district placement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In April 2013, B.D. was diagnosed with Cerebral Visual Impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72). On March 19, 2014, B.D. was admitted overnight to the Acute Psychiatric Services department at MGH due to \"increased aggression, paranoia and hallucinations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73). From May 9, 2014 until July 31, 2014, B.D. was hospitalized at Hampstead Hospital for severe aggression and hallucinations and was diagnosed with \"Disruptive Behavior Disorder NOS and Psychotic Disorder NOS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to the plaintiffs, B.D. has been attending Berkshire Meadows in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, since July 2014, \"through his IEP\" and \"making developmental and educational progress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75).

Plaintiffs argue that the IDEA's exhaustion requirement does not apply to their claims, and, in the alternative, that they should be excused from complying with the exhaustion requirement on the grounds of futility and undue burden. For the reasons set forth below, this court finds that plaintiffs were required to exhaust their administrative remedies under the IDEA with respect to their Rehabilitation Act and Section 1983 claims, and are not excused from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Rehabilitation Act\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that the defendants' \"refusal to permit B.D. access to his service dog in his educational setting\" constituted a violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 104). They argue that by that claim, they are not alleging the denial of a FAPE, but are only alleging discrimination on the basis of B.D.'s disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Suppl. Opp. (Docket No. 66) at 4). This argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To determine whether plaintiffs seek relief under the IDEA, the court must evaluate the \"gravamen\" of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the facts detailed\n   above establish, there can be no question that the plaintiffs' entire complaint is premised on their contention that the defendants failed to provide an adequate IEP, failed to provide the services they agreed to provide under an IEP, and failed to address B.D.'s physical and psychological needs. Applying the hypothetical suggested by the\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   court, these are not grievances that an adult at the school, such as an employee or visitor, could have pressed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the entire complaint is based on B.D.'s IEP, B.D.'s parents' concern that B.D. was not receiving appropriate services in his public education, and their contention that the lack of such services was causing B.D. serious harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As further evidence that the plaintiffs' claims relate to the denial of a FAPE, the plaintiffs \"previously invoked the IDEA's formal procedures to handle the dispute[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is impossible to conclude other than the essence of the Amended Complaint is the denial of a FAPE to B.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The plaintiffs attempt to segregate out the request that B.D. be allowed to bring his service dog with him to school as being distinct from his IEP. This argument is defeated by the allegations of the complaint, as well as logic. Plaintiffs specifically allege that they \"demanded that B.D.'s IEP be amended and that his service dog be added as an accommodation\" and that the defendants \"denied the Parents' request and refused to amend B.D.'s IEP to include a service dog as an accommodation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 (school considers a Functional Behavior Assessment \"to determine whether the IEP would be amended to include a service dog as an accommodation.\")). The plaintiffs' claims relating to the denial of B.D.'s use of service dog are part and parcel of their contentions about the failure of the defendants to provide a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, the demand for the use of the service dog is the type of complaint that could appropriately be raised before the BSEA in connection with a challenge to an IEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9959512\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/206/#p210\">\n    214 F.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"any matter relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education\" may be brought before the BSEA);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.

Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that such a claim can be maintained, in the instant case the gravamen of the allegations remain the denial of a FAPE. As detailed above, the plaintiffs' contention is that failing to have an adequate IEP, and failing to comply with their obligations under the IEP, the defendants caused B.D. serious harm. Whether stated in terms of substantive\n   due process, or a denial of a FAPE, B.D.'s parents contend that their son was placed in \"unsafe, unhealthy and life threatening situations at GPS\" and needed to be provided \"agreed upon services and education in a safe and appropriate learning environment.\" (Am.

They also contend that GPS violated the IDEA's \"child find\" provision by delaying B.D.'s evaluation by an optometrist and, ultimately, denying B.D.'s evaluation by an optometric behavioral specialist. These specific objections are well-suited for evaluation by a BSEA hearing officer, especially given the broad scope of such hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9959512\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/206/#p210\">\n    214 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6) ).

Here, the plaintiffs' principal argument in support of their contention that administrative exhaustion is futile is that the remedies plaintiffs seek (compensatory damages for physical injuries B.D. sustained while attending GPS from July to September 2012 and for physical and psychological injuries to his parents including the cost of medical care for B.D.'s five seizures) are unavailable under the IDEA.

After all, the administrative process facilitates the\n   compilation of a fully developed record by a factfinder versed in the educational needs of disabled children-and that record is an invaluable resource for a state or federal court required to adjudicate a subsequent civil action covering the same terrain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451400\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/52/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451400\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/52/#p58\">\n    at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The IDEA's administrative machinery places those with specialized knowledge-educational professionals-at the center of the decisionmaking process, entrusting to them the initial evaluation of whether a disabled student is receiving a free appropriate public education.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451400\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/52/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451400\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/52/#p58\">\n    at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, \"the educational expertise of the BSEA and its capacity to collect and evaluate a complicated educational record\" can greatly assist a court \"not only in crafting appropriate educational services, but also where the ultimate question is whether a disabled child was denied his/her right to an equal education[.]\"\n   <em>\n    CBDE Public Schs. v.

Mass. Sept. 27, 2012) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Consequently, it is clear in the First Circuit that the fact that the plaintiffs are seeking only monetary damages does not relieve them of the requirement that they exhaust their administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The plaintiffs' other arguments are equally unavailing. For example, they argue that development of the factual record is not required in this case because the record has already been developed in the 2010 BSEA proceeding, and in connection with the parties' communications and agreement pertaining to B.D.'s IEP and eventual out-of-district placement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 11-12). Similarly, plaintiffs argue that exhaustion should be excused on the basis that it would have been overly burdensome because plaintiffs had already adjudicated defendants' inability to implement B.D.'s IEP and provide for his education and safety needs in connection with the 2010 BSEA hearings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). However, these arguments do not excuse exhaustion. The facts central to this matter, relating to the circumstances that allegedly caused B.D. to suffer seizures during the summer of 2012 (in other words, the failure to appropriately implement his IEP and provide the supports he needed), had not occurred at the time of the 2010 BSEA hearing and have yet to be determined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, but without limitation, the issue whether B.D.'s IEP should have been amended to add a service dog, or whether B.D. should have been entitled to additional visual screenings had not even arisen by the time of the 2010 hearing. \"[T]he BSEA's record [would] provide a fundamental and useful compilation of facts and initial legal analysis by an educational expert with respect to the educational claims. Consequently, neither the record nor the analysis would be, as [plaintiff] contends, inherently wasteful.\"\n   <em>\n    CBDE Public Schs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204482296\">\n    2012 WL 4482296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs argue that exhaustion is futile and should be excused because the condition creating the damage has ceased in that B.D. is no longer at GPS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 10). This argument was expressly rejected by the\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   court in response to an argument that exhaustion should not be required where the student had already graduated.\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451400\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/52/#p58\">\n    276 F.3d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   court held, not only is compensatory education an available remedy even after graduation, but \"[t]he IDEA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme, and the plaintiffs could have invoked it at any of several different points during [the student's ...] school years. It would be a\n   hollow gesture to say that exhaustion is required-and then to say that plaintiffs, by holding back until the affected child graduates, can evade the requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451400\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/52/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In sum, proceedings before the BSEA would provide a reviewing court with valuable information in this case, including, without limitation, whether the service dog should have been added to the IEP, whether B.D. was entitled to further optometric services, whether an in or out-of-district placement was required after the 2010 BSEA decision but before GPS agreed to one, and whether the defendants were appropriately implementing B.D.'s IEP during the summer of 2012. The plaintiffs have not met their burden of establishing that exhaustion of administrative remedies would be futile or unduly burdensome, since such proceedings would involve issues not previously addressed by the BSEA.
