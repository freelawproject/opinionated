First, at step 302, the controller in a computing device acquires a digital image of a person.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 4:56-59. One technique is to have a human operator position the human subject and instruct a camera to take a photograph.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 4:59-5:6. In order for the computing device to determine and display the skin defects associated with that image, the image must be digitized and the digital image data transferred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 5:6-9. The specification provides other ways to retrieve the digital image: it may be submitted by the human subject over the computer, accessed from a database, or created by scanning a physical photograph.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 5:9-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, at step 304, the computing device determines a sub-image of the entire digital image for analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:12-18. This sub-imaging process can be done manually by a human operator or automatically by the computing device, and the decision about whether to use manual or automatic sub-imaging can also be automated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:29-42. When manual sub-image determination is selected, the human operator either draws the sub-image border or follows prompts from the computing device to select particular landmarks (e.g., the corner of the mouth, nose, or eye) that are used to draw the border.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:43-59. When automatic sub-image determination is selected, the system provides two options: semi-automatic and fully automatic sub-imaging.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:60-62. In semi-automatic sub-imaging, the user identifies the location of some facial landmarks and the computing device determines the remaining landmarks automatically by comparing the user-entered landmarks to a standard template.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:63-7:13. In fully automatic sub-imaging, the computing device determines all of the landmarks by employing, for example, a\n   facial feature recognition algorithm to search for particular patterns in the digital image.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 7:17-27.

According to the specification, the system can be configured to locate multiple defect types, such as acne, liver spots, freckles, moles, wrinkles, and pores.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:4-10. Specifically, the computing device uses known algorithms to locate the areas in the image that contain the type of defect desired.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:6-32. The system has the capability to create a new image that visually displays the skin defects by changing the shade of the pixels in the defect areas or drawing a circle around the defect areas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:33-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   From there, the computing device determines a numerical severity associated with each of the identified defect areas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:47-48. The specification describes two approaches for calculating the numerical severity: (1) subtracting the color content of the pixels associated with the skin defect from the color content of the pixels in the area surrounding the defect; and (2) counting the total number of pixels associated with the skin defect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:48-60. The numerical severity figures may be added or averaged, and the aggregated figure may be normalized by taking into account human perception of different defects.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:60-9:4. Finally, the normalized severity figure is compared to data for persons with a similar age, geography, or ethnicity to determine a percentile.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 9:5-9. The specification provides an example where a person is determined to be in the 55th or 56th percentile because \"55% of [the] sample group of people in the analyzed person's age group had a normalized severity for the current defect type below the analyzed person's severity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 9:9-14. The computing device repeats the above analysis for all of the defect areas and defect types.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 9:15-24. At the end of that process, the numerical severities may also be aggregated and scored, and the computing device may determine an overall skin severity by using one of several well-known methods.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 9:25-10:40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Fourth, at step 308, the results of the foregoing analysis are displayed to the human operator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 10:43-57. The specification offers a number of viewing alternatives. For example, the user may select which defect types to display through a graphical user interface.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 10:58-11:3.

This formulation flows from the language of the claim. Claim 1 recites a method with four steps: (1) retrieving an image of a person, '003 patent, col. 12:59; (2) performing electronic analysis on the image \"to locate an area containing a skin defect,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 12:60-62; (3) assigning a \"numerical severity\" to the defect area,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 12:63-64; and (4) comparing the \"numerical severity\" to a predefined value for a particular population,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 12:65-67. The first two steps are consonant with claim 1's preamble, which recites \"[a] method for locating one or more visual skin defects of a portion of a person,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 12:57-58, and form much of the substance of the process. The last two steps go beyond the identification of a skin defect by defining the severity of the defect with a comparative numerical\n   figure. Thus, acquiring and analyzing a digital image of a person to locate and quantify skin defects accurately captures what the \"character as a whole\" of claim 1 is \"directed to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

As a preliminary matter,\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   was decided before the two-step framework was announced in\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , so there is a question whether the outcome in\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   remains good law. To be sure, many of the high-level doctrinal points accurately reflect the current state of \u00a7 101 jurisprudence. For example, since\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit has repeated\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   's\n   observation that \"inventions with specific applications or improvements to technologies in the marketplace are not likely to be so abstract that they override the statutory language and framework of the Patent Act.\"\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   , 827 F.3d at 1350 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n    627 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   869 ). On the other hand, some of\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   's methodology appears outdated. For instance,\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   creates a heightened standard for ineligibility in requiring that the abstract nature of the claims be exhibited \"so manifestly as to override the broad statutory categories of eligible subject matter and the statutory context that directs primary attention on the patentability criteria of the rest of the Patent Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n    627 F.3d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   appears to place significant weight on the fact that the claim incorporated generic computer components-namely, a \"memory\" and \"printer and display devices\"-to deem the claims patent-eligible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n    at 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At a minimum, because\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   was decided before the two-step\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   framework, it is difficult to ascertain whether the reasoning is more aptly characterized as falling under step one or step two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Regardless of whether\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   is binding, the Court finds that case readily distinguishable from the instant case. In particular, the claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   recited the steps in the process of rendering a halftone image, namely, \"comparing, pixel by pixel, the digital image against a blue noise mask.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n    at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claims also defined the features of the mask, which had to be \"a random non-deterministic, non-white noise single valued function ... designed to produce visually pleasing dot profiles when thresholded at any level of said gray scale images.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053189\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/859/\">\n    at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this way, the claims in\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   purported to cover a defined process, not any process, of rendering a halftone image. Those claims stand in sharp contrast to claim 1, which recites the process of analyzing a digital image to locate and quantify skin defects but not any specific steps to take to accomplish the location and quantification. Indeed, claim 1's quantification steps do not appear to require any particular electronic process at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   While Plaintiffs note that both the claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   and claim 1's electronic analysis step involve \"computerized processing of pixelated, binary data of a digital image,\" Opp. at 23, that comparison is superficial. The same could be said of all digital imaging patents, but the Federal Circuit has already concluded that claims that focus on assembling and manipulating data in the realm of image processing may be patent-ineligible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Digitech Image Techs., LLC v.

Put another way, not every invention that automates a process or employs a computer is patent-eligible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Credit Acceptance Corp. v.

Cir. 2017) (\"[M]ere automation of manual processes using generic computers does not constitute a patentable improvement in computer technology.\"). The proper inquiry is not to generalize about classes of claims, but to discern the focus of the claim at issue. For the reasons stated above, claim 1 is directed to acquiring and analyzing information, and thus claim 1 is directed to an abstract idea pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    FairWarning\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

Opp. at 23-24. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that claim 1 is \"clearly rooted in computerized processing of pixelated, binary data of a digital image, and tied to the apparatus and specific algorithms described in the specification for that purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276570\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1044/#p1055\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   A claim is not abstract if it \"improve[s] the functioning of the computer itself\" or \"improves an existing technological process.\"\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2358-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs do not provide any additional analysis for claims 2-4, 8, and 11-12 beyond the one paragraph at the end of their opposition that the Court has already rejected in its analysis of claim 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 23-24. Nevertheless, the Court provides an overview of all of these claims. The Court first addresses claims 2, 3, and 12; then addresses claims 4, 8, and 11; and finally addresses claim 13 and 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

For example, the step of \"electronically analyzing the first digital image of the face of the person to determine an overall skin characteristic\" in claim 12 is very similar to the informational analysis step of \"determining a first numerical severity associated with the area containing the skin defect\" in claim 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '003 patent, col. 12:57-67, 13:57-60.

Claims 4, 8, and 11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Claim 4 depends on claim 1, and claims 8 and 11 both depend on claim 4. Claim 4 introduces additional steps for electronically creating and displaying a second digital image that shows the defect area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 13:10-13. The specification explains that this result may be accomplished by, for example, changing the\n   shade of the pixels in the defect areas or drawing a circle around the defect areas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:33-46. Claim 8 adds a step of alternating between displaying the first and second digital images,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 13:32-36, and claim 11 specifies the range of possible skin defects to be detected,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 13:53-56. In comparison to claim 1, claims 4, 8, and 11 recite further manipulation of data and display of the results. Those limitations are equally abstract.

Thus, accepting Plaintiffs' contention that claims 13 and 14 are properly understood as means-plus-function claims, their scope is confined to the corresponding structures in the specification and equivalents. More specifically, at this stage of the proceedings, claims 13 and 14 are limited to the specification-provided means for \"acquiring a ... digital image,\" \"electronically analyzing,\" \"determining a ... numerical [figure],\" and \"generating a comparison.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Before turning to the merits of the abstract-idea inquiry, the Court first addresses two procedural arguments raised by Plaintiffs. First, Plaintiffs identify a district court case in which the court denied a \u00a7 101 motion to dismiss based on the defendants' failure to show that \"the scope of the means-plus-function claims ... [was] similar to the scope of the non-means-plus-function claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Uniloc USA, Inc. v. AVG Techs. USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-00393-RWS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201154927\">\n    2017 WL 1154927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 28, 2017). Here, the Court deems the proper course to be to fully scrutinize each claim, including by determining each claim's appropriate scope. Second, Plaintiffs argue that QuantifiCare has waived any contentions about claim 13 because those arguments were not raised in the Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 47 at 2-3. Although QuantifiCare does not explicitly mention claim 13 in its Motion to Dismiss, the Motion makes clear QuantifiCare's belief that all asserted claims are invalid under \u00a7 101 for the reasons that claim 1 is invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 6 (\"All claims asserted against [QuantifiCare] are basically\n   premised on claim 1.\"). QuantifiCare brought up nearly identical claim 14, and QuantifiCare's arguments in the Motion to Dismiss and Reply are of the same nature-that the patent does not reveal anything more than a non-inventive abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 12. Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs had a sufficient opportunity to present their response, and QuantifiCare's claim 13 arguments are not waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court turns to the merits of the abstract-idea inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that incorporating the implementation details from the specification shifts the \"character as a whole\" of claims 13 and 14 from acquiring and analyzing information. Opp. at 16, 19. For purposes of the \u00a7 101 abstract-idea inquiry, though, the U.S. Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have often treated method claims in the same manner as apparatus and media claims that are \"configured to implement the same idea\" as the method claims.\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2360 ;\n   <em>\n    CyberSource\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824818\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1366/#p1372\">\n    654 F.3d at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (treating an apparatus claim with means-plus-function language as a method claim). In this case, too, the Court fails to see how the focus of claims 13 and 14 is anything different than the abstract processes of acquiring and analyzing information at issue in claim 1. That result is not changed even if the Court considers Plaintiffs' submitted declaration of Sachin Patwardhan, which merely spells out the algorithmic processes in more detail. ECF No. 42. In particular, as noted above, resort to the specification's description of each step demonstrates the abstractness of the claims because the implementation involves \"analyzing information by steps people go through in their minds, or by mathematical algorithms.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec. Power Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs make no headway by referring to the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Amdocs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176478\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1288/#p1301\">\n    841 F.3d 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the court did not make a step one determination at all, but instead decided it was appropriate to bypass the step one analysis and evaluate the claims under step two.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176478\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1288/#p1301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176478\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1288/#p1301\">\n    at 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, as discussed more fully below, the claims in\n   <em>\n    Amdocs\n   </em>\n   employed generic computer components \"in an unconventional distributed fashion to solve a particular technological problem.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176478\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1288/#p1301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176478\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1288/#p1301\">\n    at 1300-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the specification here makes clear that the processes are well-known and the components are not arranged in an unconventional way that solves some particular technological problem. The Court therefore concludes that claims 13 and 14 are directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Accordingly, claims 2-4, 8, and 11-14 are directed to an abstract idea for essentially the same reasons that claim 1 is directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n    Step Two for Claim 1 of the '003 Patent -Evaluation of Abstract Claim for an Inventive Concept\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Having found that claims 1-4, 8, and 11-14 of the '003 Patent are directed to an abstract idea under step one of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the Court proceeds to step two. Here too the Court begins its analysis with claim 1 of the '003 Patent.

Accordingly, the Federal Circuit has consistently declined to find that an individual claim element supplies an inventive concept where it requires nothing more than a generic computer component or a recitation of a routine or conventional computer function.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I\n   </em>\n   , 850 F.3d at 1341 (no inventive concept where \"the claims recite both a generic computer element-a processor-and a series of generic computer 'components' that merely restate their individual functions-i.e., organizing, mapping, identifying, defining, detecting, and modifying\");\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 1263 (no inventive concept where the claim \"simply recites that the abstract idea of remote delivery will be implemented using the conventional components and functions generic to cellular telephones\");\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1345\">\n    776 F.3d at 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no inventive concept where claim recites \"storing information\" into memory and using a computer to \"translate the shapes on a physical page into typeface characters\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   None of the elements of claim 1, assessed individually, amount to anything more than generic computer implementation. Indeed, Plaintiffs do not argue that any individual element of claim 1 encompasses such an inventive concept. Opp. at 24.

With regard to the individual method steps, the specification states many times that the necessary programming is conventional and well-known and does not utilize a new technique for analyzing digital images. For example, the specification teaches that acquiring the digital image may involve taking a photo and digitizing the picture \"in a known manner,\" such as by using a flatbed scanner, then transferring the digital image data to the computing device for analysis.

Ordered Combination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Turning to the ordered combination of elements of claim 1, the Court also finds that claim 1 fails to recite an inventive concept. Claim 1's combination of elements does not differentiate the process from the abstract idea of acquiring and analyzing information. Contrary to Plaintiffs' suggestion, claim 1 does not offer a \"non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\"\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   , 827 F.3d at 1350. Instead, all of the elements are arranged in a conventional and generic way. Claim 1 does not require a new technique for analyzing information, but rather follows the familiar progression of acquiring and analyzing information of a desired type to extract certain results from that information. In fact, as the specification acknowledges, beauty counselors have long followed the same series of steps that appear in claim 1. '003 patent, col. 1:26-27. In particular, beauty counselors examine clients to identify skin defects, then communicate information about the \"type, quantity, and location of those defects\" and recommend treatments to reduce or eliminate those defects.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:27-33. Claim 1's automation of some\n   of these straightforward steps does not provide an inventive concept either. To the extent that claim 1 invokes computers, nothing in the claim, understood in light of the specification, requires anything other than conventional computers and components for gathering and analyzing the desired information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that claim 1's ordered combination of elements encompasses an inventive concept. First, Plaintiffs argue that claim 1 as a whole provides for the comprehensible display of accurate information about individual cosmetic conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 21. However, the Federal Circuit has already rejected the notion that selecting and manipulating information \"to provide a humanly comprehensible amount of information useful for users\" is itself sufficient to \"transform the otherwise-abstract processes\" of acquiring and analyzing information.\n   <em>\n    Elec.

That holding disposes of Plaintiffs' first argument about an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs suggest that claim 1's combination of elements \"enables predictive analytics through which the invention may forecast and simulate future skin conditions specific to a subject's particular demographic,\" Opp. at 21, but Plaintiffs' description does not accurately capture the claim.

Here, claim 1 does not focus on any advance in predictive analytics. More specifically, claim 1 neither claims simulating the improving or worsening of skin conditions, nor recites what particular steps are taken to enable such functionality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 23 (asserting only that claims \"made possible\" computerized display of the simulation of improved or worsened skin conditions).

At their core, Plaintiffs' arguments imply that claim 1's combination of elements encompass an inventive concept because the elements have never before been combined.

For example, Plaintiffs point to the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Amdocs\n   </em>\n   . There, the Federal Circuit held that claims related to solutions for managing accounting and billing data over large, disparate networks recited an inventive concept because the claims contained \"specific enhancing limitation[s] that necessarily incorporate[d] the invention's distributed architecture.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176478\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1288/#p1301\">\n    841 F.3d at 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Ameritox\n   </em>\n   , the district court addressed claims related to collecting and testing urine samples, which required normalizing the urine drug concentration based on the patient's hydration and urinary output volume.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306767\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/88/885/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306767\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/88/885/\">\n    at 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In particular, the specification noted that the addition of the normalization step overcame an identified problem in prior-art systems: those systems could test for the presence or absence of drugs but could not compare drug quantity amounts because of the variation in drug concentrations in urine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306767\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/88/885/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306767\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/88/885/\">\n    at 912-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While claim 1 here could be construed to also contain a normalization step, the '003 Patent nowhere suggests that this addition is a unique solution addressed to a unique problem in skin-defect location or quantification.

As the specification of the '003 Patent explains, while beauty counselors have long provided consultations, those consultations are \"very subjective.\" '003 patent, col. 1:34. Beauty counselors do not always \"identify the same type or number of skin defects\" and may have trouble \"communicat[ing] the defects she is seeing to the client.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:34-40.

What claim 30 is directed to-electronically determining a sub-image of a digital image by reference to facial features and electronically locating skin defects within that sub-image-seeks to solve these problems by having a computerized system determine the area for analysis and perform the analysis. The use of electronic determination and analysis purports to eliminate or reduce the subjective nature of the consultations previously executed by humans. Moreover, the errors that can occur by using an electronic system are purportedly avoided by incorporating a step that identifies facial landmarks (including the corner of the eye, nose, or mouth) so that they can be excluded from analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 15:15-23;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:19-20 (\"By eliminating [those] portions of the acquired image ... from the analysis process, fewer errors occur.\"). Overall, claim 30 can reasonably be understood as an improvement to facial image processing technology itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Additionally, claim 30 purportedly provides a specific implementation of this improvement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 1258 (holding a patent to be abstract because the asserted claims were \"entirely functional in nature\" and \"untethered to any specific or concrete way of implementing [that function]\"). As discussed above, claim 30 is directed to electronically determining a sub-image of a digital image\n   <em>\n    by\n   </em>\n   reference to facial features and electronically locating skin defects within that sub-image. These two functions-electronically determining a sub-image and electronically locating skin defects within that sub-image-are specific technical implementation details that shift the focus of claim 30\n   beyond a disembodied, functional goal. With respect to the first function, claim 30 requires that the electronic determination of the sub-image be based on a separate identification of landmarks, which must include at least the corner of an eye, a nose, or a mouth. That setup permits the second function to be more meaningful because the electronic location of skin defects is limited to those within the sub-image.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '003 patent, Abstract (\"[T]he system determines which area(s) of the image to analyze using landmarks such as the corner of the eye.\"). In this way, \"[t]he claimed process uses a combined order of specific rules that renders information into a specific format that is then used and applied to create desired results,\" namely, an accurate identification within the sub-image of defect areas containing a visual skin defect that are less than about 10% of the size of the original digital image.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McRO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n    837 F.3d at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The specification adds further technical contour, as it describes each of these steps in detail.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '003 patent, col. 6:12-7:27 (describing four different methods for electronically determining a sub-image by using facial landmarks);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 7:41-54 (describing alternative embodiment where the sub-image is determined by examining the color values of multiple pixels);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 7:58-8:46 (describing what constitutes a skin defect and how the system electronically locates that skin defect). In addition, the specification underscores that these features are significant because they enable specific capabilities within the system. For example, using a portion of the original image that has eliminated certain facial landmarks-like the corner of the nose, mouth, and eye-enables more accurate image analysis by avoiding the discolorations associated with those areas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:20-23. As another example, employing algorithms related to various skin defects enables consistent determination of the location and number of skin defects within the sub-image.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 8:4-18. As such, claim 30's recitation of these two functions, electronically determining a sub-image and electronically locating skin defects within that sub-image, appears to provide meaningful restrictions on\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the larger goal of enabling accurate identification of skin defects in facial image processing is accomplished. Accordingly, taking these two features together, claim 30 is directed to a specific implementation of an improvement to facial image processing technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   So stated-and construing the pleadings in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as the Court must on a motion to dismiss-claim 30 here arguably parallels the claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    McRO\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    McRO\n   </em>\n   , as noted above, the Federal Circuit found that the claims at issue did not \"simply use a computer as a tool to automate conventional activity,\" but instead \"focused on a specific asserted improvement\" of using rules of a particular type to automate lip-synchronization of 3-D characters.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n    837 F.3d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court relied heavily on the fact that the traditional method involved subjective human decisions, so that the choice of automation rules created a distinct process not previously performed by humans.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same can be said for claim 30. The features of (1) electronically determining a sub-image by reference to facial features and (2) electronically locating skin defects within that sub-image are not directed to any form of enabling accurate and consistent location of skin defects in facial image processing, but a specific variant of this function. In addition, the specification suggests that this variant works differently than conventional approaches, as it chooses a particular set of automation rules designed to determine and analyze a sub-image, whereas the traditional approach requires subjective determinations by human beauty counselors observing a client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '003 patent, col. 1:34-40.

In particular, with regard to identifying facial landmarks to determine an appropriate sub-image, QuantifiCare argues that using anatomical landmarks \"is an operation humans have always performed\" and that drawing lines connecting these landmarks is something that a human can do. Reply at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 24 (\"Humans do that visually.\").

The '003 Patent's specification acknowledges the conventionality of each step within the process. However, the specification can also be read as providing a sufficient basis to conclude that claim 30 accomplishes the task in a distinct way. As noted above, the specification explains that beauty counselors traditionally performed the process of locating skin defects and made several subjective judgments about the type and location of different skin defects. '003 patent, col. 1:34-40. Claim 30 seeks to automate that process, reciting a series of rules that are used to accurately and reliably locate skin defects, in particular by creating a suitable sub-image for analysis. Indeed, claim 30's identification of facial landmarks and use of those landmarks to create the sub-image are related to a specific problem encountered in automating the process. These sub-image limitations are also what distinguishes claim 30 from claim 1, which merely reflects the longstanding process of acquiring and analyzing information.

Claim 9's modifications of claim 1 render claim 9 substantially similar to claim 30. Like in claim 30, the determination of the sub-image is essential to claim 9, and the subsequent analysis to detect skin defects is limited to that sub-image. Thus, claim 9's \"character as a whole\" is similar to claim 30's, and claim 9 is not directed to an abstract idea for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

In particular, claims 32 and 33 recite semi-automatic sub-image determination and fully automatic sub-image determination, respectively.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 15:37-16:3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6:60-7:27 (describing the processes of semi-automatic and fully automatic sub-image determination). As such, claims 32-33 clarify this aspect of claim 30 and do not substantially shift its \"character as a whole.\" Indeed, the Court's observations regarding how claim 30 is directed to the process of electronically determining a sub-image of a digital image by reference to facial features and electronically locating skin defects within that sub-image also hold true for claims 32-33. Thus claims 32-33 are not directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Claims 34-35 append extra steps to the process in claim 30.

These additions appear to be substantive, augmenting the electronic determination and analysis of claim 30. However, these steps do not override the functions claimed in claim 30 but instead provide further implementation of claim 30's technological improvement. Indeed, claims 34-35 appear to also advance the '003 Patent's claimed benefits of \"allowing an operator to recommend cosmetic products and/or medical treatments and to simulate an improvement and/or worsening of the skin.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 12:44-48.

Claims 38-41\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Claim 38 is an independent claim, and claims 39-41 depend on claim 38. Claim 38 comprises four steps that blend some of the steps from claims 1 and 30: (1) \"acquiring\" a digital image of \"the face of the person,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824818\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1366/#p1372\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 16:30; (2) \"electronically determining\" a sub-image of the digital image,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824818\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1366/#p1372\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 16:31-32; (3) \"electronically analyzing\" the sub-image to determine an overall skin characteristic,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824818\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1366/#p1372\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 16:33-37; and (4) \"determining a comparison\" to a predefined value for a particular population,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824818\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1366/#p1372\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 16:38-40. Although claim 38 provides fewer details than claim 30 about how to determine the sub-image, claim 38 incorporates the sub-image determination step. Like claim 30's \"electronically analyzing\" step, claim 38's \"electronically analyzing\" step is restricted to the sub-image. In contrast to claim 30, claim 38 does not locate individual skin defects but instead determines an overall skin characteristic for the defects within the sub-image. Finally, similar to claim 1, claim 38 ends with a comparison of the overall skin characteristic to a relevant population. Thus, an apt characterization of claim 38's \"character as a whole\" is electronically determining a sub-image of a digital image and electronically quantifying an overall skin characteristic within that sub-image.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Court concludes that claim 38 is not directed to an abstract idea because it is substantially similar to claim 30 in all critical respects. Crucially, claim 38 requires a determination of a sub-image upon which the subsequent analysis is to be performed. As described above, the sub-imaging process is purportedly distinct from the traditional process and addresses a particular concern related to automation of facial image processing. That fact is countenanced by the specification, which also provides details for how to implement the sub-image determination. While the output of claim 38 is slightly different than the output of claim 30, the two outputs are meaningfully similar in that they both involve improved functioning of facial image processing related to skin defects. Rather than identifying particular defect areas, claim 38 produces an overall skin characteristic for the sub-image that can be compared against another figure. These steps appear to go beyond claim 1's bare recitation of acquiring and analyzing digital image data. Thus, claim 38 is not directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The Court reaches the same conclusion as to claims 39-41. Claim 39 recites auxiliary steps for \"generating\" and \"displaying\" a second digital image based on claim 38's analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824818\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/1366/#p1372\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 16:41-47. Those extra steps complement claim 38 by further implementing the technological improvement.
