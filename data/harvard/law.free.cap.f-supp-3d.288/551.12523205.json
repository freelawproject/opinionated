(\"C.D.S.\") brought this action against defendants Bradley Zetler (\"Zetler\"), CDS, LLC, and Rapid Systems CC (collectively, \"Rapid Systems\"), seeking declaratory judgments that Rapid Systems's copyright and trademark registrations for the software \"Agencypad\" and its underlying computer code and database are void, and that C.D.S. is the sole owner of rights to trademark and copyright the software. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1.) The Complaint also seeks monetary damages for various violations of state and federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rapid Systems has asserted several direct and derivative counterclaims against C.D.S.; its CEO, Diane Treat; three directors of C.D.S., Jerome Viollon, Christelle Riot, and Christophe Racle; the majority shareholder of C.D.S., Jerome Marechaux (\"Marechaux\"); and CDS SARL, a French company majority-owned by Marechaux (collectively, the \"Counterclaim Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Second\n   Amended Answer,\" Dkt. No. 139.) Two of the derivative counterclaims are brought by Zetler, as a C.D.S. shareholder, asserting ownership rights on behalf of C.D.S. over the software \"CDS6\" and seeking to remedy the uncompensated use of that software by CDS SARL. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 289-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are several letters the parties submitted in anticipation of the upcoming trial regarding the scope of triable issues in this case. For the reasons discussed below, the Court orders that: (1) Rapid Systems is collaterally estopped from arguing that the ownership of the portions of a database relied upon by Agencypad is governed by contract; (2) Rapid Systems is not collaterally estopped from arguing that C.D.S., and not CDS SARL, owns the software CDS6; (3) Zetler has standing to bring derivative counter-claims on behalf of C.D.S. to enforce C.D.S.'s alleged ownership rights over CDS6; and (4) United States law applies to all copyright ownership and infringement questions related to the database underlying Agencypad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Agencypad is a software used to assist members of the fashion industry manage their logistical needs, such as booking and scheduling assignments for fashion models. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 65.) Throughout this litigation, C.D.S. has argued that it owns the rights to trademark Agencypad and to copyright its supporting computer code because the software was developed by C.D.S. employees within the scope of their employment and so constitutes a work-for-hire under 17 U.S.C. Section 201(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    C.D.S., Inc. v. Zetler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124545\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/198/323/#p340\">\n    198 F.Supp.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (order denying C.D.S.'s motion for partial summary judgment regarding the ownership of Agencypad). Rapid Systems, on the other hand, has argued that Agencypad is an extension of its software Portfoliopad and that its copyrights for Portfoliopad and Agencypad are valid and enforceable. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , First Amended Answer \u00b6 237-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There is no dispute that Rapid Systems owns Portfoliopad, but complicating this case is the fact that the functionality of both Agencypad and Portfoliopad depend on various tables stored in the same database (the \"Database\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.D.S., Inc. v. Zetler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273857\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/625/#p631\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). For Agencypad to function properly, it requires access to certain portions of the Database (the \"Agencypad Data\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), at least some of which were created before Agencypad existed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 389 at 5 (letter by Counterclaim Defendants admitting that some of the Agencypad Data predated Agencypad).) Rapid Systems contends that the entire Database is part of Portfoliopad and so Rapid Systems owns the Database regardless of the ownership of Agencypad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.D.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273857\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/625/#p631\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, the Counterclaim Defendants contend that Rapid Systems does not own the Agencypad Data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273857\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/625/#p631\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Counterclaim Defendants also argue that Rapid Systems's copyright registrations\n   in the Agencypad Data are invalid because the Database is not original work that is copyrightable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Related to this case is an action in France (the \"French Action\") brought by Rapid Systems against C.D.S. and CDS SARL for breaching a 2001 Exclusive Distributorship Agreement (the \"EDA\") by, among other things, bringing the instant case claiming ownership over Agencypad, which Rapid Systems alleged ownership over under the terms of the EDA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 386, Ex. A.) In the French Action, the Commercial Court of Paris, 8th Chamber, found that Agencypad is not a \"Contractual Product,\" meaning that its ownership is not governed by the EDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) The Commercial Court also stated by way of background that CDS SARL \"developed software, the latest version of which is called CDS6 ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rapid Systems appealed the decision of the Commercial Court of Paris, and the Appellate Court of Paris affirmed the finding that Agencypad is not a contractual product, and so its ownership should be determined under the law of intellectual property and not contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 386, Ex. B at 7.) The Appellate Court reasoned that \"the mere fact\" that Agencypad and Portfoliopad share the same Database does not entail that Agencypad is a contractual product along with Portfoliopad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) The Appellate Court concluded that instead of being an outgrowth of Portfoliopad, as Rapid Systems argued, \"[i]t appears ... on the evidence before the court that the Agencypad software is an upgrade of CDS6 software owned by C.D.S. Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the Appellate Court decision, Rapid Systems brought an application for a failure to adjudicate certain claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 386, Ex. C at 2.) Specifically, Rapid Systems claimed that the Appellate Court failed to adjudicate its claim that, under the terms of the EDA, Rapid Systems is the owner of the Agencypad Data. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273857\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/625/#p631\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) On Rapid Systems's application, the Appellate Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [T]he database operating with Agencypad, in the 'Agencypad System,' does not moreover constitute a contractual product as set forth in the distribution agreement and cannot be considered as 'relating' to the software Portfoliopad nor as an 'evolution' of the software Portfoliopad. Further, it has not been demonstrated to this Court which company holds the ownership of this database, this question not having been raised before this Court, as it falls under the competency of other jurisdictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The Appellate Court thus concluded that the ownership of the Agencypad Data was not governed by the EDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   C.D.S. also brought a motion in response to the first Appellate Court decision, seeking to rectify an alleged error in the original decision regarding the ownership of CDS6. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Specifically, C.D.S. moved for the Appellate Court to replace the statement \"[i]t appears ... on the evidence submitted to the court that the software Agencypad constitutes an evolution of the software CDS6 belonging to\n   <em>\n    CDS\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   \" from the original Appellate Court decision with the statement \"[i]t appears ... on the evidence submitted to the court that the software Agencypad constitutes an evolution of the software CDS6 belonging to\n   <em>\n    CDS\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SARL\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (emphases added)). Rapid Systems did not respond to C.D.S.'s motion to rectify an error, and the Appellate Court granted it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Presently before the Court is the parties' letter correspondence regarding the effects of the French Action on the upcoming trial in this case. On November 20, 2017, the Counterclaim Defendants submitted a letter arguing that the Court\n   should preclude Rapid Systems from re-litigating legal issues decided by the French courts in the French Action on collateral estoppel grounds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 385, the \"November 20 Letter.\") Specifically, the Counterclaim Defendants argue that at trial Rapid Systems should not be permitted to challenge the decisions by the French courts that: (1) Agencypad is not a contractual product; (2) the Agencypad Data is not a contractual product; and (3) that the CDS6 software is owned by CDS SARL and not C.D.S. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) The November 20 Letter further argues that regardless of the collateral estoppel issues, Zetler lacks standing to bring derivative claims on behalf of C.D.S. that are based on C.D.S.'s alleged ownership of CDS6. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By letter dated December 4, 2017, Rapid Systems opposes the Counterclaim Defendants' claims regarding the scope of triable issues. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 388, the \"December 4 Letter.\") First, Rapid Systems acknowledges that the French courts decided that Agencypad is not a contractual product, and so Rapid Systems is collaterally estopped from claiming that Agencypad is a contractual product \"in this or in any later action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) However, Rapid Systems argues, the French courts did not decide whether the Agencypad Data is a contractual product, and so Rapid Systems should not be precluded from arguing at trial that Rapid Systems owns the entire Database under the terms of the EDA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, Rapid Systems argues that any mention of the ownership of CDS6 in the French courts' decisions was incidental to their decisions and so should not have preclusive effects in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Consequently, Rapid Systems argues, Zetler should be permitted to pursue derivative claims that are based on C.D.S.'s ownership of CDS6, and the jury should decide which company owns that software. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Third, Rapid Systems argues that if the ownership of the entire Database is not governed by the EDA, then the question arises whether intellectual property claims over the Database should be decided under the laws of the United States or South Africa, where the Database was first created. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Rapid Systems argues that South African law should apply to the question of whether the Database constitutes original work that is copyrightable in the first place. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Rapid Systems argues that Zetler does have standing as a shareholder to bring a derivative suit against C.D.S. for failing to enforce its ownership rights over CDS6. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By letter dated December 11, 2017 (Dkt. No. 389, the \"December 11 Letter\"), the Counterclaim Defendants reply to Rapid Systems's arguments. The Counterclaim Defendants first argue that the French courts clearly decided that the Agencypad Data is not a contractual product and so Rapid Systems should be estopped from claiming that the ownership of that database is determined by the EDA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Second, the Counterclaim Defendants argue that the French courts' findings regarding the ownership of CDS6 were necessary to the decisions in the French Action, and so should have preclusive effects in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.) Specifically, the Counterclaim Defendants argue that the ownership of CDS6 was necessary to the disposition of the French Action because the French courts' finding that Agencypad is not a contractual product depended on the finding that Agencypad was an outgrowth of CDS6, and not Portfoliopad. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Third, the Counterclaim Defendants argue that Zetler lacks standing to challenge the ownership of CDS6 because his counterclaims\n   are not actually derivative claims since the claims would benefit only himself and not the company he alleges to represent as a shareholder. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Finally, the Counterclaim Defendants argue that United States law should apply to all of the copyright questions in this case, which are ultimately about an alleged infringement in the United States based on United States copyright law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties' recent correspondence raises the following four issues regarding the scope of the upcoming trial: (1) whether Rapid Systems will be collaterally estopped from arguing that the ownership of the Agencypad Data is governed by the EDA; (2) whether Rapid Systems will be collaterally estopped from arguing that C.D.S., and not CDS SARL, owns CDS6; (3) even if Rapid Systems is not collaterally estopped from challenging the ownership of CDS6, whether Zetler has standing to bring derivative claims based on C.D.S.'s alleged ownership of CDS6; and (4) whether the dispute over whether the Agencypad Data is original and copyrightable will be decided under United States or South African law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.

All four prongs of the Second Circuit's collateral estoppel test are met here. First, \"the identical issue was raised in a previous proceeding,\"\n   <em>\n    Interoceanica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635583\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/86/#p91\">\n    107 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when, after the Appellate Court of Paris affirmed the Commercial Court's decision that Agencypad is not a contractual product, Rapid Systems brought an application to rectify the Appellate Court's failure to adjudicate its claim regarding the ownership of Agencypad Data. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 386, Ex. C at 2.) Specifically, as Rapid Systems now asserts, it brought the motion to rectify for the purpose of establishing that Agencypad Data is owned by Rapid Systems under the EDA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 4 Letter at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, \"the issue was actually litigated and decided in the previous proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Interoceanica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635583\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/86/#p91\">\n    107 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to Rapid Systems's application, the Appellate Court ruled that \"the database operating with Agencypad, in the 'Agencypad System,' does not moreover constitute a contractual product as set forth in the distribution agreement and cannot be considered as 'relating' to the software Portfoliopad nor as an 'evolution' of the software Portfoliopad.\" (Dkt. No. 386, Ex. C at 3.) That is, the Appellate Court decided that the ownership of the Agencypad Data is not governed by the EDA. This issue, raised by Rapid Systems to the Paris Appellate Court, is the precise one it now wants to litigate at trial here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Third, after the Paris Appellate Court issued its reasoned opinion, Rapid Systems raised the issue of the ownership of the Agencypad Data to that court, which then issued a second reasoned opinion addressing this particular question. The French Action thus provided Rapid Systems \"a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Interoceanica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635583\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/86/#p91\">\n    107 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fourth, with its application to rectify the Paris Appellate Court's failure to adjudicate an issue, Rapid Systems sought to establish its ownership over the Agencypad Data, regardless of whether it could claim ownership over the Agencypad software. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 4 Letter at 4.) The Appellate Court then issued an opinion specifically addressing that issue on the merits. Additionally, the Appellate Court clarified with its second decision that its central holding in the case-that the EDA does not govern Agencypad-applied to the Agencypad Data as well. Thus, the Appellate Court's decision regarding the issue Rapid Systems now seeks to dispute, namely the ownership of the Agencypad Data, was \"necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits\" in the\n   French Action.\n   <em>\n    Interoceanica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635583\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/86/#p91\">\n    107 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because the issue of whether the ownership of the Agencypad Data is governed by the EDA was fully litigated and adjudicated on the merits in the French Action, Rapid Systems is collaterally estopped from raising the same issue at trial in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Issue Preclusion with Respect to the Ownership of CDS 6\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Counterclaim Defendants argue that Zetler should be precluded from bringing counterclaims based on the disputed fact that C.D.S. owns CDS6 because the French courts already decided that CDS SARL, and not C.D.S., owns CDS6. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 4 Letter at 5-6.) The central question in the French Action was whether Rapid Systems owns Agencypad under the terms of the EDA. Rapid Systems argued, among other things, that Agencypad was a contractual product under the EDA because Agencypad evolved from Portfoliopad, which was indisputably a contractual product. In concluding that Agencypad is not a contractual product, the Appellate Court of Paris found that Agencypad appears to have developed from CDS6 and not from Portfoliopad. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 386, Ex. B at 9.) This point was relevant to the extent that it showed that Agencypad did not develop from the contractual product Portfoliopad but instead from a product, CDS6, that Rapid Systems did not own. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635583\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/86/#p91\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Whether C.D.S. or CDS SARL owned CDS6 was thus beside the point; either way, CDS6 was owned by an adversary of Rapid Systems and was not a contractual product. As a result, when C.D.S. sought for the Appellate Court to correct the statement in its first decision that CDS6 was owned by C.D.S. as opposed to CDS SARL, the Appellate Court was able to grant that motion without materially changing any other finding or conclusion in its decision regarding the merits of the French Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 386, Ex. C at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, though the Appellate Court granted C.D.S.'s motion and stated in its final opinion that CDS6 is owned by CDS SARL (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635583\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/86/#p91\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), the resolution of the ownership of CDS6 was not \"necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits\" in the French Action,\n   <em>\n    Interoceanica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635583\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/86/#p91\">\n    107 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, the Appellate Court's statement regarding the ownership of CDS6 was \"mere dicta\" and was not \"a necessary element of the court's conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Overview Books\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=438%20Fed.%20Appx.%2031\">\n    438 Fed.Appx. at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court is therefore not persuaded that Zetler should be collaterally estopped from bringing derivative claims based on the argument that C.D.S., and not CDS SARL, owns CDS6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B. STANDING TO BRING DERIVATIVE CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Counterclaim Defendants argue that even if Zetler is not collaterally estopped from bringing derivative claims based on C.D.S.'s alleged ownership of CDS6, he lacks standing to bring those claims. The Counterclaim Defendants argue that because C.D.S. has only two shareholders, Zetler and Marechaux, and\n   since Marechaux is a counter-claim defendant, Zetler is the only person who stands to benefit from the derivative counter-claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 11 Letter at 4-5.) Consequently, the Counterclaim Defendants argue, because the derivative counterclaims based on C.D.S.'s alleged ownership of CDS6 are brought for Zetler's benefit and not for the good of the company he claims to represent, those claims should properly be characterized as direct claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 11 Letter at 4-5.) C.D.S. further argues that once these claims are properly characterized as direct claims, Zetler would lack standing to bring them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=438%20Fed.%20Appx.%2031\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The adequacy of pleadings for a derivative suit brought under Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is determined under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wayne Cty.

Thus, Zetler has standing to bring derivative counterclaims on behalf of C.D.S. regarding that company's ownership of CDS6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   C. CHOICE OF LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In its first counterclaim, Rapid Systems seeks to enforce ownership rights it claims to possess over Agencypad and the Database based on several copyrights registered with the United States Copyright Office. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Answer \u00b6\u00b6 237-48.) The Counterclaim Defendants challenge the validity of Rapid Systems's asserted copyrights on several grounds. With respect to copyrights in the Database, they argue that the material is not original work and so is not copyrightable. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , December 11 Letter at 5.) In response, Rapid Systems argues that because the Database was first developed and published in South Africa, the Court should apply South African law to the question of whether the Database is original and thus copyrightable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 4 Letter at 7.) The Counterclaim Defendants, on the other hand, maintain that because the issue here is whether the Counterclaim Defendants infringed on a valid United States copyright, in the United States, United States law should apply to the question of whether the Database is copyrightable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 11 Letter at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the landmark case\n   <em>\n    Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v. Russian Kurier, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n    153 F.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1998), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit established principles for deciding conflicts of law issues in international copyright actions. The Court first noted that the Copyright Act itself does not contain guidance for choice of law issues arising in copyright disputes, and so the courts need to \"fill the interstices of the Act by developing federal common law on the conflicts issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n    at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court then distinguished between ownership issues and infringement issues in copyright suits. With respect to copyright ownership, the Court held that \"[c]opyright is a form of property, and the usual rule is that the interests of the parties in property are determined by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the property and the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In contrast, with respect to infringement questions, the Court held that the principle governing certain choice of law questions in tort suits applies, namely that the court should apply the law of the state where the infringement occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n    at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court then applied Russian law to determine the ownership of copyrights over newspaper articles written and first published in Russia, as Russia had the most significant relationship to those articles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703458\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/82/\">\n    at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This case raises both ownership and infringement questions regarding the Database-whether Rapid Systems owns a valid copyright in the Database, and whether the Counterclaim Defendants infringed on that copyright. There is no dispute that infringement questions in this case will be decided under United States law, since the alleged infringements occurred in this country. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 4 Letter; December 11 Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But United States law also applies to the ownership issues. The United States has the strongest relationship to the copyright ownership dispute here. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Itar-Tass\n   </em>\n   , in which the parties sought to enforce intellectual property rights based on international treaties, Rapid Systems brings its suit based on copyrights registered with the United States Copyright Office. It is thus United States law that\n   gives rise to the ownership claim at issue here. Additionally, the ownership dispute over the Agencypad Data is necessarily intertwined with the ownership dispute over Agencypad, to which United States law will indisputably apply. Consequently, all copyright ownership and infringement questions in this case will be adjudicated under United States law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons stated above, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the request of plaintiff and counterclaim defendant C.D.S., Inc., and counterclaim defendants Diane Treat, Jerome Viollon, Christelle Riot, Christophe Racle, Jerome Marechaux, and CDS SARL (collectively with C.D.S., Inc., the \"Counterclaim Defendants\") for an order stating that defendants and counter-claim plaintiffs Bradley Zetler, CDS, LLC, and Rapid Systems CC (collectively, \"Rapid Systems\") are collaterally estopped from arguing that under the terms of a 2001 Executive Distributorship Agreement among the parties, Rapid Systems owns the software Agencypad or the portions of a database underlying and accessed by that software (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.
