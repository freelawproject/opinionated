BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from an alleged mix-up of consumer credit files, sale of inaccurate information to creditors, and a failure to fix the problem. Dkt. No. [1]. Plaintiff alleges these problems occurred when another person's credit information became incorrectly attached to his and that Defendant failed to fix the error when it was brought to its attention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\") by not conducting a reasonable reinvestigation when Plaintiff disputed the completeness or accuracy of his credit report, and not following reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy when issuing a credit report. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant has suffered from mix ups in the past and therefore knows about the potential for mix ups, but chooses to ignore the risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff has disclosed Evan Hendricks as an expert in support of his claims. Plaintiff notes that Mr. Hendricks has (1) closely studied the credit reporting industry for more than 35 years; (2) published a newsletter and written a book on the credit reporting industry; (3) testified as an expert in several FCRA trials; (4) testified several times before Congress on FCRA issues; and (5) had access via discovery to many of Defendant's documents that are not generally publically available.

In particular, Defendant argues that Mr. Hendricks is not qualified to testify regarding (1) Defendant's procedures; and (2) Plaintiff's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    1. Defendant's Procedures\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant argues that Mr. Hendricks is not qualified to testify about Defendant's procedures because Mr. Hendricks (1) does not have any education or training related to the operation of a consumer reporting agency; (2) has never been employed by any consumer reporting agency; (3) has never tested any of his theories or subjected them to peer review; (4) does not have the skill to test a computer program designed to match computer consumer credit information; and (5) has never developed policies or procedures for maintaining consumer reporting accuracy. Defendant also contends that the mere fact that Mr. Hendricks has previously testified on FCRA matters is not relevant to whether he is qualified in a given case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, the Court finds that Mr. Hendricks is qualified to testify regarding Defendant's procedures. He has written books and provided testimony before Congress and other governmental agencies relating to credit reporting agency practices.

Plaintiff's Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant also argues that Mr. Hendricks is not qualified to testify on Plaintiff's damages, as Mr. Hendricks has no training or experience relevant to assessing damages. In addition, Defendant contends that the jury could determine for themselves certain aspects of Mr. Hendricks's testimony, such as that a loss of time and energy caused by inaccurate credit reports could contribute to emotional distress.

Defendant further contends that Mr. Hendricks has made no attempt to explain his methods or the basis for his assertions, nor is there evidence that his methods satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors in that they have been tested, subjected to peer review, have a known error rate, or have been generally accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, in non-scientific cases such as this one, \"the relevant reliability concerns may focus on an expert's personal knowledge or experience.\"\n   <em>\n    Kumho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p152\">\n    526 U.S. at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p152\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, \"expert testimony that does not meet all or most of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors may sometimes be admissible\" based on the particular circumstances of a specific case.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948410\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1257/#p1266\">\n    415 F.3d at 1266-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, Mr. Hendricks has accumulated a wealth of personal knowledge and experience in consumer credit reporting agency practices. Therefore, the Court finds that Mr.\n   Hendricks's methods are sufficiently reliable, and that Defendant's objections go more towards the weight of Mr. Hendricks's testimony than to its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Assisting the Trier of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant argues that Mr. Hendricks's testimony will not assist the trier of fact because Mr. Hendricks's (1) opinions do not require specialized knowledge; (2) opinions include speculation regarding Defendant's state of mind; (3) factual testimony will not assist the jury; and (4) legal opinions are improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, understanding the inner workings of the credit reporting industry may require some specialized knowledge. And Mr. Hendricks's unique and specialized knowledge regarding credit reporting agency practices may help the jury contextualize and make sense of complicated information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant also argues that Mr. Hendricks should not be allowed to testify as to Defendant's state of mind and what Defendant \"knew.\" As a general matter, the Court agrees. But certain aspects of Mr. Hendricks's testimony in this area may be allowed. For example, although Mr. Hendricks may not know Defendant's subjective intent, he may be able to testify as to what information would mean to a reasonable credit reporting agency in a more objective sense. Because Mr. Hendricks is qualified to provide this more objective testimony, the Court will not exclude the entirety of his testimony on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to improper legal opinions, Defendant is correct that, as a general principle, \"testifying experts may not offer legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9180963\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/1092/#p1113\">\n    402 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1112 n.8. Based on this general principle, all witnesses \"are prohibited from testifying as to questions of law regarding the interpretation of a statute, the meaning of terms in a statute, or the legality of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Dahlgren v. Muldrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20186641\">\n    2008 WL 186641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Fla. Jan. 18, 2008). Instead, \"[t]he determination of which law applies and what the law means is for the Court to decide.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20186641\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   However, \"[a]n expert does not invade the court's authority by discoursing broadly over the entire range of the applicable law where the opinion is focused on a specific question of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Camacho v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219952\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/1343/#p1366\">\n    13 F.Supp.3d 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1366 (N.D. Ga. 2014). Here, Mr. Hendricks seeks to testify that Defendant did not have adequate procedures to ensure accuracy, and that Defendant was reckless in not taking steps to prevent mixing after Plaintiff gave notice of inaccuracies. Such testimony seeks to resolve a factual dispute, but does not go so far as to say that Defendant violated the FCRA. Therefore, Mr. Hendricks's opinions are permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   And if in fact Mr. Hendricks attempts to provide testimony at trial that improperly goes to Defendant's state of mind or impermissibly interprets or applies the FCRA, such evidence can be excluded pursuant to proper evidentiary objections. Accordingly, at this stage in the litigation process, the Court will not prohibit Mr. Hendricks from providing testimony that discusses Defendant's objective state of mind or the FCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Prior Cases and Consent Decrees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant contends that even if the Court allows Mr. Hendricks to testify as an expert, it should limit the following aspects of his testimony: (1) verdicts against Defendant in other FCRA cases; (2) twenty-year old consent decrees between Defendant and regulatory agencies; and (3) other unrelated administrative actions. Defendant argues that the proposed testimony is not relevant and any probative\n   value is outweighed by its potential to prejudice the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The parties disagree on the relevancy of prior cases, including whether some of the prior cases in Mr. Hendricks's testimony actually involved mixed files, which is the issue in this case. The parties also disagree on the relevancy of consent decrees. Because there is a factual dispute over the relevancy of the evidence, a ruling on this issue is deferred until the record is more fully developed at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. K-9 Detection Servs., Inc. v.

Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Exclude is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
