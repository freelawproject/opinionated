L. </em>1926, <em>p. </em>103) to meet just such a situation as is here presented by permitting judges of the Circuit Court (before one of whom the case in its entiretj' must ultimately be heard) to hear and determine the propriety and validity of pleadings. Such amendment of the rules was made necessary by the enormous burden of work (ever increasing) upon the justices of the Supreme Court due to the growth of poulation, industry and wealth in the state and the consequent litigation. It is, we think, only less important also that the trial judge should be the one who shall pass upon pleadings in the cases to come before him for trial. He can thus mold the issues in conformity with his own views and not be obliged to follow the views of those with whom he may not be in accord. He is then enabled also to familiarize himself with the questions to be presented in time for reflection outside the hurry of trial work. To meet the added labor the number of Circuit judges can be increased from time to time, while the number of justices in this court cannot be thus increased to practical advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The questions sought to be raised in the present record are therefore referred for their disposition to the judge of the Circuit Court sitting in the Cumberland County Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
