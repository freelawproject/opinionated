There was a judgment of dispossession, based on legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>lation in line with a statute first enacted in 1884 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1884, <em>p. </em>1878), amended by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1888, <em>p. </em>426, and to be found at page 3079 of the compiled statutes of 1910. That act is entitled \u201cAn act regulating lettings in cases where no definite term is fixed,\u201d and by a proviso prescribes, as to cases of \u201cletting where no term is agreed upon and the rent is payable monthly,\u201d \u201cthat in case any such tenant shall be so disorderly' as to destroy the peace and quiet of the other tenants living in the house or the neighborhood, or shall willfully destroy, damage or injure the premises, or shall constantly violate the said landlord\u2019s rules and regulations governing said premises, and a copy of which regulations said landlord has caused to be conspicuously posted on said premises,\u201d the landlord may give written notice of termination of the tenancy and directing the tenant to remove, and enforce it by.summary proceedings akin to those taken in case of non-payment of rent or expiration of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Until the establishment of District Courts, actions for the summary dispossession of tenants were uniformly cognizable by justices of the peace, and the act of 1884, as amended, <em>ubi supra, </em>so provides. In view of the desirability of conferring similar jurisdiction on District Courts, the District Court act of 1898 contained provisions purporting to confer such jurisdiction <em>(Comp. Stat., p. </em>1962, \u00a7 30; <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1988, \u00a7\u00a7 107 <em>et seq.) </em>in the ordinary cases of non-payment of rent and holding over after expiration of term; but where that act undertook to alter the relative status of the parties, as by creating a right of re-entry without service of a three days\u2019 notice, it was held that its title would not constitutionally support such a change. <em>George Jonas Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>69 <em>N. J. L. </em>157; and this led to the legislation of 1903, amended in 1910. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1903, <em>p. </em>26; <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>3070, <em>pi. 18-a, </em>to 3074, <em>pi. 18-g. </em>But apart from a change in the substantive rights of the parties, a mere transfer of the forum was held constitutionally within the title of \u201cAn act concerning District Courts.\u201d <em>Strait </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>677.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The act of 1884-1888, <em>supra </em>(colloquially known as the \u201cEish act,\u201d and characterized as \u201ccurious,\u201d in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Schietinger, </em>51 <em>N. J. L. </em>152, 154), was incorporated into the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>trict Court act of 1898 without any substantial change hi language so far as appears by a cursory examination. <em>Comp. \u00a1Hal., p. </em>1990, \u00a7 117. It was restricted to cases in which \u201cno term is agreed upon and the rent is payable monthly.\u201d But in 1920 the legislature twice undertook to extend its scope; by chapter 260 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>479), covering \u201cany tenant or lessee at will or sufferance, or for part of a year, or for one or more years;\u201d and by chapter 340 (at <em>p. </em>605), a direct amendment of section 117, <em>supra. </em>It is this last legislation on which the judgment under review depends; and it likewise undertakes to enlarge the powers of the landlord in cases of disorderly conduct, and the like, by changing the opening clause to read: \u201cin any letting where no term is agreed upon <em>or where the term of telling is from, month, lo month </em>and the rent is payable monthly.\u201d The case is within this clause; for the affidavit for dispossession states the letting was for one month from November 1st, 1923, and from month to month thereafter, at the rent of $65 per month payable monthly. The stipulation of facts is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">It is admitted that the tenant was disorderly in such wise as to bring the statute into play in that regard; and that there is no fault in the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We find two fundamental infirmities in this judgment\u2014 one of construction of the statute, argued by counsel; the other, constitutional, not raised on the briefs, but which the court can raise of its own motion, especially when involving \u25a0jurisdiction. <em>McMichael </em>v. <em>Horay, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>142; <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>755, 758; <em>Penrose </em>v. <em>Land Co., </em>94 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>436, and which, we think, should be raised at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">1. It is conclusively established by the stipulation of facts in the court below, that prosecutrix is the tenant of the entire house and premises described in the landlord\u2019s affidavit, and that the landlord has no other tenants of his own living in the neighborhood. It is argued for prosecutrix that the statute is not applicable, because there are no other tenants \u201cliving in the premises,\u201d and no other tenants of this landlord Jiving \u201cin the neighborhood.\u201d The answer made to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>is that when the statute speaks of \u201cany other tenants living in the neighborhood\u201d it means tenants of anyone, of this or any other landlord, and even occupants of their own homes; in fine, given a situation in which the tenant of A disturbs the neighborhood by disorderly conduct in the demised premises, A can take proceedings under this statute because of the disturbance to the peace and quiet of the neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We are unable to take this view, which, as will readily be perceived, would endow the landlord in combination with the District Court with power to abate a public nuisance. It is hardly conceivable that the legislature meant to qualify landlords as peace officers for the public benefit; and the context of the clause \u201cor in the neighborhood\u201d negatives any such construction. The other alternatives are \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Willfully destroying, damaging or injuring <em>the premises.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Constantly violating the landlord\u2019s posted rules and regulations governing <em>said premises.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">It was the landlord\u2019s reversion and rents from other tenants that the act was framed to protect, and not the general peace of the neighborhood, or the interests of any other landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">So, we conclude that as a matter of construction of this act, the court below had no jurisdiction of the case on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">2. On the constitutional phase, a few words in addition to the introductory matter above set out, will suffice. Chapter 340 of 1920, and for that matter chapter 260 also, undertake to extend the District Court jurisdiction under the Pish act, by legislation entitled as amendatory of the District Court act to other cases, particularly to cases of letting expressly from month to month, which the Pish act did not cover. This is within the ruling in <em>George Jonas Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Ross </em>and <em>Strait </em>v. <em>Wood, ubi supra, </em>and precisely within <em>Zweig </em>v. <em>Tiffany, </em>95 <em>N. J. L. </em>45, a decision on this very chapter 340. See, also, <em>Hadelman </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>93 <em>Id. </em>66, dealing with waiver of lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">The judgment and proceedings will be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
