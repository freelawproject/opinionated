FCC, </em>205 F.3d 82 (2d Cir.2000). We assume familiarity with our earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">CPT requests, <em>inter alia, </em>that we reconsider our determination that CPT\u2019s claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq. </em>were not properly before us. In response to our decision that an FCC staff member\u2019s ruling on these claims was not an appealable final order of the FCC, CPT argues that the FCC did not issue a final order only because it impermissibly delegated its final decision to an agency staff member. We express no view as to the FCC\u2019s delegation of decisionmaking but, on reconsideration, agree that on the facts of this case CPT had done all it reasonably could to secure a final agency determination. Considering the discretion we have to review non-final agency determinations, <em>see National Black Media Coalition v. FCC, </em>791 F.2d 1016, 1021 (2d Cir.1986), we have chosen to consider the merits of CPT\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">CPT filed suit under Title II of the ADA, alleging that the FCC had forced states and local governments to discriminate against electrically sensitive people in violation of the ADA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 (\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in ... the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity\u201d). CPT\u2019s claim fails, however, because Title II of the ADA is not applicable to the federal government. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1) (\u201cThe term \u2018public entity\u2019 means ... any State or local government\u201d or \u201cany department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality\u201d thereof). Regardless of how the actions of state and local governments may or may not be affected by the FCC\u2019s challenged guidelines, the FCC itself cannot be made liable under Title II of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">CPT\u2019s claim under the Rehabilitation Act is also unavailing. CPT argues that the FCC\u2019s guidelines violate the Rehabilitation Act by permitting the proliferation of FCC-regulated radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) transmitters. This misconstrues the scope of the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s protections. In this context, the Rehabilitation Act applies only to the discriminatory denial of the benefits of a \u201cprogram or activity\u201d of the FCC. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). CPT claims that electrically sensitive people are generally being excluded from aspects of modern life by the proliferation of RF transmitters. But CPT does not allege that electrically sensitive people are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>being denied the benefit of, or are subject to discrimination under, any \u201cprogram or activity\u201d <em>of the FCC. </em>Thus, CPT\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claim against the FCC is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We have considered CPT\u2019s remaining arguments for rehearing and find them to be without merit. The petition for rehearing is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
