The matter was referred to Judge John J. Mitchell of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule BV10. After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Mitchell made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\"1. The Respondent was retained by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Yearick to handle the settlement of the property they were purchasing from S. M. Moyer Construction, Ltd.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\"2. On September 6, 1977, the Respondent conducted the settlement of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\"3. The Respondent was the secretary of the selling corporation during the course of his representation of the buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\"4. Respondent failed to follow instructions he had received from the lender, First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Annapolis, thereby necessitating the return of certain documents to him for correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\"5. These documents were returned by letter dated November 22, 1977, which advised Respondent that a balance was due and owing to the lender due to certain incorrect charges on the settlement sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\"6. Respondent received said letter on November 23, 1977, as evidenced by a signed, certified mail receipt for same. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\"7. Respondent failed to make the necessary corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\"8. The checks originally drawn on the Respondent\u2019s fiduciary account to the order of First Federal Savings and Loan were not negotiated and thus the funds due to the lender remained in the Respondent\u2019s account until withdrawn by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\"9. Said funds have never been properly disbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">\n<em>\"Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\"1. The Respondent violated: Disciplinary Rule 1-102 (A) (3) (4) (5) and (6) in that he misappropriated the proceeds of the settlement while acting in a fiduciary capacity, commingled them with his own, and has failed to properly disburse said funds. The misappropriation of the settlement proceeds entrusted to him constitutes conduct demonstrating moral turpitude, conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and conduct reflecting adversely upon his fitness to practice law. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pattison, </em>292 Md. 599, 441 A.2d 328 (1982); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Burka, </em>292 Md. 221, 438 A.2d 514 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">\"2. The Respondent violated: Disciplinary Rule 5-101 (A) in that he was retained by the Yearicks to handle the settlement of the property they were purchasing and at the same time he was secretary of the selling corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">\"3. The Respondent violated: Disciplinary Rule 6-101 (A) (1) (2) and (3) in that he handled a legal matter without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>adequate preparation, neglected a legal matter entrusted to him when he failed to properly complete the real estate settlement; and failed to associate himself with an attorney competent to handle such matters while he knew or should have known that he was not competent to handle it. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bailey (II), </em>286 Md. 630, 408 A.2d 1330 (1979); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bailey (1), </em>285 Md. 631, 403 A.2d 1261 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\"4. The Respondent violated: Disciplinary Rule 7-101 (A) (2) and (3) in that he intentionally failed to carry out a contract of employment by his failure to properly complete the settlement, and this failure prejudiced his clients in that, <em>inter alia, </em>he recorded an incomplete deed of trust and made incorrect charges against his clients on the settlement sheet. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bailey (II), supra; Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bailey (I), supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\"5. The Respondent violated: Disciplinary Rule 9-102 (A) (1) and (2) and Article 10, Section 44, in that he withdrew the remaining proceeds of the settlement from his escrow account, commingled said funds with his own, converted them to his own use, and has failed to properly disburse said funds. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.

In May, 1975, the Respondent filed a Bill of Complaint for Divorce on behalf of Mrs. Tharpe in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">\"4. In December, 1975, the Respondent represented Mrs. Tharp\u00e9 at a Master\u2019s hearing on her Bill of Complaint, and immediately subsequent to that hearing, he advised Mrs. Tharpe that she was now free to remarry.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\"5.

The Respondent violated: Disciplinary Rule 1-102 (A) (1) (4) (5) and (6) in that he misrepresented to his client that she was free to marry when in fact he knew the divorce had not been finalized and such action clearly is conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice and adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Finnesey, </em>283 Md. 541, 391 A.2d 434 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\"2.

Pollack, </em>279 Md. 225, 369 A.2d 61 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\"3. The Respondent violated: Disciplinary Rule 7-101 (A) (1) (2) and (3) in that by his failure to complete the divorce and obtain a final decree on behalf of this client, he failed to seek the lawful objectives of his client through reasonably available means, failed to carry out the contract of employment, and prejudiced or damaged his client in that she remarried when the divorce was not final. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bailey (II), supra; Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bailey (I), </em>285 Md. 631, 403 A.2d 1261 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\n<em>'Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">\"1. In early 1978, the Respondent was retained on a contingency basis by Lowell R. Harmon to handle a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>injury claim resulting from an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\"2. The Respondent received two checks from Mr. Harmon\u2019s insurer, one in the amount of $267.00, representing money due a treating physician, and the other in the amount of $819.84 representing Mr. Harmon\u2019s lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\"3.

Harmon to said check, but has failed to disburse the proceeds to his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\"6. The Respondent failed to conclude the claim of Lowell R. Harmon.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">\n<em>\"Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">\"1.
