Siegel was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on one count of income tax evasion. Two United States Attorneys for the District of Maryland had recommended that the tax prosecution be dropped, but the Department of Justice in Washington overruled the recommendations. One of the United States Attorneys, who is presently the Attorney General of Maryland, called the government\u2019s case \"very thin\u201d and \"weak.\u201d Mr. Siegel\u2019s attorney in the tax case also believed that the government\u2019s case was tenuous, but he recommended that Mr. Siegel plead nolo contendere because of the adverse effect of a trial upon Mr. Siegel\u2019s health. A heart specialist was also fearful of the toll on Mr. Siegel\u2019s health that might be exacted by a trial. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>detailed account of the tax prosecution, Mr. Siegel\u2019s health at the time, and other pertinent extenuating circumstances, is set forth in <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City </em>v. <em>Siegel, </em>275 Md. 521, 529-533, 340 A.2d 710, 714-717 (1975) (LEVINE, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">After the conviction in the tax case, a three-judge panel of trial judges recommended to this Court that Mr. Siegel not be disbarred and that his license to practice law be suspended for one year. The recommendation was based upon the extenuating circumstances with regard to the tax conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">This Court, by a 4-3 vote after a reargument, rejected the recommendation of the three-judge panel and disbarred Mr. Siegel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority, taking an extremely limited view of what extenuating circumstances were relevant in determining the appropriate sanction, refused to consider the mitigating circumstances surrounding Siegel\u2019s prosecution, plea and conviction. <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Siegel, supra, </em>275 Md. at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The dissenting opinion by Judge Levine, in which Judge Singley and I concurred, took the position that in determining the proper sanction in an attorney disciplinary proceeding, \"all mitigating circumstances are relevant.\u201d <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Siegel, supra, </em>275 Md. at 532. Judge Levine then stated <em>(id. </em>at 532):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\"Therefore, the critical point here is the submission of the nolo contendere plea in light of the suspect quality of the tax case. Manifestly, the answer lies in the poor state of the respondent\u2019s health. As the bar association counsel observed, it 'denied him his day in court.\u2019 In short, but for his health, the respondent would have been afforded a full opportunity to defend against the charges .. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The dissent concluded <em>(id. </em>at 533):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\"We held in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 318 A.2d 811 (1974), that disbarment will follow from conduct such as occurred here absent 'the most compelling extenuating circumstances.\u2019 Both the bar association and the three-judge panel thought this was such a case, and so do I. If what we truly meant to say was that a conviction on such charges will automatically and <em>absolutely </em>result in disbarment, we should not have included any idle expressions about 'compelling extenuating circumstances.\u2019 As I read the majority opinion \u2014 in light of the facts here \u2014 I sincerely question whether it is realistic to suggest that a state of facts can ever exist which will suffice to avoid disbarment in this kind of case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\"It must now be clear to the respondent that he was confronted with a monumental 'Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019 when he appeared in the federal court: either run a serious risk of losing his life by going to trial on a case acknowledged by virtually everyone officially associated with it to be a weak one; or face certain disbarment by pleading nolo contendere in reliance upon the sound medical and legal advice which he had received. If what we said in <em>Agnew </em>in respect to 'compelling extenuating circumstances\u2019 has any vitality at all, that exception applies here. If it does not, as the majority holds, I am at a loss to imagine when it could ever apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\"I would adopt the carefully considered recommendation of the three-judge panel and suspend the respondent for one year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">I continue to adhere to the views expressed by Judge Levine in the <em>Siegel </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Consequently, because I do not believe that Mr. Siegel should have been disbarred in the first place, I would grant his petition for reinstatement without further delay. Moreover, I would not impose any conditions upon his reinstatement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\">. The four-judge majority was composed of three judges of this Court and a judge of the Court of Special Appeals who was specially assigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
