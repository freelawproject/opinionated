On November 2, 1977, Bar Counsel, acting on behalf of the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, filed a petition pursuant to Maryland Rule BV16 in which he requested that we suspend Mandel from the practice of law until the further order of this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>petition was based upon Mandel\u2019s conviction by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland of violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (mail fraud \u2014 fifteen counts) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 et seq. (racketeering \u2014 one count). In response to that petition, Mandel prayed that we \"pass an order deferring a determination of the merits of the Petition ..., including the question of moral turpitude\u201d and that we also pass an order suspending him \"from the further practice of law until four] further order or until such time as the respondent\u2019s conviction ... is reversed on appeal, whichever is the earlier to occur ... .\u201d Accordingly, we suspended Mandel on December 1, 1977, \"effective immediately . ...\u201d The suspension was \"without prejudice to [his right] to raise the issue of moral turpitude in further proceedings ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Mandel\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal. See <em>United States v. Mandel, </em>591 F.2d 1347 <em>(Mandel I), </em>602 F.2d 653 <em>(Mandel II), </em>609 F.2d 1076 (4th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied </em>445 U.S. 961 (1980). We shall have more to say about that affirmance since it is a significant part of Mandel\u2019s contentions here. He continues to stand suspended from the practice of law in this State. He was disbarred in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>States District Court for the District of Maryland on July 9, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Mandel was sent to prison. Under Rule BV16 c, in the absence of a request from the attorney, further disciplinary action is postponed until a reasonable time after completion of incarceration. See <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Andresen, </em>279 Md. 250, 253-54, 367 A.2d 1251 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"Asb\">Promptly after Mandel was released from prison Bar Counsel, acting on behalf of the Attorney Grievance Commission, filed a petition seeking disciplinary action against Mandel upon the basis of this conviction. He alleged that Mandel had violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102 (A)(1), (3), (4), (5), and (6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Pursuant to Rule BV9, we designated the Honorable J. Harold Grady, Chief Judge of the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Maryland, to hear the charges. He filed a report with us which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\"In his Answer to Charges, the Respondent admits all of the facts above stated, but denies that he is subject to disbarment contending that the crimes of which he was convicted do not constitute misconduct violative of Disciplinary Rule 1-102 .... In particular the Respondent contends that the crimes of which he was convicted do not involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>moral turpitude and that to so find unconstitutionally deprives the Respondent of due process under both the United States Constitution and the Maryland Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">After a discussion of cases in this Court such as <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pine, </em>291 Md. 319, 435 A.2d 419 (1981); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Klauber, </em>289 Md. 446, 423 A.2d 578 (1981) <em>(Klauber III); </em>and <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Rosenberg, </em>273 Md. 351, 329 A.2d 106 (1974), Judge Grady quoted from Rule BV 10 e 1 which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\"In a hearing of charges pursuant to this Rule, a final judgment by a judicial tribunal in another proceeding convicting an attorney of a crime shall be conclusive proof of the guilt of the attorney of that crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">He then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\"The provisions of this Rule in conjunction with the decisions in <em>Klauber III </em>and <em>Pine, supra, </em>compel the conclusion that this court may not examine the factual underpinnings of the Respondent\u2019s federal conviction and must find that he has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Judge Grady rejected Mandel\u2019s contention that the posture of his case in the United States Court of Appeals rendered his conviction devoid of precedential value or any substance in these proceedings and thus that due process precluded the use of this conviction as conclusive proof of guilt of a crime involving moral turpitude. In so doing, the trial judge quoted from <em>Rosenberg, </em>273 Md. 351. He then made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">\"FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">\"Respondent was convicted, after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, of violations of the United States Code, Title 18, Sections 1341 and 2 (mail fraud, aiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>and abetting), Sections 1961, 1962(b) and (c), 1963 and 2 (prohibited activities; aiding and abetting) and thereafter was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">\"CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\"1. The federal crime of mail fraud is a crime involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\"2. By virtue of his conviction of federal mail fraud, Respondent has violated the following Disciplinary Rules:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">DR 102(A) (1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">DR 102(A) (3)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">DR 102(A) (4)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">DR 102(A) (5)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">DR 102(A) (6)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">Mandel excepted to Judge Grady\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The exceptions may be summarized: (1) since \"[t]he only federal appellate majority opinion\u201d relative to his conviction called for a reversal, the subsequent affirmance of his conviction by a tie vote \"should not be sufficient to allow the conviction, ipso facto, to be used to disbar since an en banc federal appellate tie is without precedential value\u201d and thus in this instance should not be considered as a final judgment under Rule BV10 e 1; (2) the mail fraud statute was improperly applied \"to a scheme to defraud a sovereign State and its citizens of the faithful services of their Governor\u201d; (3) a code of ethics not applicable by its terms to the Governor of Maryland was impermissibly permitted to be used by the jury as a standard for judging him; (4) \"[t]he federal court admitted a vast quantity of unwashed hearsay which the Government offered as 'the central part of its case.\u2019 591 F.2d at 1367\u201d; and (5) he does not stand convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>because his case is distinguishable from <em>Klauber III, </em>289 Md. 446. He opened his memorandum in support of his exceptions by stating, \"There is no doubt that Respondent was convicted of mail fraud and incarcerated therefor. The sole question, now, is whether Respondent should be disbarred therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The term \"misconduct\u201d in its application to attorney disciplinary matters is defined in Rule BV1 j as \"an act or omission by an attorney, individually or in concert with any other person or persons which violates the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, as adopted by Rule 1230, whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In <em>Mandel I, </em>591 F.2d 1347, a divided court reversed the convictions of Mandel and his co-defendants on the basis of a jury instruction and the admissibility of certain evidence. The court said as to the jury instruction;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\"We think it was necessary for the jury to be charged that Governor Mandel could not be convicted under \u00a7 1341 for engaging in a scheme to defraud that involved the fraudulent misrepresentation of facts to, or such concealment of material information from, the 1972 Maryland General Assembly, without first finding that he knew that some or all of the other Appellants were among the true owners of Marlboro Race Track during the 1972 session of the Maryland General Assembly.\u201d 591 F.2d 1365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">It held that the trial judge erred by allowing the Government to introduce into evidence certain parts of the Maryland Code of Ethics \"to prove circumstantially an intent to defraud on the part of Governor Mandel.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1366. It said it did \"not think admittedly inapplicable standards of conduct had a proper place in the trial, especially when perfectly valid standards existed.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1367. It also held the trial judge erred in admitting certain evidence \"under Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (24), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>catch-all exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the court \"rejected] Appellants\u2019 contention that the use of the mail fraud statute in th[at] case constitute^] an impermissible federal intrusion into the political affairs of the State of Maryland.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1359. It determined that \"Appellants\u2019 contention that their convictions were based on an unwarranted overextension of the mail fraud statute [was] likewise without merit.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1359. The court disposed of contentions that the mail fraud statute should not have been applied to the case before it by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">\"[I]t is apparent that the mail fraud case could have been submitted on either or both of two theories on the indictment and record now before us. First, that Governor Mandel had either been bribed as a part of a scheme to defraud or that attempts had been made to bribe Governor Mandel as a part of such scheme. Second, that false information was presented to, or true information concealed from, the Maryland General Assembly or Maryland Racing Commission, or both, in order to induce those bodies to take favorable action toward those interested in Marlboro, and later Bowie. It is equally as apparent that the case could not have been submitted on the theory that Governor Mandel had a direct interest in the racetrack business, for no direct connection on his part was either alleged or proven.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1364.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The case was reargued before the court en banc. <em>Mandel II, </em>602 F.2d 653 (4th Cir. 1979). The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\"The judgments of conviction are affirmed by an equally divided court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\"A majority of the members of the <em>en banc </em>court would affirm the judgments of conviction against all of the contentions of the appellants except the claim of error in the charge to the jury which was the point upon which there was equal division.\u201d 602 F.2d at 653.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Thus, it will be seen that the contentions relative to an equally divided court are applicable only to the first of Mandel\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We have previously quoted from Rule BV10 e and its provision that in disciplinary matters a final judgment by a judicial tribunal in another proceeding convicting an attorney of a crime is conclusive proof of the guilt of the attorney of that crime. The Maryland rule is not unique. Similar rules or statutes are found in many states.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the adoption of our present Rule BV10 the Court was faced with a contention in <em>Braverman v. Bar Assn. of Balto., </em>209 Md. 328, 121 A.2d 473, <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 830 (1956), that a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>viction in the United States District Court was not conclusive upon the trial court before whom the attorney disciplinary matter was pending under the procedure then prevailing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Delaplaine discussed for the Court a New York statute providing for disbarment upon conviction of a felony and cases in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania holding that the record of conviction was conclusive of guilt even in the absence of a statute to that effect. However, since the trial judges there \"considered everything which [Braverman] claimed was material and which he asked them to consider,\u201d the Court found no need \"to state whether in a disbarment proceeding a judgment of conviction by another Court is conclusive or only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of guilt.\u201d 209 Md. at 343. Judge Delaplaine further said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">\"Generally speaking, the conviction of an attorney of any criminal offense which the law characterizes as infamous establishes <em>prima facie </em>his unfitness to be continued on the rolls of members of the bar and is sufficient cause of disbarment. <em>State ex rel. McLean v. Johnson, </em>174 N.C. 345, 93 S.E. 847; <em>Ex parte Mason, </em>29 Or. 18, 43 P. 651, 54 Am. St. Rep. 772. [Maryland Code (1951, 1955 Cum. Supp.) Art. 10, \u00a7 16] directs that every attorney who shall be found guilty of crime involving moral turpitude, or of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, or of being a subversive person, shall be suspended or disbarred from the practice of law.\u201d 209 Md. at 344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">This is not the first Maryland disciplinary proceeding under the present rules in which an attorney has attempted to attack the underlying conviction. We had such an attack in <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Siegel, </em>275 Md. 521, 340 A.2d 710 (1975). Siegel claimed that \"compelling extenuating circumstances\u201d should be grounds for not disbarring him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Those circumstances were (1) a recommendation against prosecution by \"two highly respected United States Attorneys, Stephen H. Sachs and George Beall,\u201d (2) the \"prosecution was overly zealously pursued,\u201d and (3) his inability for health reasons \"to undergo an extended trial.\u201d Judge Digges there said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\">\"[W]e cannot accept as 'compelling extenuating circumstances\u2019 those proffers by the respondent which in essence call upon us to assess the integrity of the criminal conviction itself \u2014 that prior adjudication is conclusive and thus cannot be attacked in a disciplinary proceeding by invoking this Court to reweigh or to re-evaluate the respondent\u2019s guilt or innocence. This is so as we are prohibited from such a consideration by Rule BV4 f 1 ... .\u201d 275 Md. at 527.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Then Rule BV4 f 1 was the predecessor to our present Rule BV10 e 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Chief Judge Murphy had occasion to discuss the predecessor rule for the Court in <em>Rosenberg, </em>273 Md. 351, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">\"[0]ther states provide, as we do, by rule, statute, or case law, that a conviction of an attorney is conclusive proof of guilt. <em>See, e.g., In re Metheany, </em>104 Ariz. 144, 449 P.2d 609 (1969); <em>In re Higbie, </em>6 Cal. 3d 562, 99 Cal. Rptr. 865, 493 P.2d 97 (1972); <em>In re Fumo, </em>52 Ill. 2d 307, 288 N.E.2d 9 (1972); <em>Kentucky State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Lester, </em>437 S.W.2d 958 (Ky. 1968); <em>In re Lurkins, </em>374 S.W.2d 67 (Mo. 1964). The constitutionality of these procedures has not been seriously questioned. The requirements of due process having been satisfied at the criminal trial, and the attorney\u2019s guilt having been established beyond a reasonable doubt at that proceeding, a new or other inquiry into the guilt of the attorney for disciplinary purposes is not mandated by either the State or federal constitutions. Rule BV4 f 2 provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of Rule BV4 f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>1, any party to a disciplinary proceeding may introduce additional evidence. While the question of guilt may not be relitigated, an opportunity for a meaningful hearing is thereby afforded to adduce evidence in mitigation of the offense in order to ascertain the appropriate disciplinary sanction to be applied for the attorney\u2019s misconduct.\u201d 273 Md. at 354-55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Mandel\u2019s extensive contentions of trial error in the admission of evidence are unworthy of consideration because, as previously noted, the majority of the United States Court of Appeals rejected those contentions. The equal division was only on the claim of error in the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Mandel would have us hold that because his conviction was affirmed on appeal by an equally divided court that this conviction is not a final judgment for the purposes of Rule BV10 e 1. Such simply is not the law. There is a difference between an opinion\u2019s having no precedential value, meaning that it has no binding effect upon future cases, because it is by an equally divided court, and the issue of whether it is a final judgment, binding upon the parties. We have found no case nor have we been cited to one indicating that such an affirmance is not a final judgment, binding upon the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Affirmance of a judgment where an appellate court is equally divided on an appeal is a commonly understood procedure. <em>See generally </em>5 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 902 (1962) and 5B C.J.S. <em>Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 1844 b (1958). Indeed, Maryland Constitution Art. IV, \u00a7 14 provides relative to this Court that \"an equal division of those sitting in a case has the effect of affirming the decision appealed from if there is no application for reargument as [tjhereinafter provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">There is nothing new about the concept of an affirmance where an appellate court is evenly divided. This Court did it in <em>Partridge v. Dorsey, </em>3 H. &amp; J. 302 (1813), and in <em>Hammond v. Ridgely, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 245, 284 (1821), both of which were decided prior to <em>The Antelope, </em>23 U.S. (10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Wheat.) 66, 6 L.Ed. 268 (1825), and <em>Etting v. Bank of the United States, </em>24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 59, 6 L.Ed. 419 (1826). In the latter case Chief Justice Marshall concluded the opinion by saying for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">\"[T]he principles of law which have been argued cannot be settled; but the judgment is affirmed, the Court being divided in opinion upon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Justice Powell said for the Court in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 191-92, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), <em>The Antelope </em>appeared to be \"the first occasion of an equal division\u201d in the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In <em>Groverman v. Spencer, </em>7 Md. 214 (1854), the decree was affirmed by a divided court. Judge Mason announced for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\"Although opinions representing the views of the different judges have been prepared, the whole court think it proper not to file them, for they determine nothing which would govern any future case, and therefore would in all probability lead to misapprehension hereafter. In future, in all cases of a divided court, a similar practice will be pursued.\u201d 7 Md. at 214-15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">This was explained by Chief Judge Bowie for the Court in <em>Johns v. Johns, </em>20 Md. 58 (1863), after quoting from <em>Groverman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">\"It is to be presumed, the court did not in arriving at this conclusion, overlook the constitutional provisions of Art. 4, sec. 2, in relation to its organization, that 'in every case decided, an opinion in writing shall be filed,\u2019 but that, interpreting the clause, as applicable to cases in which there was a concurrence of a majority of the quorum, where the opinion would decide future cases, and as not applying to cases where there was a want of concurrence, and the opinions would be nullities, they held the latter to be out of the constitutional provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sion. The affirmance of the decree or judgment below, being a legal result, or necessary consequence of the equal division of the appellate court, it may well be doubted, whether there was any decision by the latter, in legal contemplation. The opinion in writing, required to be filed, is the opinion or mind of the court, considered as a unit, not as consisting of several conflicting minds, and when that unity does not exist in the minds of a majority of the court or quorum, there is no decision of the court, but the judgment or decree below stands affirmed, because the appellant has not succeeded in maintaining his motion to reverse. It is almost a solecism to say, an equal division, or disagreement on any point, is a decision.\u201d 20 Md. at 61-62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In <em>Kolb v. </em>Swann, 68 Md. 516, 13 A. 379 (1888), Judge Stone said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\"In <em>Trimble v. African Methodist Bethel </em>Church, unreported, decided by this court at the January Term, 1887, the question, and indeed the only question involved, was the title of that church to a lot of about 2 acres of land sold to it by Robert Oliver for a grave yard. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\"The question and the only question involved in that suit, was whether the African Church had a good fee simple title to the whole of that grave yard lot? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\"Upon the case so brought before this court we held (by an equally divided court,) that the African Church had a good and merchantable title to the lot it had sold to the Trimbles, and in so deciding we necessarily decided that the African Church had a good and merchantable title to the whole of the grave yard lot.\u201d 68 Md. at 518-19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Subsequent to that decision Swann bought one of the lots carved out of the graveyard lot and bargained to lease it to Kolb. The Court said the facts were precisely the same as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Trimble\u2019s Case, except that there the question was presented between the church and its immediate grantee while in <em>Kolb </em>the question arose between a grantee of one of the building lots and his lessee. The Court then entered into a discussion as to whether the earlier decision by an equally divided court was binding in the circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">\"The binding force and effect of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and of all the legal consequences which flow from it, in no wise depend upon the number of judges who sat in the case, or who concurred in the judgment, provided only the court was legally organized. A judgment rendered by a mere majority, or by an equally divided court, where the law provides for the judgment by an equal division, is just as effective in all respects as if it were the unanimous decision of every judge upon the bench. Every legal consequence that belongs to any judgment follows a judgment so rendered. It is a lien on the real estate of the defendant; it can be plead as <em>res judicata </em>where the subject is again sought to be litigated between the same parties, and, in a word, has every attribute of a judgment rendered by the whole court, as far as that case is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\"The only difference is, that a judgment rendered by an equally divided court has not the same authority in analogous cases, that one would have, rendered by a majority of the court, and where the reasons upon which it is founded appear in the opinion. For these views we have ample authority. <em>The Antelope, </em>10 Wheat. 66; <em>Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>3 How. 413; <em>Durant v. Essex Co., </em>7 Wall. 107, and 101 U.S. 555; <em>Mining Co. v. Mining Co., </em>3 Wall. 332; <em>Beloit v.

The facts are the same, the argument is the same, and the authorities are the same, and therefore the decree must be the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">One of the leading cases, if not the leading case in Maryland, on res judicata is <em>Pat Perusse Realty </em>v. <em>Lingo, </em>249 Md. 33, 238 A.2d 100 (1968). Chief Judge Hammond there said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\"The basic rule of res judicata is that facts or questions which were in issue in a previous action and were therein determined by a court which had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter are conclusively settled by a final judgment in the first case and may not again be litigated in a subsequent action between the same parties or their privies even though the subsequent suit takes a different form or is based on a different cause of action. <em>Sterling v. Local 438, etc., </em>207 Md. 132 [, 113 A.2d 389 (1955)]; <em>Snodgrass v. Stubbs, </em>192 Md. 287 [, 64 A.2d 130 (1949)]; <em>De Maio v. Lumbermens Mutual, </em>247 Md. 30 [, 230 A.2d 279 (1967)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">\"A corollary of this rule has been the theory of mutuality \u2014 that estoppels must be mutual and one (as it happened a plaintiff in the second suit) who himself was not bound by the prior judgment cannot assert res judicata against him to whom it was adverse. <em>Groshon v. Thomas, </em>20 Md. 234 [(1863)].\u201d 249 Md. at 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">He then went on to say, citing <em>Kolb </em>as one example, \"Maryland has, in at least two instances, given hint that in a proper case the requirement of mutuality might not be insisted upon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">\"Perusse, in its suit against Ted, had its full day in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>court and full opportunity to win on its claim that it procured a buyer ready, willing and able to buy at the seller\u2019s price. Its claim was decided against it. There can be no doubt that it sought to relitigate that precisely identical issue in the attachment against Elizabeth. Public policy against repetitive identical litigation, which underlies the rule of res judicata, applies here with logic and force to provide that Perusse\u2019s rights were satisfied by having had its day in court on an issue, and that it is not entitled to another day in court against a particular defendant on that issue.\u201d 249 Md. at 45.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Citing <em>Durant v. Essex Co., </em>74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 107, 19 L. Ed. 154 (1869); <em>Kolb, </em>68 Md. 516; <em>Lyon v. Ingham Circuit Judge, </em>37 Mich. 377 (1877); and <em>McAlister v. Hamilton, </em>61 S.C. 6, 39 S.E. 182 (1901), for authority, 2 A. Freeman, <em>Judgments </em>\u00a7 722 at 1529 (5th ed. 1925), states, \"The effect of a judgment is not limited by the fact that on appeal it was affirmed on an equal division of the judges.\u201d A slightly more expansive statement, likewise citing <em>Durant, </em>is found in 2 H. Black, <em>Judgments, </em>\u00a7 528 (2d ed. 1902):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\"It has sometimes been contended in argument that a judgment pronounced by a divided court was, for that reason, not conclusive. But the authorities distinctly declare that such a judgment is just as conclusive and binding upon the parties, in every respect, as if rendered upon the concurrence of all the judges upon every question involved in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Citing some of the same cases, 1 Ii. Herman, <em>Law of Estoppel and Res Judicata, </em>\u00a7 116 (1886), states, \"The conclusiveness of a decision or decree of a court of last resort, is not vitiated by the fact that it is one of affirmance by a divided court, it forever settles the question decided as to that case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">In <em>Durant, </em>74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 107, Justice Field stated for the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\"There is nothing in the fact that the judges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>this court were divided in opinion upon the question whether the decree should be reversed or not, and, therefore, ordered an affirmance of the decree of the court below. The judgment of affirmance was the judgment of the entire court. The division of opinion between the judges was the reason for the entry of that judgment; but the reason is no part of the judgment itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">After reviewing English and American procedures and such United States Supreme Court cases as <em>The Antelope, </em>23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 66; <em>Etting, </em>24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 59, and <em>Brown v. Aspden, </em>55 U.S. (14 How.) 25 (1853), Justice Field concluded for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\"The statement which always accompanies a judgment in such case, that it is rendered by a divided court, is only intended to show that there was a division among the judges upon the questions of law or fact involved, not that there was any disagreement as to the judgment to be entered upon such division. It serves to explain the absence of any opinion in the cause, and prevents the decision from becoming an authority for other cases of like character. But the judgment is as conclusive and binding in every respect upon the parties as if rendered upon the concurrence of all the judges upon every question involved in the case.\u201d 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) at 113.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Mandel obviously was not incarcerated in a federal prison upon the strength or authority of a nullity. The reasoning of Justice Field for the Supreme Court, of our own predecessors, and of the textwriters is sound. The conviction of Mandel in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, duly affirmed upon appeal, is \"a final judgment by a judicial tribunal in another proceeding convicting an attorney of a crime\u201d within the purview of Rule BV10 e 1. Thus it is \"conclusive proof of the guilt of the attorney of that crime.\u201d Hence, we shall not go behind the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Mandel urges that he was not convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. He claims that his case is distinguishable from <em>Klauber III, </em>289 Md. 446. In that case we said, after quoting from the mail fraud statute which has undergone no significant change since its enactment in 1909:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\"The most recent opinion of the Supreme Court on this statute is <em>Pereira v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 1, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L. Ed. 435 (1954), in which Chief Justice Warren said for the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">The elements of the offense of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 1341 are (1) a scheme to defraud, and (2) the mailing of a letter, etc., for the purpose of executing the scheme. It is not necessary that the scheme contemplate the use of the mails as an essential element. <em>United States v. Young, </em>232 U.S. 155. <em>[Id. </em>at 8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\"In reviewing convictions under this statute the federal appellate courts consistently have said that to convict under this statute these elements must be established. They usually cite <em>Pereira </em>to this effect. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Bohonus, </em>628 F.2d 1167, 1171 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 928, 100 S.

He points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\"In <em>Klauber </em>III and <em>Pine, supra, </em>the predicate federal mail frauds were like those traditionally within the scope of the mail fraud statute. There was clear financial loss to the victims. The scheme or artifice grew out of conduct of a law practice. The fraud was simple, the court\u2019s instructions to the jury were clear, and the convictions were readily affirmed on appeal without a whimper of dissent, let alone equal division. The predicate federal proceeding against [Mandel], on the contrary, was vastly dissimilar. In it, 'the mail fraud statute [was carried] near its outer limits, and some cases may arguably indicate beyond.\u2019 <em>United States v. Mandel, </em>602 F.2d 653, 656 (4th Cir. 1979) (Widener, J., dissenting).\u201d (Last brackets in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We point out, however, that Judge Widener in the majority opinion in <em>Mandel I, </em>591 F.2d 1347, as we have already quoted, upheld for the court those \"outer limits\u201d of mail fraud. There was no dissent on that point. It thus is significant to note that in <em>Mandel I </em>Judge Widener said for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\"The gist of the mail fraud counts of the indictment charged that beginning between January 7, 1969 and the spring of 1971, and continuing thereafter to the date of the filing of the indictment, Appellants devised and intended to devise a scheme and artifice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">'(a) To defraud the citizens of the State of Maryland, and its governmental departments, agencies, officials and employees, both executive and legislative, of their right to the conscientious, loyal, faithful, disinterested and unbiased services, actions and performance of official duties of MARVIN MANDEL, in his official capacities as Governor of the State of Maryland, free from bribery, corruption, partiality, willful omission, bias, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>dishonesty, deceit, official misconduct and fraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">'(b) To defraud the citizens of the State of Maryland, and its governmental departments, agencies, officials and employees, both executive and legislative, of their right to have the state\u2019s business and its affairs conducted honestly, impartially, free from bribery, corruption, bias, dishonesty, deceit, official misconduct and fraud, and in accordance with the laws and Code of Ethics of the State of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">'(c) To defraud the citizens of the State of Maryland, and its governmental departments, agencies, officials and employees, both executive and legislative, of their right to have available and to be made aware of all relevant and pertinent facts and circumstances when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">(1) drafting, considering and deliberating upon proposed legislation for the State of Maryland with respect to the Maryland horse racing industry and to other matters;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">(2) administering the laws of the State of Maryland with respect to the Maryland horse racing industry and to other matters; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">(3) transacting business for and on behalf of the State of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">'(d) To obtain, directly and indirectly, money, property and other things of value, by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, and the concealment of material facts, relating to the Marlboro Race Track, the Bowie Race Track, the Security Investment Company, Ray\u2019s Point, Inc., and to other matters.\u2019 (from count 1, para. 13, of the indictment).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Paragraphs 14 through 32 of count 1 set forth the specifics of the alleged scheme to defraud. These specifics include allegations of bribery and the misrepresentation and concealment of material information on the part of the Appellants. Counts 2 to 20 incorporate by reference the allegations contained in count 1 and charge Appellants with various particular uses of the mails in the execution of the alleged scheme.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">\"In the racketeering counts, the government charged Governor Mandel in count 21 with acquiring and maintaining an interest in and control of the Security Investment Company through a pattern of racketeering activity that included mail fraud and bribery.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1353.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Mandel was convicted by a jury under that indictment. It is apparent that one of the issues presented by Mandel on appeal was the sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See the discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>sion of this issue in <em>Mandel I </em>by the majority opinion, which did not believe it was necessary to decide the point, 591 F.2d at 1373-74, and the dissent, 591 F.2d at 1386-87, which concluded that there was sufficient evidence. Hence, it is important to note that the en banc court found sufficient evidence to convict since it stated, \"A majority of the members of the <em>en banc </em>court would affirm the judgments of conviction against <em>all </em>of the contentions of the appellants except the claim of error in the charge to the jury which was the point upon which there was equal division.\u201d 602 F.2d at 653. (Second emphasis added.) In <em>Mandel I </em>the court further stated in discussing the mail fraud statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\"As a result of the failure to limit the term 'scheme or artifice to defraud\u2019 to common law definitions of fraud and false pretenses and schemes prohibited by State law, the mail fraud statute generally has been available to prosecute a' scheme involving deception that employs the mails in its execution that is contrary to public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of moral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1361.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">No one has challenged the accuracy of the statement in the dissent in <em>Mandel I </em>concerning jury instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\"The judge instructed the jury that a scheme to defraud is a necessary element of a mail fraud offense and that a scheme to defraud involves 'intentional use of false or fraudulent representations.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>He also told the jury that Mandel could not be convicted of mail fraud unless he had knowingly participated in the scheme to defraud alleged in the indictment. He emphasized this by explaining: 'The purpose of adding the word \"knowingly\u201d is to ensure that no one will be convicted for an act done because of mistake, or accident, or other innocent reason.\u2019 Elsewhere in the instructions, the judge fully explained the alleged scheme and set forth the government\u2019s contentions, which embraced proof that Mandel knowingly promoted the interests of his friends.\u201d 591 F.2d at 1379.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">It thus will be seen that fraud was the very essence of the charge under which Mandel was convicted. Accordingly, until the Supreme Court holds that fraud is not one of the elements of the offense of mail fraud which must be proved in order to convict under that statute, we hold as we did in <em>Klauber III, </em>289 Md. at 458, and <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>272 Md. 687, 690, 326 A.2d 180 (1974), mail fraud is \"a crime plainly involving moral turpitude.\u201d Hence Mandel stands convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. The fact that clients suffered no loss does not make Mandel\u2019s acts any less fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Having concluded that Mandel was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, the question presented is the sanction to be imposed. It is urged upon us that he \"has suffered enough,\u201d that \"[s]ince 1977, [Mandel] has been under suspension while he sweated through a tortuous appellate process and endured a nineteen month incarceration,\u201d that his \"lawyer\u2019s license\u201d has \"never [been] blemished as an attorney,\u201d and that \"[i]ive years \u2014 already served in suspended status \u2014 is enough.\u201d These statements miss the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We said in <em>Siegel, </em>275 Md. 521, relative to \"compelling extenuating circumstances\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\"Those considerations which potentially could merit this designation, even though the respondent has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, are only those which may cause this Court to view the conviction in a light which tends to show that the respondent\u2019s illegal act, committed in violation of a criminal statute, resulted from intensely strained circumstances or that the magnitude and the nature of the crime are not so severe as to compel disbarment.\u201d 275 Md. at 527.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The circumstances cited do not tend to show that Mandel\u2019s \"illegal act[s], committed in violation of a criminal statute, resulted from intensely strained circumstances or that the magnitude and the nature of the crime are not so severe as to compel disbarment.\u201d An example of \"intensely strained circumstances\u201d involved in the commission of a crime would be if a man were to steal milk for his starving children. See <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Flynn, </em>283 Md. 41, 45-46, 387 A.2d 775 (1978), for a case which met the test of <em>Siegel. </em>The compelling extenuating circumstances there existed \"at the time of the commission of the dishonest and otherwise improper acts ....\u201d The \"circumstances\u201d argued here concern not the commission of the crime itself, but its aftermath. Hence, they are not compelling extenuating circumstances as that term is used in our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">What Judge Digges said for the Court in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 318 A.2d 811 (1974), bears repeating here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\"A court has the duty, since attorneys are its officers, to insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Disciplinary procedures have been established for this purpose, not for punishment, but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public. <em>Balliet v. Balto. Co. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>259 Md. 474, 270 A.2d 465 (1970). The administration of justice under our adversary sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>tem largely depends upon the public\u2019s ability to rely on the honesty of attorneys who are placed in a position of being called upon to conduct the affairs of others both in and out of court. Although a court\u2019s power to disbar should be exercised only with restraint, '[w]hen ... unworthiness is shown to be present... it becomes our sad duty, but nonetheless our obligation to withdraw the privilege to practice law earlier granted by this Court. To fail to do so will impliedly represent to the public that the attorney continues to possess the basic qualities of honor traditionally associated with members of the bar of this State.\u2019 <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 519-20, 307 A.2d 677 (1973). In a proceeding such as this, therefore, the underlying question is 'whether, after the conduct of this man, it is proper that he should continue [as] a member of [the legal] profession ....\u2019 <em>Ex parte Brownshall, </em>2 Cowp. 829 (1778). In the absence of a compelling exculpatory explanation, we think that the answer to this question must be no when an attorney is found guilty of a crime which is deemed to involve moral turpitude and the offense entails the employment of dishonesty, fraud, or deceit which is perpetrated to enrich the offending attorney or to enhance his own well-being at the expense of his client, the state, or any other individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\"As can be discerned from this statement, we see no significant moral distinction between willfully defrauding and cheating for personal gain a client, an individual, or the government. Cheating one\u2019s client and defrauding the government are reprehensible in equal degree.\u201d 271 Md. at 549-50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">. . [T]his Court has consistently adhered to the view, both prior to 1970 (when we reviewed disciplinary actions only on appeal at the instance of the respondent-attorney), <em>Balliet v. Balto. Co.

The public interest is protected when we discipline an attorney since it demonstrates both to the public and to the legal profession the type of conduct on the part of officers of this Court which we will not tolerate without sanction. See, <em>e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>288 Md. 341, 382, 420 A.2d 940, <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 970 (1981); and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

We observe that a not guilty verdict in a criminal proceeding does not insulate an attorney from disciplinary action based upon the same allegations. In <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v, Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 535, 325 A.2d 718 (1974), we said that Frank was charged \"with engaging in unprofessional conduct comprising the same acts alleged in the criminal proceeding.\u201d Judge Digges went on to say for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\"If not all, certainly the vast majority of this country\u2019s courts support the conclusion that the principles of double jeopardy or res judicata are no bar to a disciplinary proceeding which follows the disposition of a criminal indictment, though based on substantially the same conduct. See, <em>e.g., In re Echeles, </em>430 F.2d 347 (7th Cir. 1970); <em>In re Pennica, </em>36 N.J. 401, 177 A.2d 721 (1962); <em>In re Browning, </em>23 I11.2d 483, 179 N.E.2d 14 (1961); 123 A.L.R. 779 (1939); 7 Am.

We agree with the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>In re Pennica, supra, </em>when it reasoned that res judicata cannot apply to disciplinary proceedings which follow an acquittal of criminal charges based on substantially the same conduct because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">'not only are the parties different but the purposes of the two proceedings are different. In the disciplinary matter, the primary purpose is not to punish an offender; it is to protect the public against members of the bar who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the relationship of attorney and client; it is to ascertain whether the conduct of the attorney involved has demonstrated his unfitness to practice law, and if so to deprive him of his previously acquired privilege to serve as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>an officer of the court, [citations omitted] Moreover, the <em>quantum of </em>proof required to warrant discipline or disbarment is different from that demanded for conviction of a criminal charge.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 730.\u201d 272 Md. at 535-36 (brackets in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">He further quoted for the Court from <em>In re Echeles, </em>430 F.2d 347 (7th Cir. 1970), and from the dictum in <em>Scott v.

Mandel, </em>591 F.2d 1347, 1365 (4th Cir. 1979) <em>(Mandel I). </em>By the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on Governor Mandel\u2019s established theories of defense to which he was entitled as a matter of fundamental fairness and established law, due process may very well have been denied. <em>United States v. Mandel, </em>602 F.2d 653 (4th Cir. 1979) <em>(Mandel II) </em>(Widener, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Regardless of the degree of my reluctance and discontent, I am constrained to follow the mandate of Md. Rule BV10 e 1 which declares that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">[A] final judgment by a judicial tribunal in another proceeding convicting an attorney of a crime shall be conclusive proof of the guilt of the attorney of that crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In concurring with my brothers, however, I must relate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the foundation of my concern that the present mandate of Md. Rule BV10 e 1, while intending to avoid the retrial of a criminal charge, may deny due process to a member of the Maryland Bar. Where the respondent contends that a substantial denial of due process has been visited upon him by a federal or sister state tribunal, wherein the reviewing court has been unable to reach a determination of an issue that would require reversal under Maryland\u2019s higher standard of due process as guaranteed by the Maryland Declaration of Rights, we should be able to review the contention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maryland\u2019s present rules as to disbarment set an inflexible rein on this Court, precluding us from making an independent evaluation of the underlying circumstances of any judgment of conviction, even in an instance where a jury\u2019s verdict is affirmed by virtue of a reviewing court\u2019s inability to reach a determination as to whether or not the attorney was afforded a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Although of no direct benefit to the respondent in this matter, a brief review of the mail fraud instruction issue shall serve to highlight the need for some degree of flexibility under Md. Rule BV10 e 1 regarding criminal convictions of a Maryland attorney by federal or sister state tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">It is important to note that any scheme contrary to public policy that involves deception can be prosecuted under the mail fraud statute if the mails are used in the execution of the scheme. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, </em>458 F.2d 875, 880 (5th Cir. 1972) cert. den. 409 U.S. 891, 93 S.Ct. 118, 34 L.Ed. 2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>According to the majority in <em>Mandel I,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">Based upon the indictment and the record in this case, the Appellants could have been convicted of mail fraud only if one or more of the following schemes to defraud were proven: a scheme involving the bribery or attempted bribery of Governor Mandel; or, a scheme involving the fraudulent misrepresentation of facts to, or such concealment of true facts from, the Maryland General Assembly and the Maryland Racing Commission for the purpose of obtaining legislation, racing days, and other things financially beneficial to those interested in Marlboro and later Bowie. <em>Mandel I, supra, </em>at 1365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Contrary to its argument on appeal that bribery was relevant to the mail fraud count, the government convinced the trial judge to refuse the defendants\u2019 request to instruct the jury as to the crucial difference between a mere gift or good will expenditure and the receipt of a benefit or <em>quid pro quo </em>for some official act favorable to the donor. <em>Mandel II, supra, </em>at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The majority in <em>Mandel I </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">The failure by the district court to instruct the jury on the distinction between legally innocent benefits and bribes in the context of the mail fraud counts leads us to the conclusion that the jury may easily have been misled. ... <em>Mandel I, supra, </em>at 1365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">As to the element of misrepresentation or concealment of the names of the true owners of the Marlboro Race Track, Governor Mandel contended that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as to the necessity of finding that he had knowledge that some or all of the other defendants were the true owners of Marlboro Race Track at the time the race track legislation was being considered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Maryland General Assembly before the jury could find him guilty of mail fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The majority in <em>Mandel </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">We think it was necessary for the jury to be charged that Governor Mandel could not be convicted under \u00a7 1341 for engaging in a scheme to defraud that involved the fraudulent misrepresentation of facts to, or such concealment of material information from, the 1972 Maryland General Assembly, without first finding that he knew that some or all of the other Appellants were among the true owners of Marlboro Race Track during the 1972 session of the Maryland General Assembly.... If Governor Mandel did not know who any of the real owners of Marlboro were during the 1972 legislative session of the Maryland General Assembly, he could hardly have participated with specific intent, in the context of this case, in a scheme to defraud that involved the misrepresentation or concealment of the names of the true owners of Marlboro from the Maryland General Assembly.... <em>Mandel I, supra, </em>at 1365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">As Judge Widener further stated in his dissent in <em>Mandel II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">This is an involved case. The prosecution rests on fragmented circumstances, many of the more essential ones being no more than mere rumor and legislative corridor gossip. In such a case, is not a defendant entitled to precise instructions? What was done here was, however, more likely to confuse and mislead than to provide clear guidance for the jury. And that should entitle the defendants to a new trial. The error is not insubstantial; it is fundamental. <em>Mandel II, supra, </em>at 655.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Under Maryland law, any person who has been accused of committing a criminal offense is entitled as a matter of constitutional right to have the jury instructed on every question or point of law essential to the crime charged which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>is supported by an evidentiary foundation when a request for such an instruction has been made. The refusal to so instruct, is reversible error. <em>Hardison v. State, </em>226 Md. 53, 172 A.2d 407 (1961), (wherein this Court reversed judgments of conviction for grand larceny and breaking and entering upon the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury with respect to the definition of an accomplice and the law regarding the necessary corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony); <em>Pulley v. State, </em>38 Md. App. 682, 382 A.2d 621 (1978), (wherein the Court of Special Appeals reversed a judgment of conviction for first degree murder upon the trial court\u2019s refusal to give an alibi instruction); and <em>Mumford v. State, </em>19 Md. App. 640, 313 A.2d 563 (1974), (wherein the Court of Special Appeals reversed a judgment of conviction for felony-murder upon the trial court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction that if the jurors found that a co-defendant could not have expected her companions to commit a rape which resulted in the victim\u2019s death, she could not be found guilty.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Indeed, Judge Widener in <em>Mandel II, </em>when expressing his thoughts regarding Governor Mandel\u2019s right, as a universally recognized and accepted time honored principle, to have the jury instructed on his crucial theories of defense relating to the mail fraud elements of concealment or misrepresentation of facts and bribery, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">[E]very circuit, including this court, has embraced the principle that a criminal defendant is <em>entitled </em>to an instruction on any theory of defense for which there is a foundation in the evidence.

Judge Grady in his opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">While the Supreme Court of the United States and the lesser federal courts regard themselves as the repository of ultimate knowledge on what constitutes due process and frequently find fault with state courts in this regard, the <em>dubious due process </em>the Respondent received in the course of his appeal fails to measure up to that afforded any criminal defendant by the Maryland appellate courts. Scholarly analyses <em>highly critical </em>of the appellate courts in Respondent\u2019s case have appeared in: Note, <em>United States v. Mandel: </em>The Mail Fraud and En Banc Procedural Issues, 40 Md. L. Rev. 550 (1981) and Note, <em>United States v.
