The charge was based on the allegation that Mark stole a box, containing two or three dollars, from the counter of a store owned and operated by Eu Ja Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>An adjudicatory hearing was held on April 15, 1980, before a juvenile master (Master Briscoe).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State\u2019s first witness at the hearing was a police officer. Following the officer\u2019s testimony, the State put on its principal witness, the victim Eu Ja Lee. After Ms. Lee completed her testimony on direct examination, and during cross-examination by Mark\u2019s attorney, the juvenile master \"sua sponte, declared a mistrial.\u201d The reason given by the master for declaring a mistrial was \"that Ms. Lee did not have a satisfactory comprehension and ability to communicate in the English language.\u201d The stipulation of facts indicates that both sides were surprised by the mistrial declaration and that neither consented thereto. The docket entry regarding the April 15th adjudicatory hearing states in part: \"Mistrial; Reset before another Master and arrange for Korean Interpreter for victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Another adjudicatory hearing was held on April 29, 1980, before a different master (Master Cooksey). The State had arranged for an interpreter to be present. At this hearing, after the State\u2019s first witness was sworn, the defendant moved to dismiss the juvenile petition on grounds of double jeopardy and due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The theory of the motion was that there had been no \"manifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>declaration, and that, therefore, a second adjudicatory hearing would constitute a successive prosecution precluded by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and by due process principles. The master granted the State\u2019s motion for a postponement of the hearing in order that the State could prepare a memorandum in response to the motion to dismiss. For reasons not shown in the record or the parties\u2019 statements of fact, there were no further proceedings before a master.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On May 12, 1980, the court, presided over by a judge (Hargrove, J.), heard argument on the juvenile\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court denied the motion to dismiss, relying on <em>Swisher v. Brady, </em>438 U.S. 204, 98 S.Ct. 2699, 57 L.Ed.2d 705 (1978). The court indicated that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Swisher </em>v. <em>Brady </em>opinion, an adjudicatory hearing before a master is not final and will not become final until there is a decision by a trial judge. On this theory, the trial judge concluded that successive adjudicatory hearings before <em>masters, </em>or an adjudicatory hearing before a master and a later adjudicatory hearing before a judge, do not violate the double jeopardy prohibition against successive trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Following the denial of the motion to dismiss, the trial judge proceeded to hold an adjudicatory hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State\u2019s witnesses, Eu Ja Lee and an interpreter, were sworn. Ms. Lee testified anew although this time with the aid of the interpreter. On direct examination, Ms. Lee described placing the box containing money on her store counter and testified to seeing Mark take the box. After cross-examination and re-direct examination of Ms. Lee, and after the testimony of several defense witnesses, the trial judge found that Mark had taken the money. At a disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tional hearing one month later, the trial judge placed Mark on probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion, although its reasoning differed somewhat from that of the trial judge. The intermediate appellate court initially took the position that <em>Swisher v. Brady, </em>relied on by the trial judge, was \"not apposite.\u201d The court then indicated that the critical factor was the <em>\"time </em>when jeopardy first attache[d].\u201d The Court of Special Appeals stated that, \"despite the pronouncement in <em>Breed [Breed v. Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975)] that '[\u00a1Jeopardy attached ... when the Juvenile Court, as the trier of the facts, began to hear evidence,\u2019 421 U.S. at 531, we observe that the Court of Appeals in <em>Matter of Anderson, </em>272 Md. 85 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1000 (1975), stated. . . 'that a hearing before a master is not such a hearing as places a juvenile in jeopardy.\u2019 \u201d The Court of Special Appeals, on the basis of the quoted language from <em>Anderson, </em>held that \"no double jeopardy problem arises here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Because of the obvious importance of the constitutional issue presented, we granted Mark\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">As we pointed out last year in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>State, </em>290 Md. 76, 85-86, 427 A.2d 1008 (1981), very early in the history of this country, courts developed the rule that, because a criminal defendant was entitled to a verdict once his trial began, if that trial \"were aborted by certain actions of the court or prosecutor without the defendant\u2019s consent, thereby depriving him of his right to a verdict, then the prohibition against double jeopardy would preclude a <em>subsequent </em>trial. This principle was applied when the trial was aborted either by the prosecutor\u2019s entering a nolle prosequi or otherwise abandoning the prosecution, or by the court\u2019s declaring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>mistrial without a 'manifest necessity\u2019 for so doing (whether <em>sua sponte </em>or upon the prosecutor\u2019s motion).\u201d We indicated in <em>Ward </em>that one of the principal considerations underlying this rule was the unfairness in permitting a trial to be aborted without the defendant\u2019s consent, thereby possibly giving the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict the defendant at a later date. 290 Md. at 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Recently, in <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), the Supreme Court summarized the reasons for precluding a second trial where the defendant\u2019s first trial was terminated by a mistrial without his consent (434 U.S. at 503-507):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAU\">\"Because jeopardy attaches before the judgment becomes final, the constitutional protection [against double jeopardy] also embraces the defendant\u2019s 'valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u2019 The reasons why this 'valued right\u2019 merits constitutional protection are worthy of repetition. Even if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may be grossly unfair. It increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused, prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted. The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed. Consequently, as a general rule, the prosecutor is entitled to one, and only one, opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Unlike the situation in which the trial has ended in an acquittal or conviction, retrial is not automatically barred when a criminal proceeding is terminated without finally resolving the merits of the charges against the accused.... Yet in view of the importance of the right, and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His burden is a heavy one. The prosecutor must demonstrate 'manifest necessity\u2019 for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">The words 'manifest necessity\u2019 appropriately characterize the magnitude of the prosecutor\u2019s burden. For that reason Mr. Justice Story\u2019s classic formulation of the test [in <em>United States v. Perez, </em>9 Wheat. 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824)] has been quoted over and over again to provide guidance in the decision of a wide variety of cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">While observing that the \"manifest necessity\u201d standard \"can not be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge,\u201d the Court in <em>Arizona v. Washington </em>went on to state that \"we require a 'high degree\u2019 [of necessity] before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate.\u201d 434 U.S. at 506. The Supreme Court indicated that the degree of discretion accorded a trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial varies with the particular situation. The Court first pointed to a situation failing to meet the \"high degree\u201d of necessity standard and where retrials following mistrials are prohibited <em>(id. </em>at 507-508):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\"The question whether that 'high degree\u2019 has been reached is answered more easily in some kinds of cases than in others. At one extreme are cases in which a prosecutor requests a mistrial in order to buttress weaknesses in his evidence. Although there was a time when English judges served the Stuart monarchs by exercising a power to discharge a jury whenever it appeared that the Crown\u2019s evidence would be insufficient to convict, the prohibition against double jeopardy as it evolved in this country was plainly intended to condemn this 'abhorrent\u2019 practice.... Thus, the strictest scrutiny is appropriate when the basis for the mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The Court then described a situation \"[a]t the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>extreme,\u201d namely a mistrial because of a hung jury, where the law allows \"the trial judge to exercise broad discretion in deciding whether or not 'manifest necessity\u2019 justifies a discharge of the jury.. .. The trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is therefore accorded great deference by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509-510.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The rule that a second trial is prohibited if the first trial is aborted by a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent and unsupported by \"manifest necessity,\u201d is applicable to non-jury criminal trials as well as jury trials. <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 322 A.2d 880 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In the case at bar, the petitioner, Mark R., contends that the rule is also applicable to an adjudicatory hearing in a juvenile delinquency case and that, as there was no manifest necessity for the sua sponte mistrial aborting the first adjudicatory hearing, the subsequent adjudicatory hearings were prohibited by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. It is also asserted that the successive hearings violated due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The State, on the other hand, first contends that the rule precluding a retrial after an unnecessary and unconsented mistrial has no application to a juvenile delinquency adjudicatory hearing conducted by a master. Second, the State argues that even if the rule is applicable, there was \"manifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial declaration in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The State\u2019s argument that the double jeopardy principle, which ordinarily precludes a retrial following an unconsented mistrial, has no application to a juvenile adjudicatory hearing conducted by a master, has two related prongs. Reflecting the position of the Court of Special Appeals, the State claims that jeopardy does not attach at an adjudicatory hearing before a master. Alternatively, the State agrees with the trial judge that the adjudicatory hearings before the two masters in this case and the hearing before the judge should be viewed as a single continuous proceeding. The basis for both prongs of the State\u2019s argument is the fact that a master cannot render a final decision in juvenile adjudicatory hearing. Maryland Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 3-813 (d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; Maryland Rule 911. The State principally relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Anderson, </em>272 Md. 85, 321 A.2d 516 (1974), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>419 U.S. 809, 95 S.Ct. 21, 42 L.Ed.2d 35 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1000, 95 S.Ct. 2399, 44 L.Ed.2d 667 (1975). But the decision in <em>Anderson </em>did not involve the particular issue now before us. Moreover, cases after <em>Anderson </em>demonstrate that the State\u2019s argument in the instant case must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In <em>Matter of Anderson, </em>several juveniles were charged with delinquency, and, after adjudicatory hearings before a master, the master in each case submitted a recommendation to the judge that the petition be dismissed. The State filed an exception in each case pursuant to what was then Rule 908, which authorized such an exception and provided that it should be heard by the judge <em>de novo. </em>The juveniles challenged the exceptions on Fifth Amendment double jeopardy grounds; the trial judge sustained their challenges; appeals were taken by the State, and, after judgments by the Court of Special Appeals reversing the trial judge, this Court granted the juveniles\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari. We affirmed the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals, holding that the authorization then in Rule 908 for the State to file an exception from the master\u2019s recommendation did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>not violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We initially pointed out in <em>Anderson </em>that this Court had previously held that the prohibition against double jeopardy did not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings. 272 Md. at 92-93. Nevertheless, we assumed arguendo \"that a finding-that an individual is a delinquent under the terms of the juvenile act ... places him in jeopardy so that a second proceeding relative to the same incident would be barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, emphasis supplied. After reviewing the history of juvenile proceedings in Maryland, the function of a master in Chancery, and the limited authority of a master (id. at 93-106), the Court stated in <em>Anderson </em>that, because a master cannot make a final determination of delinquency and because his findings do not become binding until approved by a judge, \"we conclude that a hearing before a master is not such a hearing as places a juvenile in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Matter of Anderson, </em>therefore, involved the right of the State to take an exception from a juvenile master\u2019s recommendation. It did not involve or even mention the rule which precludes a retrial after an unnecessary and unconsented mistrial. Moreover, the <em>Anderson </em>opinion began with the assumption that a <em>f\u00ednding </em>of delinquency or nondelinquency would preclude further action under the Fifth Amendment, and this Court held that a master had no authority under Maryland law to make such a finding. The statement in <em>Anderson </em>that a juvenile delinquency adjudicatory hearing before a master \"is not such a hearing as places a juvenile in jeopardy\u201d was made in the context of determining when there was a final adjudication of delinquency. The Court was not addressing the question of when jeopardy initially attaches at a juvenile adjudicatory hearing. This issue was resolved by the Supreme Court a year after <em>Anderson </em>in <em>Breed v. Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In <em>Breed v. Jones, </em>a petition was filed in a California juvenile court alleging that Jones had committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the crime of robbery. Subsequently, an adjudicatory hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>held before a master or referee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following the testimony of two prosecution witnesses and the juvenile, the master found that the allegations of the petition were true, and he sustained the petition. Later, pursuant to a California practice whereby waiver or transfer hearings were held <em>after </em>adjudicatory hearings, the juvenile court held a waiver hearing, declared Jones unfit for treatment as a juvenile and ordered that he be prosecuted as an adult. Jones was ultimately convicted of robbery in the criminal court. Thereafter he filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court, alleging that his conviction violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. In denying the' petition, the District Court\u2019s reasons paralleled both prongs of the State\u2019s argument in the instant case. First, the District Court held that jeopardy had not attached at the adjudicatory hearing before the master. 421 U.S. at 526. Alternatively, the District Court held that \" 'even assuming jeopardy attached during the preliminary juvenile proceedings ... it is clear that no new jeopardy arose by the juvenile proceeding sending the case to the criminal court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, and the Supreme Court, in upholding that reversal, rejected both prongs of the District Court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Breed </em>initially observed that, with the exception of the right to a jury trial, the Court\u2019s decisions have \"been to make applicable in juvenile proceedings constitutional guarantees associated with traditional criminal prosecutions.\u201d 421 U.S. at 528-529. Then, turning specifically to the double jeopardy prohibition and the attachment of jeopardy, the Court stated <em>(id. </em>at 529):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\"We believe it is simply too late in the day to conclude, as did the District Court in this case, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>a juvenile is not put in jeopardy at a proceeding whose object is to determine whether he has committed acts that violate a criminal law and whose potential consequences include both the stigma inherent in such a determination and the deprivation of liberty for many years. For it is clear under our cases that determining the relevance of constitutional policies, like determining the applicability of constitutional rights, in juvenile proceedings, requires that courts eschew 'the \"civil\u201d label-of-convenience which has been attached to juvenile proceedings,\u2019 In Re Gault, <em>supra, </em>387 U.S. at 50, 87 S.Ct. at 1455, and that 'the juvenile process ... be candidly appraised.\u2019 387 U.S. at 21, 87 S.Ct. at 1440. See In re Winship, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 365-366, 90 S.Ct. at 1073.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Pointing out that \"in terms of potential consequences, there is little to distinguish an adjudicatory hearing such as was held in this case from a traditional criminal prosecution,\u201d and that a juvenile adjudicatory hearing \"engenders elements of 'anxiety and insecurity\u2019 in a juvenile, and imposes a 'heavy personal strain\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 530-531), the Court continued <em>(id. </em>at 531):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">\"We deal here, not with 'the formalities of the criminal adjudicative process,\u2019 McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S., at 551, 91 S.Ct. at 1989 (opinion of Blackmun, J.), but with an analysis of an aspect of the juvenile-court system in terms of the kind of risk to which jeopardy refers. Under our decisions we can find no persuasive distinction in that regard between the proceeding conducted in this case ... and a criminal prosecution, each of which is designed 'to vindicate [the] very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws.\u2019 United States v. Jorn, <em>supra, </em>400 U.S. at 479, 91 S.Ct. at 554. We therefore conclude that respondent was put in jeopardy at the adjudicatory hearing. Jeopardy attached when respondent was 'put to trial before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the trier of facts,\u2019 400 U.S., at 479, 91 S.Ct., at 554, that is, when the Juvenile Court, as the trier of the facts, began to hear evidence. See Serfass v. United States, 420 U.S., at 388, 95 S.Ct., at 1062.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">With regard to a contention by the State that the policy underlying the double jeopardy prohibition was not infringed because the juvenile never faced the risk of more than one punishment, the Supreme Court answered in language quite applicable to the case at bar <em>(id. </em>at 532-533):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">\"we have pointed out that 'the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2019 ... is written in terms of potential or risk of <em>trial </em>and conviction, not punishment,\u201d Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. at 329, 90 S.Ct. at 1761. (Emphasis added.) And we have recently noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">'The policy of avoiding multiple trials has been regarded as so important that exceptions to the principle have been only grudgingly allowed. . . Following the same policy, the Court has granted the Government the right to retry a defendant after a mistrial only where \"there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824).\u2019 United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 343, 344, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1022, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975). (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\"Respondent was subjected to the burden of two trials for the same offense; he was twice put to the task of marshalling his resources against those of the State, twice subjected to the 'heavy personal strain\u2019 which such an experience represents. United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S., at 479, 91 S.Ct., at 554.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The Court\u2019s reliance upon the mistrial cases is, of course, particularly noteworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Finally, the Court in <em>Breed </em>rejected the reasoning of the District Court that any jeopardy which \"attaches at an adjudicatory hearing continues until there has been a final disposition of the case. ...\u201d 421 U.S. at 533-534. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>pointed out that the concept of \"continuing jeopardy\u201d until the ultimate conclusion of a case was originally articulated by Justice Holmes, dissenting in <em>Kepner v. United States, </em>195 U.S. 100, 134-137, 24 S.Ct. 797, 806, 49 L.Ed. 114 (1904), and that the concept has never been accepted by a majority of the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 534. The Court concluded <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\"[T]he fact that the proceedings against respondent had not 'run their full course,\u2019 Price v. Georgia, <em>supra, </em>398 U.S. at 326, 90 S.Ct. at 1759, within the contemplation of the California Welfare and Institutions Code, at the time of transfer, does not satisfactorily explain why respondent should be deprived of the constitutional protection against a second trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\"><em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones </em>would certainly seem to require a rejection of both prongs <em>of </em>the State\u2019s argument in the instant case, <em>i.e., </em>that jeopardy does not attach at an adjudicatory hearing before a master and that successive adjudicatory hearings should be viewed as one \"continuous\u201d proceeding for double jeopardy purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent opinion in <em>Swisher v. Brady, supra, </em>also undermines the State\u2019s argument. Before discussing the <em>Swisher </em>opinion, the background of that case should be recounted. As previously mentioned, at the time <em>Matter of Anderson, supra, </em>was decided by this Court in 1974, our juvenile rules provided that the State was authorized to file exceptions to the master\u2019s findings and recommendations, and that, if exceptions were filed, the matter set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>forth in the exceptions would be heard by the judge <em>de novo. </em>During the spring of 1975, this Court\u2019s Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure was preparing a proposed revision of the juvenile rules, in light of the Legislature\u2019s revision of the juvenile statutory provisions at its 1975 session. On June 3, 1975, the Standing Committee on Rules forwarded its recommendations to this Court. One of the recommendations was the proposed rule that the State\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s findings and recommendations would be heard <em>de novo </em>if the State so elected. 2 Md. Reg. 909 (1975).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, just a few days earlier, on May 27, 1975, the Supreme Court had handed down its opinion in <em>Breed v. Jones, supra. </em>And shortly thereafter, on June 11, 1975, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, relying on <em>Breed v. Jones, </em>held that a <em>de novo </em>hearing, upon the State\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s findings and recommendations, constituted a subsequent adjudicatory hearing which was forbidden by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Aldridge v. Dean, </em>395 F.Supp. 1161 (D. Md. 1975). Between June 11, 1975, and June 18, 1975, the Standing Committee on Rules modified its recommendation, and proposed that the excepting party <em>other than the State </em>could elect a <em>de novo </em>hearing, and that \"[i]f the State is the excepting party, the hearing shall be on the record, supplemented by such additional evidence as the judge considers relevant and to which the parties raise no objection.\u201d Proposed Rule 910 e, 2 Md. Reg. 970 (1975). The committee members\u2019 notes indicate that the proposed change was due to <em>Breed v. Jones </em>and <em>Aldridge </em>v. <em>Dean. </em>This Court concurred with the recommended change, and the rule as promulgated on June 18, 1975, did not allow the State as excepting party to present additional evidence if the juvenile objected. 2 Md. Reg. 967, 970 (1975). That provision, currently numbered Rule 911 c, remains the same today.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Two years later, in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Swisher, </em>436 F.Supp. 1361 (D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Md. 1977), the United States District Court for the District of Maryland held that permitting the State to take exceptions to a juvenile master\u2019s finding of non-delinquency or to his disposition order was a violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, despite the fact that the exceptions were heard on the record and not <em>de novo. </em>The District Court thus held unconstitutional the rule which had been promulgated by this Court. Upon the State\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court reversed. <em>Swisher v. Brady, supra, </em>438 U.S. at 219. But the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in upholding the Maryland rule authorizing exceptions by the State to the master\u2019s proposed findings and recommendations, compels the rejection of the State\u2019s position in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The Supreme Court began its legal discussion in <em>Swisher </em>by quoting from <em>Arizona v. Washington, supra, </em>a mistrial case, for the \"general principles governing this case.\u201d 438 U.S. at 214.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Then, agreeing with the position of this Court in promulgating Rule 911, the Supreme Court held that permitting the State to file exceptions from the master\u2019s proposals does not require an accused to stand trial a second time in violation of double jeopardy principles because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>juvenile is subjected to a single proceeding beginning with the master\u2019s hearing and culminating with the judge\u2019s adjudication and <em>because the prosecution is not entitled to present additional evidence before the judge. </em>The Supreme Court stated <em>(id. </em>at 215-216, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\"Importantly, a Rule 911 proceeding does not impinge on the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. A central purpose 'of the prohibition against successive trials\u2019 is to bar 'the prosecution [from] another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978). <em>A Rule 911 proceeding does not provide the prosecution that forbidden 'second crack. \u2019 </em>The State presents its evidence once before the master. The record is then closed, and additional evidence can be received by the Juvenile Court judge only with the consent of the minor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Later, the Court again emphasized that under Rule 911, the juvenile is not subjected \"to the embarrassment, expense and ordeal\u201d of a \"full-blown\u201d second hearing because the judge conducts the hearing on the record. <em>Id. </em>at 216-217. Finally, the Supreme Court specifically drew a distinction between the limited authorization for the State to take exceptions and, <em>inter alia, </em>a mistrial ruling which would lead to a second factual hearing <em>(id. </em>at 218, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\"In <em>Scott [United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978)] we held that it is not all proceedings requiring the making of supplemental findings that are barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, but only those that follow a previous trial ending in an acquittal; in a conviction either not reversed on appeal or reversed because of insufficient evidence, see <em>Burks v. United States, supra, </em>or in a <em>mistrial ruling not prompted by 'manifest necessity,\u2019 see Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978). A Juvenile Court judge\u2019s decision terminating a Rule 911 proceeding follows none of those occurrences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In the case at bar, the juvenile was subject to two \"full-blown\u201d factual hearings without his consent. The State was provided with \"that forbidden 'second crack.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If there was no \"manifest necessity\u201d for the unconsented mistrial, the subsequent <em>de novo </em>adjudicatory hearing clearly cannot be squared with the principles set forth in <em>Swisher v. Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Moreover, to accept the State\u2019s position, that the double jeopardy prohibition has no application to juvenile adjudicatory hearings conducted by masters and ending in unnecessary and unconsented mistrials, could give the State even more than a forbidden \"second crack.\u201d Under the State\u2019s theory, there could be innumerable adjudicatory hearings before masters as long as masters were willing to abort hearings because of deficiencies in the State\u2019s case. This opportunity for harrassment and abuse would frustrate one of the chief purposes of the double jeopardy prohibition. We agree with the courts in other jurisdictions which have consistently held that the declaration of a mistrial in a juvenile adjudicatory hearing, without manifest necessity and without the juvenile\u2019s consent, precludes a subsequent adjudicatory hearing. <em>In re Raymond P., </em>86 Cal.App.3d 797, 150 Cal.Rptr. 537 (1978) (dismissal by juvenile master during an adjudicatory hearing was treated as a mistrial declaration, and the court held that under <em>Swisher v. Brady, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971), the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited a further adjudicatory hearing); <em>District of Columbia v. I. P., </em>335 A.2d 224 (D.C. 1975); <em>State in Interest of C.V., </em>146 N.J.Super. 573, 370 A.2d 490, <em>certif. denied, </em>74 N.J. 258, 377 A.2d 663 (1977); <em>People ex rel.

Washington, supra, </em>434 U.S. at 505. Furthermore, reviewing courts should \"resolve any doubt\u201d in favor of the defendant, <em>Downum v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 734, 738, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We pointed out in <em>Jourdan v. State, </em>275 Md. 495, 510, 341 A.2d 388 (1975), and earlier in <em>Cornish </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>272 Md. at 317-318, that, although the courts have not prescribed strict categories of circumstances which will meet the \"manifest necessity\u201d standard, the cases do set forth certain general principles for determining whether that standard is met. Thus in <em>Cornish </em>we discussed various situations in which retrials after mistrials have ordinarily been permitted, as well as other situations where retrials have been precluded under the \"manifest necessity\u201d test, 272 Md. at 318, 321. Two circumstances, under which retrials after unconsented mistrials have generally been prohibited, are present in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">First, the cases clearly establish that a deficiency in the prosecution\u2019s evidence, whether or not it should have been expected by the prosecutor and whether or not the prosecutor was at fault, ordinarily does not constitute \"manifest necessity\u201d justifying an unconsented mistrial. <em>See, e.g., Downum v. United States, supra, </em>372 U.S. at 737-738 (prosecution witness absent); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>509 F.2d 312 (D.C.Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 991, 95 S.Ct. 1427, 43 L.Ed.2d 672 (1975) (refusal of prosecution witness to testify); <em>McNeal v.

I.P., supra, </em>335 A.2d at 226 (because of testimony during cross-examination of prosecution\u2019s witness during juvenile adjudicatory hearing, court believed that prosecution was \"trying to hide something\u201d); <em>Fonseca v.

Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. at 487; <em>Jourdan v. State, supra, </em>275 Md. at 511-512; <em>United States v. Tinney, </em>473 F.2d 1085, 1089 (3d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, 412 </em>U.S. 928, 93 S.Ct. 2752, 37 L.Ed.2d 156 (1973); <em>Matter of Raymond P., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.3d at 803; <em>Ostane v. Hickey, </em>385 So.2d 110 (Fla.App. 1980); <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>29 Ill.App.3d 529, 331 N.E.2d 163 (1974); <em>Jones v.

Thus in <em>Jourdan v. State, supra, </em>275 Md. at 511-512, where the court had declared a mistrial because the prosecuting attorney became ill during the trial, this Court held that there was no manifest necessity for the mistrial declaration because a continuance until another prosecuting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>attorney could become prepared was a feasible alternative. Several of the cases involving missing witnesses have pointed out that a continuance might have cured the problem. <em>See, e.g., Tolliver v. Judges of Family Court, supra, </em>298 N.Y.S.2d at 239-240 (absence of witness at juvenile adjudicatory hearing not manifest necessity \"for a mistrial and for causing the infant petitioner substantial prejudice by placing him in jeopardy again. At the most, the matter might have been adjourned once more to afford the complainant or the Court an added opportunity to secure the attendance of the claimed witness.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u25a0 Turning to the case before us, the mistrial declared by the master at the first adjudicatory hearing was entirely due to a deficiency in the prosecution\u2019s evidence, <em>i.e., </em>the alleged inability of the prosecution\u2019s chief witness to be understood during cross-examination. Assuming that the master was justified in concluding that the witness was unable to communicate in the English language, the problem was a failure of the prosecution to have another witness present, namely an interpreter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As shown by the above-cited cases involving mistrials because of the absence of a prosecution witness, such absence has virtually never been considered a manifest necessity for a mistrial. Moreover, a short continuance for the purpose of obtaining an interpreter, with a resumption of the adjudicatory hearing before the same master at the point during cross-examination when the master began to have difficulty, could have solved the problem. Therefore, for two separate reasons, there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">This conclusion is confirmed by a leading double jeopardy opinion involving a mistrial because of a prosecution witness\u2019s difficulties with the English language, <em>United States v. Kin Ping Cheung, </em>485 F.2d 689 (5th Cir. 1973). In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>case, Ting testified for the prosecution with the aid of an interpreter. During the cross-examination of Ting, difficulties began to occur. The court\u2019s opinion describes what happened as follows (485 F.2d at 690):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\"Ting asserted that he was having trouble with his memory; and acute problems arose concerning the translation of his testimony. Specifically, there was a serious question whether the word he used to describe what he thought he was importing into the United States should be translated as 'food\u2019 or as 'Chinese medicine\u2019. The trial judge had two discussions with counsel and the interpreters over the accuracy of the translation. After the completion of Ting\u2019s testimony, an Assistant United States Attorney, as an officer of the Court, felt compelled to call to the attention of the trial judge a statement by a potential Government witness to the effect that there was a 'little bit lacking\u2019 in the interpretation of Ting\u2019s testimony. This person, when questioned by the trial judge, pointed out that there were a number of Chinese dialects (he understood three), and the court interpreter seemed to comprehend Mandarin but did not fully understand Shanghaiese or Cantonese. In addition, there are certain concepts which cannot be translated in another language; that in some cases the best fidelity rate was about 70 to 75 percent. At this point, the trial judge, on his own motion, declared a mistrial in the case .... He stated that he expected an interpreter to be found who could speak the dialect of any witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">After reviewing the mistrial cases from <em>United States v. Perez, </em>9 Wheat. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824), until the present, the court in an opinion by Judge Wisdom held that the trial judge erred on two grounds in finding manifest necessity for a mistrial. \"First, the trial judge failed to consider alternatives to declaring a mistrial.\u201d <em>Kin Ping Cheung, supra, </em>485 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>F.2d at 691. One of those alternatives was the possibility of a continuance. The court went on <em>(id. </em>at 691-692):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">\"Second, this case is one where the mistrial 'entailed not only a delay for the defendant, but also operated as a postjeopardy continuance to allow the prosecution an opportunity to strengthen its case.\u2019 <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. at 469, 93 S.Ct. at 1073, 35 L.Ed.2d at 434; citing Downum v. United States, 1963, 372 U.S. 734, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100; see McNeal v. Hollowell, 5 Cir. 1973, 481 F.2d 1145, at 1150.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">As in <em>Kim Ping Cheung, </em>the prosecution witness\u2019s difficulties with the English language during cross-examination at the first adjudicatory hearing in the present case did not rise to that \"high degree\u201d of necessity required to justify a subsequent adjudicatory hearing. Consequently, the petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed, and case remanded to that Court with directions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\">. Despite the requirement in Maryland Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-813 (b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, that proceedings before juvenile masters be recorded, the proceedings and testimony at the April 15, 1980, adjudicatory hearing were apparently not recorded. Nevertheless, the parties have stipulated as to what occurred at that hearing. Additional facts concerning the trial court proceedings in this case are taken from statements of fact in the various briefs and memoranda filed by the parties. There are no disagreements between the two sides concerning what took place in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. The record also contains no transcript of the proceedings at the April 29th adjudicatory hearing. Although we know from the parties\u2019 statements of fact that the State\u2019s first witness was sworn, it is not clear whether that witness began to testify. Trial counsel for the juvenile was apparently of the belief that a motion to dismiss on the ground of a second trial forbidden by double jeopardy principles, could not be made until the attachment of jeopardy at the second trial. Of course, such a motion can be filed before the commencement of the second trial, and, if it is filed before the second trial, the denial of the motion is immediately appealable. <em>See </em>the discussion in Pulley v. State, 287 Md. 406, 412 A.2d 1244 (1980). As to when jeopardy attaches at a nonjury trial, <em>see </em>Blondes v.

Whether this hearing should be regarded as a third adjudicatory hearing, or as a continuation of the second adjudicatory hearing which commenced on April 29, 1980, before Master Cooksey, is immaterial and need not be explored in this case. If Mark\u2019s constitutional argument is sound, any adjudicatory hearing following the mistrial declaration on April 15, 1980, would have been precluded. On the other hand, if the State\u2019s position is sound, neither the proceedings on April 29th nor the adjudicatory hearing on May 12th would have been prohibited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\">.
