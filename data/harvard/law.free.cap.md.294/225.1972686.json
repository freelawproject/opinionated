Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 16 (a) (1). The phrase \"physical or mental handicap\u201d is defined as \"any physical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement which is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness . . . .\u201d Art. 49B, \u00a7 15 (g). We issued a writ of certiorari in this case to determine the extent, if any, that obesity may be a \"physical or mental handicap\u201d within the meaning of the statutory language. Despite the importance of this issue, we shall not be able to address it because of the employer\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Jacquelin Wilson applied for the position of bus driver with the Mass Transit Administration (MTA), and she was given a medical examination by the MTA\u2019s physician. The examining physician\u2019s report stated that Ms. Wilson was \"40 lbs. overweight,\u201d although no cause for this condition was set forth in the report. Ms. Wilson\u2019s employment application was rejected by the MTA because she was overweight. During the same period of time (1979-1980), the applications of Dorothea Goodman and Betty R. Wright for employment as bus drivers were also rejected by the MTA for the same reason.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The three women whose employment applications were rejected filed complaints with the Maryland Commission on Human Relations, alleging unlawful employment discrimination by the MTA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An investigation of the complaints by the Commission\u2019s staff pursuant to Art. 49B, \u00a7 10, resulted in staff findings of probable cause to believe that the MTA had engaged in discrimination based on physical handicaps in violation of Art. 49B, \u00a7 16 (a) (1). After the MTA refused to concur with the findings and refused to execute proposed conciliation agreements, the Commission\u2019s staff decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the matter would be set for a public hearing before a Commission hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Before any hearing was held, the MTA commenced the present action by filing in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City a bill for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commission. The bill recited the basic facts concerning the complaints which had been filed with the Commission, as well as the general allegation that numerous other similar complaints had been filed. The bill set forth the MTA\u2019s belief \"that it is necessary for the protection of the public safety that the MTA require applicants for the position of bus driver to meet certain weight requirements because of the lack of agility associated with overweight or obesity which agility is necessary for the safe operation of MTA buses.\u201d The MTA asserted \"that overweight or obesity is not a physical handicap within the meaning of the definition found in Article 49B\u201d and \"that the Commission has neither the power, authority nor jurisdiction to consider obesity as a physical handicap.\u201d The MTA requested a declaratory judgment determining whether overweight or obesity is a physical handicap within the meaning of the statute, as well as an injunction preserving the status quo pending the judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Commission filed a demurrer and an answer, asking that the bill of complaint be dismissed for failure of the MTA to exhaust its statutory administrative remedies. The Commission denied that it had taken a position on the question of whether obesity was a physical handicap within the meaning of the statute, and asserted that the issue should be determined after a public hearing by a hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In a written opinion, the Circuit Court held that the MTA need not exhaust administrative remedies because \"the issue here is purely one of statutory interpretation.\u201d The Commission\u2019s demurrer was overruled, and the Commission was enjoined \"from processing any complaints based on alleged discrimination because of obesity, pending further Order of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Subsequently, the MTA filed a motion for summary judgment. The Commission opposed the motion on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that the MTA had failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that obesity is not, as a matter of law, excluded from the definition of \"physical handicap\u201d in Art. 49B, \u00a7 15 (g). Attached to the Commission\u2019s opposition was an affidavit by Dr. Neil Solomon, an expert in the \"treatment of conditions commonly called 'overweight\u2019 and 'obesity,\u2019 \u201d which stated: \"Although it is not common, both overweight and obesity can ... be caused by illness, bodily injury or birth defect.\u201d Cases of obesity caused by illness, severe trauma and genetic deficiency were described.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The Circuit Court granted the motion for summary judgment, holding that no factual dispute existed. The court entered a declaratory judgment to the effect that the Commission \"is without jurisdiction to process complaints filed with it claiming obesity as a physical handicap under the definition contained in Article 49B, \u00a7 15 (g), unless, as a threshold matter, the [Commission] affirmatively ascertains that the obesity condition complained of 'is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness.\u2019 If there is no affirmative finding of causation, the [Commission] has no jurisdiction to further process the claim. ...\u201d The court enjoined the Commission \"from further processing each precipitating complaint against MTA based on alleged discrimination because of obesity until it is determined as a threshold matter that each complaint which is to be further processed is founded on 'bodily injury, birth defect or illness\u2019 . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Commission took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing (1) that the bill should have been dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and (2) that the Commission should not be required \"to determine at the threshold that a Complainant\u2019s obesity or overweight 'is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness\u2019 before it can process such a complaint\u201d (Commission\u2019s brief, p. 2). The MTA took a cross-appeal, arguing that \"obesity is not a physical handicap within the meaning of Art. 49B, \u00a7 15 (g) . . . even if it is caused by bodily injury, birth defect, or illness.\u201d (MTA\u2019s brief, p. 10). This Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to oral argument in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Under Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11, if after investigation, the Commission\u2019s staff finds probable cause to believe that a discriminatory act or acts have been committed, and if no agreement is reached for the elimination of the alleged discriminatory acts, a case is to be set for a hearing before a hearing examiner. At the hearing, the Commission\u2019s general counsel is to present the case in support of the complaint, and the respondent may submit testimony, examine and cross-examine witnesses and \"be fully heard.\u201d Art. 49B, \u00a7 11 (b). After the hearing, the hearing examiner is to render a decision; if the examiner finds that the respondent has engaged in unlawful discrimination, he is to enter an appropriate order. Art. 49B, \u00a7 11 (e). Furthermore, \"any party affected by the [hearing] examiner\u2019s decision\u201d may take an appeal to an \"appellate panel of commissioners\u201d in accordance with the procedural rules of the Commission. Art. 49B, \u00a7 3 (d). Finally, as we held in <em>Soley v. St. Comm\u2019n On Human Rel., </em>277 Md. 521, 525-526, 356 A.2d 254 (1976), under Art. 49B, \u00a7 12, together with the Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 255, either the Commission, the respondent, or a party aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s decision may file an action for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The above-described administrative and judicial review remedies were not exhausted in the present case. Because of this action for a declaratory judgment and an injunction, the complaints of Jacquelin Wilson, Dorothea Goodman and Betty R. Wright have not yet been heard by a hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">This Court has firmly adhered to the rule that statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial review remedies must ordinarily be pursued and exhausted. As recently summarized by Judge Digges for the Court in <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 283-284, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\"An examination of the decisions of this Court over the last four or five decades will supply ample support for the statement that there are few legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tenets which have received greater acceptance into the jurisprudential law of this State than the one announcing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">[A] claimant ordinarily must seek to redress the wrong of which he complains by using the statutory procedure the legislature has established for that kind of case, if it is adequate and available, and that if he is unsuccessful and wishes aid from the courts, he must take judicial appeals in the manner the legislature has specified rather than by seeking to invoke the ordinary general jurisdiction of the courts .... [Consequently, we] have consistently held that where a special form of remedy is provided, the litigant must adopt that form and must not bypass the administrative body or official, by pursuing other remedies. <em>[Agrarian, Inc. v. Zoning Inspector, </em>262 Md. 329, 332, 277 A.2d 591, 592 (1971).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">See in addition, <em>e.g., Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert Co., </em>286 Md. 303, 308, 407 A.2d 738, 741 (1979); <em>Klein v. Colonial Pipeline Company, </em>285 Md. 76, 83, 400 A.2d 768, 772 (1979); <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>282 Md. 641, 649, 387 A.2d 260, 265 (1978); <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>City of College Park, </em>280 Md. 525, 533, 375 A.2d 1098, 1104 (1977); <em>Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline v. Bendler, 280 </em>Md. 326, 330, 373 A.2d 1232, 1234 (1977); <em>Comm\u2019rs of Cambridge v. Henry, </em>263 Md. 370, 373-74, 283 A.2d 415, 417 (1971).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The principle that statutory administrative remedies must normally be exhausted is not only a requirement of our case law; it is a policy embodied in various enactments of the General Assembly. For example, the Administrative Procedure Act authorizes an aggrieved party to seek judicial review only from \"a <em>Gnal </em>decision\u201d of an administrative agency. Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a), emphasis supplied. The Declaratory Judgments Act, Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-409 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, states: \"If a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In fact, because of the strong public policy underlying this requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted, this Court, if it notices in a particular case an issue as to whether administrative remedies have been exhausted, will sua sponte address the issue despite the failure of the parties to raise the matter. <em>Joseph H. Munson Co. v. Sec. of State, </em>294 Md. 160, 448 A.2d 935 (1982); <em>Sec., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Wilson, </em>286 Md. 639, 645, 409 A.2d 713 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We have recognized a few limited exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, the principal one being an action challenging the validity of a legislative enactment on its face. <em>National Asphalt v. Prince Geo\u2019s Co., </em>292 Md. 75, 77, 437 A.2d 651 (1981); <em>Shipp v. Bevard, </em>291 Md. 590, 599, 435 A.2d 1114 (1981); <em>Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert Co., </em>286 Md. 303, 308-309, 407 A.2d 738 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The instant case, however, falls within no exception recognized by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Although there may be cases in some other jurisdictions supporting the trial court\u2019s view that administrative remedies need not be exhausted if the question is one of statutory interpretation like that presented here,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>is contrary to the settled law of Maryland. This Court has consistently held that statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial review remedies must be exhausted in cases involving the interpretation of statutory language. <em>See, e.g., Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, supra, </em>288 Md. at 287-290 (interpretation of county building code); <em>Sec., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>286 Md. at 642, 647 (interpretation of statutory provision increasing the amount of unemployment benefits); <em>Soley v. St. Comm\u2019n On Human Rel., supra, </em>277 Md. at 523-524, 527-528 (interpretation of provision in Art. 49B setting forth requirements for complaints issued by Human Relations Commission). Moreover, to hold that the existence of a statutory interpretation issue furnishes an excuse to abort the administrative proceedings before a final agency decision, would also be inconsistent with the principle that the agency\u2019s construction of a statute which it administers is entitled to weight. <em>See National Asphalt v. Prince Geo\u2019s Co., supra, 292 </em>Md. at 80; <em>Balto. Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades v. Barnes, </em>290 Md. 9, 14-15, 427 A.2d 979 (1981); <em>Comptroller v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 543, 404 A.2d 1045 (1979); <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, </em>283 Md. 677, 685, 393 A.2d 181 (1978); <em>Demory Brothers v. Bd. of Pub. Works, </em>273 Md. 320, 327, 329 A.2d 674 (1974); <em>Department v. Greyhound, </em>247 Md. 662, 669, 234 A.2d 255 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The MTA in the present case has couched the statutory interpretation issue in terms of the Commission\u2019s \"authority\u201d or \"power\u201d or \"jurisdiction,\u201d and has charged that the Commission is attempting to \"expand\u201d its jurisdiction and proceed in an unauthorized manner. Nevertheless, many, if not most, statutory interpretation issues arising in administrative proceedings could be phrased in terms of the agency\u2019s \"authority,\u201d \"power\u201d or \"jurisdiction\u201d to take a certain type of action in a specific case. A party\u2019s argument that an agency will be exceeding its authority if it ultimately interprets the statute and decides the case contrary to that party\u2019s position, does not excuse the failure to await a final agency decision. Thus in <em>Soley v. St. Comm\u2019n On Human Rel., supra, </em>277 Md. at 523-524, 527-528, it was argued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>appellant that, because the initial complaints failed to conform to statutory requirements as interpreted by the appellant, the Commission would be exceeding its authority to process the complaints and that, therefore, the appellant need not exhaust the statutorily prescribed administrative remedies. In rejecting this argument, Judge Levine stated for the Court (id. at 527-528):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\"The remaining ground on which appellants rely for their contention that the general rule should not be applied here is that there need be no exhaustion of administrative remedies where the act of the administrative agency is alleged to be ultra vires or illegal. They rest this contention on two cases, <em>Shpak </em>v. <em>Mytych, </em>231 Md. 414, 418, 190 A. 2d 777 (1963), and <em>Stark v. Board of Registration, </em>179 Md. 276, 284, 19 A. 2d 716 (1941). This reliance is misplaced. In neither <em>Shpak </em>nor <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 549-50, 121 A. 2d 816 (1956), the principal authority which it cites, did this Court hold that declaratory relief may be granted where a law is alleged to be ultra vires or illegal, despite the existence of a statutory remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">\"We find no authority, therefore, for the proposition that there need be no exhaustion of a statutory or administrative remedy where the act of an administrative agency is alleged to be ultra vires or illegal. Accordingly, we hold that the chancellor was correct in his conclusion that where a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under the declaratory judgment act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Court in <em>Soley </em>went on to note <em>(id. </em>at 528, n. 3) that under the Administrative Procedure Act, Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (g) (2) and (4), among the grounds upon which a final administrative decision may be judicially reviewed, are that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\"[i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency\u201d or \"[a]ffected by other error of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">It may well be that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required where an \"agency is palpably without jurisdiction.\u201d Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>(1958), Ch. 20, \u00a7 20.01, p. 56. Here, however, the Commission on Human Relations concededly has jurisdiction over employment discrimination cases, over employment discrimination based upon a \"physical or mental handicap,\u201d and over the MTA. The Commission is not attempting to act when it \"is palpably without jurisdiction,\u201d in the words of Professor Davis. Under our decisions, the question of the extent, if any, that obesity may be a \"physical or mental handicap\u201d within the meaning of the employment discrimination laws, is the type of issue which, if arising in a contested administrative case, should await a final agency decision prior to judicial resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City reversed, and case remanded to that Court with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the Mass Transit Administration.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\">.

The Commission on Human Relations is charged with the responsibility for enforcing the provisions in Art. 49B of the Code relating to discrimination, including employment discrimination. Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 9-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Although the MTA is a state agency, being part of the Maryland Department of Transportation, state agencies are subject to the provisions of the Code prohibiting employment discrimination and are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission on Human Relations. Art. 49B, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">. For a discussion of the public policy reasons for the exhaustion requirement, <em>see, e.g., </em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, 288 Md. 275, 284, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981); Sec., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v.

Another \"exception\u201d to the exhaustion requirement arises when the legislature in a particular enactment has indicated its intent that a statutory administration remedy need not be invoked and exhausted under certain circumstances. White v. Prince George\u2019s Co., 282 Md. 641, 649, 387 A.2d 260 (1978); Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P.&amp;P. v. Wash. Nat\u2019l Arena, 282 Md. 588, 595-596, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978). In addition, exhaustion of an administrative remedy might not be required \"[w]here the administrative agency cannot provide to any substantial degree a remedy.\u201d Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, <em>supra, </em>288 Md. at 285.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\">. <em>See </em>some of the cases reviewed in Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>(1958, 1982 Supp.), Ch. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
