Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 64A. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">\"(a) Any condition or impairment of health of any paid municipal, county, State, airport authority or fire control district, fire fighter or fire fighting instructor caused by lung diseases, heart diseases, or hypertension and any condition or impairment of health of <em>any paid State, municipal, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, county or airport authority police officer </em>caused by heart diseases or hypertension resulting in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to be compensable under this article and to have been suffered in the line of duty and as a result of his employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In 1978, the petitioner, Rudolph Furgang Soper, then a Montgomery County paid deputy sheriff (deputy sheriff), was diagnosed by a physician as suffering from heart disease and was placed on administrative sick leave by his employer, Montgomery County. After the deputy sheriff was hospitalized, a physician employed by Montgomery County determined that the deputy sheriffs medical condition rendered him incapable of performing his duties and, effective 1 September 1979, the deputy sheriff was administratively retired by Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In 1979, the deputy sheriff filed a claim for compensation with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (Commission). At a hearing, counsel for both parties stipulated that the single issue to be resolved was, in essence, the question presented here. The Commission found \"that a Montgomery County Deputy Sheriff is not a 'police officer\u2019 within Section 64A of Article 101\u201d and ordered that the deputy sheriffs claim be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The deputy sheriff appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. That Court granted Montgomery County\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ultimately entered a final judgment in favor of Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>On 24 June 1981, the deputy sheriff appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and on 22 September 1981, he filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court. We issued such a writ before consideration by the Court of Special Appeals. We shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The deputy sheriff contends that sheriffs are constitutional officers who, notwithstanding the delegation of certain duties to state, county, and municipal police officers, retain the powers they possessed at common law. The deputy sheriff asserts that these powers include conserving public peace, preserving public order, preventing and detecting crime, enforcing criminal laws by, among other things, raising a posse and arresting persons who commit crimes in their presence, providing security for the courts, serving criminal warrants and other writs and summonses, and transporting prisoners. The deputy sheriff maintains that, under these circumstances, and the powers of and duties'performed by sheriffs and, therefore, by their deputies are identical or substantially similar to and concurrent with those of police officers and that deputy sheriffs are, therefore, subjected to similar risks and stresses. He points out that the Legislature, recognizing this similarity of functions, has frequently extended certain rights and benefits to and imposed certain obligations upon sheriffs and police officers alike. <em>E.g., </em>Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 594B (f) (9) &amp; (10) (power to arrest without warrant); Md. Code (1957,1982 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 727 (b) (5) (Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights); Md. Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 59A-1 (death benefits); Md. Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol. &amp; 1981 Cum. Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 70A (a) (4) &amp; (8) (training requirements); Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 88B, \u00a7 2 (e), \u00a7 4 (a), &amp; \u00a7 5 (general concurrent powers); <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (c) (1) (v) (carrying a handgun when engaged in law enforcement activities). The deputy sheriff claims, therefore, that the term \"police officer\u201d contained in Art. 101, \u00a7 64A (a) is ambiguous and argues that that term was legislatively intended to encompass deputy sheriffs. He ultimately concludes that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Montgomery County deputy sheriff is encompassed in the term \"police officer\u201d contained in Art. 101, \u00a7 64A (a). We do not agree with this ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature. Statutes are to be construed reasonably and with reference to the purposes to be accomplished. <em>E.g., Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 155, 159, 438 A.2d 490, 491 (1981); <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210, 1213 (1980); <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 538-39, 404 A.2d 1045, 1052-53 (1979). The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. <em>Trotta v. County Car Center, Inc., </em>292 Md. 660, 663, 441 A.2d 343, 344 (1982); <em>Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. 416, 425, 45 A.2d 79, 83 (1945); Art. 101, \u00a7 63. That which necessarily is implied in the statute is as much a part of it as that which is expressed. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r of Maryland, </em>293 Md. 629, 643, 446 A.2d 1140, 1148 (1982); <em>Chillum-Adelphi Volunteer Fire Dept., Inc. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>247 Md. 373, 377, 231 A.2d 60, 62 (1967); <em>Restivo v. Princeton Constr. Co., </em>223 Md. 516, 525, 165 A.2d 766, 771 (1960). However, neither statutory language nor legislative intent can be stretched beyond the fair implication of the statute\u2019s words or its purpose. <em>Chillum-Adelphi, </em>247 Md. at 377, 231 A.2d at 62. Applying these principles to the instant case produces a clear result.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The purpose of Art. 101, \u00a7 64A is implicit in the language of the statute, and was recognized by this Court in <em>Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County v. Colgan, </em>274 Md. 193, 198-99, 334 A.2d 89, 92-93 (1975), a case involving fire fighters. There, in holding that the statute did not violate the equal protection clause and was, therefore, constitutional, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\" 'In the subject statute the legislature has seen fit to grant to fire fighters a presumption that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>disability arising from lung and heart diseases was suffered in the line of duty and as a result of their employment. There is general public knowledge that <em>f\u00edre f\u00edghters, in the course of their daily activities, </em>are exposed to inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes and <em>are subjected to unusual stresses and strains. </em>An adequate constitutional base exists here.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\"Finally, ... not only may the Legislature properly determine that <em>fire fighters are exposed to health hazards not shared by other government employees, </em>but it may also rationally determine that <em>full-time fire fighters are subject to greater hazards than unpaid fire fighters: volunteers and those whose principal duties do not involve fighting fires.\u201d Colgan, </em>274 Md. 205-06, 208, 334 A.2d 96, 97 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Thus, this Court indicated that the purpose of Art. 101, \u00a7 64A is to provide a presumption of compensable occupational disease to certain classes of public employees including police officers who, in the course of their daily activities, are subjected to unusual hazards, stresses, and strains. If this purpose is to be effectuated, the functions that deputy sheriffs do, in fact, perform as a primary part of their daily activities, and not the functions that sheriffs and their deputies are authorized to perform, must control. Thus, in order to be encompassed within the term \"police officer\u201d contained in Art. 101, \u00a7 64A (a), deputy sheriffs must perform, as a primary part of their daily activities, those law enforcement duties ordinarily performed by police officers that include unusual hazards, stresses, and strains.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In determining whether deputy sheriffs are entitled to the benefits of Art. 101, \u00a7 64A (a), we note that ordinarily sheriffs retain the powers they possessed at common law including conserving public peace, preserving public order, preventing and detecting crime, enforcing criminal laws by, among other things, raising a posse and arresting persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>who commit crimes in their presence, providing security for courts, serving criminal warrants and other writs and summonses, and transporting prisoners. <em>South v. Maryland, </em>59 U.S. 396, 402 (1856); <em>Beasley v. Ridout, </em>94 Md. 641, 655, 52 A. 61, 64 (1902); <em>Turner v. Holtzman, </em>54 Md. 148, 159-60 (1880); <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 376, 488-89 (1860); 57 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 606, 609-10, 611 (1972). We shall additionally note that ordinarily those powers are concurrent with the powers now ordinarily exercised by police officers. We need only then determine which of the sheriffs\u2019 retained common law powers deputy sheriffs do, in fact, exercise as a primary part of their daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Article IV, \u00a7 44 of the Maryland Constitution provides that there shall be an elected sheriff in each county and Baltimore City who shall \"exercise such powers and perform such duties as now are or may hereafter be fixed by law.\u201d Thus, sheriffs are constitutional officers whose powers and duties are not expressly enumerated in the Constitution. Rather, those powers and duties are prescribed by the common law as modified by the Acts of the Legislature. Accordingly, sheriffs retain their common law powers and duties until deprived of them by the Legislature. <em>Beasley, </em>94 Md. at 655-57, 52 A. at 64-65; <em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em>15 Md. at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Legislature has codified some of the common law duties of sheriffs. <em>E.g., </em>Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 87, \u00a7 6 (accepting bail bonds or cash); Art. 87, \u00a7 26 (removing convicted criminals from the courthouse to the penitentiary); Art. 87, \u00a7 45 (keeping prisoners safely); Md. Code (1974, 1980 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 2-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (serving writs); \u00a7 2-302 (executing writs of execution or attachment); \u00a7 2-303 (filing returns of service with the clerk of the court). However, it has not substantially diminished those common law duties, but rather has left them essentially intact. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>The Maryland Sheriff v. Modern and Efficient Administration of Justice, </em>2 U.Balt.L.Rev. 282, 288 (1973). <em>But see, e.g., Beasley, </em>94 Md. at 648, 657, 52 A. at 62, 65; 1901 Md. Laws Extra Sess., ch. 15; 1826 Md. Laws, ch. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>In addition, certain public local laws have prescribed sheriffs\u2019 duties. Md.

Because in such counties the functions performed by deputy sheriffs are identical to those ordinarily performed by police officers, it is implicit in the language of the statute that deputy sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>are encompassed within the term \"police officer\u201d contained in Art. 101, \u00a7 64A (a) and, therefore, are to be accorded a presumption of compensable occupational disease. Such a result is consonant with the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Some few counties in Maryland, however, have established police departments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Montgomery County is illustrative, and demonstrates that the establishment of a police department results in a dichotomy between the daily functioning of police officers and deputy sheriffs. A review of the applicable Maryland Code provisions, Montgomery County Code provisions, Montgomery County personnel regulations, and the record in this case reveals that in Montgomery County police officers ordinarily perform law enforcement duties that involve unusual hazards, stresses, and strains as a primary part of their daily activities, whereas deputy sheriffs ordinarily do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">With respect to the functions of police officers in Montgomery County, Montgomery County Code (1972,1977 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-43 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\"There is hereby established a department of police.... <em>The department </em>shall include the county police and <em>shall have the authority, functions and activities which are prescribed by law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Montgomery County Code (1972, 1977 Repl.Vol., 1980 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 35-3 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\"(b) Law enforcement.

Code (1974, 1980 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 2-309 (q) of the Courts Article provides that the sheriff shall appoint, fix the compensation of and may discharge deputy sheriffs.

Moreover, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>of the relevant code provisions in those counties other than Montgomery County in which police departments have been established, support an inference that the same dichotomy exists between the daily functioning of police officers and deputy sheriffs, and that in such counties police officers ordinarily do perform law enforcement duties that involve unusual hazards, stresses, and strains as a primary part of their daily activities, whereas deputy sheriffs ordinarily do not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Because in counties that have established police departments, the functions ordinarily performed by deputy sheriffs as a primary part of their daily activities are dissimilar from those primarily performed by police officers and do not involve unusual hazards, stresses, and strains, deputy sheriffs in such counties are not encompassed in the term \"police officer\u201d contained in Art. 101, \u00a7 64A (a).
