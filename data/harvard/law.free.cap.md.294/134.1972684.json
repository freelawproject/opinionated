Gerald Babbitt, Andrew J. Panholzer, and the New Century Corporation were indicted by the Grand Jury for Calvert County for common law forgery; forging and altering under Md. Code (1957,1976 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 45; common law conspiracy to forge; common law conspiracy to forge or alter a private instrument; and common law conspiracy to forge or alter a public document. The State\u2019s Attorney for Calvert County filed a petition with the circuit court for said county requesting the appointment of assistant counsel for the State to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, as all the members of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office had prior or present dealings with the defendants. Acting under what he felt was his prerogative under Md. Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 2-102 (a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the trial judge appointed Assistant Attorney General Stephen M. Schenning as special assistant counsel for the State to handle the prosecution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">After some discussion between the defense attorney and the appointed prosecutor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the State <em>nol prossed </em>the indictments against Babbitt, Panholzer, and New Century. Immediately thereafter, the State again petitioned for the appointment of an assistant prosecutor and the court, again under the auspices of Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a), appointed Schenning as special assistant counsel for the State. Schenning subsequently filed a criminal information charging Babbitt and Panholzer with the common law misdemeanors of forgery and conspiracy to commit forgery. In its information the State alleged that Babbitt and Panholzer had altered a Use and Occupancy Permit purportedly issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>by the Department of Inspection and Permits of Calvert County to the New Century Corporation, approving a building constructed by New Century for use as a personal residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">On the day of trial, Babbitt and Panholzer, through counsel, moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, contending that the second order of court appointing Schenning as assistant counsel was invalid, thereby making the information and subsequent proceeding a nullity. The motion was denied, the case proceeded to trial, and Babbitt and Panholzer were convicted of both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Subsequently, Babbitt and Panholzer appealed their convictions to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to consideration by that court, however, this Court, on its own motion, granted certiorari to consider the important issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Babbitt and Panholzer contend, <em>inter alia </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that when Schenning <em>nol prossed </em>the indictments his authority to prosecute the case as special assistant counsel terminated; that under the second order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Schenning was not authorized to file a criminal information; and that, since Schenning was without authority to prosecute, the motion for dismissal should have been granted. Our analysis of the pertinent rule and statute convinces us that the trial court had no authority to appoint counsel for the State to initiate prosecution by filing a criminal information.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Chapter 700 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure governs the trial of criminal causes in the circuit courts of the counties and the Criminal Court of Baltimore. Maryland Rule 701. According to Rule 710 (a) \"|a]n offense shall be tried <em>only </em>on a charging document.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) A charging document is \"a written accusation, filed in court, alleging that a defendant has committed an offense. It includes an indictment, an <em>information </em>and any charging document defined by section a of Maryland District Rule 702. . . .\u201d Rule 702 (a) (emphasis supplied). An information is \"a charging document in which the accusation is made by the <em>State\u2019s Attorney </em>and which is filed with the court.\u201d Rule 702 (d) (emphasis supplied). Pursuant to the Rules, therefore, an individual may only be tried after a charging document has been filed, in this case a criminal information. And in order for a criminal information to be valid it must be filed by the State\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It is manifest that Schenning was not appointed as State\u2019s Attorney nor as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney. Rather, he was appointed as assistant counsel for the State. A State\u2019s Attorney is a constitutional officer and is elected by the voters in the various political subdivisions of the State to prosecute offenses committed therein. The duties of the State\u2019s Attorney are prescribed by the General Assembly in Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl. Vol.), Article 10, \u00a7 34, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney for each county and the City of Baltimore shall, in such county or city, prosecute and defend, on the part of the State, <em>all </em>cases in which the State may be interested, subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>provisions of \u00a7 33B of this article. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Although the duties and authority of the State\u2019s Attorney are nowhere specifically enumerated or defined, <em>Food Fair Stores v. Joy, </em>283 Md. 205, 213, 389 A.2d 874 (1978), one of the specifically granted prerogatives of the office is to prosecute all cases where the State has an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Despite Schenning\u2019s obvious inability to ascend to the position of State\u2019s Attorney, the State, in the case <em>subjudice, </em>contends that the trial judge\u2019s appointment of Schenning under Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a) conferred on Schenning the authority to file a criminal information. This statutory construction contradicts the plain wording of the statute and would undermine the constitutional prerogative of the State\u2019s Attorney to determine when, who, and whether to prosecute. Such a legislative intent could only be inferred from clear and unambiguous language to that effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">[i]f advisable in a specific proceeding, a court may appoint an auditor, surveyor, court reporter, assistant counsel for the State, counsel for a party if authorized by law or rule, accountant, master, examiner, or other officer, and may require his presence in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">A revisor\u2019s note to this statute states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">[t]his section is new language, and allows a court to appoint temporary officers when necessary for the conduct of a specific proceeding... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">This section is based on Article IV, \u00a7 9 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Constitution which grants judges broad authority to appoint personnel and on a number of statutes and rules which provide for such appointments. <em>See </em>Art. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9 \u2014 Auditors; \u00a7 107 \u2014 Trustees; Art. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12 \u2014 Assistant Counsel for the State; Art. 21, \u00a7 14-111, Art. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 13-15 and Rule BG 76 \u2014 Surveyors; Art. 26, \u00a7 69 \u2014 Masters in Juvenile Causes; Rule 580 \u2014 Examiner; 595 \u2014 Auditor; 117 \u2014 Elisor; 205 (e), 596 \u2014 Master; 719, V71 (e), V79 (d) \u2014 Counsel. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">Art. IV, \u00a7 9 is apparently declarative of the Common Law.. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">As can be seen by the revisor\u2019s note, Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a) consolidated the power of the courts to appoint personnel when the situation mandates it for the smooth and efficient running of the judicial system. Looking at the words and their common meanings, it does not authorize the court to assume the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s constitutional power to determine when and if to prosecute, nor does it allow the State\u2019s Attorney to abrogate his constitutionally prescribed duty by simple acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">A review of the facts in the instant case illustrates what we mean. Babbitt and Panholzer were indicted by the grand jury and the indictments were filed in the Circuit Court for Calvert County. At this point, a criminal proceeding had begun and was before the court. Because the State\u2019s Attorney and his staff raised the possibility of a conflict of interest, the court, under Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a), appointed Schenning as assistant counsel for the State to continue the prosecution. There was obviously a \"specific proceeding\u201d begun and the court\u2019s appointment was necessary to continue the proceedings before it. The appointment was thus valid under Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Shortly after Schenning was appointed he elected to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the charges against Babbitt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Panholzer. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>is an abandonment of the prosecution and the case was thus terminated. <em>Hooper and Kordon v. State, </em>293 Md. 162, 443 A.2d 86, 89 (1982); <em>State v. Moulden, </em>292 Md. 666, 441 A.2d 699, 700-02 (1982). There was, therefore, nothing further before the court. Despite this, the court reappointed Schenning, purportedly under Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">If we were to construe Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a) to allow this procedure we would in effect be authorizing trial courts to circumvent the constitutional and statutory role of the State\u2019s Attorney and the Rules of Procedure in criminal causes on the strength of a section of the Courts Article. We think it highly unlikely that the legislature intended \u00a7 2-102 (a) to transcend such authority without specifically indicating an intention to do so. Rather, conforming to the rule that the Constitution, statutes, and rules will be construed harmoniously where possible, we hold that Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a) does not empower a court to appoint assistant counsel for the State to initiate prosecution by filing a criminal information.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In the case at bar, Schenning was not a State\u2019s Attorney pursuant to Rule 702 (f) and the criminal information he filed after the entry, of a <em>nol pros </em>did not meet the requirements of Rule 702 (d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The charging document was, therefore, a nullity, <em>see, Ayre </em>v. <em>State, </em>291 Md. 155, 433 A.2d 1150 (1981), and the trial court erred when it did not grant the motion to dismiss. The proceedings that followed the denial of the motion were thus without force and effect and the judgment of the trial court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Calvert County reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\n<em>County to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">. This discussion is not mentioned in the record but was alluded to at oral argument before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">.

Even if the legislature were to clearly signal its intent to confer this authority on judges, its efficacy would be questionable in light of Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 8, providing that \"the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; <em>and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">. We note that in this regard this case differs from State v. Ensor &amp; Compton, 277 Md. 529, 356 A.2d 259 (1976), in that, there the Grand Jury did possess authority to initiate prosecution by returning an indictment. Consequently, we need not, in this case, reconsider the holding in State v. Ensor &amp; Compton, that counsel can be appointed under Courts Article, \u00a7 2-102 (a) to initiate the presentation of evidence to the Grand Jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
