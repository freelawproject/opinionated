Appeal was taken to this court, and decree was reversed. Our opinion is reported in 111 Fed. 904, 50 C. C. A. 61. It sufficiently sets forth the specifications and the claim in controversy. We concurred with the judge who heard the cause in the conclusion that the \u201cimprovement\u201d was one which should have been obvious to an ordinary skilled mechanic, but were constrained by the testimony to hold that there was patentable invention. That testimony is set forth in the opinion. It showed that the desirability \u2022of retarding the ball as it neared the home terminal of the returnway had been appreciated for many years; that many different devices to secure that result had been suggested, but that apparently no one \u25a0of those who sought to secure the result had adopted the seemingly \u2022obvious one of making the ball reach the home terminal on an up grade. Had any such method been disclosed in the earlier art, the \u25a0original decision would have been affirmed. It now appears that, apprehending proof of such a structure antedating the patent, the patentee has filed a disclaimer which recites that in the prior art there were ball returnways with \u201can upgrade near the player\u2019s end, merging into the terminal,\u201d and disclaims such part of the claim \u201cas would include a returnway by which the homing of the ball was not accelerated.\u201d The bill presents the disclaimer as well as the patent, and, with the concession that in the prior art the returning ball had been retarded by an up grade, the case may properly be disposed of on demurrer; and, for the reasons set forth in our former opinion, we have reached the conclusion that the patent discloses no patentable invention, except possibly as to minor details of construction which are subject of other claims, not here in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The decree is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
