This question was considered and the authorities bearing on it, to some extent, cited and examined in the case of Schmeltz <em>v. </em>Garey, 49 Tex., 49. In conformity with the views expressed in that case and intimated in Lockhart <em>v. </em>Ward, 45 Tex., 227, our opinion is that this question must be answered in the negative.' The judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
