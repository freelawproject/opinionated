Punitory damages.\u2014Where there is no evidence tending to show that the acts complained of were done through malice, or wantonly, or with intent to harass, injure, or oppress the plaintiff, it is error to submit to the jury the question of punitory damages.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-6\">2. Same.\u2014See facts held not to authorize the submission to the jury of the question of punitory damages.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b500-8\">Appeal from Busk. Tried below before the Hon. A. J. Booty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">G. M. Buchanan sued J. W. and Albert Bradshaw, in the District Court of Busk county, for possession of a tract of land described in the petition, for rent, and for value of some articles of personal property alleged to have been on the premises in controversy and taken by the defendants. By amendments, it was charged that the taking by defendants was by force, wrongful, willful, and oppressive. Punitory damages were asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-10\">The defendants pleaded misjoinder of actions; not guilty; and, by amendment, that defendants had abandoned the land and all claim thereto; accord and satisfaction, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-11\">In the testimony it appeared that J. W. Bradshaw, one of the defendants, had sold the land to one Thomas Teason on credit. Teason went into possession, built a house, and cleared and put twelve acres of the land in cultivation. The rent of the land was worth $8 per acre. January 30, 1874, Teason conveyed the land to plaintiff by a title bond, Buchanan paying $50 cash and giving his note for the remainder. Buchanan took possession of the house, and had some articles of personal property there of value of $15. He kept the key, but did not live in the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-12\">February 10, 1874, J. W. Bradshaw and Albert Bradshaw took possession of the house, and obtained entrance by borrowing a key from a neighbor. Before taking possession, Bradshaw had been told by Teason that he was unable to pay for the land. Teason told Bradshaw to take back the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Bradshaw did not know of Teason\u2019s sale to Buchanan, when defendants took possession of the land. When Bradshaw learned of Buchanan\u2019s claim, he said he (Bradshaw) \u201c would do what was right.\u201d In the same conversation, Buchanan said: \u201c He would have nothing more to do with the land.\u201d Part of the personal property was returned to Buchanan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-4\">Buchanan had sued in forcible entry and detainer, and recovered judgment for the place; but an appeal had been taken. Teason also had brought a suit for possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The court charged the jury at great length, and submitted the question of vindictive damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">The jury found for plaintiff $60 actual and $75 exemplary damages, upon which judgment was rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\">Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-8\"><em>N.

Law Dict., title Trespasser <em>ab initio; </em>9 Bacon Abr., Bouv. ed. 1846, pp. 448, 449, and cases cited; 8 Coke, 146; 5 Taunt., 198; 7 Ad. &amp; E., 176; 11 M. &amp; W. Exch., 740; Hopkins <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 10 Johns., 372; Barrett <em>v. </em>Lightfoot, 1 Monr., 242.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-4\">If a person enters a dwelling-house by permission, and continues there after he has been requested to leave it, he becomes a trespasser <em>ab initio. </em>(Adams <em>v. </em>Freeman, 12 Johns., 408.) Buchanan demanded possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-5\">An inspection of the plaintiff\u2019s petition and amendments will show it to be an action to recover damages for forcibly and fraudulently trespassing on the plaintiff\u2019s home and property, and not an action to try title to land.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b502-6\">Moore, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">This judgment must unquestionably be reversed. There is no evidence whatever in the statement of facts calling for a charge by the court on the subject of vindictive or punitory damages, or to warrant the verdict of the jury for this character of damages. There is no evidence tending to show that appellants were actuated by malice in taking and holding the house and land, as alleged by appellee, or that they did so wantonly, or with the intent to vex, harass, injure, or oppress him. On the contrary, the evidence strongly tends to show that they were actuated by no such motive. If they were, they seemed to have exhibited no outward manifestations of such feelings.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">To sustain the verdict in this case would, in effect, be to hold that the jury'may infer malice whenever there is evidence warranting a verdict for the plaintiff in an action of trespass <em>quare clausam fregit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
