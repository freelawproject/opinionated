A. Eay, the husband and father of plaintiffs, for $2,500 in gold, for the benefit of plaintiffs. On the 6th of November, 1874, defendant filed for answer general demurrer and special exceptions, general issue and special answer, in which it substantially states that plaintiff never complied with the terms of the policy, but failed to pay the first premium until G. A. Eay was <em>in extremis, </em>and then paid the premium fraudulently, concealing the condition of Eay from the company, and it tendered back the premium paid in court. On the 18th of January, 1877, defendant filed amended answer, pleading, to the jurisdiction of the court, that the court could not entertain the suit because the defendant did not reside in and had no agent in Eusk county, but was domiciled in Richmond, Va. In special plea, it alleged that G. A. Eay was never insured by defendant; that Eay made application for insurance, and the application was granted on condition that he would pay the first premium; that Eay refused to pay the premium; that the premium was never paid till Eay had died, and the defendant was ignorant of Ray\u2019s death when the premium was paid; alleging fraud, &amp;c., and that defendant offered to return the premium as soon as it was ascertained that Eay had died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">On the 19th of January, 1877, plaintiff moved to strike out the plea to the jurisdiction of the court, because filed after plea to the merits of the petition, and because not filed in due order of pleading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-7\">On the 19th of January, 1877, plaintiff filed amended petition, alleging that it is not true, as alleged by defendant in its answer, that G. A. Eay did not pay the first premium for the policy sued on; but averring that Bay had paid said premium before his death, and before the policy issued, by executing and delivering to Nash, the agent of defendant, his draft on Nat. Guerin for the premium, and said Guerin; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>accepted the draft and paid it; that said Nash accepted the draft in full satisfaction of said premium, and delivered to said Kay, long before Kay\u2019s death, the policy, which policy plaintiff filed as a part of her amended petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\">On the 5th of February, 1877, defendant filed general exception to the amended petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">On the 5th of February, 1877, defendant filed amended answer, in substance what it had previously stated, and in addition that Nash had no authority to accept the draft from Kay in payment of the premium, and that Kay refused to pay the draft,\u2014caused it to be protested, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">Defendant\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction of the court was stricken out. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for $3,515.38 and costs. Motion for new trial and in arrest of judgment were made and overruled. Defendant brings this case into this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">Additional facts necessary are given in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-8\"><em>Drury Field, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-9\">I. The court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s general demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s petition, the petition disclosing the fact that the court had no jurisdiction to try the cause. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1423.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-10\">II. There is error in the ruling of the court in striking out defendant\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction of the court. The plea presented to the court the fact of lack of jurisdiction, and was good, it mattered not when filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-11\">III. There was error in the court admitting the policy issued to Gabriel Kay over the objection of defendant, the ground of objection being, that plaintiff did not prove by the production of the special act of incorporation that there was any such company incorporated in the State of Virginia as the Piedmont and Arlington Life Insurance Company. (1 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 480; Watkins <em>v. </em>Holman, 14 Curtis, 175.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-12\">IV. The evidence showed that Gabriel Kay had abandoned his application for the policy of insurance before it was issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>by the company, and refused to accept it when tendered to him by the company after it was granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-6\">Y. The court erred in giving judgment against plaintiff in error, because the evidence showed that Gabriel Kay did not pay the first premium on his policy before his death, and caused the draft he had drawn on Guerin for its payment to be dishonored and not paid.' The premium remained unpaid until three days after the death of Gabriel Kay, when the same was paid by Eat. Guerin, knowing that Kay was dead and could not be insured, at the same time concealing the fact of Kay\u2019s death from the company, thereby inducing the company to accept the premium for a dead man, after his death, which was a fraud on the company. (Hoyt <em>v. </em>Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., 98 Mass., 539; Myers <em>v. </em>Keystone Mutual Life Insurance Co., 27 Penn., 268; Sheldon <em>v. </em>Conn. Mutual Life Assurance Co., 25 Conn., 207; Robert <em>v. </em>New England Mutual Life Insurance Co., 1 Big. on Ins., 634.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">YI. Kay, the insured, refused to allow the first premium to be paid before his death, and refused to receive the policy when tendered to him; hence the risk against the company never attached, by reason of Kay\u2019s own default in payment of his first premium, which was a condition precedent to the attaching of the risk against plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\">Vil. Gabriel Kay abandoned his application to be insured before it was granted, and when the same was presented to him he positively refused to accept it; notified Guerin not to pay the draft that he had drawn upon him, and that Guerin had accepted for Kay, in favor of the company, to pay the first premium.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-9\">YIH. There is error in the judgment of the court awarding ten per cent, attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff in the suit. The statute of this State under which, we suppose, the court awarded attorney\u2019s fees, was passed long subsequent to the accrual of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action, and the court, in applying said act to this cause, gave the act retro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>active effect. (Gen. Laws of 1874, approved May 2, 1874, sec. 9, p. 200.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">IX. The court erred in giving judgment for plaintiff below, for any sum, because the evidence shows that the pretended insured was dead before the risk attached, under the rules governing the issuance of policies.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-6\"><em>N. G. Bagley, Jones Wynne, </em>and <em>William Steadman, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">I. It is competent for a court to render judgment in favor of a resident against a non-resident, upon service had upon the resident agent.. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1423.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-8\">H. The petition alleges that defendant is a non-resident; that D. M. W. Hash is its agent, with an office at Galveston, Texas. Hash waived service and submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. (Act Legislature of Texas 1874, sec. 1, pp. 197, 198.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-9\"><em>III. </em>When a party has appeared and answered to the merits he submits to the jurisdiction, and it is too late to plead to the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-10\">Plaintiff had answered to the merits before he plead to the jurisdiction. (25 Tex. Supp., 77; 23 Tex., 178; 20 Tex., 215; 11 Wall., 668.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-11\">IV. The third error assigned cannot be considered, when we refer to the bill of exceptions and see there the only objection to the reading of the policy was that it was not authenticated as the law required to admit it in evidence. The policy was sealed with the corporate seal. We submit that the question raised in the third assignment was not raised in the court below, and will not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-12\">If the policy was under seal of the company and a part of the petition, and sued on as the contract of the plaintiff, and its execution was not denied, but admitted, its admission as evidence was proper. (Herndon <em>v. </em>Ennis, 18 Tex., 411; Bliss on Life Ins., sec. 161, p. 248.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-13\">We insist that the contract was executed and complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>when the draft on Guerin was given by Eay, and had been accepted by Guerin, and taken by Hash as payment of the premium, and the policy issued and was delivered; and that Eay could not abandon it without the consent of Hash or the plaintiff, and the plaintiff nor its agent Nash would release Ray. (Bliss on Life Ins., 2d ed., secs. 150, 175, pp. 215, 268.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-4\">Y. As to allowing attorney\u2019s fees, we insist that the Legislature of Texas has a right to enact laws that affect the remedy, and not questions upon the merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">Ray departed this life in February, 1873; proof of death was made April 23, 1873, and this suit was brought October 14, 1874. (Act of Legislature of Texas approved May 2, 1874, sec. 9, p. 200; Freeborn <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Wall., 174, 175; Bronson <em>v. </em>Kinzie, 1 How., 315, 316.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">YI. We say that the contract was complete when Hash accepted the draft from Eay. He accepted it as cash, and his act was recognized by the company; and whatever the rules on the back of the policy may be, which Eay never saw till the policy was delivered, which was long after the contract was made, they cannot affect the contract made under the circumstances established by the evidence in this case. (Bliss on Life Ins., 2d ed., sec. 179, p. 275, and first note on same page.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b525-7\">Moore, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ABK\">If it appears on the face of the petition that the subject-matter of the suit is not within the jurisdiction of the District Court, the defect in the petition maybe taken advantage of by general demurrer. But when the objection to jurisdiction is not for want of power in the court to hear and determine the subject-matter of the suit, but want of proper service because defendant is entitled to be sued in some other county, unless the defendant pleads to the jurisdiction of the court, or specially excepts to the petition, the objection is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">2. If the objection to the jurisdiction is because of the priv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ilege of defendant of being sued in some other court than that in which the action is brought, or because there has been no sufficient service to require defendant to answer, it is a familiar principle that an answer to the merits gives jurisdiction of the person, and is a waiver of the privilege of being sued elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">8. The third error assigned by appellant is, that the policy upon which the suit was brought should not have been admitted in evidence, because plaintiff did not prove that there was any such company incorporated in the State of Virginia as the Piedmont and Arlington Life Insurance Company, by producing the special act of incorporation passed by the Legislature of said State, if any such act ever existed. In answer to this assignment, it is sufficient to say that it is not warranted by the record. Bo such objection was made to the introduction in evidence of the policy as that suggested in the assignment. The only objection taken to the introduction of the policy, or at least the only one shown by the record, is that said policy \u201c was not authenticated.as required by law to admit the same in evidence.\u201d As the point ruled by the court has not been assigned as error or discussed by counsel, we need not notice it.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">4. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments relate to issues of fact raised by appellant\u2019s answer denying the execution of the contract of assurance set up in plaintiff\u2019s petition. We see nothing in the record, in respect to any of the matters referred to in these assignments, of which appellant can complain, or which would warrant a reversal of the judgment. Concede that appellant forbade its agents to accept drafts or bills in payment of premiums for their policies: the want of authority of the agent to receive payment in this way, might be waived and such payment acquiesced in and accepted by the company. There was, unquestionably, evidence tending to prove that such was the fact in respect to this policy. If so, the payment was just as valid and effectual as if it had been made in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>8. The eighth assignment is, in our opinion, well taken. The judgment in appellee\u2019s favor for the sum of $319.58 as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, is unwarranted and cannot be sustained. The loss on account of which this suit was brought, had occurred long before the enactment of the law allowing a recovery of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in suits against life insurance companies incorporated out of this State. It is a well-settled rule that statutes are always held to operate prospectively, unless a contrary construction is evidently required by their plain and unequivocal language. The law relied upon to support this judgment reads as follows: \u201cThe several insurance companies, and those incorporated out of this State, in all cases where a loss occurs, and when they refuse to pay within the time specified in the policy, shall be liable to pay the holder of said policy, in addition to the loss, not more than twelve per cent, on the liability of said company for said loss; also all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for the prosecution of the case against said company.\u201d Certainly the language here used seems much more appropriately to apply to losses to occur after the passage of the law, than to such as had previously occurred, though they were still unpaid; but if it plainly appears that the Legislature intended it to apply to all cases, without reference to the date of loss, we should feel constrained to hold that effect could not be given to this intention in this case. To do so would, in our opinion, violate the obligation of the contract, and also be in direct conflict with the provision of our State Constitution prohibiting the enactment of retrospective laws. Whether like constitutional objections will prevent a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees where the loss occurs after the enactment of the law, on a policy issued prior thereto, we are not now called upon to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">9. If the minor plaintiffs were necessary parties to this suit, the judgment would have to be reversed. In earlier times there seems to have prevailed rather technical and subtle distinctions in courts of law, as well as of equity, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>respect to the prosecuting and defending of suits and actions by infants. At law, an infant having a guardian might sue by his guardian or next friend, though in practice it is said he generally sues by his next friend, but in all cases he must defend by his guardian. (1 Black., 464; 2 Inst, 261; 2 Saund., 117f.) In equity, the practice seems to be for infants in all cases to sue by their next friend, although they have a guardian, but they may defend by their guardian. (Danl. Ch. Pr., 94, and notes; Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., sec. 58, and note 3.) While the authority of his next friend to sue for an infant is said to be derived from statutes passed in the time of Edward I, (Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., sec. 58, note 3,) they were certainly permitted to sue in this way in this State previous to the enactment of the probate law of 1870, and possibly since, though there is no statute expressly authorizing it, unless this is impliedly done by the authority given the court to appoint special guardians <em>ad litem </em>for infant parties. After all, it seems of little moment whether the party by whom the infant sues is called by the one name or the other, if the authority to represent the infant is recognized by the court; for it is said on high authority that guardians and <em>prochein amy </em>are sometimes named in the books one for the other. (Id.) But though the name by which the representative of the infant may be designated may not be very material, before he can bind the infant, or before judgment should be rendered in his favor, if objection be made, he must, we think, take the oath and give the bond required of special guardians by the statute; and for this reason, if in this case the infants were necessary parties, the judgment would have to be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">By the terms of the policy the whole amount of loss is payable to Mrs. Ray, one-half in her own right and the other \u25a0half in trust for the children of herself and her deceased husband. The policy, by its terms, is \u201c for the sole use of his (Gabriel A. Ray\u2019s) wife Treasy Ray and his surviving children, wife to become guardian without giving bond or secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>rity.\u201d Certainly this clause in the policy does not make Mrs. Bay the guardian; but it plainly shows, as we think, the intention of the parties to the contract, that the entire amount for which the policy calls, was to be paid to her. The object and purpose of the stipulation, so far as concerns appellant, were that it might be authorized to settle the loss at once with Mrs. Bay, and not be embarrassed in doing so by reason of the interest of the children, for whom no guardian might have been appointed. If the assured chose to insure his life for the benefit of his children, coupled with the condition that the policy should be payable to their mother in trust for them, he certainly had the right to do so.\u2019 The judgment, in our opinion, in effect accomplishes the purpose of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The mere technical difference in her recovery as the next friend of her minor children, instead of in trust for them, is not of such moment as to require a remand of the case. But for the error of the court in allowing attorney\u2019s fees, the judgment must be reversed and reformed. And it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Beversed and reformed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
