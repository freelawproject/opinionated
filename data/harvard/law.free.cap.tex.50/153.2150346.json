If the County Court had tried this case, it would have been under that provision of the Constitution, and County Court act thereunder, giving to said court its appellate powers, and none other. (Const. 1875-76, art. 5, sec. 16; Gen. Laws, 1876, sec. 3, p. 18.) The Constitution makes no other provision regarding suits appealed from Justices\u2019 Courts to County Courts. The appellate powers of the District Court are expressly defined by the Constitution, and limited to probate matters, guardianship, letter^ of administration, &amp;e. (Const. 1875-76, art. 5, sec. 8, p. 3&amp;.) Again, it is urged that before the District Court can assume original jurisdiction over the subject-matter of a suit that is within the jurisdiction of the County Court, it must appear affirmatively that the county judge is disqualified, and the amount, in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>troversy is valued at, or exceeds, $500, exclusive of interest.
