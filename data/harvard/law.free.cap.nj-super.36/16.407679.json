Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">A clear understanding of the matter requires a somewhat extended recounting of defendant\u2019s marital affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Elmer Bond married Margaret Bond in 1924. Two children were born of that union, both now of age. In February 1935 he took Margaret and the children to Florida. The circumstances of their going there are somewhat vague. There is testimony that Elmer had been separated from Margaret some time before, that he had become involved with another woman, and that the purpose of going to Florida was to effect a reconciliation. About a month later he told his wife to return home to New Jersey with the children and that he would follow. She did so, but he remained in Florida, living with his parents in Miami Beach until late in April 1936. Several months after Margaret left, Elmer met Corrine L. Foy, a divorced woman. She knew he was married, and when he became interested in obtaining a divorce from Margaret she referred him to the attorney who had represented her in her own divorce proceedings. At the close of February 1936 Elmer instituted divorce proceedings in Dade County, Florida, based on Margaret\u2019s alleged extreme cruelty and desertion. Thereupon Margaret filed a complaint in our former Court of Chancery seeking to restrain him from proceeding with that action, and on April 2, 1936 she commenced a separate maintenance suit against him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the same court. Elmer nonetheless went ahead with his divorce and on April 23, 1936 obtained a final decree by whose terms he was to pay Margaret $30 a week for the support and maintenance of herself and the two children of the marriage. Pour days later he entered into a ceremonial marriage with Corrine at Tampa, Florida. Soon after the newly married couple returned to live in New Jersey, where they have been resident ever since. One child was born of that marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Following his return to New Jersey Elmer and Margaret (and a named trustee) entered into a separation agreement whereby he was to pay her $30 a week for her support and maintenance and that of the two children. The separate maintenance action then pending between them was to be discontinued. Elmer also conveyed to her his interest in their former marital home, owned as tenants by the entirety. At the time of the agreement, Margaret did not know of the Florida divorce; in fact, she first learned of it in 1947 through Corrine, who told her of the second marriage and the child born of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Elmer and Corrine lived together as husband and wife in New Jersey until May 1947. Thereafter Corrine instituted a separate maintenance action based on Elmer\u2019s extreme cruelty, resulting in the judgment of June 19, 1950 and the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>already referred to. The judgment was affirmed on appeal. Elmer failed to comply fully with the terms of the judgment, with the result that Corrine instituted contempt proceedings. His defense was that he was obliged to pay support for his first wife and children and could not afford to pay both Margaret and Corrine $30 each. The trial court found him in contempt. On appeal the Appellate Division reversed. <em>Bond v. Bond, </em>16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>83 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">At the time of that appeal there was pending an action instituted by Elmer against Margaret on February 7, 1951, whereby he sought to have their separation agreement reviewed and the $30 weekly payments provided therein reduced. Margaret filed an answer and counterclaim to set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>aside the Florida divorce and for a divorce from Elmer on the ground of his desertion in March 1935. She then obtained an order making Corrine a party defendant. Corrine thereupon filed an answer and separate defenses denying the fraud charged as to Elmer\u2019s Florida residence and his subsequent remarriage, or that she had knowledge at the time of her marriage of any matrimonial injunctive order obtained by Margaret. She claimed that Margaret knew of her marriage to Elmer prior to the separation agreement of July 2, 1936 and was guilty of laches; that she was estopped from contesting the validity of the Florida divorce because of her knowledge of the divorce and remarriage; and that Elmer had a <em>bona fide </em>residence in Florida before instituting his suit for divorce against Margaret, so that the divorce decree was a valid judgment entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of New Jersey. Elmer elected not to prosecute the complaint or to offer any testimony by way of answer or defense to Margaret\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">After a full trial the Chancery Division on May 4, 1954 dismissed Elmer\u2019s complaint for modification of the separation agreement, as well as Margaret\u2019s counterclaim for absolute divorce, and also Corrine\u2019s answer and separate defenses. Judgment was entered in Margaret\u2019s favor declaring Elmer\u2019s Florida divorce decree to be not entitled to full faith and credit and therefore without force and effect in New Jersey. Corrine did not appeal and consequently is bound by the adjudication in that proceeding which had the effect of invalidating her marriage to Elmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Soon after the judgment of May 4, 1954 Elmer moved (1) to vacate and set aside Corrine\u2019s separate maintenance judgment of June 19, 1950; (2) to discharge the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>and the cash bond posted thereunder; (3) to dismiss Corrine\u2019s pending application to hold him in eontempt of court; and (4) to vacate and set aside a certain writ of execution and the sheriff\u2019s sale, report and deed thereunder. In addition to this relief he subsequently moved to have the court fix the amount he was to pay for the support and maintenance of his daughter by the marriage to Corrine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The court had before it the affidavits filed by the parties, Elmer\u2019s answers to interrogatories, and his deposition taken in May 1953. In that deposition Elmer admitted he had always been a legal resident of New Jersey and never domiciled in Florida, and that the representations made in the course of the Florida divorce proceedings that he was a legal resident of Miami Beach, Florida, were untrue. The trial court thereupon (1) denied Elmer\u2019s application to set aside the judgment of June 19, 1950; (2) modified that judgment by allocating the sum of $15 for the support and maintenance of the child of the marriage, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of June 20, 1950; (3) discharged the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>and cash bond posted thereunder, Elmer having furnished a bond of $3,500 to insure the support and maintenance of his child by Oorrine; (4) directed the clerk of the court to pay over the $5,000 posted under the writ of <em>ne exeat, </em>with interest, if any; (5) denied the application to vacate the writ of execution, and the sheriff\u2019s sale, report and deed; and (6) dismissed Corrine\u2019s application to hold defendant in contempt. By another order the court dismissed Corrine\u2019s motion to have the $3,500 bond secure not only the payments of support and maintenance for the child, but also support and maintenance for herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The opinion of the trial court is silent as to the reasons for refusing to vacate the separate maintenance judgment and for discontinuing, in effect, Elmer\u2019s obligation to make support payments to Corrine. We can only guess that the court\u2019s refusal to vacate the judgment was because of Elmer\u2019s unclean hands in obtaining the Florida divorce from Margaret, and that the failure to provide expressly for Corrine\u2019s support was grounded in the fact that there was no longer a valid and subsisting marriage between her and Elmer in view of the court\u2019s earlier adjudication of the invalidity of the Florida divorce. This latter conclusion would appear to have been based on <em>Tonti v. Chadwick, 1 N. J. </em>531 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> There can be no question whatever that under the circumstances and on the face of the record Elmer\u2019s divorce from Margaret was obtained in fraud of the courts of Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and of New Jersey. We are in complete agreement with the Chancery Division's earlier determination of the invalidity of that divorce, reflected in its judgment of May 4, 1954. Because of his unclean hands, Elmer was not entitled to any affirmative relief whatsoever at the hands of the Chancery Division when he sought, among other things, to have the separate maintenance judgment of June 19, 1950 vacated and the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>and cash bond posted thereunder discharged. On well-established equitable principles, he should have been left where the court found him. The separate maintenance judgment and the order awarding the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>should have been left intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We are not required to deal here with any rights which Corrine may claim to have under that judgment and order. That issue must await the time when it is clearly and squarely presented to us. The question involved in such a claim of rights is too important to be determined by way of dictum. Whether Corrine, whose marriage to Elmer is invalid because his Elorida divorce from Margaret has been adjudicated a nullity, may insist that she is nonetheless entitled to be supported by him, presents an important question of public policy. Contrast <em>Tonti v. Chadwick, </em>1 <em>N. J. </em>531 (1949) (prior Mexican mail order divorce; separate maintenance denied because parties held <em>in pari delicto) </em>and <em>Caldwell v. Caldwell, </em>298 <em>N. Y. </em>146, 81 <em>N. E. 2d </em>60 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1948) (also a Mexican mail order divorce ease), with <em>Krause v. Krause, </em>282 <em>N. Y. </em>335, 26 <em>N. E. 2d </em>290 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1940) (prior invalid Nevada divorce; second wife allowed support on theory of <em>quasi </em>estoppel). Compare <em>Rooney v. Rooney, </em>54 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>231 <em>(Ch. </em>1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The Chancery Division orders of December 3, 1954 are accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for proper action in the light of this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
