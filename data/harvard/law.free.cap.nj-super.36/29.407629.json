J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AK\">The sole issue here is as to the construction of the terms of a trust under a will. Testator died in 1927, survived by his wife Elly, their son Eudolf then 15, and their daughter Margaret then 11. In 1954 Elly died, 12 years after Eudolf had reached 30. The issue is this: what portion of the principal of the trust in the trustee\u2019s hands on Elly\u2019s death was payable to Eudolf \u2014 one-half, Eudolf claims and the court below held, or only one-quarter, as Margaret, the appellant, claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">We are concerned in this case, not with extrinsic evidence, but with the words of the will, in particular the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\">\u201cIn the event that my wife is living when my son Rudolf, reaches the age of thirty years, then my trustees or trustee are directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>pay to my son Rudolf <em>one-third of the principal of the entire trust fund, </em>together with such share of the accumulated income that my son Rudolf would be entitled to at said time, and the <em>balance of the trust fund </em>to bo retained by my trustees for the purpose of paying to my wife, and to my daughter, Margaret, one-half each of the income from <em>said trust fund </em>during the remainder of the lives of my wife and my daughter, Margaret.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">In the event of the death of my wife after my son Rudolf reaches the age of thirty years, and upon the death of my wife, I direct my trustees or trustee to pay to my son Rudolf, <em>one-half </em>the principal of <em>said trust fund, </em>together with one-half of the share of the accumulated income which my wife had been receiving at the time of her death, and <em>the remaining one-half of said entire trust fund then in the hands of my trustees </em>to be held in trust for the purpose of paying the income from said portion of said trust fund to my daughter, Margaret, during the remainder of the life of my said daughter, Margaret, and upon her death the balance of the principal of said trust fund in the hands of said trustees to be paid to the heirs of my daughter, Margaret.\u201d (Italics added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The critical words appear near the beginning of the second paragraph quoted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201cI direct my trustees or trustee to pay to my son Rudolf, <em>one-half </em>the principal of <em>said trust fund.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The phrase <em>\u201csaid </em>trust fund\u201d carries one back to the very same phrase appearing near the close of the first paragraph quoted; there it clearly has reference to the amount of <em>corpus </em>remaining after paying Rudolf one-third. This, we conclude, fixes the significance of that phrase at the <em>locus </em>in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">However the trial court then seemed to have felt bound to look no further into the will. Accordingly, construing the critical words, it held Rudolf was entitled on his mother\u2019s death to j/\u00f3 of the <em>corpus </em>of the trust as it then stood. This would give him, as Margaret puts it, a total of two-thirds of the entire <em>corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The trial court\u2019s notion was that a portion of a will is to be construed with reference to the remainder only where, standing oil by itself, it is ambiguous. But the law is otherwise. Indeed it is one of the postulates of this subject \u2014 \u2022 declared by Chief Justice Gummere to be \u201cthe cardinal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>predominant principle\u201d \u2014 that \u201cthe purpose of the testator\u201d must be sought \u201cfrom all parts and provisions of the instrument considered together.\u201d <em>Shannon v. Ryan, </em>91 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>491, 494, 495 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1920). The same thought, variously stated, will be found in a host of cases, <em>e. g., In re Goldfaden\u2019s Estate, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>450, 455 (1951); <em>Pilgrim, v. Vandemark</em>135 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>469, 472 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1944); <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. New York, etc., Animals, </em>23 <em>N. J. Super. </em>170, 182 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952) \u2014one section of a will is \u201cnot to be considered in a vacuum.\u201d In fact <em>Gulick v. Gulick\u2019s Executors, </em>27 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>498, 501 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1875), relied upon by the trial court, is in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">On looking at the will as a whole, one is immediately taken with the idea that the testator may have intended something other than what he s\u00e1id in the provision at issue. Thus in the first paragraph above quoted, Rudolf is given at 30 \u201cone-third of the principal of the <em>entire </em>trust fund.\u201d Later, in the second paragraph quoted, there is set aside for Margaret and her heirs at her mother\u2019s death</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u201ct.he <em>remaining one-half </em>of <em>said entire </em>trust fund then in the hands of my trustees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In construing the word \u201centire\u201d in this latter clause we are obliged to submit to one of these alternatives: we may look upon the word as of little significance or strike it as error; or we may conclude that the draftsman of the will has made an error in mathematics \u2014 for the will purports to give one-third of the <em>entire </em>trust to Rudolf at 30, and (what amounts to) another one-third thereof at his mother\u2019s death, and then sets aside one-half thereof for Margaret and her heirs. Quite apparently in our view \u2014 at any event we think it will become apparent as the argument progresses \u2014 the word \u201centire\u201d here is neither surplusage nor error, but on the contrary is a word of very substantial import. It lends much support to Margaret\u2019s contention that Rudolf is entitled, not to one-half, but only to one-quarter of the <em>corpus </em>in the trustee\u2019s hands on her mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The word \u201cthen\u201d in the phrase \u201cthe remaining one-half of said entire trust fund <em>then </em>in the hands of my trustees\u201d does not stand in the way of Margaret\u2019s argument. It may be said to have reference to the next preceding word expressive of time, <em>viz., </em>the word \u201cremaining\u201d \u2014 or, to have general reference to the time following the two payments of <em>corpus </em>directed to be made in Rudolf\u2019s favor. At any event we think it does not allude to the time of Elly\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Looking further into the will, we find two other provisions of the wdll lending substance to Margaret\u2019s position. Under one of them Rudolf at his mother\u2019s death was given certain accumulated income, in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">\u2022'* * * together with one-half of the share of the accumulated income which my wife had been receiving at the time of her death\u201d (further, see quotation above).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">It would seem utterly incongruous for the testator to give Rudolf only one-half of the accumulated income his mother would have had if living, and at the same time to give him all the principal that had been supporting her share of the income. But even more significant is the draftsman\u2019s assumption that the other half share of this accumulated income need not be mentioned; he seems to have thought it would go to Margaret by virtue of her life interest in \u201cthe remaining one-half of said entire trust fund.\u201d In other words it may be taken from the omission of any provision as to this other one-half of the accumulated income that the share of principal set aside for Margaret and her heirs was to include one-half of the principal that had been supporting her mother\u2019s income. (As to the significance of the words \u201caccumulated income,\u201d see <em>Commercial Trust Co. of New Jersey v. Spiegelberg, </em>117 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>171 <em>(Ch. </em>1934), affirmed <em>Commercial Trust Co. of New Jersey v. Mason, </em>119 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>376 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936); <em>Lippincott v. Ridgway, </em>11 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>526 <em>(Ch. </em>1858); <em>Lewis v. Towar, </em>45 <em>A. </em>999 <em>(Ch. </em>1900); <em>Titsworth v. Titsworth, </em>107 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>436, 441 <em>(Ch. </em>1931); <em>Barrett v. Barrett, </em>134 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>138, 151 <em>(Ch. </em>1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Another provision in the will indicating that Rudolf was to have, all told, only one-half of the \u201centire trust fund,\u201d appears in a prior paragraph of the instrument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">\u201cIn the event of the death of my wife, before my son Rudolf reaches the age of thirty years [provision is made as to the income] * * *; and upon my son, Rudolf, reaching the age of thirty years, then my trustees or trustee shall be directed to pay to my son, Rudolf, one-half of the principal of the trust fund then held by my trustees or trustee at said time, together with one-half the accumulated income that my wife would be entitled to at said time, and the balance of one-half of said trust fund then in the hands of my trustees or trustee to be retained by trustees or trustee for the purpose of paying the income thereof to my daughter, Margaret during the remainder of her life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">There is a parallelism of language in certain respects between this paragraph and the one in issue; and so the fact that the word <em>entire </em>appears only in the latter paragraph indicates that the draftsman there made use of the word for some purpose. But that is a small matter. Of more significance is the inexplicable incongruity of a -gift to Rudolf of only one-half of the entire trust if his mother died before he reached 30, and two-thirds of it if she died thereafter. Besides the trust for Margaret increases or decreases proportionately depending on Rudolf\u2019s age at his mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We notice, too, that certain provisions of the will as to income, which we have not quoted, furnish some small support to Margaret\u2019s position, for in them she and Rudolf are dealt with on terms of equality.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We will not stop to consider other conceivable constructions of the critical words, not argued by the parties and of less merit than those presented. We may brush aside, too, any notion that certain provisions of the will are so obscure as to be meaningless and void; this would be a last resort to which we would turn only on the failure of every attempt to render the provisions effective. <em>Arenofsky v. Arenofsky, 29 N. J. Super. </em>209, 217 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954); <em>Den ex dem. Micheau v. Crawford, </em>8 <em>N. J. L. </em>90, 97 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1825).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We are obliged, therefore, to make a choice between the two constructions mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Is Rudolf entitled to two-thirds of the <em>corpus </em>of the entire trust \u2014 one-third at 30 and a second one-third at his mother\u2019s death? If so, as stated, we must strike the word \u201centire\u201d from the provision set up for Margaret and her heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Or was there a mistake on the draftsman\u2019s part; did he really intend Rudolf to receive at his mother\u2019s death only one-quarter of the amount constituting the principal of the trust ? If so, we must substitute one-quarter for one-half in the crucial clause in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">There is a large body of cases in this State authorizing the court to correct the words of a will so as to substitute one word for another, or to strike a word, where necessary to give effect to the clear intent of the testator. <em>Herbert v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>131 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>330, 337 <em>(Ch. </em>1942), affirmed 132 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>445 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942); <em>Creveling\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v.

Eq. </em>745, 749 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1852).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">But this is an authority to be exercised only with the greatest of caution. Can we say that either construction above set forth represents with clarity the testator\u2019s intention? We hardly think so. However the situation presented is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the one contemplated by these cases. Here we are driven by the constructions stated, into rejecting the will either at one point or at another, either by striking the word \u201centire\u201d or by changing one-half to one-quarter. In such a juncture we think clarity is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">It may be said that it is easier to strike an adjective of somewhat dubious weight (the word \u201centire\u201d) than both to strike a term (one-half) of a sort which stands out in a will, and also to write in another like term (one-quarter), nevertheless \u2014 assuming all this to be so \u2014 we find ourselves with a solid conviction that the words of the will indicate an intention on the testator\u2019s part to give Rudolf at his mother\u2019s death but one-quarter of the amount constituting the principal of the trust. This, we feel confident, comports with the predominant idea in the testator\u2019s mind as revealed by the will; and that idea, if it properly appears before the court, is to be heeded as against all doubtful provisions standing in its way. <em>Hudson Trust Co. v. de </em>Malignon, 140 <em>N.
