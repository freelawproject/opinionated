A. 2A</em>:4-18 gives the court concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court to provide for the support of the wife \u2014 a jurisdiction, incidentally, which the Superior Court derives entirely from <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:34-24. <em>Richman v. Richman, </em>129 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>114, 116, 118 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941). In general see <em>Peff v. Peff, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>513, 525 (1949); <em>cf. Turi v. Turi, </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>313, 320 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), and cases cited. This question as to the effect of <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:4-18 was not raised below. But the wife makes no' point of that here. Besides, the issue goes to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Morin v. Becker, </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>457, 460 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The stress of the wife\u2019s argument is laid upon clause <em>b </em>and the italicized portion of clause c of <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:4-18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cThe juvenile and domestic relations court shall also have jurisdiction concurrently with such other courts as may have jurisdiction over the matter, to hear and determine in a summary manner disputes and complaints:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">a. Involving the domestic relation or the welfare of children, as to which jurisdiction is vested in any court except the superior court or except with respect to the adoption of children or adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">b. Involving matters of support or temporary custody of children as to which jurisdiction is vested in the superior court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">c. Involving violations of subtitle 12 (disorderly persons law) of this title (\u00a7 2A:169-1 <em>el se.q.), </em>and chapter 1 of Title 44, Poor (\u00a7 44:1-1 <em>et seq.), </em>chapter 6 and chapter 17 of Title 9, Children (\u00a7 9:6-1 et seq., and \u00a7 9:17-1 et seq.), and article 4 of chapter 5 of Title 30, Institutions and Agencies (\u00a7 30:5-33 <em>et seq.), </em>of the Revised Statutes, <em>together with any other laws or future enactments covering similar complaints or offenses, where the gravamen of the complaint under such laws or enactments is the failure or neglect of 1 member of the family to satisfy or discharge his legal obligar tions to another member of the family. </em>[Italics added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">5k s\u00a1: * Ms * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">e. Involving the domestic relation, where a husband or father deserts his wife or child even though they continue to live in the same household, in which case the court may order adequate support of his wife, child or family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">f. Involving the domestic relation, where a husband or father forces his wife or child to leave the home because of his cruel and inhuman conduct, in which case the court may provide by appropriate order for their support and maintenance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">We deal first with the words \u201cmatters of support\u201d appearing in clause <em>b. </em>The wife argues that these words apply to the support of wives as well as children and indeed confer upon the court the authority given to the Superior Court by <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:34-24 to award support in the case of a consensual separation. It might be observed that the Superior Court\u2019s authority in this regard is said to rest (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Richman v. </em>Richman, 129 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>114,116 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941), <em>supra), </em>upon that provision of <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:34-24 which we have italicized below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><em>\u201c2A </em>:34-24. If a husband, without justifiable cause, shall abandon his wife <em>or separate himself from her </em>and refuse or neglect to maintain and provide for her, the [Superior Court \u2014 see <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:34-8] may order suitable support and maintenance to be paid and provided by the husband for the wife and her children, or any of them, by their marriage, or to be made out of his property * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The wife\u2019s argument is unpersuasivo. It is hardly to be supposed that clause <em>b </em>of <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:4-18, expressly referring to children, was intended to deal with wives also, but without mentioning them \u2014 indeed without even any reference to the \u201cdomestic relation\u201d such as appears in the phrase which introduces clauses <em>a, e </em>and <em>f. </em>Besides, the specificity of the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:4-18e and / hardly indicates that the Legislature thought that the words \u201cmatters of support\u201d <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-18b), are to be equated to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-24. In fact the wife\u2019s whole argument here, presupposing an extraordinary easualness in draftsmanship, gives to clause <em>b </em>a forced construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The weakness of her argument becomes plainer, the further one looks into the matter. It was held under a predecessor statute <em>(R. S. </em>9 :18-14 as amended by <em>L. </em>1946, <em>c. 71) </em>that a jurisdictional prerequisite to a wife\u2019s action for support in a Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court was \u201cactual abandonment or desertion.\u201d See <em>Frank v. Juvenile, etc., Court of Essex County, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>364, 368 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948), holding the court to be without jurisdiction in the case of a constructive desertion; <em>De Sena v. De Sena, </em>4 <em>N. J. Super. </em>379 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949), where the spouses continued to live in the same household; <em>cf. Bonanno v. Bonanno, </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>268, 273 (1960), saying the court has jurisdiction with respect to the support of a \u201cdeserted\u201d spouse. Under that statute obviously a consensual separation, such as here, would not have sufficed. The next version of this statute <em>(L. </em>1950. c. 337 \u2014 for present purposes, the same as the law today, <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:4\u201418) was drawn in part in order to super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>sede the <em>Frank </em>case with respect to a constructive desertion brought about by cruel and inhuman conduct. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:4-18/; as to <em>e, </em>see the <em>Be Bena </em>case. Still, notwithstanding that the <em>Frank </em>and <em>Be Sena </em>cases were obviously then in view, no recognizable attempt was made in clause 5 or elsewhere to give the comt jurisdiction in a case where there was no desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Enough has been said as to the wife\u2019s argument concerning clause 5 of <em>N. J. S. </em>4. 24:4-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We turn, then, to clause <em>c. </em>In that clause the court is given jurisdiction with respect to certain enumerated statutes \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201ctogether with any other <em>laws </em>or future enactments covering <em>similar </em>complaints or offenses, where the gravamen of the complaint under such laws or enactments is the failure or neglect of 1 member of the family to satisfy or discharge his legal obligations to another member of the family\u201d (italics added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">This provision appeared almost verbatim in the 1946 law, above cited, and was considered in <em>Frank v. </em>Juvenile, <em>etc., Court of Essex County, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>364 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948), <em>supra. </em>(We need not stop to discuss prior cases dealing with similar prior laws.) It was clearly the view of the court in <em>Frank </em>that the word \u201claws,\u201d above italicized, cannot be taken to include <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:3A-24. That being so, it is difficult to see how this same provision, through mere repetition in <em>L. </em>1950, <em>c. </em>337 (amending <em>R. S. </em>9:18-14) and also in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24 :4-18, can now be said to embrace that statute. As above stated, the Legislature in drawing the 1950 act, had the <em>Frank </em>case before it. The amendment then prepared, insofar as it superseded the <em>Frank </em>case, is quite pointed (see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24 <em>:4-18e </em>and /); and clearly no effort was made to incorporate into clause <em>c, </em>by reference, the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:34-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The fact that clause c has been held to refer to the Uniform Desertion and Uonsupport Act, <em>State on Complaint of Bruneel v. Bruneel, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>53 (1953), <em>State v. Savastini, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>507 (1954), and the further fact that there are some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>broad definitions in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A.:4-30.2, are beside the point. Indeed we think the whole matter is sufficiently clear that we need not consider what are, and what are not, complaints or offenses <em>\u201csimilar\u201d </em>(see clause c quoted above) to those involving the \u201cviolations\u201d specifically referred to in <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:4-18c.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We have given some consideration to the law in other states with respect to maintenance in a case of a consensual separation. See note 10 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>466, 478, 479 and (as to the New York Domestic Relations Court Act) 550; 42 <em>C. J. S., Husband and \"Wife, </em>\u00a7 611, <em>p. </em>205. See also 3 <em>Nelson, Divorce and Annulment </em>384, 392 <em>(2nd ed.) </em>as to the effect of a separation agreement. But we have so little to go by here, it would be idle to speculate on the legislative policies underlying the failure to provide in <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:4 \u2014 18 for a separation by consent. The ease simply comes down to this: the Legislature has not indicated an intention to confer upon the court the full authority contained in <em>N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:34-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">However the fact that jurisdiction over the subject matter lies, not in the court below, but in another court in the state, is not as serious a matter as it once was. <em>R. R. 1:27D </em>(the words \u201cof this State,\u201d appearing in the rule, we construe as meaning \u201cin this state\u201d). Under <em>R. R. 1:27D(b), </em>we may deal with the case as though it had been brought in the court (the Superior Court) authorized to act under <em>N. J. S. A. 2A</em>:34-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">It is not necessary to mention any other point raised by the husband, except one, which we think is well taken, namely, that there was no proof below as to the needs of the wife. Her needs constitute one of the factors which should be considered by a court when fixing the amount of an award in a case of separaie maintenance. <em>Bonanno v. Bonanno, </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>268, 274 (1950), <em>supra; Walsh v. Walsh, </em>88 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>368, 369 <em>(Ch. </em>1917), affirmed 88 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>369 <em>(E. A. </em>1917); <em>Turi v. Turi, </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>313, 323 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), <em>supra; R. R. </em>6:5-4(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>If the wife wishes to have this case remanded to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, pursuant to <em>R. R. 1:27D, </em>she will present (or make an application to present) a special form of mandate within ten days of the filing of this opinion. The mandate should state that the remand is made for the taking of proof as to the wife\u2019s needs and the fixing of the amount of support, and for such other proceedings as the Superior Court deems advisable. It should also direct: the wife to amend her complaint so as to set forth therein a cause of action based on a consensual separation; the Clerk of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court to transfer to the Clerk of the Superior Court the record and papers on file in the ease, see <em>R. R. </em>1:27D(a); and (under the circumstances here) the fees fixed by <em>R. R. </em>4:98-1(d) and <em>N. J. S. A. 22A </em>:2-12 to be paid to the Clerk of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">If such a mandate (or application) is not presented within the time stated, the Clerk will enter the usual form of mandate on a reversal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
