The Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) employed a five step sequential evaluation process in determining whether a particular applicant for benefits is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act and the pertinent regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In relevant part, those regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>tions require that a claimant must manifest a severe impairment, i.e., one that significantly limits his ability to perform basic work activities, prior to the agency\u2019s consideration of other vocational factors such as age, education, and previous work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c); 416.-920(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each of the named plaintiffs in the instant matter was denied benefits at the second stage of the administrative analysis upon a finding that their respective impairments were not severe, without consideration by the agency of other vocational factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each exhausted his administrative remedies without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">The plaintiffs on April 20, 1984 filed the instant suit in federal district court. The plaintiffs sought judicial review of their respective individual determinations and additionally challenged 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1520(c) and its application as overly stringent and inconsistent with the Social Security Act inasmuch as the agency had purportedly denied benefits to individuals who manifested medically determinable impairments rendering them unable to engage in substantial gainful activity without consideration of the other vocational factors such as age, education, and prior work experience enumerated in the statute. The plaintiffs in their complaint sought to represent</p>\n<p id=\"AWC\">all SSDI [social security disability insurance] and SSI [supplemental security income] claimants residing in the Commonwealth of Kentucky who have or have had applications for disability benefits and who are or have been denied pursuant to the policy set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), .1521 and .1522, 416.-920(c), .921 and .922, and Social Security Ruling .82-55, on the basis that they do not have a \u201csevere\u201d impairment; and all recipients of such benefits who are making or have made claims for continued benefits, and whose benefits are being or have been terminated pursuant to the same policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The plaintiffs requested that the district court declare that the refusal of the agency to consider other vocational factors where it found that a claimant\u2019s impairment was not severe contravened the Social Security Act and further sought to enjoin the Secretary from denying benefits on the basis of the regulation in question. An examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint disclosed that, although the potential scope of the proposed class included certain individuals in Kentucky whose claims for benefits had been previously denied or their benefits terminated by application of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) as implemented by the Secretary, the injunctive relief actually requested by the plaintiffs in their complaint was framed exclusively in <em>prospective </em>terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>On August 9, 1984, the plaintiffs moved the district court to certify the proposed class. On August 13, 1984, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the district court enjoin the Secretary from applying the regulation to all claims currently pending in Kentucky. On August 14, 1984, the Secretory filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 suit on the basis that, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the class action inasmuch as the proposed class included individuals who had not presented claims for benefits to the agency, individuals who had not administratively exhausted their claims, as well as individuals who had failed to file appeals from the agency\u2019s denial of benefits in federal district court within 60 days of notice of the final decision of the Secretary regarding their respective claims. The plaintiffs in response on August 28, 1984 redefined their proposed class to include the following individuals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">1. Those presently with claims before the Secretary, but who have not received an initial determination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-5\">2. Those presently with claims before the Secretory who have had their claims denied on the basis they do not have a severe impairment, and who have administratively appealed their claims; or who have received an initial determination less than 65 days before April 20, 1984, the date this action was filed; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-6\">3. Those who have received a \u201cfinal decision\u201d from the Secretary denying their claims on the basis they do not have a severe impairment, and who have either appealed to the United States District Court, or who have received their decision less than 65 days before April 20, 1984, the date this action was filed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAI\">The plaintiffs subsequently filed supplemental memoranda in support of their motion for class certification and preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">On November 13, 1984, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification and preliminary injunctive relief. With respect to class certification, the lower court noted that the claims of the various class members would necessitate individualized examination thereby defeating any justification for class certification. Additionally, the district court concluded that class certification under the prevailing circumstances would adversely affect the claims of numerous class members by denying class plaintiffs expeditious review of their individual claims. The district court also overruled the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration. The plaintiffs appealed to this court the denial of preliminary injunctive relief and class certification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both the district court and a panel of this court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for injunctive relief and conditional class certification pending appeal. <em>Salyers v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>No. 85-5237, order (6th Cir. June 12, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">Subsequent to the plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal, this circuit has considered the Secretary\u2019s implementation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) as that issue has been joined herein in a tandem of decisions. <em>See Farris v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>773 F.2d 85 (6th Cir.1985); <em>Salmi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number><em>v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>774 F.2d 685 (6th Cir.1985). In <em>Farris </em>and <em>Salmi, </em>this circuit concluded that, although the Secretary\u2019s regulations do not conflict with the statutory mandate of the Social Security Act in light of the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984, those regulations must be interpreted as directing that an impairment qualifies as nonsevere only if, regardless of a claimant\u2019s age, education, or work experience, the impairment would not affect the claimant\u2019s ability to work. <em>Farris, </em>773 F.2d at 89-90; <em>Salmi, </em>774 F.2d at 691-92. Additionally, the Secretary at approximately the same time issued an interpretive ruling, SSR 85-28, in which the agency clarified its implementation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) in light of several court decisions. The ruling emphasized that an impairment was to be found not severe only when medical evidence established a slight abnormality or combination thereof which would have no more than a minimal effect on a claimant\u2019s ability to work even if the individual\u2019s age, education, or work experience were specifically considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">It is obvious at the outset that these intervening judicial and administrative developments have substantially altered the stance of the instant litigation. The appropriate inquiry, therefore, is whether the changes in the factual circumstances that prevailed at the commencement of the litigation have mooted the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See </em>13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3533.3 (1984). An examination of the record disclosed that the very reasons that prompted the plaintiffs\u2019 action for declaratory and injunctive relief on a class-wide basis have now been resolved. This circuit has not interpreted 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) in <em>Farris </em>and <em>Sal-mi, </em>which interpretation is dispositive of the plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief. Cf<em>. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce v. Austin, </em>788 F.2d 1178, 1182 (6th Cir.1986) (changing circumstances may moot a request for declaratory relief). Moreover, it is clear that, at the very least, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for <em>prospective </em>injunctive relief on behalf of the putative class have been mooted in light of both this circuit\u2019s decisions and the agency\u2019s independent actions. <em>See Banas v. Dempsey, </em>742 F.2d 277, 281 (6th Cir.1984) (change in federal law while action pending rendered moot plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief to prevent defendant from enforcing allegedly unconstitutional state practices), <em>aff'd, Green v. Mansour, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 423, 88 L.Ed.2d 371 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">The only remaining issue, therefore, is whether the plaintiffs have joined claims for <em>retrospective </em>relief that might nevertheless justify class certification and further consideration by this court. A review of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint disclosed a request for purely <em>prospective </em>relief in requesting the district court to enjoin the Secretary from denying or terminating benefits of class members pursuant to the regulation in question. Nothing in the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent motions for preliminary injunction or for class certification detracted from this prospective characterization of the requested relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, this court concludes that the current posture of this case is such that the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for class declaratory and injunctive relief are now moot in light of intervening developments. <em>See County of Los Angeles v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 1383, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979). This result dictates that this court need not explore the remaining issues raised by the parties on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Based upon the foregoing and in view of this circuit\u2019s decisions in <em>Farris </em>and <em>Salmi, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying preliminary injunctive relief and class certification is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-9\">. The instant appeal has previously been the subject of an unpublished opinion by this panel. <em>Salyers v. Secretary of HHS, </em>791 F.2d 935 (6th Cir.1986). In that opinion, the court remanded the case to the district court for entry of an order denying a preliminary injunction and class certification upon a separate document in conformity with Rule 58, Fed.R.Civ.P., and retained jurisdiction of the appeal pending completion of that action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-10\">. The Supreme Court has recently described the sequential process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-11\">The first step determines whether the claimant is engaged in \"substantial gainful activity.\u201d If he is, benefits are denied. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), (b), 416.920(a), (b) (1985). If he is not engaged in such activity, the process moves to the second step, which decides whether the claimant's condition or impairment is <em>\u201csevere,\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e. one that significantly limits his physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. If the impairment is not severe, benefits are denied. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-1520(c), 416.920(c). If the impairment is severe, the third step determines whether the claimant\u2019s impairments meet or equal those set forth in the \"Listing of Impairments\u201d (listings) contained in subpart P, appendix 1, of the regulations, 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(d), 416.-920(d). The listings consist of specified impairments acknowledged by the Secretary to be of sufficient severity to preclude gainful</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>employment. If a claimant\u2019s condition meets or equals the listed impairments, he is conclusively presumed to be disabled and entitled to benefits. If the claimant\u2019s impairments are not listed, the process moves to the fourth step, which assesses the individual\u2019s \"residual functional capacity\u201d (RFC); this assessment measures the claimant\u2019s capacity to engage in basic work activities. If the claimant\u2019s RFC permits him to perform his prior work, benefits are denied. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). If the claimant is not capable of doing his past work, a decision is made under the fifth and final step whether, in light of his RFC, age, education, and work experience, he has the capacity to perform other work. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-1520(f), 416.920(f). If he does not, benefits are awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACxB\"><em>Bowen v.
