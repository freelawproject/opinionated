England III, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classified him as a \u201ctax protester.\u201d England sued the IRS under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, seeking to have the words \u201ctax protester\u201d removed from IRS records pertaining to him. The district court dismissed the action on the ground that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7852(e) deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The Privacy Act requires each agency that maintains a system of records to \u201cmaintain all records which are used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination____\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Agencies are prohibited from maintaining records \u201cdescribing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity____\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">The Privacy Act permits an individual to review agency records that contain information pertaining to that individual. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(l). In addition, the individual is permitted to request amendment of a record that pertains to him, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2), and the agency is required promptly either to \u201cmake any correction of any portion thereof which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely or complete,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2)(B)(i), or to inform the individual of its refusal to amend the record and the reason for the refusal, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2)(B)(ii). The individual who disagrees with the refusal of the agency to amend its records is permitted to seek review of that decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(3). If the reviewing official refuses to amend the record, the individual may file with the agency a statement setting forth the reasons for his disagreement with the agency\u2019s decision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(3), and he may bring a civil action in the United States district court against the agency, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Congress has, however, limited the applicability of the Privacy Act\u2019s remedial provisions with regard to records maintained by the IRS.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-16\">Privacy Act of 1974. \u2014 The provisions of subsections (d)(2), (3), and (4), and (g) of section 552a of title 5, United States Code, shall not be applied, directly or indirectly, to the determination of the existence or possible existence of liability (or the amount thereof) of any person for any tax, penalty, interest, fine, forfei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ture, or other imposition or offense to which the provisions of [Title 26] apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYN\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7852(e). One of the subsections of the Privacy Act that cannot be applied to records falling within 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7852(e) is subsection (g), which confers upon the district courts jurisdiction over the civil remedies provided by the Privacy Act. The district court, therefore, is without jurisdiction over a civil action by an individual who seeks to amend a record determining actual or possible tax liability. <em>See Love v. Commissioner, </em>80-2 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9520. (N.D.Ga.1980); <em>Hudgins v. Commissioner, </em>84-2 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9854 (D.D.C.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>(D.C.Cir.1985); <em>Green v. Commissioner, </em>556 F.Supp. 79, 86 (N.D.Ind.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>734 F.2d 18 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The records that England seeks to have amended were generated by the IRS in the course of processing his tax returns and determining his tax liability. During the initial processing of England\u2019s returns, it was determined that the returns met the criteria of the \u201cTax Protester Program;\u201d 1. e., from the face of the returns it was determined that England had employed \u201cone or more illegal schemes that affect the payment of taxes.\u201d II Audit, CCH Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 4293.11(1). The IRS defines tax protester schemes to include schemes that protest the payment of taxes on constitutional grounds that have been held by courts to be without merit, as well as schemes involving family estate trusts, alleged churches, foreign trust organizations and other sham transactions designed to reduce the individual\u2019s tax liability illegally. <em>See </em>II Audit, CCH Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 4293.14. If the IRS determines that an individual\u2019s return meets the criteria of an illegal tax protester return, his IRS record is flagged \u201ctax protester\u201d and his subsequent returns are automatically screened for continued reliance on such illegal schemes to avoid payment of taxes. II Audit, CCH Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 4293.16(10). Thus, documents flagging England\u2019s record as that of a \u201ctax protester\u201d have a direct relationship to the determination of an his tax liability and fall within the scope of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7852(e). The district court therefore properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over England\u2019s 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">England also argues that the flagged records violate 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(7) because they constitute a record of the exercise of his first amendment rights. We disagree, because the records relate only to the determination of tax liability, not to how England has exercised his first amendment rights. They are therefore exempted from Privacy Act suits by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7852(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The records here are not a surveillance report, newsletter or press release, <em>see Clarkson v. Commissioner, </em>678 F.2d 1368, 1372 (11th Cir.1982), nor a videotape, <em>see Albright v. United States, </em>631 F.2d 915 (D.C.Cir.1980); they are internally generated reports relating to the filing of facially illegal returns. This is not a case of labelling one as a \u201ctax protestor\u201d because of speeches or writings in the absence of filing such returns. Consequently, the congressional concern behind subsection 552a(e)(7), to prevent \u201c \u2018collection of protected information not immediately needed, about law-abiding Americans, on the off-chance that Government or the particular agency might possibly have to deal with them in the future,\u2019 \u201d is not implicated here. <em>Clarkson, </em>678 F.2d at 1375 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>(quoting S.Rep. No. 1183, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 6916, 6971)). England, therefore, failed to state a claim under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-12\">. The requirements of accuracy, completeness, timeliness and relevancy are directed both toward the authorized needs of the agency and toward the need for agency decisions that are fair to the individual. <em>See Zeller v. United States, </em>467 F.Supp. 487, 502 (E.D.N.Y.1979); Sen.Rep. No. 93-1183, <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6916, 6965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\">. Even if England were able to establish that the records in question concerned his exercise of his first amendment rights, he would have to contend with the exception in \u00a7 552a(e)(7) which allows an agency to maintain records relating to an investigation with respect to the exercise of first amendment rights if the investigation is relevant to an authorized criminal investigation or to an authorized intelligence or administrative investigation. <em>Jabara v. Webster, </em>691 F.2d 272, 280 (6th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 863, 104 S.Ct. 193, 78 L.Ed.2d 170 (1983); <em>see also Clarkson v. Commissioner, </em>678 F.2d 1368, 1374 n. 10 (11th Cir.1982). The objective of this exception is \u201c \u2018to make certain that political and religious activities are not used as the cover for illegal or subversive activities.\u201d' <em>Clarkson, </em>678 F.2d at 1374 (quoting 120 Cong. Rec. H10,892 (daily ed.' November 20, 1974)). In view of our decision, we need not rule on the interpretation or effect of this exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
