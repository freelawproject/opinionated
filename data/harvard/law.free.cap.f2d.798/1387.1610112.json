Leggett and administered by defendant-appellee Frederick L. Badger. At the time the assault occurred Badger was employed as a correctional officer at Florida State Prison, where Leggett was a prisoner. Leggett subsequently filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, prevailed on the merits, and sought attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida properly declined to enforce a mandate of this court relating to the assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees against the State of Florida on the grounds that the mandate had been super-ceded by controlling precedent that required an opposite result. We agree with the district court that this case presents the rare situation in which one of the narrow exceptions to the \u201claw of the case doctrine\u201d is applicable, and therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-18\">In the underlying action under \u00a7 1983, a jury found for Leggett and awarded him compensatory and punitive damages. A panel of this court affirmed this award in an unpublished opinion. <em>Leggett v. Badger, </em>673 F.2d 1343 (11th Cir.1982) (per curiam) <em>(Leggett I). </em>Subsequently, the district court held that Leggett was not entitled to receive attorneys\u2019 fees from the State of Florida. On appeal, a panel of this court \u201creverse[d] and remand[ed] this case for joinder of the [State of. Florida] for the purposes of attorney\u2019s fees determination, and consideration in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Glover [v. Alabama Depart-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number><em>merit of Corrections, </em>734 F.2d 691 (11th Cir.1984)].\u201d <em>Leggett v. Badger, </em>759 F.2d 1556, 1558 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(Leggett II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-4\">The court in <em>Glover </em>held that \u201cthe fact that damages were awarded against defendant Towns [, a prison official,] in his individual capacity only does not preclude the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against the state.\u201d 734 F.2d at 695. Such fees could be assessed, however, only if the government entity is \u201cjoined in the suit for purposes of the attorney\u2019s fees determination____Id.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Leggett therefore joined the state and moved the district court to enforce the <em>Leggett II </em>mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-6\">After the <em>Leggett II </em>decision, however, the Supreme Court of the United States determined that \u201cit is clear that a suit against a government official in his or her personal capacity cannot lead to imposition of fee liability upon the governmental entity.\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3106, 87 L.Ed.2d 114, 123 (1985). Significantly, the court in <em>Leggett II </em>had found that Leggett prevailed \u201cagainst Badger in his individual capacity.\u201d <em>Leggett II, </em>759 F.2d at 1557. The district court accordingly declined to enforce the mandate of this court, holding that it was free to do so because the decision in <em>Graham </em>was controlling authority that dictated a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-9\">Generally, an appellate court decision on an issue must be followed in all subsequent trial court proceedings in the same case. <em>Dorsey v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>730 F.2d 675, 678 (11th Cir.1984). This rule, usually referred to as the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine, has three exceptions that allow a federal district court to act contrary to the appellate decision: (1) when new and substantially different evidence is presented subsequent to the appeal; (2) when controlling authority has been rendered, contrary to the law of the appellate decision; (3) when the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice if implemented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Stanley v. United States, </em>786 F.2d 1490, 1498 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-16\">Leggett\u2019s primary argument is that the mandate issued by this court in <em>Leggett II </em>was final and therefore binding on the district court. The only exception, he claims, is if the \u201cprior decision on which the mandate is based is <em>clearly </em>erroneous.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 12 (emphasis in original). The \u201cmandate rule\u201d on which this contention relies is but a \u201cspecific application of the law of the case doctrine.\u201d <em>Piambino v. Bailey, </em>757 F.2d 1112, 1120 (11th Cir.1985). As such, the rule in this circuit is that it is subject to the same three exceptions. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Leggett\u2019s characterization of the law is simply not correct; the standard he articulates inaccurately and incompletely juxtaposes two of the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-17\">The district court correctly characterized the question before it on remand as whether <em>Graham </em>justified disregarding the mandate of <em>Leggett II; </em>i.e., was <em>Graham </em>controlling authority that required a contrary result. We must decide the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-18\">The Supreme Court in <em>Graham </em>specifically set out \u201cto unravel once again the distinctions between personal and official capacity suits,\u201d <em>Graham, </em>\u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 105 S.Ct. at 3104, 87 L.Ed.2d at 120; distinctions that \u201capparently continue[] to confuse lawyers and confound lower courts____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at\u2014, 105 S.Ct. at 3105, 87 L.Ed.2d at 121. In an effort to clarify these muddied waters, it determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>\u201cit is clear that a suit against a government official in his or her personal capacity cannot lead to imposition of fee liability upon the governmental entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 105 S.Ct. at 3106, 87 L.Ed.2d at 123. The Court noted that \u00a7 1983 \u201cwas not intended to make municipalities liable on a <em>respondeat superior </em>principle____ [F]ee liability runs with merits liability; if federal law does not make the government substantively liable on a <em>respondeat superior </em>basis, the government similarly is not liable for fees on that basis under \u00a7 1988.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 105 S.Ct. at 3107, 87 L.Ed.2d at 123. This demonstrates that the district court properly concluded that <em>Graham </em>was not distinguishable from <em>Leggett II</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>thus <em>Graham </em>represented \u201can intervening change in the controlling law [that] dictates a different result.\u201d <em>Piambino v. Bailey, </em>757 F.2d 1112, 1120 (11th Cir.1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court, therefore, correctly declined to enforce our mandate. Leggett\u2019s other allegations of error are without merit and warrant no discussion. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1479-10\">. This first <em>Glover </em>decision (hereinafter <em>Glover I), </em>subsequently was vacated and remanded by the Supreme Court for consideration in light of <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). <em>See Alabama Dept. of Corrections v. Glover, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 40, 88 L.Ed.2d 33 (1985) (hereinafter <em>Glover II). </em>On remand to this court, we vacated the fee award portion of <em>Glover I </em>and remanded it to the district court for reconsideration in light of <em>Graham. See Glover v. Alabama Dept. of Corrections, </em>776 F.2d 964 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(Glover III).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1479-24\"><em>. </em>We note the need to read and apply these exceptions narrowly. A district court should follow the law of the case as decided by the appellate court unless the court is certain that one of the three specifically and unquestionably applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1480-11\">. There are, of course, factual differences between Leggett's case and Graham's. In light of the sweep and plain language of the unanimous decision in <em>Graham, </em>however, it seems plain that these distinctions are not material. For example, the primary difference, as in <em>Glover I, </em>is that the state attorney general\u2019s office represented the defendant during his litigation. The State of Kentucky took no such step in Graham\u2019s behalf. The Court in <em>Graham, </em>however, knew about <em>Glover I </em>and that this court, faced with the facts in <em>Glover I, </em>had reached a contrary decision. <em>See Graham, </em>\u2014 U.S. at\u2014n. 6, 105 S.Ct. at 3104 n. 6, 87 L.Ed.2d at 120 n. 6. Nevertheless, it drew no distinctions in this regard. In short, <em>Graham\u2019s </em>language is categorical and blunt: \"[S]ection 1988 simply does not create fee liability where merit liability is nonexistent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 105 S.Ct. at 3107, 87 L.Ed.2d at 123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1480-27\">. The propriety of this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that a panel of this court has noted that, in light of <em>Graham, </em>plaintiffs no longer should rely on <em>Glover I </em>for the proposition that a governmental entity may be held liable for attorneys' fees when the plaintiff prevails in a \u00a7 1983 suit against a government official solely in his individual capacity. <em>See Ancata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., </em>769 F.2d 700, 705 n. 10 (11th Cir.1985); <em>accord Stevens v. Gay, </em>792 F.2d 1000, 1003 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
