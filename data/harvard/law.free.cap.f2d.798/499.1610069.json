The Sunshine Act generally requires federal agencies to open their meetings to the public; Exemption 10 provides, however, that an agency may close a meeting when, <em>inter alia, </em>it is likely to \u201cspecifically concern ... the agency\u2019s participation in a civil action____\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Appellant Clark-Cowlitz Joint Operating Agency, a municipal corporation in the State of Washington, initiated this action below against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Clark-Cowlitz sought an order permitting it to inspect the transcript of an April 25, 1983 Commission meeting that had been closed to the public pursuant to Exemption 10. Sustaining the Commission\u2019s position in full, the district court awarded summary judgment against ClarkCowlitz. Because we agree that Exemption 10 was properly invoked in this case, we now affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-19\">In 1980, the Commission issued a decision on an important issue of statutory construction arising under the Federal Power Act: whether the preference accorded to municipalities in hydroelectric licensing proceedings, <em>see </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 800(a) (1982), applies in <em>relicensing </em>proceedings <em>(i.e., </em>where a private utility\u2019s original fifty-year license has expired and a municipality seeks to take over the license). In <em>City of Bountiful, Utah, </em>11 FERC (CCH) \u00b6 61,337 (1980) <em>(Bountiful), </em>the Commission concluded that it did. That decision was challenged by private utilities but nonetheless affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Alabama Power Co. v. FERC, </em>685 F.2d 1311 (11th Cir.1982). The private utilities then sought review in the Supreme Court by petitions for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-20\">The Commission scheduled a meeting for April 25,1983 to discuss its response to the certiorari petitions. Shortly before that date, the Commission\u2019s members voted to close the meeting because its agenda concerned the agency\u2019s \u201cparticipation in a civil action\u201d and thus fell within the terms of Sunshine Act Exemption 10. <em>See </em>48 Fed. Reg. 17,432 (1983) (providing public notice of this determination). Although the meeting was closed to the public, the Commission transcribed the meeting\u2019s discussion. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(f)(l) (1982). On May 3, Clark-Cowlitz requested access to this transcript. The Commission denied this request, again relying upon Exemption 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-21\">At the April 25 meeting the Commission, in fact, had decided not to defend the <em>Bountiful </em>decision in the Supreme Court. The composition of the Commission had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>changed, and a majority wished to <em>support </em>the petitions for certiorari pending before the Court. In a brief submitted on behalf of the Commission, the Solicitor General of the United States disclosed this development, and accordingly asked that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision be vacated. The Supreme Court, however, denied certiorari on July 6. <em>Utah Power &amp; Light Co. v. FERC, </em>463 U.S. 1230, 103 S.Ct. 3573, 77 L.Ed.2d 1415 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Clark-Cowlitz then renewed its request for the transcript of the April 25 meeting, and again was denied on the basis of Exemption 10. The Chairman of the Commission affirmed this denial, maintaining that all portions of the April 25 meeting were exempt and that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">Full and candid discussion of litigation strategy demands that Commissioners and staff have the freedom to raise and consider a wide range of alternatives. If initial theories and hypotheses and preliminary observations are subject to public scrutiny, there may well be a chilling effect on future strategy discussions and harm to the Commission\u2019s future litigation posture before the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Letter from Chairman C.M. Butler III to Christopher D. Williams, Esq. (July 12, 1983) (Joint Appendix at 75, 76).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Clark-Cowlitz then brought this suit. After conducting an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the transcript, the district court granted the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Memorandum Opinion, No. 83-1842 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1983). The district court concluded that the April 25 meeting \u201cinvolved open and candid discussions concerning the possible agency positions [relating to] the pending petition[s] for <em>certiorari,\u201d id. </em>at 7, and thus fell squarely within the purview of Exemption 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">On appeal, a panel of this court reversed the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Clark-Cowlitz Joint Operating Agency v. FERC, </em>775 F.2d 359 (D.C.Cir.1985). It held that the protections of Exemption 10 terminate upon the conclusion of the litigation for which the exemption is invoked. <em>Id. </em>at 363-65. Because the Supreme Court had denied certiorari in the <em>Bountiful </em>litigation, the panel concluded that Exemption 10 would no longer support the Commission\u2019s refusal to provide the transcript. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, the full court voted to rehear the case <em>en banc </em>and consequently vacated the panel decision. We now affirm the district court\u2019s disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The Government in the Sunshine Act embodies the general policy that federal agencies should \u201cconduct their meetings in the open, rather than behind closed doors.\u201d S.Rep. No. 354, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1975) (Senate Report). Nonetheless, the Act contains ten specific exemptions from this requirement of openness. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c) (1982). These exemptions serve to \u201cprotect the ability of the Government to carry out its responsibilities____\u201d Senate Report at 11. We deal here only with Exemption 10, which permits an agency to close meetings (and withhold the transcript or minutes thereof)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dealing with its participation in litigation. We conclude that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission properly invoked Exemption 10 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">As the district court found, the Commission\u2019s April 25 meeting concerned the posture the agency would adopt in litigation pending before the Supreme Court. \u201cThe Commissioners met to discuss all the available options and possible repercussions with counsel and came to a final conclusion on the agency\u2019s litigation strategy.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Mem.Op. at 11. As such, these matters fall within the plain terms of Exemption 10, and the agency was privileged to withhold the transcript from public scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Clark-Cowlitz nevertheless argues that at the April 25 meeting the Commissioners decided to reverse the <em>Bountiful </em>decision, and thus that the meeting strayed beyond exempt \u201clitigation strategy\u201d into what it contends were non-exempt \u201cpolicy deliberations.\u201d We think, however, that the appellant interprets Exemption 10 too narrowly. As a predicate to determining <em>how </em>to respond to the certiorari petitions filed against the Commission, the Commissioners necessarily discussed <em>what result </em>they sought. It could hardly have been otherwise: an attorney cannot discuss litigation tactics with his client in a coherent manner without touching upon his client\u2019s substantive objectives. Nor is it unusual for a discussion focused on litigation tactics to lead a party to modify its substantive position. The commencement of litigation, as well as its various twists and turns, often induces parties to concentrate sharply on policy objectives and, not infrequently, to see those objectives in a different light. For purposes of Exemption 10, then, there could be no hard-and-fast distinction between litigation strategy and policy questions; what matters is simply that the agency deliberations in question deal with \u201cthe agency\u2019s participation in a civil action.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(10). The Commission\u2019s April 25 meeting manifestly satisfies that test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We also reject Clark-Cowlitz\u2019s contention that the Commission was required to release the transcript once the litigation discussed at the April 25 meeting had terminated. No such requirement can be found in the language of Exemption 10. In fact, a <em>different </em>exemption, Exemption 9, contains an express temporal limitation. It covers information \u201cthe <em>premature </em>disclosure of which\u201d would engender financial instability or speculation or otherwise \u201cbe likely to significantly frustrate the implementation of a proposed agency action.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(9) (1982) (emphasis added). We do not believe that Congress would have written an express temporal limitation into Exemption 9 and yet have intended a similar (unwritten) limitation to apply to Exemption 10. The legislative history of the Act is not to the contrary. Clark-Cowlitz relies upon a passage from the Senate Report on the bill, which notes that certain information may be exempt at first but later lose its sensitive nature and become non-exempt. <em>See </em>Senate Report at 32. We think it plain, however, that this passage was intended to refer only to Exemption 9. <em>See id. </em>(referring to \u201cmatters which are sensitive at the time, such as the regulation of financial institutions, that would cause financial speculation if disclosed prematurely\u201d). In fact, since the version of the bill which the Senate Report described did not even require agencies to maintain a transcript or set of minutes when it closed a meeting pursuant to Exemption 10, <em>see </em>S. 5, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975), subsequent disclosure could not have been contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Requiring an agency to disclose its tactical discussions upon the conclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the litigation, moreover, would frustrate Exemption 10\u2019s purpose. Exemption 10, like the attorney-client privilege in civil litigation, <em>see, e.g., Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>566 F.2d 242, 252 (D.C.Cir.1977), which it quite clearly reflects, serves to facilitate the candid exchange of views between client and counsel necessary for effective participation in adversary proceedings. Exposing such communications <em>ex post </em>would tend to inhibit free and open discussion nearly as much as would contemporaneous disclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, for instance, in <em>FTC v. Grolier Inc., </em>462 U.S. 19, 103 S.Ct. 2209, 76 L.Ed.2d 387 (1983), the Supreme Court indicated that attorney work-product immunity survives beyond the particular litigation giving rise to it. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 103 S.Ct. at 2213. In a concurring opinion that bears forcefully on the question at issue here, Justice Brennan observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">The invasion of \u201c[a]n attorney\u2019s thoughts, heretofore inviolate,\u201d and the resulting demoralizing effect on the profession, are as great when the invasion takes place later rather than sooner. More concretely, disclosure of work product connected to prior litigation can cause real harm to the interests of the attorney and his client even after the controversy in the prior litigation is resolved. Many Government agencies, for example, deal with hundreds or thousands of essentially similar cases ____ It would be of substantial benefit to an opposing party (and of corresponding detriment to an agency) if the party could obtain work product generated by the agency in connection with earlier, similar litigation against other persons____ [H]e could gain insight into the agency\u2019s general strategic and tactical approach to deciding when suits are brought, how they are conducted, and on what terms they may be settled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 103 S.Ct. at 2216 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">Given the language of the statute, as informed by these compelling policy considerations, we hold that Exemption 10 is not extinguished at the conclusion of the litigation for which it is invoked.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>affirm the decision of the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-13\">. Exemption 10 provides in full that an agency may close a meeting to prevent the disclosure of information likely to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">specifically concern the agency\u2019s issuance of a subpena, or the agency\u2019s participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the agency of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554] or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-23\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)(10) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">. The Act requires an agency to \"maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public,\u201d or, in the case of several exemptions (including Exemption 10), merely to keep a set of minutes. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(f)(l) (1982). (In this case, the Commission maintained a verbatim transcript of the meeting, foregoing its option to keep minutes instead). The agency must then make the transcript or set of minutes available to the public, \"except for such item or items [on the agenda] as the agency determines to contain information which may be withheld under [an exemption].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552b(f)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">. There is no suggestion here that the Commission used the pending litigation as a subterfuge to discuss non-exempt items in a closed session or that it unfairly manipulated the agenda of its April 25 meeting. As the district court found, the Commissioners' discussion of the municipal preference issue was intertwined with their discussion of possible responses to the pending certiorari petitions. <em>See A.G. Becker, Inc. v. Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys., </em>502 F.Supp. 378, 386-87 (D.D.C.1980). We note, moreover, that Clark-Cowlitz does <em>not </em>argue that there were any discrete portions of the April 25 meeting that are non-exempt, <em>i.e., </em>that the Commission must disclose segments of the transcript. In any event, under the Sunshine Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">[a]gencies need not edit a transcript or electronic recording of the Commission\u2019s discussion of a particular matter word by word so as to make abbreviated portions of the record of the meeting available to the public. Where sensitive matters are an integral part of the record of the discussion of [an item on the agenda], no part of the record need be made public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Senate Report at 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, <em>see </em>Diss.Op. at 504-505, it does not follow from Congress\u2019 refusal to create a general Sunshine Act exemption for predecisional deliberations that specific types of deliberations (such as those relating to \"the agency\u2019s participation in a civil action\u201d) are not exempted. Likewise, Con-, gress\u2019 rejection of arguments that the Sunshine Act\u2019s general provision for open meetings would inhibit agency deliberations does not mean that Congress ignored such \"chilling effects\" in enacting particular exemptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\">. Clark-Cowlitz also suggests in passing that the Commission\u2019s determination not to exercise its discretion to release the transcript (despite the applicability of Exemption 10) should be reversed by this court. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 13, 19 n. 12. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the issue has been properly raised in this appeal, we reject the suggestion that such agency determinations are judicially reviewable. The Act states that its exemptions preclude disclosure \"[ejxcept in a case where the agency finds that the public interest requires otherwise____\u2019\u2019 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c) (1982). The Senate Report explains that this language indicates that \"closing a meeting on [the basis of an exemption] is permissive, not mandatory____ [A]n agency may still decide that the public good achieved by opening the meeting outweighs the advantages to be gained by closing it.\u201d Senate Report at 20. To be sure, the House Report states that \u201d[t]his balancing procedure is to be performed by the agency in the first instance,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 880, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 9, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 2183, 2190 (1976), and a panel of this Circuit has (in dictum) interpreted this comment as anticipating ultimate judicial review. <em>See Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. NRC, </em>727 F.2d 1195, 1203 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1984). We cannot believe, however, that Congress intended the courts to review <em>both </em>an agency\u2019s determination that an exemption applies in particular circumstances <em>and </em>its refusal to find that disclosure is nonetheless warranted by the \"public interest.\" That interpretation would propel the courts into the standardless realm of judging whether the public good in openness \u201coutweighs\u201d an agency\u2019s interest in confidentiality in various contexts \u2014 wholly independent of the balance already struck by Congress in the Act\u2019s express exemptions. One oblique sentence in the House Report, not endorsed in the Senate Report or the Conference Report, is simply too slender a reed upon which to rest such an untoward result. We therefore hold that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c)\u2019s \"public interest\" exception to the Act\u2019s exemptions is addressed to the unreviewable discretion of the agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b598-5\">SPOTTSWOOD W.

In my view, the panel opinion more accurately reflects the intent of Congress as to the scope of the Sunshine Act. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b (1982), embodies the belief of Congress that openness in government is essential to representative democracy. <em>See Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. NRC, </em>725 F.2d 1195, 1199 (D.C.Cir.1984). Secrecy contributes to erosion of popular confidence in government, dampens well-informed public debate, and diminishes governmental accountability to the electorate. <em>Common Cause v. NRC, </em>674 F.2d 921, 928 (D.C.Cir.1982); S.Rep. No. 354, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 4-5 (1975) (hereinafter <em>Senate </em>Report); H.R. Rep. No. 880 (part 1), 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, 2184 (hereinafter <em>House Report).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">The Act establishes a presumption that meetings should be held in the open and places the burden on the agency to justify any decision to conduct deliberations outside of public view. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(h)(l); <em>Common Cause, supra, </em>674 F.2d at 929; <em>Senate Report </em>at 19. Only if a matter falls within one of ten specific exemptions may an agency properly elect to close a meeting. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. CAB, </em>684 F.2d 31, 35 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">We have repeatedly held that all the exemptions, including the litigation exemption, must be construed narrowly. <em>See Common Cause, supra, </em>674 F.2d at 932; <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, supra, </em>727 F.2d at 1199; <em>see also Senate Report </em>at 2 (exemptions \u201cnarrow\u201d in scope). To ensure that agencies \u201cconduct their deliberations in public to the greatest extent possible,\u201d <em>Senate Report </em>at 11, as Congress intended, we must carefully limit the scope of Exemption 10 to its underlying purpose \u2014 protection of the government\u2019s ability to conduct ongoing litigation. Once litigation has ended, agencies must release the transcripts of any prior meetings closed on account of that litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">The majority asserts that Exemption 10 \u201cserves to facilitate the candid exchange of views between client and counsel necessary for effective participation in adversary proceedings. Exposing such communications <em>post hoc </em>would tend to inhibit free and open discussion nearly as much as would contemporaneous disclosure.\u201d Majority opinion (maj. op.) at 502. The majority offers no evidence, however, that concern over possible \u201cchilling effects\u201d on agency discussion played any part in the congressional adoption of this exemption. In fact, the legislative history is to the contrary. Congress repeatedly rejected such arguments. <em>See, e.g., Senate Report </em>at 6-8; 121 Cong.Rec. 35322 (1975) (statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Senator Ribicoff) (\u201cOpenness does not in fact hurt the quality of discussion or inhibit free and frank discussions.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 35331 (statement of Senator Weicker). Congress enacted Exemption 10 solely to protect the government\u2019s ability to conduct litigation. <em>See Senate Report </em>at 26; <em>House Report </em>at 12-13. Appellee itself notes that Congress limited the Act's verbatim transcript requirement to meetings closed under Exemptions 8, 9 and 10. Brief for appellee at 20. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that this limitation reflects congressional concern over the possible chilling effects of such transcripts, we must also note that the limitation indicates a specific <em>lack </em>of concern on this point for Exemption 10. Nowhere in Exemption 10 or its legislative history is concern over \u201cchilling effects\u201d to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s view that Exemption 10 \u201cclearly reflects\u201d the attorney-client privilege flies in the face of congressional resolve to avoid such a broad exemption from the Sunshine Act. Despite the urging of several federal agencies, <em>see Common Cause, supra, </em>674 F.2d at 929, Congress refused to amend the Sunshine bill to include an exemption similar to the \u201cpredecisional memorandum\u201d exemption found in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) (1982). The Supreme Court had held that FOIA\u2019s \u201cpredecisional memoranda\u201d exemption incorporates an exemption for the attorney-client privilege. <em>See NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 154, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1518, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1974). By refusing to insert the FOIA exemption in the Sunshine Act, Congress also refused to include a full-fledged attorney-client privilege exemption.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> For the same reason, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>FTC v. Grolier Inc., </em>462 U.S. 19, 103 S.Ct. 2209, 76 L.Ed.2d 387 (1983), is misplaced. In <em>Grolier </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the precise FOIA exemption Congress refused to make a part of the Sunshine Act. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 103 S.Ct. at 2210-11. Regardless of the persuasiveness of Justice Brennan\u2019s analysis of the attorney-client privilege in <em>Grolier, </em>the case now before this court does not concern that privilege. The <em>Grolier </em>analysis cannot effectively illuminate the contours of the Sunshine Act\u2019s Exemption 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The majority is also reluctant to adopt my reading of Exemption 10 because it finds it unlikely \u201cthat Congress would have written an express temporal limitation into Exemption 9 and yet have intended a similar (unwritten) limitation to apply to Exemption 10.\u201d Maj. op. at 501. But Exemption 9 does not truly contain any \u201cexpress temporal limitation.\u201d That exemption protects certain information \u201cthe premature disclosure of which\u201d would harm certain financial interests or frustrate proposed agency action. The words \u201cpremature disclosure\u201d are words of definition \u2014 they describe the material to be protected by the exemption. They do not, on their face, impose a time limit. Exemption 9 does not expressly say that after disclosure of such information would no longer be harmful the agency must release the no-longer-sensitive material. Such an <em>inference </em>is entirely reasonable, of course, especially in view of the legislative history of the Act. <em>See Senate Report </em>at 32. But it is nonetheless an inference rather than an express provision. The absence of temporal words of definition in Exemption 10 does not bar the same kind of inference for that exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The majority maintains, however, that the legislative history of the Act refers to time limits only for Exemption 9. For that proposition the majority quotes a portion of this passage from the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">[A] meeting will be closed because it involves matters which are sensitive at the time, such as the regulation of finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>cial institutions, that would cause financial speculation if disclosed prematurely. Later, however, the discussion\u2019s sensitive nature may disappear. An agency must then publicly release the record of its meeting at a later date when [the exemption] no longer applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><em>Senate Report </em>at 32, quoted in part in maj. op. at 502. Admittedly, the only explicit reference in this passage is to a matter covered by Exemption 9. But the language of the passage (\u201csuch as\u201d) is clearly exemplary, rather than exhaustive. It applies to any discussion whose \u201csensitive nature may disappear,\u201d not only to those discussions covered by Exemption 9. The passage is entirely consistent with the conclusion that Congress intended such a time limit to apply to Exemption 10 as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Senate Report makes the intent behind the exemption clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">To fall within the provisions of [the litigation exemption] the discussion must concern a particular case of adjudication. If the agency discusses a particular series of cases, each of which meets the requirements of [the exemption], the meeting may also be closed. The [exemption] would not apply when an agency discusses its adjudication policies in general, such as the policy that should be adopted towards all those that may violate a particular law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\"><em>Senate Report </em>at 26. Leaving aside any hypothetical chilling effects, once the \u201cparticular case\u201d under discussion in a closed meeting has been resolved, the agency no longer has any information to protect other than its discussion of \u201cadjudication policies in general.\u201d This is the sort of discussion that Congress explicitly refused to allow agencies to carry on in secret. In any event, neither FERC nor the majority suggest that any such general litigation policies are involved here. We are left to wonder what it is that FERC feels must be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In the process of reading out of Exemption 10 any time limit on withholding litigation meeting transcripts, the majority also extends the exemption to cover policy deliberations conducted in conjunction with litigation strategy. Although the panel opinion did not reach this complicated issue, I must disagree with the majority nevertheless. Exemption 10 should have only limited applicability to general policy deliberations that occur in the course of formulating Strategy in pending litigation. Unquestionably, as the majority observes, it is not \u201cunusual for a discussion focused on litigation tactics to lead a party to modify its substantive position.\u201d Maj. op. at 502. But that is not an argument for keeping the discussion secret beyond the time necessary to protect the agency\u2019s position in the pending litigation. On the contrary, given the Sunshine Act\u2019s unequivocal congressional command for openness in government, the inevitable entanglement of general policy discussion and legal strategizing argues in favor of a time limit on Exemption 10. Although the Sunshine Act would not demand <em>immediate </em>disclosure of a substantive change in policy if that disclosure would damage the agency\u2019s litigation position, the public retains a powerful interest in ultimately knowing how and why that substantive policy change came about. Exemption 10 should shield what would otherwise be public only to the extent necessary to protect litigation strategy. The majority correctly notes that there is no evidence of \u201csubterfuge\u201d in FERC's policy reversal. But the agency\u2019s intent should not be determinative; good faith is no substitute for full disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">As I noted in the panel opinion, 775 F.2d 359, 364-65 (D.C.Cir.1985), <em>vacated, </em>788 F.2d 762 (D.C.Cir.1986) <em>(per </em>curiam), it is important to point out that Exemption 10 does not vanish in every case the moment the underlying litigation draws to a close. Some matters may be discussed in the course of a particular litigation the disclosure of which would thwart effective litigation in other cases. Revelation of an agency\u2019s strategy for a series of similar cases, for example, could have a debilitating ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>feet on the agency\u2019s overall litigation policy. <em>See Senate Report </em>at 26. But topics that transcend any single litigation certainly will be less common than more specific topics. The transcript Clark-Cowlitz seeks to obtain here contains nothing that will hinder FERC by its disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the case to that court with instructions to order the Commission to release to the public the transcript of the April 25th meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> This is not to suggest, of course, that Congress did not exempt certain types of predecisional discussions from the effects of the Sunshine Act. Exemption 10, for example, clearly encompasses some such discussions. Nonetheless, in light of the explicit refusal of Congress to include an exemption that would have fully embraced the attorney-client privilege, the majority\u2019s analogy between Exemption 10 and the attorney-client privilege seems particularly inapt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
