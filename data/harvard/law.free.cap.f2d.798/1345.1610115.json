Quarles is an oil and gas contractor with mobile drilling units at sites throughout the western United States. Crenshaw was hired by Quarles as a drilling equipment mechanic on September 16, 1980. Crenshaw and Quarles agreed that Crenshaw would be responsible for routine maintenance and emergency repairs of Quarles\u2019 drilling equipment located at various sites. Crenshaw was provided with a company truck equipped with a tool carrier and a mobile telephone to travel to these sites. The parties agreed that Crenshaw would be paid a biweekly gross salary of $1,707.69, a figure which was subsequently raised to $1,793.08 on April 10, 1981. In 1983, Crenshaw filed this suit for overtime compensation, liquidated damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs for the period from September 16, 1980 to June 30, 1981, and from October 1, 1981 to April 30, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-18\">The district court awarded Crenshaw $34,082.85 in overtime compensation and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Quarles appeals the determination that a <em>Belo </em>contract was in effect between the parties, the selection of the three-year stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>ute of limitations, the award of liquidated damages, and the district court\u2019s calculation of the number of hours worked by Crenshaw. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">The FLSA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-8\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for \u25a0 commerce, for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). This general rule does not apply when the elements of \u00a7 207(f) of the FLSA, governing so-called <em>Belo </em>contracts, are present.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, Quarles argued that a <em>Belo </em>contract was in effect. R. Vol. I, pp. 36-37. The district court held that there was a <em>Belo </em>contract and the \u00a7 207(f) exception applied. R. Vol. I, p. 67. On appeal, Quarles now argues that there was no <em>Belo </em>contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">At the outset, we acknowledge the general rule against allowing a party to argue a legal position on appeal contrary to that argued at trial. 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4477 (1981). This is an equitable prohibition, <em>Richardson v. Turner, </em>716 F.2d 1059, 1061 n. 2 (4th Cir.1983), that we will not apply when \u201cexceptional cases or particular circumstances\u201d demand that we consider a question of law raised on appeal. <em>Cf. Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S.Ct. 719, 721, 722, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1941). In the present case, we are presented with the unusual situation where <em>both </em>parties argued at trial that a <em>Belo </em>contract existed. The applicability of the <em>Belo </em>contract exception was a crucial issue at trial that was argued extensively by both parties. Therefore, this is not an instance where the issue was not raised below. Crenshaw is not now prejudiced by being asked to address a question that was not considered at trial. Crenshaw argued at trial that a <em>Belo </em>contract had been established, and he makes the same argument on appeal. Under these particular circumstances, we do not find it equitable to apply the rule against inconsistent positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-14\">The elements of the \u00a7 207(f) exception were described in <em>Donovan v. Brown Equipment and Service Tools, Inc., </em>666 F.2d 148, 153 (5th Cir.1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-15\">First, the duties of the employee must \u201cnecessitate irregular hours of work.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(f). Second, the employee must be employed pursuant to a bona fide individual contract or collective bargaining agreement. <em>Id. </em>Third, that contract must \u201cspecif[y] a regular rate of pay\u201d for hours up to forty and one and one-half times that rate for hours over forty. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 207(f)(1). Finally, the contract must provide a weekly pay guarantee for not more than sixty hours, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>based on the specified rates. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 207(f)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">An employment agreement comes within the \u00a7 207(f) exception only if <em>each </em>of the elements is present in a particular case. <em>Brown, </em>666 F.2d at 153. Two of the elements are in dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">A <em>Belo </em>contract must specify a \u201cregular rate of pay.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(f). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u201cregular rate\u201d of pay to mean \u201cthe hourly rate actually paid for the normal, non-overtime workweek.\u201d <em>Walling v. Helmerich and Payne, Inc., </em>323 U.S. 37, 40, 65 S.Ct. 11, 40, 89 L.Ed. 29 (1944). We applied this definition in <em>Triple \u201cAAA \u201d Company, Inc. v. Wirtz, </em>378 F.2d 884 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 959, 88 S.Ct. 338, 19 L.Ed.2d 364 (1967). In <em>Triple \u201cAAA \u201d, </em>an employer argued that the semi-monthly salary paid to its employees had provided compensation at a specified hourly rate that included overtime compensation for hours in excess of forty hours per week. We rejected this argument as \u201cnothing more than after-the-fact computations,\u201d concluding that \u201can underlying agreement ... relating to the regular rate is crucial when an employer pays a flat monthly salary for an average work week of more than forty hours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 886-87. <em>Accord Brennan v. Elmer\u2019s Disposal Service, Inc., </em>510 F.2d 84, 87 (9th Cir.1975); <em>Nunn\u2019s Battery &amp; Electric Co. v. Goldberg, </em>298 F.2d 516, 519 (5th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">At trial, Crenshaw insisted that he did not know the number of hours upon which his. salary was based. R. Vol. II, pp. 58-59. The chief mechanic, however, who had hired Crenshaw to work for Quarles testified that he had told Crenshaw that his salary would be based on a sixty-hour work week. R. Vol. II, pp. 98-99. The district court resolved this factual dispute by adopting Quarles\u2019 assertion that the parties had agreed to a sixty-hour work week based on forty hours at a regular hourly rate and twenty hours at one and one-half times the regular rate. R. Def. Ex. 2, p. 5. We find support for this determination in the record and do not find it to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">The employment agreement here comes within the \u00a7 207(f) exception only if there are \u201cirregular hours of work.\u201d Crenshaw\u2019s work hours fluctuated substantially during the period under consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fluctuating hours, however, are not necessarily \u201cirregular hours.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-13\">\u201c[T]he term, \u2018irregular hours of work,\u2019 does not mean merely a fluctuating long workweek, consisting only or mostly of variations in the hours required <em>over </em>forty. For hours to be considered irregular within the meaning of section [20]7(f), they must, in a <em>significant </em>number of weeks, fluctuate <em>both </em>below forty hours per week as well as above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-14\"><em>Brown, </em>666 F.2d at 154 (emphasis added). <em>Accord Donovan v. Tierra Vista, Inc., </em>796 F.2d 1259 (10th Cir.1986); <em>Donovan v. McKissick Products Co., </em>719 F.2d 350 (10th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1215, 104 S.Ct. 2657, 81 L.Ed.2d 363.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>the \u00a7 207(f) exception applies, we must conclude as a matter of law that there were a \u201csignificant\u201d number of weeks during which Crenshaw worked fewer than forty hours. <em>Cf. Brown, </em>666 F.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">The district court did not consider the number of weeks in which Crenshaw worked fewer than forty hours. The parties stipulated before trial that their employment agreement anticipated that the number of hours Crenshaw would work \u201cwould by necessity fluctuate from week to week.\u201d R. Vol. I, p. 19. The district court apparently believed that this satisfied the \u201cirregular hours\u201d requirement of \u00a7 207(f). Although both parties argued at trial that a <em>Belo </em>contract was in effect, neither party sought to prove the \u201cirregular hours\u201d element necessary to find a <em>Belo </em>contract under \u00a7 207(f). The district court erred in holding that \u00a7 207(f) applied without considering whether Crenshaw had in fact worked \u201cirregular hours\u201d during the, course of his employment by Quarles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">The number of hours that Crenshaw worked each week is included in the record because that information was needed to calculate the amount of overtime compensation due. The record, therefore, allows us to resolve this legal question of whether Crenshaw worked \u201cirregular hours\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 207(f). We have determined that there were only eight weeks in which Crenshaw worked fewer than forty hours out of a total of 119 weeks of work, or 6.7% of the total.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is similar to the 6.9% figure found not to be \u201csignificant\u201d in <em>Brown. </em>666 F.2d at 154. We hold that the number of weeks that Crenshaw worked fewer than forty hours is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of \u201cirregular hours\u201d in the \u00a7 207(f) exception and thus this employment agreement is not a <em>Belo </em>contract. Quarles is therefore liable under \u00a7 207(a) for overtime compensation due to Crenshaw. We remand to the district court for a determination of the amount of overtime compensation owed to Crenshaw pursuant to the method described in <em>Triple \u201cAAA\u201d, </em>378 F.2d at 887.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">We are also presented with several challenges to the decision of the district court regarding the number of hours for which compensation is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-14\">A two-year statute of limitations is generally applicable to actions to recover unpaid overtime compensation under the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). A three-year statute of limitations applies when a \u201cwillful violation\u201d of the Act has occurred. <em>Id. </em>We have held that \u201ca violation is willful if the employer knew or should have known of an appreciable possibility that the employees involved were covered by the Act.\u201d <em>Donovan v. M &amp; M Wrecker Service, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>733 F.2d 83, 85 (10th Cir.1984). <em>See also McKissick Products Co., </em>719 F.2d at 354 (citations omitted) (a violation is willful if \u201cthe employer knew that the Act was \u2018in the picture\u2019 and was aware of the Act\u2019s possible application to his employees\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">The district court concluded that Quarles should have been aware of the appreciable possibility that the overtime provisions of the FLSA applied to Quarles\u2019 employees. The record supports this finding. William Morton, the tax manager for Quarles, testified that he believed Crenshaw should have been paid overtime compensation for any hours worked above sixty hours in a particular week. Def. Ex. 2, p. 17; <em>see </em>R. Vol. I, p. 64. Crenshaw was required to provide time records for Quarles throughout much of the period in question. R. Vol. I, p. 64. These time records showed that Crenshaw frequently worked more than sixty hours in a week. R. Vol. III, PI. Ex. 57. Therefore, Quarles should have known that it owed overtime compensation to Crenshaw. Failure to pay such compensation was a willful violation of the statute, so the district court correctly applied the three-year statute of limitations under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">The time that Crenshaw spent traveling to his job sites was included by the district court in calculating the time for which overtime compensation is due. The Portal-to-Portal Act (codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 216[b], 251-262) excludes from overtime compensation time spent \u201ctraveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity\u201d of an employee and time spent in \u201cactivities which are preliminary or postliminary\u201d to the principal activity. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(a). This section has been interpreted not to prohibit overtime compensation when active duties are performed during travel time. <em>D A &amp; S Oil Well Servicing, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>262 F.2d 552 (10th Cir.1958); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.7(d). In <em>D A &amp; S, </em>we held that employees who transported equipment needed to service producing oil wells must be compensated for their travel time. We emphasized that each case involving compensation for travel time \u201cmust be decided upon its peculiar facts.\u201d <em>D A &amp; S Oil Well Servicing, Inc., </em>262 F.2d at 554-55. We added, however, that \u201cemployees who transport equipment without which well servicing could not be done, are performing an activity which is so closely related to the work which they and the other employees perform, that it must be considered an integral and indispensable part of their principal activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555. <em>See Steiner v. Mitchell, </em>350 U.S. 247, 256, 76 S.Ct. 330, 335, 100 L.Ed. 267 (1956) (adopting the \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-9\">The district court here found that travel was an indispensable part of Crenshaw\u2019s job. We agree. Quarles provided Crenshaw with a specially equipped truck containing many of the tools that he needed to service drilling rigs scattered across several states. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that time spent travelling to and from drill sites in this truck was compensable under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-11\">The district court included meal periods in calculating the time for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>overtime compensation is due. The Portal-to-Portal Act does not affect meal periods during the work day because it only applies to activities which take place either before or after a complete work day. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254. The administrative interpretation of the Act correctly recognizes that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 \u201cplays no part in determining whether ... a [meal] period ... is or is not compensable.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.6(b). The evidence suggests that Crenshaw often ate hurriedly due to the nature of his work. <em>See e.g., </em>R. Vol. II, p. 46. Under the circumstances in this case, we find that meal periods were properly included in the determination of hours worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">The district court\u2019s findings of fact indicate that Crenshaw worked between 40 and 48 hours per week from the last week of September, 1980 until approximately December 1, 1980. R. Vol. I, pp. 64-65. The district court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, state that Crenshaw worked 72 hours per week between September 16, 1980 and January 9, 1981. R. Vol. I, p. 69. The two determinations are irreconcilable. We remand for a decision regarding the number of hours Crenshaw worked between the last week of September, 1980 and December 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">The FLSA provides for an award of liquidated damages in an amount equal to unpaid overtime compensation. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b). The only instance where a court may exercise discretion in not awarding liquidated damages is when an employer shows that its action was in good faith and that it had reasonable grounds for believing the failure to pay overtime compensation was not a violation of the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court concluded that Quarles had not met its burden of demonstrating good faith. <em>See Sinclair v. Automobile Club of Oklahoma, Inc., </em>733 F.2d 726, 730 (10th Cir.1984). Quarles apparently believed that it was not in violation of the FLSA because it thought that its employment agreements came within the \u00a7 207(f) exception to the overtime requirements. But a misunderstanding of the requirements of the Act is not a reasonable ground under \u00a7 260. <em>See Sinclair, </em>733 F.2d at 730. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding liquidated damages. We remand, however, for a recalculation of the amount of liquidated damages in light of the recalculation of the amount of overtime compensation due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">. The Supreme Court approved an employment agreement establishing a fixed weekly salary for irregular weekly hours in <em>Walling v. A.H. Belo Corp., </em>316 U.S. 624, 62 S.Ct. 1223, 86 L.Ed. 1716 (1942). Congress subsequently codified the principles of <em>Belo </em>in what is now 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-12\">No employer shall be deemed to have violated subsection (a) of this section by employing any employee for a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such employee under subsection (a) of this section if such employee is employed pursuant to a bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to an agreement made as a result of collective bargaining by representatives of employees, if the duties of such employee necessitate irregular hours of work, and the contract or agreement (1) specifies a regular rate of pay of not less than the minimum hourly rate provided in subsection (a) or (b) of section 206 of this title (whichever may be applicable) and compensation at not less than one and one-half times such rate for all hours worked in excess of such maximum workweek, and (2) provides a weekly guaranty of pay for not more than sixty hours based on the rates so specified.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1438-8\">. For example, on one occasion Crenshaw worked 61 hours in one week and 119 hours in the following week. R. Vol. III, PI. Ex. 57, p. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1438-9\">. The requirement of finding that less than forty hours were worked in a \"significant\u201d number of weeks is essential to the purpose of the FLSA. Overtime pay is designed (1) to encourage employers to hire additional workers rather than demand longer hours from present employees and (2) to compensate employees for working longer hours if they choose to do so. <em>McKissick Products Co., </em>719 F.2d at 352. The \u00a7 207(f) exception protects employees whose jobs involve a fluctuating number of hours from week to week. The regular rate of pay for irregular hours provides a stable income to an employee even when there was little work to be performed in a particular week. <em>Brown, </em>666 F.2d at 154. But when the fluctuation in hours only occurs in the overtime range \u2014 more than forty hours in a week \u2014 application of the \u00a7 207(f) exception serves only to excuse the employer from paying overtime compensation. <em>Foremost Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wirtz, </em>381 F.2d 653, 660-61 (5th Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 946, 88 S.Ct. 1031, 19 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1968). As the administrative interpretation of \u00a7 207\u00a9 states: \"Nothing in the legislative history of section 7(f) sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>gests any intent to suspend the normal application of the general overtime provisions of section 7(a) in situations where the weekly hours of an employee fluctuate only when overtime work in excess of the prescribed maximum weekly hours is performed.\" 29 C.F.R. \u00b6 778.-406.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">. The district court accepted Plaintiffs Exhibit 57 as an accurate representation of the number of hours worked by Crenshaw during those periods for which no records were kept. R. Vol. I, p. 64. This exhibit also summarizes the time sheets kept by Crenshaw during all other periods. It is from these records that we have determined the total number of weeks worked and the number of weeks when Crenshaw worked fewer than forty hours per week. Weeks during which vacation time was taken are not included in either total, for they are not relevant in ascertaining \u201cirregular hours of work.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>666 F.2d at 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1439-16\">. We add to the discussion in <em>Triple </em>\"AAA\"only because Quarles has misconstrued the formula. Brief of Appellant at 9. The hourly \"regular rate\u201d of compensation is determined by dividing the weekly salary by the number of hours of work that the salary was <em>intended </em>to compensate, not the average number of hours Crenshaw actually worked. Quarles has paid Crenshaw the \"regular rate\u201d for those hours the salary was intended to compensate. Quarles now owes Crenshaw compensation in the amount of one-half the hourly rate for those overtime hours the salary was intended to compensate and one and one-half the hourly rate for those hours worked beyond what the salary was intended to compensate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">. We are aware that the Supreme Court disapproved this standard for willfulness in the context of the liquidated damages provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in <em>Trans World Airlines v. Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 128, 105 S.Ct. 613, 625, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). The Court in <em>Thurston </em>believed that such a \"broad\u201d standard was inappropriate because it \u201cwould result in an award of double damages in almost every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But the Court carefully left open the question of the appropriate standard for the statute of limitations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-12\">A statute of limitations does not operate as a penalty against a defendant, unlike an award of liquidated damages. The First Circuit relied on this distinction in holding that <em>Thurston </em>does not effect the willfulness standard for the statute of limitations. <em>EEOC v. McCarthy, </em>768 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1985); <em>Secretary of Labor </em>v. <em>Daylight Dairy Products, Inc., </em>779 F.2d 784 (1st Cir.1985). We agree with the First Circuit, and we continue to hold that the willfulness standard stated in <em>M &amp; M Wrecker, </em>733 F.2d at 85 determines which statute of limitations applies under the FLSA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1441-9\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-10\">In any action commenced prior to or on or after May 14, 1947 to recover unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime compensation, or liquidated damages, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq.], if the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages or award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216 of this title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
