For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">A. <em>The Federal Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The instant appeal arises out of conflicting state and federal approaches to the problem of foster care. In response to demonstrated inadequacies in our nation\u2019s system of foster care, <em>see generally </em>125 Cong.Rec. S29938 (daily ed. Oct. 29, 1979) (remarks of Sen. Cranston), Congress enacted Pub.L. No. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), signed into law by President Carter on June 17, 1980. The Act amended Title IV of the Social Security Act and sought to provide the states with fiscal incentives to encourage a more active and systematic monitoring of children in the foster care system. In particular, the Act amended the Title IV-B program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 620-628, which provides funds to the states for the improvement of child welfare services, and created the Title IV-E program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670-676, which provides reimbursement to the states for foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments made by the states on behalf of eligible children.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">In amending Title IV-B, Congress authorized annual appropriations of $266 million \u201c[f]or the purpose of ... establishing, extending, and strengthening child welfare services----\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 620(a). Of this $266 million, each state would receive a proportionate share of the initial $141 million appropriation. For a state to receive its share of any funds appropriated in excess of $141 million, the Act provides that the state must certify, <em>inter alia, </em>that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-17\">(2) has implemented and is operating to the satisfaction of the Secretary\u2014 ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-18\">(B) a case review system (as defined in section 675(5) of this title) for each child receiving foster care under the supervision of the State____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 627(a). Section 675(5) of the Act defines \u201ccase review system\u201d as a procedure for assuring that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-20\">(B) the status of each child is reviewed periodically but no less frequently than once every six months by either a court or by administrative review (as defined in paragraph (6)) in order to determine the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement, the extent of compliance with the case plan, and the extent of progress which has been made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster care, and to project a likely date by which the child may be returned to the home or place for adoption or legal guardianship, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(C) with respect to each such child, procedural safeguards will be applied, among other things, to assure each child in foster care under the supervision of the State of a dispositional hearing to be held, in a family or juvenile court or another court (including a tribal court) of competent jurisdiction, or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court, no later than eighteen months after the original placement (and periodically thereafter during the continuation of foster care), which hearing shall determine the future status of the child (including, but not limited to, whether the child should be returned to the parent, should be continued in foster care for a specified period, should be placed for adoption, or should (because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances) be continued in foster care on a permanent or long-term basis); and procedural safeguards shall also be applied with respect to parental rights pertaining to the removal of the child from the home of his parents, to a change in the child\u2019s placement, and to any determination affecting visitation privileges of parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">As is evident from the statute, and more particularly, its legislative history, <em>see, e.g., </em>125 Cong.Rec. S22685 (daily ed. Aug. 3, 1979) (remarks of Sen. Cranston), Congress afforded the states considerable flexibility to develop administrative procedures compatible with their own unique foster care circumstances. Despite this general flexibility, however, Congress insisted that any state requesting excess funds satisfy certain minimum requirements. First, within six months after a child's placement in foster care, and at least once every six months thereafter for the duration of his or her stay, the Act mandates that a status review be conducted, either by a state court or by an impartial state administrative body. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(B). Second, with respect to children still in foster care after eighteen months, the Act requires that a court or court appointed body hold periodic dispositional hearings to determine the child\u2019s future status. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 675(5)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">B. <em>Vermont\u2019s Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Prior to the Act\u2019s passage, Vermont\u2019s statutory foster care procedures provided that, at the request of certain persons or agencies, the state\u2019s attorney \u201cshall prepare and file a petition [with the juvenile court] alleging that a child is in need of care or supervision.\u201d Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 645 (1981). Thereafter, the juvenile court was required to hold a hearing and issue an order containing its findings with respect to the allegations in the petition. If the court found that the child was in need of care or supervision, the court was required to continue the hearing for the purpose of \u201cconsidering the disposition to be made in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 654(b). The court was empowered to place the child in foster care and terminate the parental rights of the child\u2019s parents and transfer those rights to an individual, agency, or institution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 656(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">When a court ordered placement in foster care, Vermont law required that the court\u2019s dispositional order be reviewed \u201ctwo years from the date [it was] entered and each two years thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 658(a). That review would include a juvenile court hearing only if a party to the initial dispositional hearing so requested, or if the court in its own discretion so ordered. In those cases where the juvenile court\u2019s dispositional order terminated parental rights, Vermont law did not require that the disposition of the child\u2019s situation be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">After passage of the federal Act, the Vermont legislature amended the state\u2019s foster care procedures in order to render the state eligible to receive the additional Title IV-B federal funds. The most significant changes included shortening the time for review of the juvenile court\u2019s dispositional order placing a child in foster care from two years to eighteen months, and requiring that review of the dispositional order include a hearing by the juvenile court or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court. Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 658 (1985 Supp.). The amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>procedures did not, however, require any dispositional review for children whose parents had had their parental rights terminated (\u201cTPR\u201d children), even if such a child remained in foster care after termination. Vermont conceded in the district court that a dispositional hearing for a TPR child who remains in foster care is undertaken (after the initial hearing) only if the juvenile court, in its discretion, orders or conducts such a hearing, or if adoption proceedings are initiated in the probate court with respect to that child.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">C. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ar8\">In fiscal year 1981, the first year for which the Act was applicable, states were instructed to declare their eligibility for the additional Title IV-B funds by a statement of self-certification. Vermont submitted its self-certification on July 29,1981, attesting to the fact that it was in compliance with the Act\u2019s procedures. That self-certification was accepted by the Secretary\u2019s agent, the Acting Commissioner of the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (\u201cACYF\u201d). Accordingly, for fiscal year 1981, Vermont received $346,872 in additional Title IV-B funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In April of 1982, all states, including Vermont, were informed that their self-certifications would be subject to a verification review by ACYF to assure compliance with the Act. During the course of its review, ACYF discovered that Vermont did not have procedures to assure periodic dispositional hearings for TPR children and in fact had not been providing such hearings. On August 12, 1983, ACYF\u2019s Acting Commissioner notified Vermont that it had failed to satisfy the requirements of the Act for fiscal year 1981 in three respects. The Commissioner\u2019s notice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">[Sjince Vermont did not provide dispositional hearings for TPR children in Fiscal Year 1981, the State failed to meet the requirements of section 427 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 627].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">In addition to the failure to provide dis-positional hearings for TPR children, Vermont failed to meet the requirements of section 427 on two other grounds____ In Fiscal Year 1981, Vermont law stated that \u201cevery order transferring legal custody or guardianship over the person shall be reviewed <em>two years from, the date </em>entered____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 658(a) (1981). Thus, contrary to the requirements of section 475(5)(C), State law did not require dispositional hearings within 18 months of each child\u2019s original placement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-14\">In Fscal Year 1981, State law provided that any person to whom legal custody or guardianship has been transferred must file a notice of biennial review with the court before whom [sic] the proceeding was held, the State\u2019s attorney and all parties to the proceeding. Vermont law also stated that \u201c(w)ithin 20 days of such notice, any such party may file a request for a hearing with the court, or the court on its own motion may order a hearing____ <em>In the event that no such hearing is requested or ordered, an order shall be deemed </em>reviewed____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 658(c) (1981). The State law thus did not make dispositional hearings mandatory. Consequently, Vermont law did not meet the requirements of section 475(5)(C) and the State failed to comply with section 427.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">On August 23, 1983, Vermont filed an appeal with GAB, which upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination. GAB, however, addressed only Vermont\u2019s failure to provide periodic dispositional hearings to TPR children; it specifically declined to reach the two additional issues discussed in the ACYF Commissioner\u2019s decision. In October of 1984, Vermont petitioned for review of GAB\u2019s decision in the district court. Following cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge Billings granted Vermont\u2019s motion and denied that of the Secretary, reasoning that Vermont law, as interpreted by the state itself, did provide TPR children with appropriate dispositional hearings. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>reversing GAB\u2019s decision, Judge Billings did not confine himself to the sole issue ruled upon by GAB; instead, he discussed and rejected the other two grounds for ineligibility cited by the ACYF Commissioner but not passed upon by GAB. From that decision, the Secretary now appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The threshold question for our determination concerns the applicable standard of review. Before the district court, the parties agreed that GAB\u2019s decision could only be set aside if it was determined to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In light of intervening Supreme Court decisions, <em>Bennett v. New Jersey, </em>470 U.S. 632, 105 S.Ct. 1555, 84 L.Ed.2d 572 (1985); <em>Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education, </em>470 U.S. 656, 105 S.Ct. 1544, 84 L.Ed.2d 590 (1985), Judge Billings suggested that the standard applicable to a review of compliance with a restrictive grant program was the less deferential substantial evidence test. The issue was not firmly decided, however, since Judge Billings concluded that GAB\u2019s decision could not withstand either standard. Assuming, without deciding, that the substantial evidence standard governs GAB\u2019s decision, we nonetheless conclude that the decision was properly supported and therefore must be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In rejecting GAB\u2019s determination that Vermont \u201cfailed to provide procedures for assuring periodic dispositional hearings for TPR children,\u201d Judge Billings found that \u201cthe Secretary relied not upon her agency\u2019s interpretation of an applicable federal statute, but upon her agency\u2019s interpretation of Vermont statutes and procedures.\u201d <em>State of Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, </em>No. 84-325 slip op. at 13 (D.Vt. Aug. 28, 1985). According to Judge Billings, these state procedures \u201csatisfied the guidelines of Section 675.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Moreover, Judge Billings was unable to \u201cdiscern any way that the decision of the Secretary comported with the dictates of the federal statute[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>and concluded that the decision was without justification. We disagree. In our view, the district court\u2019s reliance on Vermont\u2019s statutory scheme was erroneous; section 658(b) of the Vermont statute simply does not apply to TPR children, and therefore falls short of the federal mandate that <em>every </em>child in foster care receive a periodic dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">On appeal, Vermont maintains that its 1981 statutory foster care procedures comply with the federal Act\u2019s dispositional hearing requirement in three ways. As discussed below, we find all of its arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">First, Vermont contends that its statute, Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 658, satisfies the federal requirement that dispositional hearings be held periodically for all foster care children. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">(a) Unless otherwise specified therein an order under the authority of this chapter transferring legal custody, or guardianship over the person or residual parental rights and responsibilities of a child to an individual, agency, or institution shall be for an indeterminate period and provided further that, every order transferring legal custody or guardianship over the person shall he reviewed two years from the date entered and each two years thereafter. In no event shall any such order remain in force or effect beyond a person\u2019s twenty-first birthday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">(b) Any person to whom legal custody or guardianship over the person has been transferred shall thereafter file a notice of biennial review with the court before whom [sic] such proceeding was held, the state\u2019s attorney having jurisdiction, and all parties to the proceeding, and, in addition, shall file with such court and such state\u2019s attorney a report and recommendation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>(c) Within 20 days of such notice, any such party may file a request for a hearing with the court, or the court on its own motion may order a hearing. Within 30 days after any such request or order, a hearing shall be held for the purpose of considering the review of the order of disposition, which hearing shall be held in all respects as a hearing on a petition under this chapter, except that in such a hearing, all evidence helpful in determining the questions presented, including oral and written reports, may be admitted and relied upon to the extent of its probative value, even though not competent in a hearing on a petition. In the event that no such hearing is requested or ordered, an order shall be deemed reviewed within the meaning of subsection (a), and shall remain in force for a period of two years after the expiration of the time within which a hearing could have been requested, without the entry of an additional order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 658(a)-(c) (1981). The central failing in this statutory provision is found in Vermont\u2019s concession in the district court that section 658 hearings are merely discretionary in the case of TPR children. The language of section 675(5)(C) of the federal Act, however, is clear in extending to <em>\u201ceach </em>child in foster care under the supervision of the State\u201d the protection of periodic dispositional hearings. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(C) (emphasis added). Moreover, the legislative history amply demonstrates that section 675(5)(C) requires dispositional hearings for <em>all </em>foster care children. The central purpose of the legislation was to remove children from long-term foster care, either by reuniting them with their parents or by placing them with adoptive parents or in some other permanent arrangement. In introducing the Senate version of the bill in 1979, Senator Cranston made clear the need for dispositional hearings to be held at specific intervals after a child\u2019s placement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">[T]he provision for a dispositional hearing after a set period of time is, I believe, of critical importance. One of the prime weaknesses of our existing fostercare system is that, once a child enters the system and remains in it for even a few months, the child is likely to become \u201clost\u201d in the system. Yearly judicial reviews of the child\u2019s placement too often become perfunctory exercises with little or no focus upon the difficult question of what the child\u2019s future placement should be. Foster care, with few exceptions, should be a temporary placement; unfortunately, under our existing system, temporary foster care becomes a permanent solution for far too many children. This provision requiring a dispositional hearing after a child has been in foster care for a specific period of time should assist States in making the difficult, but critical, decisions regarding a foster child\u2019s long-term placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">125 Cong.Rec. S22684 (daily ed. Aug. 3, 1979); <em>see also </em>H.Rep. No. 136, 96th Cong. 1st sess. 50 (1979) (remarks of Rep. Ullman).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Contrary to Vermont\u2019s assertion, nothing in the Act excludes TPR children in foster care from the requirement of periodic dis-positional hearings. Indeed, this was the specific conclusion of an American Bar Association study:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">Children who are still in foster care following termination of parental rights proceedings or following voluntary surrender of parental rights are also covered by the dispositional hearing requirement [of the Act]. Until they are actually placed for adoption or guardianship, they are still in state supervised foster care and, thus are entitled to a dispositional hearing under the explicit language of the act. Further, as a practical matter court involvement may be necessary to insure [sic] that a plan is being implemented \u2014 for example, that adoptive parents are being sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">American Bar Association, <em>Comparative Study of State Case Review System Phase II: Dispositional Hearings </em>(1984), volume 3, at 2-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Judge Billings acknowledged that no dispositional hearing is held after the termination of parental rights, but con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>sidered that fact of no moment, noting that \u201c[i]t comports with neither the federal statute nor common sense to require an additional initial dispositional hearing.\u201d Slip op. at 16. Apparently, Judge Billings based this conclusion on his view that a termination of parental rights was in fact a \u201cdisposition\u201d after which no further hearings would be necessary. That finding, however, misperceives the very purpose of the Act, <em>viz., </em>to assure all children periodic hearings until a <em>final </em>disposition is effected. Since the mere termination of parental rights does not serve to remove a child from the foster care system, Judge Billings erred in concluding that TPR children required no further dispositional hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Neither are we persuaded by Vermont\u2019s contention that its state adoption procedures, which impose a requirement of a probate court hearing prior to adoption approvals, constitute dispositional hearings that satisfy the requirements of section 675(5)(C). Significantly, probate court intervention does not occur unless and until adoption proceedings have been commenced. Clearly, TPR children who are not fortunate enough to be considered for adoption never will receive such a hearing. And, as Vermont concedes, if an adoption plan fails to materialize or progress, no judicial hearing will be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In addition, it is clear to us that, contrary to Vermont\u2019s assertion, the six-month case reviews required by section 675(5)(B) of the Act do not, of their own accord, satisfy the more stringent dispositional hearing requirement of section 675(5)(C). Even the most cursory comparison reveals that the requirements of section 675(5)(C) are far more demanding than those of the six-month case reviews contemplated by section 675(5)(B). For example, there is no requirement that the section 675(5)(B) review be held before a court or court-approved body. Moreover, the six-month review is designated merely to \u201cproject a likely date\u201d by which a permanent arrangement will be made, while the section 675(5)(C) hearing is held for the express purpose of determining the future status of the child. Finally, and perhaps most important, section 675(5)(C) mandates the application of \u201cprocedural safeguards,\u201d in order to protect a child\u2019s interest. No similar requirement is to be found in section 675(5)(B). There simply can be no question that the section 675(5)(C) hearing imposes an additional level of review, beyond that provided in section 675(5)(B), aimed at pressing a foster child\u2019s case to a permanent resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">We likewise reject Vermont's contention that a decision by the juvenile court to refrain from holding discretionary 659 hearings for a TPR child pursuant to Vt. Stat-Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 659 (1981)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> can reasonably be construed to amount to tacit approval of the results of the administrative reviews. GAB properly rejected this argument, finding that such a theory of posthoc approval did not fulfill the statutory requirement for a dispositional hearing \u201c \u2018in a family or juvenile court or another court ... of competent jurisdiction, or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court ... \u2019 since the State presented no evidence of any appointment or approval by the juvenile court authorizing the State to conduct dispositional hearings.\u201d GAB decision at 6 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(C)). Moreover, as GAB reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">[Tjhere is no indication in the record that the juvenile court judge was required to make, or even as a matter of practice made, any formal determination not to continue review hearings for a TPR child. Such a determination, depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>upon its content, might arguably be regarded as an appointment of the State to hold dispositional hearings. (However, judicial approval simply of the results of the State\u2019s six-month administrative reviews would not be sufficient since section 475(5)(C) [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(C)] requires approval of an \u201cadministrative body\u201d to conduct dispositional hearings.) We see no basis for implying merely from the absence of further review by the juvenile court judicial approval of the State to conduct dispositional hearings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In short, Vermont has failed to comply with the stringent requirements of section 675(5)(C). GAB therefore was correct in its decision finding Vermont ineligible for the 1981 Title IV-B funds and the district court erred in reversing that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the matter is remanded to the district court with instructions to enter an order affirming GAB\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">(a) An order of the court may be set aside by a subsequent order of this court or, upon appeal from a denial thereof by that court, by a court upon appeal therefrom, when it appears that the initial order was obtained by fraud or mistake sufficient therefor in a civil action, or that the court lacked jurisdiction over a necessary party or of the subject matter, or that newly discovered evidence so requires. An order of the court may also be amended, modified, set aside or terminated by that court at any time upon petition therefor by a party or on its own motion on the ground that changed circumstances so require in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 659(a) (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-17\">. In light of this disposition, it is unnecessary for \u00fas to address the additional argument advanced by the Secretary that the district court improperly decided issues which were not passed upon by GAB. Nor need we reach the contention of <em>amicus curiae </em>that the district court erred in finding that the Act did not require \"face-to-face\u201d hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
