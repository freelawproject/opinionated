He agreed to destroy his 1983 wheat crop, and the Department agreed to give him 61,476 bushels of wheat. After he had destroyed his crop, the Department informed him that there had been an error in the calculations and his payment was decreased to 39,121 bushels of wheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">After unsuccessfully exhausting their administrative remedies, plaintiffs filed suit in district court against the United States and various Department officials, suggesting several grounds for relief. The district judge concluded that, because all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims were \u201cgrounded in a basic claim of breach of contract,\u201d the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 1491, precluded district court jurisdiction. He transferred the entire action to the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Plaintiffs contend that the Claims Court\u2019s inability to grant the equitable relief they seek makes the transfer order a final decision appealable to this court. We disagree. For a decision to be final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, \u201cit ordinarily must dispose of the litigation on the merits.\u201d <em>Jesko v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 565, 567 (10th Cir.1983); <em>cf. Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (refusal to certify a class held not immediately appealable under this theory). The transfer order did not do this. Therefore \u00a7 1291 is not a basis for jurisdiction over this appeal. In addition, because the transfer order and the adequacy of relief granted by the Claims Court will be effectively reviewable on appeal from its final judgment, the collateral order exception set forth in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), does not permit immediate appeal. <em>See Jesko, </em>713 F.2d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-19\">As in <em>Jesko, </em>713 F.2d at 568, we are not convinced that <em>Goble v. Marsh, </em>684 F.2d 12, 14-15 (D.C.Cir.1982), supports plaintiffs\u2019 argument for an appeal in this court. In <em>Goble </em>the District of Columbia Circuit held that, when there is a possibility of concurrent jurisdiction between the district court and Claims Court, a transfer order \u201cbelongs in that small class of decisions\u201d that may be appealed immediately under the <em>Cohen </em>doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 14. We need not decide whether we would adopt the reasoning of <em>Goble </em>in this case because, although plaintiffs cite three statutes as support for concurrent jurisdiction, none sustains them.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-20\">First, plaintiffs contend that 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365 authorizes district court review of payment-in-kind determinations. That statute applies to farm marketing quotas, not to plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">Second, plaintiffs argue that the Administrative Procedure Act authorizes judicial review of the agency action. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. Although this is true, the Act further provides that the \u201cform of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>proceeding for judicial review is the special statutory review proceeding relevant to the subject matter in a court specified by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. The court \u201cspecified by statute\u201d when, as in this case, the United States is a defendant and the amount of the claim exceeds $10,000, is the Claims Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a)(1). Given this adequate remedy, we decline to interpret the Administrative Procedure Act as authorizing additional judicial review in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Third, plaintiffs urge us to find that the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, gave the district court jurisdiction. The exercise of mandamus jurisdiction is appropriate only when no other remedy could protect plaintiffs\u2019 interests. <em>See American Science and Engineering, Inc. v. Califano, </em>571 F.2d 58, 64 (1st Cir.1978). Here the action in the Claims Court and the availability of a timely appeal to the Federal Circuit from its final decision will protect plaintiffs\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 two remaining arguments in favor of appellate jurisdiction also must fail. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the order transferring their action was not equivalent to denial of an injunction. The district court did not reach the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, as it must to determine the need for an injunction. Thus 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) does not provide a basis for our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We also cannot obtain jurisdiction of this matter by issuing a writ of mandamus. In <em>In re Dalton, </em>733 F.2d 710, 716-18 (10th Cir.1984), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 947, 83 L.Ed.2d 959 (1985), we enumerated five guidelines to the propriety of mandamus relief. <em>See Varsic v. United States District Court, </em>607 F.2d 245, 250 (9th Cir.1979) (unlikely that all guidelines will ever point in same direction; balance of indicators may be required). None of the guidelines favors this extraordinary remedy here. In addition, plaintiffs failed to file a petition for the writ as required by Fed.R.App.P. 21(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s order transferring plaintiffs\u2019 case to the Claims Court is not appealable in this court. We DISMISS plaintiffs\u2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-12\">. This general transfer provision was enacted as part of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25, 55 (1982). It effectively subsumed a more specific repealed provision for transfers to the former Court of Claims, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c) (1976). <em>See </em>96 Stat. at 39; S.Rep. No. 275, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 11, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 11, 21. Therefore our prior case law interpreting \u00a7 1406(c) is instructive, if not controlling. <em>See Jesko v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 565 (10th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
