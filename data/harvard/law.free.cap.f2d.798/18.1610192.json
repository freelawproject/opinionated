BROWN, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In this appeal, George Collatos seeks review of his conviction of one count of perjury. He has raised three issues on appeal, none of which has sufficient merit to overturn his conviction. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\n<em>How it All Happened</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">In September of 1979, Collatos appeared as an immunized government witness at the extortion trial of Theodore Anzalone, an aide to former Mayor Kevin White of Boston. On cross-examination, Collatos suffered a severe \u201clapse of memory\u201d with regard to a clandestine meeting clearly set up by Anzalone\u2019s counsel and which Collatos had attended with Anzalone at La Bella\u2019s coffee shop in Boston\u2019s North End.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The content of that conversation formed the crux of Anzalone\u2019s defense. Collatos, the government\u2019s star witness, was thoroughly impeached by his \u201clack of recall\u201d on cross-examination and Anzalone was subsequently acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Six months after Anzalone\u2019s acquittal, Collatos was indicted for perjury. The indictment charged that Collatos falsely testified that he did not remember his critical meeting with Anzalone at La Bella\u2019s. Collatos was subsequently convicted of the charge against him, but he contends that his trial was tainted by three errors of the District Court. He first argues that the Court erred in treating the materiality of his statements as a question of law rather than as one of fact for jury determination. Second, he contends that the closing argument of the government constituted improper comment upon his silence at trial. Finally, he takes issue with the Court\u2019s refusal to include certain of his requested interrogatories in its voir dire of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">\n<em>Materiality: Law or Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">Collatos first asserts that the trial court erred in treating the issue of materiality as a question of law. Such an approach operates to deny him his right to a jury determination of all of the essential elements of the offense with which he was charged. Whatever the conceptual merit of this argument, it has long since been foreclosed by the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Sinclair v. United States, </em>279 U.S. 263, 49 S.Ct. 268, 73 L.Ed. 692 (1929). In <em>Sinclair, </em>the Court stated that a question of materiality \u201cis rightly decided by the Court as [a question] of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 49 S.Ct. at 273, 73 L.Ed. at 700. Every Circuit Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including the First Circuit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has followed the mandate of <em>Sinclair </em>and, in a perjury case, treated the issue of the materiality of a false statement as a question of law. In this case, we are compelled by our own precedent, and by <em>Sinclair, </em>to do likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-18\">We recognize, as did the Fifth Circuit, that <em>Sinclair </em>represents an historical ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ception to the fundamental principle that \u201cthe judge must submit every essential element of the offense to the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>718 F.2d 1317, 1323 (5th Cir.1983) <em>(en banc). </em>We are not free, however, to stray from the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Thus, although courts might be reluctant to \u201cexpand <em>Sinclair\u2019&amp; </em>sweep at the expense of the accused\u2019s right to interpose the jury between himself and the judge,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1324, in this case \u2014 which is squarely on point with <em>Sin</em>clair\u2014 we apply its mandate and uphold the decision of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\n<em>Improper Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It is hornbook law that a prosecutor, in closing argument, is at liberty to strike hard blows but not foul ones. <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314, 1321 (1935). In this case, Collates contends that the prosecutor hit below the belt when he stated in his closing argument \u201cNow, I suppose it\u2019s a good defense, or at least it can be, to attack the government when you have no other defense.\u201d Without disclaiming that this was inaccurate or, indeed, that he had any particular defense,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Collates asserts that this argument was an improper comment upon his silence in violation of the rule in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">A claim of improper argument is evaluated under a \u201charmless error\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 510-11, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1981, 76 L.Ed.2d 96, 107 (1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is so because there is no such thing as an error-free trial and, in the setting of a particular case, even some constitutional errors \u201care so unimportant and insignificant that they may, consistent with the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 709 (1967). In this case, we are convinced that if \u2014 and the if is a very big one \u2014 there was any <em>Griffin </em>error, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">In <em>Griffin, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution \u201cforbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence, or instructions by the Court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d 380 U.S. at 615, 85 S.Ct. at 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d at 110. The comment made by the prosecutor, however, was at worst an equivocal remark upon Collates\u2019 lack of a defense,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rather than even a whisper of an intimation regarding his failure to testify. It was uttered in response to a scathing defense attack upon the manner in which the government had conducted its investigation, and, in context, it appears that the government was merely attempting to buttress its contention that there was no reasonable doubt, indeed no doubt at all, regarding Collates\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">We have reviewed the whole record and are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that if \u2014 and the if is again a very big if \u2014 there was any error in the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\n<em>Invitation for Reversal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">The final issue raised by Collates concerns the voir dire of prospective jurors by the trial judge. Collates had requested that the following two questions be directed to the venire members in order to probe their attitudes towards perjury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">(1) If the evidence in this case were that defendant had a prior conviction for perjury, would that affect your judgment in any way if no other credible evidence were produced by the government?;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">(2) if the evidence in this case were that defendant had been convicted of both perjury and extortion, would that affect your judgment in any way if no other credible evidence were produced by the government?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The District Court declined to ask the proposed questions. The judge reasoned that if there was truly no evidence of guilt other than Collates\u2019 prior convictions, Collates would be entitled to an acquittal as a matter of law on the grounds that his prior convictions constituted only impeachment evidence. Collates contends, however, that the refusal to ask the proposed questions was an abuse of discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">A defendant is not entitled to have specific questions directed to the jurors on voir dire. <em>Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 594-95, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 1020, 47 L.Ed.2d 258, 263 (1976). Indeed, \u201cthe latitude and manner of voir dire examination is within the sound discretion of the district judge ... subject to the essential demands of fairness.\u201d <em>United States v. Desmarais, </em>531 F.2d 632, 633 (1st Cir.1976) (quoting <em>United States v. Gassaway, </em>456 F.2d 624, 626 (5th Cir.1972)). <em>See also Parento v. Palumbo, </em>677 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.1982); <em>Eastern Renovating Corp. v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield, </em>554 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1977). Collates has failed to persuade us that the District Court\u2019s voir dire was insufficiently probing to satisfy the essential demands of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The questions proposed by Collates would have placed the issue of his convictions before the jury prior to the time he testified at trial. Evidence of a prior conviction for perjury is generally admissible only to impeach the credibility of a witness who has already testified, Fed.R.Evid. 608, or under limited circumstances, as proof of other acts that are indicative of intent, motive, or identity. Fed.R.Evid. 609. Had the trial judge raised the issue of the prior convictions in the voir dire, before Collates even took the witness stand, and worse, even before the trial began, he ran the risk of tainting the trial irreparably. We are hard pressed to discern how the District Court\u2019s decision to avoid that risk constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court below could properly exclude the requested questions from the voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">The actions of the District Court were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\">. The meeting was carefully staged by Anzalone\u2019s defense counsel with a couple of over-hearers concealed from Collatos\u2019 view. In the meeting Collatos demanded 1200,000 to influence his testimony at the then pending trial of Anzalone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-13\">. <em>See United States v.

Indeed, at oral argument his counsel, with commendable candor, acknowledged that at the trial he had no defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">. The Government contends that the closing argument of its prosecutor must be evaluated under the \u201cplain error\u201d standard of <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), because defense counsel failed contemporaneously to object to the allegedly improper comment at the time it was made. Its position, however, is incorrect since defense counsel did object at the time the comment was made. When the objection was made, however, the Court stated: \"I\u2019ll reserve all of your objections so you won\u2019t be constantly interrupting and then I'll allow you to come to the side and ask for corrections.\u201d In light of the Court's statement, we treat the objection as having been made and the asserted error in the argument is evaluated under the harmless error standard of <em>Hastings, </em>rather than the plain error standard of <em>Young.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b114-14\">. In context, the statement did no more than remark upon a fact already abundantly apparent to the jury and virtually conceded by his counsel, <em>see supra </em>note 4, that Collates truly had put on no defense, although his counsel- did vigorously cross-examine the Government\u2019s witnesses. The prosecutor did no more than verbalize what the jury had already observed with their own eyes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">. Indeed, defense counsel successfully objected to the introduction of the conviction when the Government sought to introduce it under Fed.R. Evid. 404(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
