He proceeded through the customs enclosure without incident and walked to an airline counter approximately twenty yards away. While in customs, Ogueri was observed by Inspector Ellis. On the basis of his observations and experience in narcotics seizures, Ellis followed Ogueri outside the customs enclosure, approached him at the airlines counter, questioned him about his trip and finally asked him to return to the customs enclosure. There Ogueri was searched again and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>agents located 661 grams of cocaine on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Ogueri was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and refused to waive them. Ogueri denied initiating any conversation and making any statements. Nevertheless, Inspector Lamelas testified that Ogueri asked him for help; Lamelas responded by saying that he could only report any cooperation by the appellant to the United States Attorney. Ogueri then made certain incriminatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">1. The search, conducted after Ogueri had gone twenty yards beyond the customs enclosure, was valid as a search at the functional equivalent of the border. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ramos, </em>645 F.2d 318, 320-21 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (search thirty minutes after defendant left customs enclosure and checked into airport hotel but had not gone to his room). This traveler had not been assimilated into the mainstream of domestic activity; the evidence is conclusive that the contraband he was carrying had crossed the border.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">2. The trial judge did not err in finding that Ogueri\u2019s statements were voluntarily made after he initiated the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
