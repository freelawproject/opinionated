Driver advances three arguments on appeal: first, that the prosecution deprived him of due process by not disclosing material exculpatory evidence; second, that the admission of a highlighted s\u00fammary of certain telephone records was erroneous; and third, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. For the reasons stated below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">On July 18, 1984, a federal grand jury charged Driver in a one-count indictment with conspiring to distribute cocaine with Nicholas Smith, and with unindicted co-conspirators John Benton, John Shipley, Thomas Carpenter, and Steven Lear, between November 1982 and May 1983. Benton had entered into a plea agreement concerning another indictment based on the same transactions, but did not plead guilty until after the conclusion of Driver\u2019s trial. Smith, Shipley, Carpenter, and Lear also had pled guilty to crimes arising out of the same or similar transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">At trial on September 18, 19, and 20, 1984, Smith, Benton, Shipley, Carpenter, Lear (collectively the \u201cco-conspirators\u201d), and FBI agent Robert Dueker testified against Driver. Driver\u2019s only witness was Lear, who testified about Lear\u2019s addiction to cocaine. According to the trial testimony, which we must review in the light most favorable to the verdict, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Andrus, </em>775 F.2d 825, 853 (7th Cir.1985), Benton obtained cocaine from Driver, and sold it to Smith, Shipley, Carpenter, and Lear, on a number of occasions between November 1982 and May 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">A. <em>Disclosure of Exculpatory Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">Driver first argues that the government denied him discovery of four classes of information: (1) other offenses committed by the co-conspirators of which the government was aware; (2) telephone calls placed by the co-conspirators to other drug sources; (3) statements by the co-conspirators relating to other drug sources; and (4) Lear\u2019s psychological records.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">As the Supreme Court held in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and reaffirmed in <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), and <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), due process requires that the prosecution disclose material evidence that is favorable to the accused. \u201cTo make out a successful claim under <em>Brady, </em>the defendant^ ] must establish (1) that the prosecutor suppressed evidence; (2) that such evidence was favorable to the defense; and (3) that the suppressed evidence was material.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>780 F.2d 1305, 1308 (7th Cir.1986). When the government fails to disclose favorable evidence, such \u201cevidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014,\u2014, 105 S.Ct. at 3384 (Blackmun, J.), 3385 (White, J., concurring); <em>see Jackson, </em>780 F.2d at 1308-13. Justice Blackmun has suggested that \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d should have the same meaning in this context as it does with respect to establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), that is, \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 105 S.Ct. at 3384.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">1. <em>Other offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">With respect to other offenses allegedly committed by the co-conspirators, Driver did not call this court\u2019s attention to any offense committed by Benton, Smith, Shipley, Carpenter, or Lear, of which the. government was aware and which it did not disclose to the defense. Driver\u2019s speculation that the government might not have disclosed all of the information in its possession about the co-conspirators falls far short of establishing that the prosecution suppressed exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Andrus, </em>775 F.2d. at 843 (\u201cA due process standard which is satisfied by mere speculation would convert <em>Brady </em>into a discovery device and impose an undue burden on the district court.\u201d). Indeed, in this case the government maintained an open file policy, under which it afforded Driver access to all of its files pertaining to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Furthermore, the jury was aware that the government\u2019s witnesses had entered into plea bargains or had pled guilty to offenses arising out of the same or similar transactions. Benton, Shipley, and Carpenter testified that they had trafficked in cocaine, quaaludes, and marijuana. Benton and Shipley admitted that they had lied under oath with respect to their income tax returns. Smith testified that he had dealt in marijuana. Lear testified that he had trafficked in cocaine, marijuana, hashish, valiums, and quaaludes, had possessed stolen money orders or travelers\u2019s checks and a stolen car, and had participated in counterfeiting. Given the amount of evidence as to the co-conspirators\u2019 characters that was before the jury, and given that the government maintained an open file policy of discovery, Driver\u2019s unsupported assertion that the government suppressed evidence of other offenses committed by the co-conspirators is insufficient to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">2. <em>Telephone calls to other drug sources </em>In regard to calls to drug sources other than Driver, the government disclosed to Driver all of its records concerning telephone calls by Benton. Benton placed his calls from his two places of work. The telephone records which the government disclosed list all the long-distance calls placed from the two numbers, including business calls, Benton\u2019s calls to arrange drug deals, and other personal calls by other employees. Driver asserts that the government knew from its \u201cdebriefing\u201d of the co-conspirators pursuant to their plea agreements which of the hundreds of calls were made by Benton to other drug sources.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that, by not disclosing the caller\u2019s identity and the call\u2019s subject-matter for each call to another drug source, the government did not afford him meaningful discovery under <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Driver, however, has failed to substantiate his speculation that the government knew of calls made by Benton to other drug sources. Although the government is under a duty to disclose material exculpatory evidence of which it is aware, it is not under a duty to investigate each of the hundreds of calls to determine whether a call was placed by Benton to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>drug dealer. <em>See United States v. Beaver, </em>524 F.2d 963, 966 (5th Cir.1975) <em>(\u201cBrady </em>clearly does not impose an affirmative duty upon the government to discover information which it does not possess.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 905, 96 S.Ct. 1498, 47 L.Ed.2d 756 (1976). By opening its files to Driver, the prosecution amply discharged its duty under <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">3. <em>Transactions with other drug sources</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Driver also has not shown by affidavit or otherwise that the government suppressed evidence within its possession of any transactions between the co-conspirators and other drug sources. In fact, the jury was aware that the co-conspirators obtained cocaine from other sources. For example, Shipley admitted that he also obtained cocaine from one Jeffrey Barnes. Carpenter testified that he purchased cocaine from Barnes and other persons. Smith conceded that he bought cocaine from someone else than Benton and Driver. Since the government opened its files to Driver and since a substantial amount of evidence that the co-conspirators purchased cocaine from other sources was introduced at trial, Driver\u2019s mere allegation that the government withheld evidence connecting the co-conspirators with other drug sources fails to make out a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">4. <em>Psychological records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">With respect to Lear\u2019s psychological records, Driver argues that the prosecution suppressed a psychological report that was prepared for Lear\u2019s sentencing on counterfeiting charges, Lear pled guilty and the report was prepared in the Southern District of Indiana, while Driver was prosecuted in the Southern District of Illinois. Without deciding whether the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois possessed, for the purpose of <em>Brady </em>discovery, information included in a presentence report prepared for a United States District Court for another district, we do not believe the report is material. When he recalled Lear to the stand, Driver elicited the contents of the report, that is, that Lear was addicted to cocaine and marijuana. <em>See United States v. Sweeney, </em>688 F.2d 1131, 1141-42 (7th Cir.1982) (nondisclosure of medical reports concerning witness\u2019s drug addiction was not prejudicial because contents of reports were elicited on cross-examination); <em>see also United States v. McMahon, </em>715 F.2d 498, 501 (11th Cir.) (psychological report was not material because underlying facts were elicited on cross-examination), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1001, 104 S.Ct. 507, 78 L.Ed.2d 697 (1983) &amp; 465 U.S. 1065, 104 S.Ct. 1413, 79 L.Ed.2d 739 (1984). Since the defense elicited the contents of the report, there is no reasonable likelihood that access to the document itself would have affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the government did not violate its duty of disclosure under <em>Brady. </em>Driver simply has not shown that evidence was suppressed by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">B. <em>Admission of Highlighted Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Over Driver\u2019s objection, the district court admitted into evidence a three-page typewritten summary of telephone calls by Benton to Driver, Shipley and Smith. Without objection,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Benton highlighted the dates, times, and duration of four telephone calls made on December 4, 1982, between Driver and Benton, and Shipley and Benton. Driver argues that the summary should not have been admitted because it contains calls that were wholly innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The admission of a summary under Fed.R.Evid. 1006 requires \u201ca proper foun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>dation as to the admissibility of the material that is summarized and ... [a showing] that the summary is accurate;\u201d however, the decision to admit or exclude the summary rests in the district court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Needham v. White Laboratories, Inc., </em>639 F.2d 394, 403 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 927, 102 S.Ct. 427, 70 L.Ed.2d 237 (1981). In this ease, Benton testified that he made telephone calls to Driver, Shipley, and Smith to arrange cocaine deals, and that the summary accurately lists his calls to those individuals. The government introduced the summary so that the jury could examine Benton\u2019s calls to Driver, Shipley, and Smith without searching through the records of all the calls made from Benton\u2019s places of work. <em>Cf. United States v. Denton, </em>556 F.2d 811, 816 (6th Cir.) (admission of composite recording of conversations to save time and inconvenience), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 892, 98 S.Ct. 269, 54 L.Ed.2d 178 (1977). The jury heard Benton testify that most of his calls to Driver did not concern drug transactions. Driver\u2019s objection that the calls were innocent goes to the exhibit\u2019s weight, but not its admissibility. <em>See United States v. Keplinger, </em>776 F.2d 678, 694 (7th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2919, 91 L.Ed.2d 548 (1986). We therefore conclude that the district court correctly admitted the exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Driver also argues that the highlighting of the four telephone calls made on December 4, 1982, \u201cpresented to the jury an argumentative, prejudicial picture of the case,\u201d Reply Brief 6; however, he did not object to the highlighting of the summary of Benton\u2019s telephone calls to Driver, Shipley, and Smith. We, therefore, must inquire whether the highlighting, if it is error at all, is plain error, that is, whether it affects Driver\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). In doing so, we must be mindful that \u201cthe plain error exception to the contemporaneous objection rule is to be \u2018used sparingly, solely in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1592 n. 14, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982)). Given the amount of evidence of Driver\u2019s guilt, the highlighting of the four telephone calls \u2014 if it is error at all, which we strongly doubt \u2014 does not create a risk of a miscarriage of justice. Hence, the alleged error is not plain error. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>774 F.2d 838, 843-44 (7th Cir.1985) (admission without objection of color-coded chart is not reversible error).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">C. <em>Effective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Driver also argues that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel. At first glance, Driver\u2019s claim is quite unusual because it is advanced by the same attorney who represented him at trial. A claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance might seem to be more commonly raised by another attorney. In this case, however, counsel states that he was under unusual personal strain, and argues that his personal concerns prevented him from providing effective assistance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish that the trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>See Strickland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Nutall v. Greer, </em>764 F.2d 462, 466 (7th Cir.1985). In determining whether counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, courts presume that counsel\u2019s performance was within the \u201c \u2018wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goins v. Lane, </em>787 F.2d 248, 253 (7th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065). While the rule serves several purposes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this rebuttable presumption of competence prevents counsel from deliberately making a tactical decision to forego a procedural opportunity\u2014 for example, to object to a question or to pursue a line of cross-examination \u2014 and then, after the tactic has proved unsuccessful, arguing on appeal that the tactical decision constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Thus, the defendant \u201c \u2018must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Goins, </em>787 F.2d at 253 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In this case, the theory of the defense was that Driver was an innocent man who was framed by untrustworthy drug users and dealers in an attempt to reduce their sentences and to protect the identity of their true source of cocaine. Defense counsel thus actively cross-examined the government\u2019s witnesses to impeach their credibility, and challenged their veracity in the defense\u2019s closing argument. Driver does not complain about his counsel\u2019s conduct of these phases of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Instead, Driver asserts that his counsel\u2019s failures to object to certain voir dire procedures, to tender instructions concerning multiple conspiracies, and to object to an allegedly improper comment in the prosecution\u2019s closing argument deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Counsel\u2019s conduct of Driver\u2019s defense simply did not fall outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Notwithstanding Driver\u2019s vague assertion that his counsel did not file \u201cappropriate\u201d voir dire questions, his defense attorney requested that the court question particular jurors further on certain subjects, but the district court declined to do so. Tr. 40-43. Driver also argues that counsel failed to object to venire members answering certain questions by raising their hands. However, the questions that were answered by the jurors raising their hands were merely preliminary questions dealing with whether any of the venire members had previously served on a jury. The district judge then personally questioned any juror who answered affirmatively. Counsel\u2019s decision not to object to this procedure, as well as his request for further voir dire questions, was well within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Driver also argues that counsel failed to submit instructions concerning multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>conspiracies. Counsel, however, could well have concluded that instructing the jury on multiple conspiracies would be inconsistent with the defense theory that Driver was an innocent man who was unfairly framed. \u201cTrial counsel is not obligated to present every conceivable theory in support of the defense.\u201d <em>Goins, </em>787 F.2d at 254. Defense counsel reasonably could have concluded that the strength of Driver\u2019s claim to innocence would have been dissipated by arguing to the jury that Driver was part of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, but that he was not part of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. <em>Cf. id. </em>(\u201cThe strength of meritorious arguments is dissipated by the weakness of groundless ones.\u201d). After counsel\u2019s choice not to submit multiple conspiracy instructions has proved unsuccessful, we will not permit the defendant, by asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, to avoid the consequences of his counsel\u2019s decision, unless counsel\u2019s performance could not be considered sound trial strategy. We conclude that, because counsel\u2019s decision not to tender instructions on multiple conspiracies may be considered sound trial strategy, counsel\u2019s performance satisfied the objective standard of reasonableness required by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Finally, Driver argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to an allegedly improper statement in the government\u2019s closing argument denied him effective assistance of counsel. To place the statement in context, we should note that Lear testified that he and Benton obtained cocaine in November 1982 from a man whom he identified at trial as Driver. In his cross-examination and direct examination of Lear, Driver\u2019s counsel suggested that, due to Lear\u2019s addictions to various drugs, Lear could not recall several important details about the November 1982 transaction, including whether the supplier was in fact Driver. To rebut the suggestion that Lear forgot important details, the prosecutor argued that Lear recalled that the supplier had a beard. In closing argument, the prosecutor then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">He [Lear] wanted to tell you that the individual [the supplier] had a beard. That is right, he had a beard, and ladies and gentlemen it\u2019s uncontradicted. His [Lear\u2019s] testimony is uncontradicted. He was called back this afternoon, by Mr. Pritzker [defense counsel], asked him again.[sic] I asked him again, does that affect your ability to identify? Did the man have a beard? Yes he did. Uncontradicted. Whose memory? It\u2019s not his. His [Lear\u2019s] memory is good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Tr. 370.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">We conclude that the absence of an objection to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Lear\u2019s testimony as \u201cuncontradicted\u201d did not deprive Driver of effective assistance of counsel. Of course, defense counsel need not raise every possible objection. In proper cases, a decision not to object to clearly objectionable comments in the prosecution\u2019s closing argument is sound trial strategy. <em>Cf. Darden v. Wainwright, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2471-72, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (defense counsel made the tactical decision not to object to improper comments by the prosecutor). In this case, defense counsel chose to respond to the prosecutor\u2019s comment in the defense\u2019s closing argument rather than objecting during the government\u2019s closing argument. Defense counsel observed in his closing argument that Benton, the third participant to the November 1982 transaction, did not testify that the supplier wore a beard. He then argued that Lear\u2019s testimony about the beard was not \u201cuncontroverted,\u201d but was \u201cuncorroborated.\u201d Tr. 379. By suggesting to the jury that Lear had made up the supplier\u2019s beard, just as he created his story that the supplier was Driver, defense counsel turned the prosecutor\u2019s statement against the government. Thus, we conclude that the defense counsel\u2019s conduct was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Moreover, there is no reasonable probability that an objection would have changed the trial\u2019s outcome. The testimony that was described as uncontradicted was not central to the case, but involved only a peripheral issue. The government did not describe as uncontradicted any other portion of Lear\u2019s testimony, or the testimony of any other witness. Given the strength of the evidence against Driver and the context in which the comments were made, we believe that the references to Lear\u2019s testimony that the supplier wore a beard did not affect the outcome of the case. Hence, we conclude that there is not a reasonable probability that, but for the absence of an objection, Driver would have been acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We therefore hold that Driver was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">For the reasons stated above, Driver\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">. In cases in which evidence is in the exclusive control of the government or has been destroyed by the government, a defendant might be able to establish that the government suppressed exculpatory evidence without specifically identifying the allegedly suppressed evidence. Driver, however, has made no showing at all by affidavits or otherwise that any evidence was suppressed by the government. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Balistrieri, </em>779 F.2d 1191, 1218-21 (7th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1490, 89 L.Ed.2d 892, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3284, 91 L.Ed.2d 573 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-14\">. Driver\u2019s theory is that Benton, Smith, Shipley, Carpenter, and Lear identified Driver as their source of cocaine to protect their true supplier. If this is the case, however, it is doubtful that they would have disclosed to the government the name of their true source, nor would they have identified any telephone calls to him or her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. Counsel stated that, \"[d]espite the Government\u2019s contention, Counsel for Appellant did object to the highlighting of the document by the government witness, Robert Duecker, on the ground that said highlighting destroyed the integrity of the document.\u201d Reply Brief 7. Counsel cites as support page 315 of the record; however, counsel\u2019s citation to the record refers to his objection to the highlighting of another document by another witness, which highlighting is not at issue on appeal, rather than to Benton\u2019s highlighting of the telephone records summary. Counsel did not object to Benton\u2019s highlighting of the summary of Benton\u2019s telephone calls. Tr. 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">. Driver\u2019s trial began as scheduled on September 18, 1984. After voir dire, Driver\u2019s counsel requested in chambers a one-day continuance, which the district court granted. Counsel states that \"the lives of counsel, his wife and children were in danger as a result of counsel\u2019s anticipated testimony as a government witness in a federal criminal investigation. Counsel had previously been shot and wounded by persons hired by the target of that investigation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief 2. In exceptional cases, circumstances outside the courtroom might justify a presumption of ineffectiveness without inquiry into counsel's actual performance at trial. <em>See United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984); <em>Goins v. Lane, </em>787 F.2d 248, 252 n. 1 (7th Cir.1986). Defense counsel, however, has failed to support his assertions. He also has not demonstrated that the alleged events were so close in time to the trial as to justify such a presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-5\">. As the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">The availability of intrusive post-trial inquiry into attorney performance or of detailed guidelines for its evaluation would encourage the proliferation of ineffectiveness challenges. Criminal trials resolved unfavorably to the defendant would increasingly come to be followed by a second trial, this one of counsel\u2019s unsuccessful defense. Counsel\u2019s performance and even willingness to serve could be adversely affected. Intensive scrutiny of counsel and rigid requirements for acceptable assistance could dampen the ardor and impair the independence of defense counsel, discourage the acceptance of assigned cases, and undermine the trust between attorney and client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Thus, the presumption also prevents the proliferation of frivolous appeals, and assures defense counsel\u2019s independence from second-guessing by the courts.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\">. Thus <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>standard for ineffective assistance of counsel resembles the cause and prejudice standard of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), to the extent that a purpose of each is to prevent \"sandbagging\" by trial counsel. <em>See Reed v. Ross, </em>468 U.S. 1, 13-14, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 2909, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (a purpose of the <em>Wainwright </em>standard is to prevent sandbagging).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\">. Although appellant\u2019s briefs refer only to the passage quoted above, the government stated again in its reply to the defense\u2019s closing argument that Lear's testimony that the supplier wore a beard was \"uncontradicted.\u201d Tr. 384-85.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
