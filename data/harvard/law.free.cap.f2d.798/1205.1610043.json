Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980). In brief, the White Mountain Apache Tribe, which inhabits a reservation in Arizona, organized a tribal enterprise to harvest timber. In 1969 the enterprise entered into a contract with Pinetop Logging Company which provided that Pinetop would perform logging operations on the reservation. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 100 S.Ct. at 2581. In 1971, the Arizona Highway Department and the Arizona Highway Commission assessed a motor carrier license tax and a use fuel tax against Pine-top for activities it performed pursuant to the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 139-40, 100 S.Ct. at 2581-82. Pinetop paid the taxes under protest, and then brought suit in state court to recover them. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 100 S.Ct. at 2581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">In December 1973, after the Tribe had agreed to reimburse Pinetop for the assessed taxes, <em>id. </em>at 140, 100 S.Ct. at 2581, Pinetop and the Tribe brought suit in federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent any further imposition of state taxes against Pinetop.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In their federal complaint, Pinetop and the Tribe contended that federal law preempted the state tax laws and that the tax violated their rights to due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">Shortly after commencement of the federal action, the State of Arizona filed a motion requesting the district court to abstain on the ground that \u201cthe Arizona tax statutes here in question may be susceptible to an authoritative construction by the state courts in the pending state court action that would avoid or modify the Federal constitutional questions raised.\u201d The district court granted the motion, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), and at the same time granted a consent temporary restraining order forbidding the state agencies to assess further taxes against Pine-top.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">Although not required to do so, Pinetop and the Tribe then elected to submit their federal preemption claim to the Arizona courts along with the questions of state law. In May 1975, the Arizona Superior Court rejected all their claims, state and federal, and entered judgment for the state. The federal district court then dismissed the federal action sua sponte. In early 1976, however, upon the motion of Pinetop and the Tribe, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>vacated the dismissal order and entered a consent preliminary injunction pending final outcome of the state proceedings. In 1978, the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed the state trial court judgment, characterizing the Tribe\u2019s arguments as \u201cpure sophistry.\u201d <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, </em>120 Ariz. 282, 290, 585 P.2d 891, 899 (Ct.App.1978), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>448 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">After the Arizona Supreme Court declined review, the state returned to federal district court with a motion to quash the consent preliminary injunction and to dismiss the federal action. The district court denied the state\u2019s motion. The United States Supreme Court then reversed the Arizona Court of Appeals, holding that the state taxes were preempted because the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing the harvest and sale of tribal timber had occupied the field and because the state taxes would interfere with federal goals and policies. 448 U.S. at 151, 100 S.Ct. at 2587. Armed with a favorable state court judgment on their federal claims, Pinetop and the Tribe then returned to the district court seeking a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction and attorney\u2019s fees. The district court granted all the relief sought, including attorney\u2019s fees of $206,012.07. The state appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">We first address the question whether Pinetop and the Tribe have stated a claim under \u00a7 1983 for which attorney\u2019s fees are available under \u00a7 1988. Pinetop and the Tribe argue that a claim of preemption of the state\u2019s power to tax Pinetop\u2019s logging operations oh the reservation constitutes a claim of deprivation of \u201crights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. The Supreme Court decided in <em>Bracker, supra, </em>that the federal laws regulating the harvest and sale of tribal timber did preempt the Arizona tax statutes, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-7\">Where ... the Federal Government has undertaken comprehensive regulation of the harvesting and sale of tribal timber, where a number of policies underlying the federal regulatory scheme are threatened by the taxes respondents seek to impose, and where respondents are unable to justify the taxes except in terms of a generalized interest in raising revenue, we believe that the proposed exercise of state authority is impermissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\"><em>Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 151, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 2587, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980). Although the Court acknowledged that \u201ctraditional notions of Indian self-government ... provided an important \u2018backdrop\u2019 \u201d for its analysis, 448 U.S. at 143, 100 S.Ct. at 2583, it explicitly \u201cbased [its decision] on the preemptive effect of the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme\u201d governing the timber harvest. <em>Id. </em>at 151 n. 15, 100 S.Ct. at 2588 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">The question whether the Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI cl. 2) may be used as a sword in bringing a \u00a7 1983 action is, of course, different from that decided by the Supreme Court in <em>Bracker </em>\u2014 whether the Supremacy Clause may be invoked as a shield against the imposition of state taxes on tribal logging operations heavily regulated by the federal government. It is the former question that we must address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">Pinetop and the Tribe argue that because the federal laws that regulate timber operations on tribal lands are intended to benefit the Tribe, the laws may serve as the basis for a \u00a7 1983 claim. That the Tribe benefits from the federal timber regulations, however, is not dispositive of the issue. In this case, Pinetop and the Tribe did not prevail in the Supreme Court on a theory that the state had <em>violated </em>any of the federal laws or regulations governing logging operations on tribal lands. Rather, the Supreme Court in <em>Bracker </em>reasoned that state taxes were preempted because the federal government had pervasively regulated tribal logging operations and because state taxation would interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>the goals and purposes of the federal regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">Thus the question presented is whether the Tribe\u2019s preemption claim, based on federal occupation of a regulatory field and inconsistency of state action with federal goals and policies, will support a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">The Supreme Court has never directly addressed the question whether the Supremacy Clause creates \u201crights, privileges or immunities\u201d within the ambit of \u00a7 1983. In <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 U.S. 600, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979), however, the Supreme Court did hold that the Supremacy Clause is not a substantive constitutional provision that creates rights within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). <em>Id. </em>at 612-15, 99 S.Ct. at 1913-15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court noted, \u201ceven though that Clause is not a source of any federal rights, it does \u2018secure\u2019 federal rights by according them priority whenever they come in conflict with state law. In that sense all federal rights, whether created by treaty, by statute, or by regulation are \u2018secured\u2019 by the Supremacy Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 99 S.Ct. at 1913-14. Under <em>Chapman, </em>therefore, the Supremacy Clause, standing alone, \u2018secures\u2019 federal rights only in the sense that it establishes federal-state priorities; it does not create individual rights, nor does it \u2018secure\u2019 such rights within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">The primary function of the Supremacy Clause is to define the relationship between state and federal law. It is essentially a power conferring provision, one that allocates authority between the national and state governments; thus, it is not a rights conferring provision that protects the individual against government intrusion. The distinction between the two categories of constitutional controls has been enunciated by Professor Choper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-12\">When a litigant contends that the national government (usually the Congress, but occasionally the executive, either alone or in concert with the Senate) has engaged in activity beyond its delegated authority, or when it is alleged that an attempted state regulation intrudes into an area of exclusively national concern, the constitutional issue is wholly different from that posed by an assertion that certain government action abridges a personal liberty secured by the Constitution. The essence of a claim of the latter type \u2014 which falls into the individual rights category of constitutional issues ... \u2014 is that no organ of government, national or state, may undertake the challenged activity. In contrast, when a person alleges that one of the federalism provisions of the constitution has been violated, he implicitly concedes that one of the two levels of government \u2014 national or state \u2014 has the power to engage in the questioned conduct. The core of the argument is simply that the particular government that has acted is the constitutionally improper one. To put it another way, a federalism attack on conduct of the national government contends that only the states may so act; a federalism challenge to a state practice asserts that only the central government possesses the exerted power; neither claim denies government power altogether.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">J. Choper, <em>Judicial Review in the National Political Process, </em>174-75 (1980) (quoted with approval in <em>United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, </em>564 F.Supp. 581 (D.R.I.1983) and <em>Consolidated Freightways v. Kassel, </em>556 F.Supp. 740, 746 (S.D.Iowa 1983) <em>aff'd </em>730 F.2d 1139 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 126, 83 L.Ed.2d 68 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-15\">We believe that \u00a7 1983 was not intended to encompass those Constitutional provisions which allocate power between the state and federal government. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number><em>Consolidated Freightways v. Kassel, supra, </em>730 F.2d at 1146 &amp; n. 16. The following excerpt from a speech by Representative Shellabarger, a leading proponent of the 1871 Act, confirms the limited intentions of the framers of the \u00a7 1983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-4\">Most of the provisions of the Constitution which restrain and directly relate to the States, such as those in tenth section of first article, that \u201cno State shall make a treaty,\u201d \u201cgrant letters of marque\u201d, \u201ccoin money,\u201d \u201cemit bills of credit,\u201d &amp; c., relate to the divisions of the political powers of the State and General Governments. They do not relate directly to the rights of persons within the States and as between the States and such persons therein. These prohibitions upon the political powers of the States are of such a nature that they can be, and even have been, when the occasion arose, enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void all State acts of encroachment on Federal powers. Thus, and thus sufficiently, has the United States \u201cenforced\u201d these provisions of the Constitution. But there are some that are not of this class. These are where the court secures the rights or liabilities of persons within the States, as between such persons and the States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Cong.Globe, 42d Cong. 1st Sess., App. 69 (1871). As the Eighth Circuit has observed, \u201cthe implication of Rep. Shellabarger\u2019s statement is that \u00a7 1983 was enacted to provide a remedy for the latter category of constitutional violation he mentions, and not the former.\u201d <em>Consolidated Freightways v. Kassel, supra, </em>730 F.2d at 1146 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">Following the lead of the Supreme Court in <em>Chapman </em>and the framers of \u00a7 1983, the District of Rhode Island has answered in the negative the question whether the Supremacy Clause will support an action based on \u00a7 1983. In <em>United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, </em>564 F.Supp. 581 (D.R.I.1983), a utility sought fees under \u00a7 1988 after successfully challenging on preemption grounds a state statute imposing a bonding requirement on a nuclear power generating facility. The court there held that a successful Supremacy Clause challenge to state legislation could not serve as the basis for a \u00a7 1983 action, and hence attorney\u2019s fees were not available under \u00a7 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 585-87. The Eleventh Circuit reached the same conclusion in a decision affirming the dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 action: \u201cThe sole cause of the unconstitutionality was the supremacy clause. Therefore Pirolo is not entitled to a \u00a7 1983 remedy for enforcement of the ordinances.\u201d <em>Pirolo v. City of Clearwater, </em>711 F.2d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, 720 </em>F.2d 688 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">An analogous question is posed by the invocation of \u00a7 1983 in cases based on the dormant Commerce Clause, another constitutional provision that has as its primary function the allocation of power between national and state governments. The most extensive treatment of the issue was provided by the Eighth Circuit in <em>Consolidated Freightways v. Kassel, supra, </em>a case in which a trucking firm sought \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees based on its successful dormant Commerce Clause challenge to an Iowa statute banning 65-foot twin trailer trucks. The Eighth Circuit held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiR\">Although the Commerce Clause differs from the Supremacy Clause in that the Commerce Clause is a specific grant of legislative power to Congress, the two clauses are analogous in the sense that both clauses limit the power of a state to interfere with areas of national concern. Just as the Supremacy Clause does not secure rights within the meaning of \u00a7 1983, neither does the Commerce Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1144. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s reasoning implies that the Supremacy Clause alone will not support a \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-10\">A similar question was addressed in <em>Connor v. Rivers, </em>25 F.Supp. 937 (N.D.Ga. 1938), <em>aff'd, </em>305 U.S. 576, 59 S.Ct. 359, 83 L.Ed. 363 (1939). There, the district court decided that a dormant Commerce Clause claim did not provide jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3) \u2014 the provision for federal jurisdiction over civil rights cases irrespective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>of the amount in controversy \u2014 based on an analysis of the history of \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 938. Because <em>Connor </em>was decided at a time when the general federal question jurisdictional provision contained an amount in controversy provision, the suit could only be maintained in federal court if it was maintainable as a civil rights action under \u00a7 1343(3). The Supreme Court affirmed <em>Connor </em>in a one sentence per curiam opinion noting the lack of the requisite jurisdictional amount in controversy. <em>Connor </em>reinforces the conclusion we draw from <em>Chapman: </em>power conferring provisions of the Constitution do not create \u201crights, privileges, or immunities\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. Although there are federal court decisions that have held or assumed that the dormant Commerce Clause does support an action under \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we find them unpersuasive because they do not undertake a substantial analysis of the issue. <em>See Consolidated Freightways Corp. v. Kassel, </em>556 F.Supp., at 744-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">We thus come down on the side of the weight of authority that preemption of state law under the Supremacy Clause \u2014 at least if based on federal occupation of the field or conflict with federal goals \u2014 will not support an action under \u00a7 1983, and will not, therefore, support a claim of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">Pinetop and the Tribe do not directly confront the question whether the actual ground on which the decision in <em>Bracker </em>was made \u2014 preemption based on federal \u201coccupation of the field\u201d and \u201cconflict with federal goals\u201d \u2014 will support a \u00a7 1983 action. Rather, their argument seems to assume that there is a direct conflict between Arizona\u2019s tax and the federal regulations governing timbering on tribal lands. Thus, the Tribe\u2019s argument emphasizes the statutory scheme regulating logging operations on tribal lands \u2014 an emphasis that would be appropriate were this a direct conflict case. Because the Arizona tax does not directly violate any federal law or regulation, the Tribe\u2019s argument does not confront the crucial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">In developing their argument, Pinetop and the Tribe rely on <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980) , in which the Court held that plaintiffs could recover in an action grounded on state violations of the Social Security Act because \u201cthe \u00a7 1983 remedy broadly encompasses violations of federal statutory as well as constitutional law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 100 S.Ct. at 2504. Unlike the situation in <em>Thiboutot, </em>no federal statute or regulation was violated by the Arizona tax on Pine-top's logging operation. Moreover, although some courts broadly interpreted the <em>Thiboutot </em>language to mean that \u00a7 1983 encompassed all federal statutes, <em>see, e.g., Yapalater v. Bates, </em>494 F.Supp. 1349, 1358 (S.D.N.Y.1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>644 F.2d 131 (2d Cir.1981), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>455 U.S. 908, 102 S.Ct. 1255, 71 L.Ed.2d 447 (1982), the Supreme Court has since recognized that not all federal statutes secure rights within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass\u2019n, </em>453 U.S. 1, 19, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2625, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981); <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, </em>451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>Recognizing the Supreme Court\u2019s limitation of <em>Thiboutot </em>imposed by <em>Sea Clammers </em>and <em>Pennhurst, </em>Pinetop and the Tribe contend that our decision in <em>Boatowners and Tenants Association v. Port of Seattle, </em>716 F.2d 669 (9th Cir.1983) supports their position. In <em>Boatowners, </em>an association of pleasure craft owners charged that the manner of operation of a municipal marina violated the River and Harbor Improvements Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 540-633 (1982), and thereby constituted a deprivation of federal statutory rights cognizable under \u00a7 1983. We found that although pleasure craft owners certainly benefitted from the general navigational improvements fostered by this federal scheme, \u201cthere is no indication that the statute was intended to benefit specially the pleasure craft owners ... nor that Congress intended to confer federal rights on [them].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we held that the pleasure craft owners as a class had no \u201cenforceable rights\u201d as required by <em>Pennhurst </em>and <em>Middlesex County </em>for maintaining a \u00a7 1983 action. Pinetop and the Tribe argue that they are \u201cspecially benefitted\u201d by the federal laws and regulations governing timber operations on tribal lands. Thus, they contend that Supremacy Clause preemption by those laws and regulations creates a \u201cright, privilege or immunity\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">The relevant focus for inquiry, however, is not primarily whether the regulatory scheme was designed to benefit the Indians. Indeed it may have been so designed. Rather the focus must be on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bracker </em>\u2014preemption pursuant to the Supremacy Clause. So directed, our inquiry leads to the conclusion that the <em>Bracker </em>decision is grounded not on individual <em>rights </em>but instead on considerations of <em>power </em>\u2014 the division of authority between the states and the national government. As the Court noted, \u201cAt the most general level, the taxes would threaten the overriding <em>federal objective </em>of guaranteeing Indians that they will \u2018receive ... the benefit of whatever profit [the forest] is capable of yielding----\u2019\u201d <em>Bracker, supra, </em>448 U.S. at 149, 100 S.Ct. at 2586 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The court continued: \u201cIn addition the taxes would <em>undermine the Secretary\u2019s ability </em>to make the wide range of determinations committed to his authority concerning the setting of fees and rates with respect to the harvesting and sale of tribal timber.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) Hence, the focus of concern in <em>Bracker </em>is state interference with federal policy objectives and the free exercise of authority by federal officials \u2014 not individual or tribal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">Moreover, the Tribe\u2019s exemption from state taxation of its timber business does not implicate individual rights; rather the exemption derives from its status as a sovereign.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 148, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>S.Ct. at 2586. Nor did the federal legislation create in the Tribe any new interest in the timber; the timber was already \u201cowned by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 100 S.Ct. at 2581. The central thrust of the legislation is merely to vest in the Secretary of the Interior authority to regulate the business of harvesting and selling the timber. <em>See </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 406-407 (1982). In exercising that authority, the Secretary, of course, is required to base his decisions \u201cupon a consideration of the needs and best interests\u201d of the tribal owner. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 406(a). However, the critical inquiry \u2014 as the Supreme Court made particularly clear in <em>Sea Clammers </em>\u2014 is whether there is any basis for the judiciary to infer a congressional intent to create rights enforceable under \u00a7 1983. 453 U.S. at 19-20, 101 S.Ct. at 2625-26. We find no basis for inferring such an intent in this case. For the purpose of applying \u00a7 1983 doctrine as enunciated in <em>Thiboutot </em>and its progeny, we see nothing remarkable about the fact that Congress intended the federal regulation to protect the interests of the beneficial owner of the timber. Indeed, the kind of regulatory legislation involved in this case is analogous to that involved in <em>Boatowners </em>where we also found no \u201cenforceable rights.\u201d 716 F.2d at 673-74. There it was the regulation of municipal marinas; here it is the regulation of tribal timber business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">In sum, the Arizona tax on Pine-top\u2019s logging operations did not violate any federal statute. Nor is the existence of a federal \u201cgoal\u201d or \u201cpolicy\u201d, standing alone, sufficient to create a right cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Rather, the tax ran afoul of the Supremacy Clause because it was deemed to interfere in a general way with the authority and policies of the federal government. To be sure, the Supremacy Clause shielded the Tribe\u2019s timber business from state taxation, giving the Tribe a federal defense to any action brought by the state to collect the taxes; it does not follow, however, that in enacting the regulatory legislation, Congress intended to confer on the Tribe the right to use \u00a7 1983 as a sword to enjoin the collection of state taxes. The Tribe\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, rooted as it is in the power conferring function of the Supremacy Clause, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">We therefore hold that the preemption claim of Pinetop and the Tribe does not give rise to a claim cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, we conclude that the preemption claim does not support an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-11\">Plaintiffs argue in the alternative that even if their preemption claim does not give rise to a fee award under \u00a7 1988, they are entitled to fees on the basis of pendent Fourteenth Amendment claims pleaded in their original federal complaint. Plaintiffs rely upon <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980), for the proposition that a plaintiff who prevails on a claim not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 may recover fees under \u00a7 1988 on the basis of an unadjudicated constitutional claim that satisfies the \u201csubstantiality\u201d test of <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-12\">We reject this claim principally because plaintiffs have failed to provide us with any meaningful basis for evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>their Fourteenth Amendment claims. All we have to go on in trying to understand and analyze the claims are the bare allegations in the complaint filed at the outset of the federal court action. Plaintiffs tell us nothing more about the claims other than that the complaint \u201cspecifically alleges claims under the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, and Indian Commerce Clause.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Answering Brief, at 50-51. We find these allegations, standing alone, far too meager to enable us to determine whether the claims meet the substantiality test of <em>Hagans v. Lavine.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The merit of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims is rendered suspect not only by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to present this court with anything beyond a reference to the bare bones allegations of the complaint, but also by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to litigate these claims in the state courts. After the district court entered its <em>Pullman </em>abstention order, plaintiffs tendered their preemption claim to the state courts, but not the due process and equal protection claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, we agree with Amici Curiae that it is difficult to take these Fourteenth Amendment claims seriously \u201cwhen the plaintiffs themselves did not think enough of the claims to even assert them in their brief to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Brief of Amici Curiae, at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">Even upon their return to the district court to seek attorney\u2019s fees, plaintiffs failed to put any flesh on the bare bones allegations of their complaint. Their motion for fees states merely that their \u201ccomplaint also alleges violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses and the Indian Commerce Clause.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, at 11. The district court awarded fees on the basis of the preemption claim without mentioning the Fourteenth Amendment claims. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>Findings of Fact and Conclusions on the Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for an Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">This is not a case where a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff seeks attorney\u2019s fees on the strength of constitutional claims which were pressed but not adjudicated because of \u201cthe longstanding judicial policy of avoiding unnecessary decision of important constitutional issues.\u201d <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. at 133, 100 S.Ct. at 2577. Rather, this is a case where the constitutional claims were never pressed beyond the original federal complaint until they were dusted off for use in seeking a fee award under \u00a7 1988. For all practical purposes, plaintiffs abandoned their Fourteenth Amendment claims when, following the invocation of <em>Pullman </em>abstention by the district court, they failed to tender the claims to the state courts and the United States Supreme Court along with their preemption claim. In contrast, the pendent constitutional claims that provided the basis for a fee award in <em>Maher </em>were never abandoned and their substantiality was adjudicated by both the district court and the court of appeals. <em>See Gagne v. Maher, </em>455 F.Supp. 1344, 1348 (D.Conn.), <em>aff'd, </em>594 F.2d 336 (2nd Cir.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">Finally, and perhaps most troublesome, is plaintiffs\u2019 failure to take advantage of their opportunity in this court for further exposition of their constitutional claims. They provide us with no meaningful analysis; the sole authority relied upon is Justice Stevens\u2019 dissent in <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 158, 100 S.Ct. at 2591, a reliance we find to be misplaced. In the first place, plaintiffs mischaracterize Justice Stevens\u2019 dissent. They claim that he and Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist, who joined in the dissent, \u201cfelt that these state taxes <em>did violate </em>the due process and equal protection clauses\u201d. Appellees\u2019 Answering Brief, at 51 (emphasis added). All that Justice Stevens said was that <em>Pinetop, </em>as a private corporation doing business with an Indian Tribe, <em>\u201cmay well have </em>a right to be free from taxation as a matter of due process or equal protection,\u201d <em>Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 158, 100 S.Ct. at 2591 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (emphasis added), if the taxes burden a federal regulatory scheme and \u201cthere [is] no governmental interest on the State\u2019s part in imposing such a burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 100 S.Ct. at 2591. Indeed it would have been remarkable had Justice Stevens expressed the definitive opinion attributed to him by plaintiffs since preemption, not due process or equal protection, was the issue before the Court and the issue on which Justice Stevens disagreed with the majority. Justice Stevens\u2019 comments were clearly made solely for the purpose of contrast in the context of emphasizing that whatever valid grounds Pinetop might have had for challenging the state taxes, preemption was not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">The second reason plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Justice Stevens\u2019 dissent is misplaced is that the record leaves no room for doubt that Justice Stevens was not addressing the Fourteenth Amendment claims alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 federal complaint. Not only were those claims not before the Court in <em>Bracker, </em>which involved a review of the state court judgment, but also the dissent does not track the allegations of the federal complaint. Hence, whatever plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional theories might be, Justice Stevens was not addressing them. Justice Stevens speculated about conceivable constitutional claims that <em>Pinetop </em>as a private corporation might have, whereas the allegations in the complaint focus on the <em>Tribe\u2019s </em>status as a sovereign to enjoy treatment under Arizona tax laws on a par with the United States and the other states. Perhaps more importantly, Justice Stevens was speculating on possible constitutional implications of taxing vehicles used by Pinetop <em>solely </em>on private property, whereas the gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is the state\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs beneficial treatment in <em>apportioning </em>the fuel use tax and motor carrier tax based upon travel on public and private roads within the state.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Moreover, while plaintiffs are correct in stating that Arizona\u2019s use fuel tax is levied \u201cfor the purpose of partially compensating the state for the use of its highways,\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 28-1552 (1976), they fail to point out that the tax is expressly levied \u201cin lieu of\u201d direct fuel taxes. Ariz. Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 28-1554 (1976). As such, the use fuel tax is analytically indistinguishable from a direct fuel tax. We doubt that plaintiffs would seriously contend that Arizona can be forced to apportion direct fuel taxes collected at the pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">In conclusion, we hold on the basis of the record before us that the Fourteenth Amendment claims fail to meet the substantiality test of <em>Hagans v. Levine </em>and have been asserted in this action at this late date \u201csolely for the purpose of obtaining fees in [an action] where \u2018civil rights\u2019 of any kind are at best an afterthought.\u201d <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 24, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2514, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 failure to present their Fourteenth Amendment claims to the state courts provides an alternate ground for rejecting them as a basis for awarding fees under \u00a7 1988. While we recognize that a federal plaintiff subject to <em>Pullman </em>abstention is not required to tender his federal claims to the state courts for adjudication, <em>see England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>375 U.S. 411, 421, 84 S.Ct. 461, 467, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1963), we know of no authority suggesting that a federal plaintiff may tender some federal claims while reserving others arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While <em>England </em>carves out an exception to principles of res judicata in permitting a federal plaintiff to tender his pendent state claims to the state courts and return to federal court on his reserved federal claims in the event he fails to get adequate relief in the state action, we see no basis in law or logic for stretching that exception to permit him to reserve some of his federal claims while tendering others to the state courts for adjudication. Because plaintiffs would plainly have been barred by res judicata from returning to federal court to litigate its due process and equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>protection claims had they failed to obtain a favorable state court judgment, we hold that plaintiffs may not use those claims as a basis for returning to federal court to seek a fee award under \u00a7 1988. For all practical purposes, plaintiffs abandoned their due process and equal protection claims when they failed to tender them to the state courts along with their preemption claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">In sum, we hold that plaintiffs are not entitled to a fee award on the basis of the unadjudicated constitutional claims alleged in their federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">The state also appeals from the district court order granting a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction. Plaintiffs contend that the injunction and declaratory judgment were appropriate because the district court\u2019s findings reflected a sufficient threat that the state would impose the impermissible taxes even after the Supreme Court barred it from doing so in <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">In the absence of a controversy \u201cof sufficient immediacy and reality,\u201d <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941), a district court lacks jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment. <em>Sellers v. Regents of the University of California, </em>432 F.2d 493, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 981, 91 S.Ct. 1194, 28 L.Ed.2d 333 (1971). Here, there is no evidence that state officials intend to ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bracker. </em>The record in fact contains evidence to the contrary. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the state filed an affidavit stating that it did not intend to impose any of the disputed taxes on Pinetop and the Tribe. We have no basis for presuming from this record that the Arizona officials will not honor a final state court judgment based upon a decision of the United States Supreme Court. We therefore hold that the district court erred in concluding that a controversy \u201cof sufficient immediacy and reality\u201d supported the issuance of a declaratory judgment against assessment of the taxes for the years covered by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">Plaintiffs further contend, however, that the district court properly entered a declaratory judgment on the merits covering the 1968-71 tax period, since assessments covering that period were never adjudicated by either the state courts or the Supreme Court. The state court tax refund action that ultimately reached the Supreme Court dealt only with taxes paid under protest after November 1971, and Pinetop and the Tribe argue that \u201ceach year is the origin of a new [tax] liability and a separate cause of action,\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 598, 68 S.Ct. 715, 719, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948). They nevertheless concede that any attempt by the state to impose taxes covering the 1968-71 period would be thwarted by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Appellees\u2019 Answering Brief at 27. <em>See Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979).

Here we deal only with preemption based on federal occupation of the field and conflict between state law and federal goals and policies.

The dissent argues that the violation of federal regulations governing the harvest of tribal timber would give rise to a \u00a7 1983 action because those statutes were designed to benefit the Tribe. Dissent at 1219-1222. While we disagree that these regulations intended to create rights enforceable under \u00a7 1983, it is perhaps more important that the Tribe has never contended \u2014 and no court has ever found \u2014 that these statutes were ever violated. In our view, therefore, the Tribe fails to clear the first hurdle presented by the <em>Thiboutot-Pennhurst-Sea Clammers </em>line of cases. Unlike the situation in <em>Thiboutot, </em>or in <em>Boatowners, </em>no federal statute or regulation was violated by the Arizona tax on plaintiffs\u2019 logging operations. Rather we have a case in which pervasive federal regulation precludes <em>any </em>state regulation. <em>See Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 148, 100 S.Ct. at 2586. Section 1983, as interpreted in <em>Thiboutot </em>and its progeny, enforces federal statutory rights only against direct violations of the federal statute in question. <em>See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass\u2019n, </em>453 U.S. 1, 19, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2625, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981) <em>(Thiboutot </em>recognized \u00a7 1983 action on behalf of \"a private party <em>claiming that a federal statute has been violated </em>under color of state law.\u201d); <em>Pennhurst, </em>451 U.S. at 28, 101 S.Ct. at 1545 (remanding for a determination of whether the state officials violated the DDA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1306-10\">. Indeed, the Tribe\u2019s right to invoke the power of federal courts to enjoin Arizona from taxing Pinetop\u2019s logging operations rests on considerations of sovereignty, not individual rights. Any plaintiff other than an Indian tribe would be barred by the Tax Injunction Act from bringing a \u00a7 1983 action to enjoin state taxation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>hence from obtaining attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. While we do not address the question whether the Tribe may bring a \u00a7 1983 action to enjoin state taxation, we do note the hoops that the dissent is forced to jump through to make this determination. <em>See Dissent, </em>at 1226-27 &amp; n. 16. The dissent recognizes that a tribe cannot avoid the bar of the Tax Injunction Act in an action based on the rights of individual tribe members. <em>Id. </em>1226 n. 15. The dissent also acknowledges that it is doubtful whether a tribe \"qua sovereign\u201d would qualify as a \u201ccitizen of the United States or other person\u201d entitled to sue under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>The dissent purports to overcome these hurdles by opining that here the Tribe may sue under \u00a7 1983 because it is acting in this case as a \"incorporated business entity\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1227.

There is no attempt to impose similar unapportioned taxes on carriers that operate partly in the State of Arizona and partly within some other state, and A.R.S. \u00a7 40-641 expressly exempts \"receipts from property transported under a star route contract of the federal government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-7\">There is no legal basis for the taxation; the taxation is arbitrary and discriminatory, lacking any rational basis.

Although we do not have before us the record in the state court action, we infer that plaintiffs did not tender the Fourteenth Amendment claims to the state courts because plaintiffs have not disputed the state\u2019s contention that the plaintiffs \"never argued in the state courts nor in the Supreme Court any constitutional violation.\u201d Reply Brief of Appellant, at 16. The record is clear that the claims are not mentioned in the published opinion of the Arizona Court of Appeals, <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v.

Plaintiffs\u2019 response to this argument by Amici is grossly misleading. Plaintiffs say that their failure to raise the Fourteenth Amendment claims before the Supreme Court \"proves only that the Supreme Court is the master of its docket, [because the Court] granted certiorari <em>only </em>on the federal preemption issue, and the plaintiffs briefed nothing more.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Answering Brief at 51-52 (emphasis in original). The clear implication of this explanation is that plaintiffs raised the due process and equal protection claims in their Petition for Certiorari, but that the Court\u2019s order granting certiorari excluded those claims from consideration. Upon recalling and reviewing the Petition for Certiorari and the various briefs in <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v.

Moreover, neither due process nor equal protection was mentioned in any of the various briefs filed in the case.

The dissent overlooks this crucial distinction in concluding that the plaintiffs were treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>differently from other similarly situated parties in the state because taxes were being imposed for vehicles used solely on private property. <em>Dissent, </em>at 1224. In fact, the vehicles involved were operated on both public and private roads. <em>See Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 154 &amp; n. 3, 100 S.Ct. at 2589 &amp; n. 3. In pleading their Fourteenth Amendment claim, plaintiffs' allege that the Tribe and its partner Pinetop have a constitutional entitlement to be treated in the same manner as interstate truckers whose state fuel use taxes are apportioned to capture only that portion of fuel use actually attributable to travel on roads within the state. <em>See </em>note 10, <em>supra. </em>Thus, the Tribe contended that, for the purpose of the Arizona tax, tribal roads should be treated as though they were in a separate state. Arizona refused to do this, asserting that Pinetop\u2019s activities took place solely within Arizona and that Pinetop should be taxed in the same manner as are all other commercial entities that use vehicles on both public and private roads in Arizona. Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, plaintiffs were not \"singled out\u201d for disparate treatment and taxed \"differently from other landowners in the State.\u201d <em>Dissent, </em>at 1223 n. 10. Rather, they were taxed in exactly the same fashion as all others who use both public and private roads within Arizona \u2014 without apportionment. The only exception was the United States government, which was expressly exempted from the taxes. Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 40-641 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">. The state argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the issue of attorney\u2019s fees when plaintiffs presented their federal claims to the Arizona courts. The state relies on <em>England v.

We believe, however, that <em>England </em>does not present a jurisdictional bar to these claims, but rather announces only a rule of res judicata. Thus, the district court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the fees claim. Because we hold that plaintiffs do not have a \u00a7 1983 claim to support an award of fees under \u00a7 1988, we need not decide whether the Tribe may return to federal court on their discrete claim for attorney\u2019s fees after submitting their preemption claims to the state courts. Nor need we decide whether the Tribe lacks standing to seek a fee award under \u00a7 1988 because it is not a \"citizen\u201d or \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1311-12\">FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AKu\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-14\">There are three separate and independent bases to support the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Tribe under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982).

Such a conclusion is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>375 U.S. 411, 84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1963), and to our court\u2019s decision in <em>Tovar v.

In the case before us, after the district court entered its abstention order, the Tribe did not submit its section 1983 claims for decision to the Arizona state courts or the United States Supreme Court, did not litigate them in those courts, and did not have them decided there. <em>See White Mountain Apache Tribe v.

The majority itself concedes that the Tribe never freely submitted its section 1983 claims for resolution in the <em>Bracker </em>case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, these claims were properly before the district court when it awarded section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">B. <em>The Tribe\u2019s Section 1983 Claim Based Upon the Indian Reservation Timber Laws</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">The majority maintains that even if the Tribe\u2019s claims were properly before the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>trict court, violations of the federal laws regulating the harvest and sale of reservation timber, such as those alleged by the Tribe in this case, cannot give rise to a civil rights action under section 1983. I disagree. Section 1983 provides a cause of action for state officials\u2019 violations of federal statutes whenever (1) the statutes create \u201cenforceable rights,\u201d and (2) Congress did not, in the statutes themselves, foreclose private enforcement of those rights through a section 1983 action. <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association, </em>453 U.S. 1, 18, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2625, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981); <em>accord Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.

I conclude that both these requirements are satisfied in respect to sections 406, 407, and 466, and that the Tribe is therefore entitled to vindicate its rights under these provisions in a section 1983 action. I further conclude, based upon the Supreme Court's opinion in <em>Bracker, </em>that the Tribe\u2019s section 1983 claim under these provisions is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">As the majority acknowledges, sections 406, 407, and 466 require the Secretary of the Interior to manage tribal timber resources based \u201cupon a consideration of the needs and best interests\u201d of the tribe, and to ensure that proceeds from any timber sales be paid to the tribe \u201cor disposed of for [its] benefit,\u201d subject only to limited deductions for \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d incurred by the federal government. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 406(a), 413; 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 163.18 (1985); <em>see United States v.

The Supreme Court recently held, based largely upon its decision in <em>Bracker, </em>that these provisions establish a trust relationship between the federal government and tribes with timberlands on their reservations, and that they establish a \u201csubstantive right enforceable [by tribes] against the United States for money damages\u201d under the Tucker Act if the federal government breaches its fiduciary duties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 216-18, 224, 226, 103 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>at 2967-69, 2971, 2972; <em>accord Short, </em>719 F.2d at 1134-35 (interpreting <em>Mitchell </em>to cover both allotted and unallotted lands).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Our court recently held that a federal act establishing a land trust for the betterment of native Hawaiians created rights enforceable by those individuals under section 1983 against parties who interfere with or deprive them of their rights or benefits under the trust.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa, </em>739 F.2d at 1471-72.

Based upon these decisions and the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Mitchell, </em>I conclude that by establishing a trust relationship between Indian tribes and the federal government, sections 406, 407, and 466 create rights that tribes who are deprived of their trust benefits or whose trust relationships are disrupted can enforce under 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">I also conclude that Congress did not intend to foreclose private enforcement under section 1983 of the rights it created for Indian tribes in sections 406, 407 and 466. We have held that \u201cthere is a presumption that a federal statute creating enforceable rights <em>may </em>be enforced in a section 1983 action,\u201d and that the burden is on the \u201cgovernmental defendant [to] show that Congress intended the federal statute in question to provide the exclusive remedy.\u201d <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa, </em>739 F.2d at 1470-71 (emphasis added and citations omitted); <em>accord Almond Hill School, </em>768 F.2d at 1035. The text of sections 406, 407 and 466 does not suggest that Congress intended to preclude a section 1983 remedy. The three provisions do not include a \u201ccomprehensive enforcement scheme\u201d with a \u201c \u2018balance, completeness and structural integrity\u2019 that would suggest remedial exclusivity,\u201d <em>Middlesex, </em>453 U.S. at 20, 101 S.Ct. at 2626; <em>Almond Hill School, </em>768 F.2d at 1035-36 (citations omitted); <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa, </em>739 F.2d at 1471; <em>Department of Education, State of Hawaii v.

Even assuming that Congress specifically contemplated a Tucker Act remedy when it adopted the three provisions, we have held that a federal act providing only a single, limited remedy \u201cdoes not contain a sufficiently comprehensive enforcement scheme to foreclose a section 1983 remedy.\u201d <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa, </em>739 F.2d at 1471; <em>see also Almond Hill School, </em>768 F.2d at 1036-37; <em>cf. Maine v.

Moreover, as the present case illustrates, limiting Indian tribes whose reservations contain timberlands to the sole remedy recognized in <em>Mitchell </em>would deny them any redress whatsoever against state officials who interfere with the trust relationship created by sections 406, 407, and 466 and who attempt to deny tribes the benefits to which these provisions entitle them. I therefore conclude, based upon the lack of any explicitly delineated remedies in sections 406, 407, and 466 and based upon the legislative history and background of the three provisions, that Congress did not intend to foreclose private enforcement of these provisions under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">Since both conditions required by the Supreme Court for establishing the availability of a section 1983 cause of action are satisfied, I conclude that the Tribe was entitled to enforce its section 406, 407, and 466 rights against the defendants in a section 1983 action. <em>See Middlesex, </em>453 U.S. at 19, 101 S.Ct. at 2625. Moreover, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bracker, </em>I conclude that the Tribe\u2019s section 1983 claims based upon these three provisions are meritorious. The Court stated in <em>Bracker </em>that \u201cthe [challenged Arizona] taxes would threaten the overriding federal objective of guaranteeing Indians that they will \u2018receive ... the benefit of whatever profit [the forest] is capable of yielding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 149, 100 S.Ct. at 2586 (citations omitted). It stated that \u201c[t]he imposition of the taxes at issue would undermine\u201d the \u201cpolicy of assuring that the profits derived from timber sales will inure to the benefit of the Tribe, subject only to administrative expenses incurred by the Federal Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Thus, the Supreme Court found that the challenged Arizona taxes deprive the Tribe of the central benefit guaranteed to it in its trust relationship with the federal government under sections 406, 407, and 466. <em>See Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. at 221-24, 103 S.Ct. at 2970-72. I therefore conclude that the tribe would prevail on its section 1983 claim based on those three provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">C. <em>The Tribe\u2019s Section 1983 Claims Based on Due Process and Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">The majority asserts that the Tribe\u2019s due process and equal protection claims are frivolous, \u201cdifficult to take ... seriously,\u201d and so \u201cinsubstantial\u201d that they will not support an attorney\u2019s fees award under section 1988.

Thus, the <em>Braeker </em>majority concluded that imposition of the challenged Arizona taxes deprived the Tribe of property, that in imposing these taxes, Arizona treated the Tribe differently from other, similarly situated entities, and that Arizona has failed to identify any rational basis for doing so. I conclude, as a result, that the due process and equal protection claims raised by the Tribe are not frivolous or foreclosed by prior decisions, and therefore support the district court\u2019s award of section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Williams, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1679-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>D. <em>The Tribe\u2019s Capacity to Bring A Section 1983 Action In Federal Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">Since the Tribe has asserted viable section 1983 claims based upon the Indian reservation timber laws and the due process and equal protection clauses, it is entitled to recover section 1988 attorney's fees if (1) it has the capacity to bring a section 1983 action based on those claims; and (2) such an action is not barred in the federal courts by the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1982).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although not every action by an Indian tribe challenging the imposition of state taxes will satisfy these two requirements, I conclude, based on the circumstances of this case and the capacity in which the Tribe initiated this litigation, that the present action satisfies both requirements, and that the Tribe is entitled to recover section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>The Tribe brought this action in its capacity as an incorporated business entity under section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 477 (1982):<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>standing to challenge Arizona\u2019s taxes is based on the tax burden it incurred while operating in a proprietary capacity. <em>See Moe v.

Our court and other courts have held that private corporations qualify as \u201ccitizens\u201d or \u201cother persons\u201d entitled to bring section 1983 actions. <em>See California Diversified Promotions, Inc. v.

When Congress passed section 1362 in 1966, it was fully aware that Indian tribes can act in both sovereign and proprietary capacities. Therefore, its failure to limit explicitly the scope of section 1362 to actions brought by tribes in their governmental capacity suggests that it intended the provision to encompass actions brought by tribes in their corporate capacity as well. Furthermore, this court has held that \u201cstatutes passed for the benefit of Indian tribes, <em>such as section 1362, </em>are to be liberally construed, with doubtful expressions being resolved in the Indians\u2019 favor.\u201d <em>Gila River Indian Community v.

In that case, we held that a utility company that was loosely affiliated with the Navajo Tribe could not bring an action as an \u201cIndian tribe or band\u201d under section 1362, since the utility company was semi-autonomous, three of its seven directors were not members of the Tribe, and the Tribe itself was \u201cnot a party\u201d to the action. <em>Id. </em>at 1231-32.

This issue is irrelevant to the disposition of the present case. The Tribe did not litigate its fourteenth amendment claims in the Arizona state courts, and therefore could not have raised them in the <em>Bracker </em>appeal.

The majority maintains that the Tribe\u2019s fourteenth amendment claims, in contrast to Pinetop\u2019s, arise out of the Tribe\u2019s \"status as a sovereign\" and are based on the assumption that the Tribe is entitled to receive \u201cbeneficial [or preferential] treatment\" above and beyond that of other individuals and entities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-18\">However, the majority has misinterpreted the Tribe\u2019s due process and equal protection claims and has confused them with the preemption claim it advanced in <em>Bracker. </em>Although the underlying premise of the Tribe\u2019s preemption claim in <em>Bracker </em>was that the State must accord <em>special </em>treatment to the Tribe\u2019s timberlands and cannot regulate them to the same extent as it regulates other timberlands, <em>see generally Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 145-53, 100 S.Ct. at 2584-89, the Tribe\u2019s fourteenth amendment claims in this action are based on the allegation that Arizona has impermissibly discriminated against the Tribe and singled it out by taxing it <em>differently </em>from other landowners in the state without any apparent rational justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-19\">The Tribe has raised its fourteenth amendment claims in its capacity as a corporation seeking to make commercial use of its reservation lands. <em>See </em>Section D, <em>infra. </em>Its due process and equal protection claims are identical to those that any corporate entity would raise if it were treated disparately under a state taxing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>scheme. These claims have nothing to do with the Tribe\u2019s status as a sovereign entity. They arise out of the Tribe\u2019s joint commercial venture with Pinetop, <em>see id., </em>and are therefore identical to any fourteenth amendment claims that Pine-top would be entitled to raise as a corporation. Therefore, any statements in the <em>Bracker </em>dissent relating to possible due process and equal protection claims available to Pinetop would be equally applicable to the Tribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">. <em>See </em>the discussion relating to the Tribe\u2019s corporate or propriety capacity in Section D, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">. The majority asserts that the challenged Arizona taxes are typically assessed \"without apportionment\u201d between mileage driven on state-maintained roads and non-state-maintained roads for entities or landowners based in Arizona. Majority opinion at 1215 n. 13. Thus, according to the majority, the Tribe is not entitled under Arizona law to have the taxes chargeable to its and Pinetop\u2019s timber operations apportioned, and its demand for tax apportionment in its complaint represents a request for <em>preferential treatment, </em>as opposed to <em>equal protection. Id. </em>The majority interprets the Tribe's equal protection claim as alleging that the Tribe and Pinetop are constitutionally entitled to be treated \"in the same manner as interstate truckers\" passing through Arizona, and that the \"tribal roads [on its reservation] should be treated as though they [are] in a separate state.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-8\">However, the majority has misinterpreted the challenged Arizona taxing scheme, and oversimplified the Tribe\u2019s equal protection claim. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, Arizona\u2019s fuel taxes are assessed for in-state taxpayers based upon the types of roads on which they use their vehicles. Section 28-1552 provides that \"an excise tax [shall be] imposed [at the rate of eight cents per gallon] <em>on use fuel used </em>in the propulsion of a motor vehicle <em>on any highway </em>within this state.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 28-1552 (1985) (emphasis added); <em>see Bracker, </em>448 U.S. at 139-40, 100 S.Ct. at 2581. Thus,. according to the plain terms of this and other provisions, Arizona\u2019s use fuel tax is imposed only for gasoline used by taxpayers to travel on state-maintained highways \u2014 it is not assessed based upon their total mileage during the year. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 28-1551(4) (1985) (defining \u201chighway\" to mean only those roads <em>\"open to the use of the public </em>\u201d), \u00a7 28-1578 (authorizing refund of use fuel tax to \u201c[a]ny person who purchases tax paid use fuel and ... uses it in this state for purposes <em>other than to propel a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state\") </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Ariz.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 28-1555(B)(l) (taxpayers can obtain written authorization not to pay use fuel tax to vendors and instead to self-assess tax if they \"operate a motor vehicle [either] within and without this state or <em>on and off the highways of this state </em>\u201d), \u00a7 28-1556 (establishing <em>rebuttable presumption </em>that all fuel inserted into a vehicle\u2019s gas tank is \"consumed in propelling the vehicle <em>on the highways of this state </em>\u2019\u2019) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-12\">Moreover, Arizona\u2019s assistant attorney general made a series of statements and concessions during the Supreme Court argument in <em>Bracker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>indicating that Arizona apportions mileage when assessing its challenged taxes. He stated initially that \" 'so long as road[s] remain! ] private thoroughfare[s, the] use of those road[s] would not be subject to the State tax.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bracket </em>448 U.S. at 154 n. 3, 100 S.Ct. at 2589 n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting Assistant Attorney General Macpherson). Yet, if the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Arizona tax statutes is correct, taxpayers would not be permitted to apportion their taxes based upon their relative use of state highways and other roads, and their use of \"private thoroughfare[s]\" would be taxed so long as they also used state highways at some point during the year. Furthermore, Arizona conceded during the Supreme Court argument that it did not intend to \"tax use on ... tribal roads\u201d regardless of the state courts\u2019 prior decisions on the matter, and the Tribe\u2019s attorney welcomed this concession. <em>Id. </em>at 154-56 &amp; n. 4, 100 S.Ct. at 2589-90 &amp; n. 4 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting attorneys Macpherson and Wake); <em>see id. </em>at 148 n. 14, 100 S.Ct. at 2589-90 n. 14. This concession would have been meaningless if, as the majority contends, Arizona\u2019s taxes were determined without apportionment, because the Tribe admitted that it and Pinetop used state highways and B.I.A. roads in their operations. <em>Id. </em>at 154 n. 2, 100 S.Ct. at 2589 n. 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The three Justices dissenting in <em>Braeker </em>expressly noted that Arizona\u2019s concessions regarding tribal and private roads would reduce the taxes owed by Pinetop and the Tribe: thus, they expressly interpreted the Arizona statutes to authorize apportionment of mileage in determining the amount of taxes owed. <em>See id. </em>at 159 &amp; n. 8, 100 S.Ct. at 2591 &amp; n. 8 (Stevens, J., dissenting). For all these reasons, it seems clear that Arizona assesses at least some of its challenged taxes based upon the road-use of the individual taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">The Tribe\u2019s equal protection claim in this action arises out of Arizona\u2019s refusal to apportion the Tribe\u2019s and Pinetop\u2019s mileage in assessing their fuel taxes, even though it apportions mileage for \u201cother operations that occur in part over state roads and part over non-state roads.\u201d First Amended Complaint, 1f XXIII. Despite the majority\u2019s claims, these \"other operations\u201d include Arizona-based as well as non-Arizona-based individuals and entities. The subsequent reference in the Tribe\u2019s complaint to \"carriers that operate [only] partly in the State of Arizona,\u201d upon which the majority relies, does not signify that the Tribe\u2019s equal protection claim is entirely premised upon the treatment received by \"interstate truckers,\u201d as the majority contends \u2014 it merely states an alternative equal protection argument. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1319-9\">. The majority asserts that because the challenged Arizona use fuel tax \"is expressly levied \u2018in lieu of direct fuel taxes,\u201d it is therefore \"analytically indistinguishable from a direct fuel tax.\u201d The majority contends as a result that the Tribe cannot challenge Arizona\u2019s unequal imposition of the use fuel tax, because it could \"not seriously contend that Arizona should be forced to apportion direct fuel taxes collected at the pump.\u201d Majority opinion at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-10\">This argument is seriously flawed. The fact that a state can conceivably tax an individual or entity under one tax scheme does not automatically entitle it to impose taxes upon that individual or entity under a different tax scheme when other similarly situated individuals or entities are not being taxed under that scheme. Otherwise, there could never be due process or equal protection challenges to state taxing schemes, because it would always be possible to hypothesize situations in which the victims of alleged discriminatory treatment could be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">Arizona chose to adopt its use fuel tax. It is responsible for administering that tax in an evenhanded, non-discriminatory fashion that will withstand due process and equal protection scrutiny. If Arizona chooses to change to a direct fuel tax so that it can tax the Tribe and other private landowners for fuel used on non-state-maintained roads and private property, it certainly would be entitled to do so. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>the fact that Arizona could conceivably change its tax system does not affect the resolution of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">. The Tax Anti-Injunction Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-7\">[Federal] district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Courts have recognized a limited exception to this provision for \"Indian Tribes.\u201d <em>See Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, </em>425 U.S. 463, 472-75, 96 S.Ct. 1634, 1640-42, 48 L.Ed.2d 96 (1976); <em>see also </em>Section D, <em>infra. </em>Since the Anti-Injunction Act applies only to actions brought in <em>federal court, </em>had the Tribe chosen to raise its section 1983 claims in its parallel state-court action, section 1341 would not have served as a bar to its section 1983 claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">. A tribe\u2019s ability to bring an action in federal court challenging the imposition of state taxes depends on the capacity in which the tribe initiates the litigation and the basis of the tribe's standing to bring such a challenge. The Supreme Court indicated in <em>Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, </em>425 U.S. 463, 96 S.Ct. 1634, 48 L.Ed.2d 96 (1976), that in actions involving challenges to the imposition of state taxes, the source of parties\u2019 standing to bring the actions must coincide with the basis on which subject-matter jurisdiction is asserted. <em>See id. </em>at 468 n. 7, 96 S.Ct. at 1639 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"Ara\">In the present action, the Tribe\u2019s standing is based upon its proprietary, corporate activities; as a result, in order tb maintain its action, the Tribe must be entitled to bring a section 1983 action and must qualify for the \"Indian tribes\u201d exception to section 1341 while acting in its corporate capacity. The Tribe could also have challenged Arizona\u2019s taxes in its sovereign, governmental capacity, if the imposition of those taxes adversely affected its exercise of its powers of self-government, or if the taxes were imposed on the Tribe\u2019s governmental operations. <em>See id.; see also Assiniboine &amp; Sioux Tribes v. Montana, </em>568 F.Supp. 269, 276 (D.Mont.1983) (tribal vehicles had to be taxed for Tribe to have standing to seek refund under <em>Moe). </em>Such an action would clearly not be barred by section 1341. <em>See, e.g., Moe, </em>425 U.S. at 474-75, 96 S.Ct. at 1641-42. However, it is doubtful whether the Tribe qua sovereign would qualify as a \"citizen of the United States or other person\" eligible to bring an action under section 1983 for deprivation of its rights, privileges, or immunities. <em>See City of Safety Harbor v. Birchfield, </em>529 F.2d 1251, 1253-55 (5th Cir. 1976) (municipality is not a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to bring section 1983 action); <em>Buda v. Saxbe, </em>406 F.Supp. 399, 403 (E.D.Tenn.1974) (a \"state is not a \u2018... citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof ...\u2019 within the contemplation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d); <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 459 N.E.2d 80, 83-84 (1983) (city housing authority cannot bring section 1983 action to enforce due process or equal protection rights); <em>see also City of South Lake Tahoe v.

(\u201c\u2018[pjolitical subdivisions of a state may not challenge the validity of a state statute under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1039, 101 S.Ct. 619, 66 L.Ed.2d 502 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-13\">Similarly, the Tribe could have brought an action challenging Arizona's vehicle taxes as a representative of or as <em>parens patriae </em>for its individual members, in order to vindicate their individual rights. <em>See, e.g., Assiniboine &amp; Sioux Tribes, </em>568, F.Supp. at 277; <em>see also Little Earth of United Tribes, Inc. v. United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, </em>584 F.Supp, 1292, 1295-97 (D.Minn.1983). When acting solely in a representative capacity, a tribe's standing is based exclusively upon the standing of its individual members: the tribe simply raises claims that its members could raise individually, and essentially stands in the same position as they would, had they brought the action collectively. <em>See International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America v. Brock, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2523, 91 L.Ed.2d 228 (1986); <em>Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission, </em>432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977); <em>United States v.

Thus, the Tribe would clearly be entitled to bring a section 1983 action based upon alleged violations of its members' due process and equal protection rights, or their rights under the Indian reservation timber laws. <em>See, e.g., Thompson v. New York, </em>487 F.Supp. 212, 216 (N.D.N.Y. 1979) (individual Indians can maintain section 1983 actions based on alleged violations of their equal protection rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">However, it would appear inconsistent with our prior decisions to allow tribes suing merely as representatives of their individual members to avoid the bar of section 1341. We have held that the \"Indian tribes\u201d exception to section 1341 does not apply to suits brought by individual Indians, <em>see Comenout v. Washington, </em>722 F.2d 574, 577 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Dillon v. Montana, </em>634 F.2d 463, 469 (9th Cir.1980), or by Indian entities that are less than, full-scale \"Indian tribefs] or band[s],\u201d as that phrase is used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362 (1982). <em>See Navajo Tribal Utility Authority v. Arizona Department of Revenue, </em>608 F.2d 1228, 1231 (9th Cir.1979). In light of these decisions, authorizing Indian tribes to bring representative actions in federal court challenging the collection of state taxes on behalf of their members would undermine and perhaps trivialize section 1341 by enabling individual Indians to avoid section 1341\u2019s bar simply by having their tribe bring a \"representative\u201d action on their behalf. <em>See Assiniboine &amp; Sioux Tribes, </em>568 F.Supp. at 277. Moreover, the Supreme Court noted in <em>Moe </em>that if standing to bring an action challenging the imposition of state taxes is based exclusively upon the rights of individual tribal members, those tribal members must be authorized to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts in their own right. <em>See Moe, </em>425 U.S. at 468 n. 7, 96 S.Ct. at 1639 n. 7 (citing <em>Zahn v. International Paper Co., </em>414 U.S. 291, 294, 94 S.Ct. 505, 508, 38 L.Ed.2d 511 (1973)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">.
