Zachary Agran. We reinstate the original panel opinion, 778 F.2d 649 (11th Cir. 1985), as to all issues except the Agran issue, designated in the original opinion as headnote three. Concerning that issue we substitute the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-19\">Balogh\u2019s asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony and written statement of A. Zachary Agran, a former employee of Mayor\u2019s. While seeking employment with Balogh\u2019s in January 1980, Agran allegedly made statements that generally inculpated Mayor\u2019s and Rolex in the conspiracy alleged in Balogh\u2019s complaint. Agran initialed a statement handwritten by Balogh\u2019s counsel, and at that time or thereafter there was written at the end of the statement the following: \u201cDated January 4,1980 Gloria Lazar Notary.\u201d The notary seal was present along with the date of expiration for the notary\u2019s commission, but there was no certification that the writing was sworn to and subscribed before the notary. Agran contends that he did not read the handwritten statement before initialing it, that there was no notary present at that time, and that the statement was not notarized in his presence. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney later mailed Agran a typed copy for his signature, but Agran did not sign. He testified that the typewritten statement was inaccurate, that he tore it up and threw it away and that he heard nothing further from the attorney. In February 1984 Agran gave Mayor\u2019s counsel an affidavit recanting the statement purportedly made four years earlier. On application for rehearing, Balogh\u2019s presses as its primary contention that the handwritten statement initialed by Agran should have been admitted by the trial court under the residual hearsay exception, Fed.R.Evid. 803(24).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>We note first that prior notarized statements may be admitted under Rule 803(24) at the trial judge\u2019s discretion. Admission of a sworn statement by a \u201cturncoat witness\u201d is an appropriate application of that rule. We will not disturb a trial judge\u2019s determination as to admissibility of evidence on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Baylor v. Jefferson County Board of Education, </em>733 F.2d 1527, 1533 (11th Cir.1984). A district court has considerable discretion in determining admissibility under Rule 803(24), and we are particularly hesitant to overturn a trial court\u2019s admissibility ruling under the residual hearsay exception absent a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the court made a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached based upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Page v. Barko Hydraulics, </em>673 F.2d 134, 140 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">Outside the presence of the jury, the trial judge in this case took testimony from Agran and heard the plaintiffs\u2019 proffer concerning their version of the facts touching on the admissibility of the writing. The court excluded Agran\u2019s testimony and the subsequent proffer, and denied plaintiffs\u2019 request to have the writing admitted under Rule 803(24). Sharp factual dispute exists concerning the \u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d of the handwritten statement. We conclude that the trial court properly considered the factors for admission under Rule 803(24), and we are not convinced that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors and making its ruling. The record indicates that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, and we affirm the denial of the statement\u2019s admission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1447-16\">. Fed.R.Evid. 803(24) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-17\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness: ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-20\">(24) Other exceptions. A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court- deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>mines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, his intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">. The original panel in this case understood plaintiffs\u2019 primary contention to be that plaintiffs were entitled to call Agran to the stand and impeach him with the earlier written statement under Fed.R.Evid. 607. The panel affirmed the district court\u2019s contrary ruling under Rule 607 and correctly based its decision on <em>Whitehurst v. Wright, </em>592 F.2d 834 (5th Cir.1979). We adhere to <em>Whitehurst\u2019s </em>holding that under Rule 607 a witness may not be called solely for the purpose of impeaching him and thereby obtaining otherwise inadmissible testimony. Assuming arguendo that this issue was sufficiently preserved and properly before this court, we conclude that the district court ruled appropriately in excluding Agran\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 839. We note that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilson v. City of Aliceville, </em>779 F.2d 631 (11th Cir.1986), is inapposite. In <em>Wilson </em>the court reversed the district court\u2019s exclusion of a witness\u2019 prior written statement that was later disavowed. <em>Id. </em>at 637. The district court\u2019s ruling, however, had been based on Fed.R.Evid. 403. Neither the trial court nor the party opposing the statement\u2019s admission objected to its admission on the basis of its being hearsay. <em>'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-18\">We also note that plaintiffs in this case have never offered Agran\u2019s written statement as a prior inconsistent statement under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A), and we therefore do not rule on its admissibility as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
