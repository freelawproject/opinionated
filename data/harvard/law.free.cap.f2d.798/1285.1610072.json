Stodd, Trustee in the Chapter 7 case of Anderson-Walker Industries, Inc. (the \u201cDebtor\u201d), appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the Trustee\u2019s Objection to Claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AKo\">In April 1980, the Debtor filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Lafayette Metals, Inc. (\u201cLafayette\u201d) had shipped raw materials to the Debtor over a period of several years preceding the filing of the petition. On its schedules, the Debt- or listed Lafayette as the single largest creditor and indicated Lafayette was owed about $208,000. Lafayette continued to ship to the Debtor raw materials after the filing on a cash-against-delivery basis. Lafayette\u2019s credit manager was appointed to serve on the creditors\u2019 committee during the Debtor\u2019s Chapter 11 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">In September 1980, the Debtor\u2019s case was converted to a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7. A Trustee was appointed and notice was sent to all scheduled creditors (including Lafayette) advising that to participate in dividends they were required to file a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court on or before May 6, 1981. Lafayette did not file a formal proof of claim within that period. Lafayette filed a formal proof of claim, labeled \u201cAmended Proof of Claim\u201d on March 3, 1983 stating, \u201cTHIS PROOF OF CLAIM AMENDS THAT DATED DECEMBER 17, 1980.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">Lafayette\u2019s December 17, 1980 \u201cproof of claim\u201d (sent within the six-month period ending May 6, 1981) was in the form of a letter sent to the Trustee\u2019s attorney written by Lafayette\u2019s credit manager in response to the attorney\u2019s collection letter demanding $960 due the Debtor. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-7\">This letter confirms receipt of your collection letter of December 16, 1980, requesting payment on an amount due to Anderson-Walker. As you may or may not know, the estate owes Lafayette $243,000. Our transaction with Anderson-Walker was based on a <em>Contra </em>basis as is noted on the invoice attached. Therefore, we would request that on the disbursement of funds from the estate, that this deduction be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">A balance sheet indicating the amount owed by the Debtor was attached to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">In March 1981, the credit manager again wrote to the Trustee requesting information concerning the status of the Anderson-Walker case, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">[P]lease respond to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-11\">1. Estimated amount to be disbursed to unsecured creditors after legal and accounting fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-12\">2. Total unsecured creditors claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-13\">3. Estimated date of payout.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-14\">This information is vital as our auditors are concerned with the amount we have reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-15\">The Trustee\u2019s response was handwritten on the same letter and sent by mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-16\">There is no way I can answer any of these questions until the time for filing claims expires and all claims have been examined and resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-17\">In January 1983, Lafayette received a notice from the Credit Managers Association stating that \u201cthe Trustee advises that funds on hand are sufficient to pay in full the principal amount of each allowed claim.\u201d However, the Trustee subsequently advised Lafayette that because it did not file a formal proof of claim within the filing period, Lafayette would not participate in the dividends. As noted, in March 1983 Lafayette filed a formal proof of claim, \u201camending\u201d its letter of December 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-18\">The Trustee filed an objection to the \u201camended\u201d proof of claim with the bankruptcy court. He argued that the December 1980 letter could not be considered a timely and valid proof of claim and hence the March 1983 \u201camendment\u201d was invalid. The bankruptcy court denied the Trustee\u2019s objection, finding, among other things, that \u201ccommunications disclosing the nature and extent of the claim and intention to hold the Estate liable for the claim took place during the period to file claims.\u201d The bankruptcy court subsequently denied the Trustee\u2019s motion for reconsideration and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">Because we are in as good a position as the district court to review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings, we independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>In re Acequia, Inc., </em>787 F.2d 1352, 1357 (9th Cir.1986). Whether the documents filed by Lafayette, considered in conjunction with Lafayette\u2019s conduct, constitute an amendable informal proof of claim is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>See In re Pizza of Hawaii, Inc., </em>761 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(Pizza of Hawaii); In re Sambo\u2019s Restaurants, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 811, 815 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(Sambo\u2019s).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\">The Trustee raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that Lafayette failed to satisfy the requirements set out in our cases for the filing of an amended proof of claim. <em>See In re Franciscan Vineyards, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 181, 182-83 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam) <em>(Franciscan Vinyards), cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 915, 100 S.Ct. 1274, 63 L.Ed.2d 598 (1980); <em>Sun Basin Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 48, 49-50 (9th Cir.1970) (per curiam) <em>(Sun Basin). </em>Second, he argues that even if Lafayette filed an informal claim, it did not satisfy the \"misdelivery\u201d exception of former Bankruptcy Rule 509(c) (repealed 1983 and repromulgated as Bankruptcy Rule 5005(b)). <em>See In re Evanston Motor Co., </em>735 F.2d 1029, 1031-32 (7th Cir.1984) <em>(Evanston Motor). </em>We consider each contention separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">A. <em>Informal Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-11\">Our cases have consistently applied the \u201cso-called rule of liberality in amendments\u201d to creditors\u2019 proofs of claim. <em>Franciscan Vineyards, </em>597 F.2d at 182 <em>(quoting In re Patterson-MacDonald Shipbuilding Co., </em>293 F. 190, 191 (9th Cir. 1923)). For a document to constitute an informal proof of claim, it must state an explicit demand showing the nature and amount of the claim against the estate, and evidence an intent to hold the debtor liable. <em>Sambo\u2019s, </em>754 F.2d at 815. The reason for this \u201cliberal\u201d rule is elemental. Bankruptcy courts are courts of equity, and must assure \u201cthat substance will not give way to form, [and] that technical considerations will not prevent substantial justice from being done.\u201d <em>Pepper v. Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 305, 60 S.Ct. 238, 244, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939); <em>In re International Horizons, Inc., </em>751 F.2d 1213, 1216 (11th Cir.1985). The \u201cliberal\u201d rule reflects our preference for resolution on the merits, as against strict adherence to formalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-13\">In <em>Sun Basin, </em>432 F.2d 48, a secured creditor did not file a formal proof of claim within the statutory period, but did file an objection to the trustee\u2019s petition to sell the property subject to his lien. We held that the creditor\u2019s objection, filed within the statutory period, \u201cfairly reflect[ed]\u201d the existence of a claim against the bankrupt, and hence was a valid and amendable informal proof of claim. <em>Id. </em>at 49. We stated: \u201cHere the intention to collect from the estate was implicit in the recitations that the debt existed, that it was past due, that [the creditor] proposed to realize on the security, that the amount due exceeded the security\u2019s market value, and that the bankrupt was obligated to pay the anticipated deficiency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">In <em>Franciscan Vineyards, </em>597 F.2d 181, we followed <em>Sun Basin </em>and ruled for the creditor on facts similar to this case. There, the bankrupt owed the County of Napa (\u201cCounty\u201d) tax arrearages. The County did not file a formal proof of claim within the statutory period, but did send a letter to the Trustee enclosing two tax bills and stating: \u201cThe assessments are against the old Franciscan Vineyards, and we understand you are handling their affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182 n. 1. The County argued that the letter constituted an amendable informal proof of claim. We emphasized that a creditor need not show that the document was a proof of claim. Rather, the creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>need only show \u201cthat a demand [was] made against the estate, and must show the creditor\u2019s intention to hold the estate liable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183 <em>(quoting In re Hotel St. James Co., </em>65 F.2d 82, 83 (9th Cir.1933)). We also stated that the Trustee must read and \u201creasonably construe\u201d the documents sent by a creditor. <em>Id. </em>We held that the County\u2019s letter sufficiently described the debt and implicitly expressed an intent to collect from the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">Lafayette's letter of December 17th falls within <em>Sun Basin </em>and <em>Franciscan Vineyards. </em>The letter unambiguously states the existence and amount of the debt, that the Debtor owed this sum to Lafayette, and that it had not been paid. Lafayette attached to the letter and made reference to an invoice describing the debt. As in <em>Franciscan Vineyards, </em>the letter here contains much of the pertinent information required to be filed in a formal proof of claim. 597 F.2d at 182. <em>See also </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501; Bankr.R. 301(a) (repealed 1983). Further, the Trustee was under a duty.to \u201creasonably construe\u201d Lafayette\u2019s communication. <em>Id. </em>at 183. The Trustee knew that Lafayette was the Debtor\u2019s single largest creditor, that Lafayette was concerned with the status of its claim and the date that payment would be forthcoming, and that Lafayette had taken an active and continuing role in the Debtor\u2019s bankruptcy and business. Lafayette\u2019s active participation in the bankruptcy court proceedings may be considered in determining whether its December 17th letter was an amendable informal proof of claim. <em>Pizza of Hawaii, </em>761 F.2d at 1380. Lafayette\u2019s letter, \u201creasonably construed\u201d in light of these facts, strongly implies Lafayette\u2019s intention to collect on the debt. We agree with the bankruptcy court that the December 17th letter was an amendable informal proof of claim. <em>See Sambo\u2019s, </em>754 F.2d at 816 (discussing <em>Franciscan Vineyards, </em>and noting that letter sent by that claimant to debtor\u2019s attorney would constitute a valid informal claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">B. <em>Bankruptcy Rule 509(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">We next consider the Trustee\u2019s argument that Lafayette was required to prove it directed the December 17th letter to the bankruptcy court but instead mistakenly delivered it to the Trustee. The Trustee relies on former Bankruptcy Rule 509(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-7\">A paper intended to be filed but erroneously delivered to the trustee or receiver, or the attorney for either of them, or to the district judge, referee, or clerk of the district court, shall, after the date of its receipt has been noted thereon, be transmitted forthwith to the proper person. In the interest of justice the court may order that the paper shall be deemed filed as of the date of its original delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">Bankr.R. 509(c) (repealed 1983, current version at 5005(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">We recognize that Rule 509(c) might be construed to support the Trustee\u2019s interpretation. <em>See Evanston Motor, </em>735 F.2d at 1031-32. But the language of the Rule does not dictate the Trustee\u2019s construction. The Rule does not state that the creditor (or other sender) must direct the paper to the bankruptcy court but mistakenly send it to a trustee or another official. Rather, the Rule requires an \u201cin-ten[t]\u201d to file a paper, and an \u201ceroneousf ] delivery]\u201d to an official. Bankr.R. 509(c). As we interpret this language, the Rule only requires that the creditor intend that the paper will become a part of the bankruptcy court proceedings and receive some official action. A creditor who sends a paper to a court-appointed trustee or other official, under circumstances that the sender can be said to have acted with an expectation that it receive an official response, has done so with an intent that the paper is being \u201cfiled.\u201d The sender is in error, however, because the paper should have been \u201cfiled\u201d with the bankruptcy court. The sender has thus \u201cintended to ... [file] but erroneously delivered [the paper] to the trustee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the \u201cinterests of justice,\u201d a bankruptcy court may then \u201cdeem\u201d that the paper has been filed on time. <em>Id. </em>Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>strued in this manner, Rule 509(c) is fully consistent with our prior case-law regarding the filing of amended proofs of claim. <em>See Sambo\u2019s, </em>754 F.2d at 816 (reaffirming the continuing vitality of <em>Franciscan Vineyards).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\">The history of Rule 509(c) substantiates our construction of this Rule. Rule 509(c) was preceded by General Order 21(1), which provided that \u201c[pjroofs of claim received by any trustee shall be delivered to the referee to whom the case is referred.\u201d <em>See </em>4B J. Moore &amp; L. King, <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>18-21, at 1535-36 (14th ed. 1978) [hereinafter <em>Collier </em>]. Neither General Order 21(1) nor the case-law interpreting it required that the creditor have filed the proof of claim under a misapprehension that it had been filed with the bankruptcy court. <em>See </em>3 &amp; 12 <em>Collier, supra </em>\u00b6 57.11, at 202-17, &amp; \u00b6 509.11, at 5-68 to 5-71. <em>See also Franciscan Vineyards, </em>597 F.2d at 183 (discussing case-law). The drafters of Rule 509(c) did not intend that it would alter the former practices regarding amended proofs of claim. Although Rule 509(c) applies to all \u201cpapers,\u201d the Advisory Committee (which drafted the Rule) expressly stated that the Rule was intended as \u201can extension of the rule of practice prescribed in the last sentence of General Order 21(1) respecting proofs of claim delivered to the trustee. See 3 Collier \u00b6 57.10 (1961).\u201d <em>See </em>Bankr.R. 509(c) Advisory Committee Note (repealed 1983). The Advisory Committee\u2019s reference to the prior practices under former General Order 21(1) belies any intent to adopt the construction suggested by the Trustee. <em>See </em>3 <em>Collier, supra </em>\u00b6 57.11, at 202-17 (cited by the Advisory Committee; discussing rules governing filing of amended proofs of claim, consistent with our holdings in <em>Franciscan Vineyards </em>and its progeny).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">We must therefore reject the Trustee\u2019s interpretation of Rule 509(c) as inconsistent with our case law and a fair reading of the Rule and its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
