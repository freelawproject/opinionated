In contract negotiations with the Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC or the agency), the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Council of Locals No. 214 (AFGE or the union) proposed to allow twelve employees in a bargaining unit of 72,311 to spend their entire paid duty time performing representational activities on behalf of the union. AFGE presently seeks review of a decision by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) that this bargaining proposal was negotiable only at the election of AFLC. Although section 7131(d) of the FSLMR provides for the granting of official time in any amount jointly agreed upon by the agency and the union, the FLRA ruled that section 7131(d) must be subordinated to section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, which reserves to the agency the choice of whether to negotiate on \u201cthe numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty\u201d of the agency. The FLRA concluded that because AFGE\u2019s official time proposal was integrally related to the number of employees or positions assigned to an agency work project or organizational entity, it was negotiable only at the election of the agency. <em>See American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Locals No. 214 and Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, </em>19 F.L.R.A. 215 (1985). We find that the FLRA\u2019s decision deprives section 7131(d) of any reasonable meaning. Accordingly, we reject the FLRA\u2019s statutory construction and vacate its negotiability decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-13\">AFGE is the exclusive representative of the more than 72,000 civilians employed nationwide at bases of the Air Force Logistics Command. In the course of negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement between AFGE and AFLC, the union proposed that sixty union representatives at the various AFLC bases be granted 100% official time. A grant of official time allows employees to be paid as if they were performing their normal duties whenever they perform representative functions during the working day. AFLC declared this proposal to be outside of its statutory duty to bargain, and the union petitioned the FLRA for review of this assertion of non-negotiability. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7105(a)(2)(E), 7117(c). Before the FLRA issued its negotiability decision, the union\u2019s proposal was modified to provide for only twelve full-time representatives. It was this modified proposal that the FLRA finally considered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>In evaluating the negotiability of this bargaining proposal, the FLRA first determined, as a factual matter, that the direct effect of permitting twelve employees to perform union representational activities would be to \u201cnecessitate a reallocation of positions and employees, forcing changes in [AFLC\u2019s] staffing patterns.\u201d 19 F.L.R.A. at 221. Because the proposal would effectively reduce the number of employees available to perform the tasks of any work project, and because, under the facts of this case, AFLC was unable to \u201cdividfe] among the remaining employees the tasks of the employee who assumes full-time Union responsibilities,\u201d the effect of AFGE\u2019s proposal was \u201cto require management, in order to maintain staffing levels, to add positions or employees to the work project or organizational entity from which an employee is designated to serve as a full-time Union representative.\u201d 19 F.L.R.A. at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-4\">The FLRA then considered the relationship between two potentially conflicting provisions of the FSLMR bearing on the negotiability issue. The FLRA noted that when considered in isolation, section 7131(d) clearly indicated that the union\u2019s proposal was negotiable. Section 7131(d) provides that \u201cany employee representing an exclusive representative ... shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7131(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FLRA found a conflict, however, between this section and section 7106, the \u201cManagement Rights\u201d provision of the Statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which lists a variety of managerial prerogatives about which the agency may, but need not, negotiate. Under section 7106(b)(1), an agency may negotiate <em>at its election </em>\u201con the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-13\">In determining whether a bargaining proposal falls within section 7106(b)(1) prior FLRA decisions have applied a \u201cdirect effects test.\u201d <em>See, e.g., American Federar tion of Government Employees, Local 3669 and Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1528\">*1528</page-number>F.L.R.A. 641 (1980). Under this test, a proposal that \u201cis directly or integrally related to the numbers, types and grades of employees or positions assigned to a work project, organizational entity or tour of duty, so as to be determinative of such numbers, types and grades, is negotiable [only] at the election of the agency.\u201d <em>See </em>19 F.L.R.A. at 219. The FLRA reasoned that because in this case the direct effect of AFGE\u2019s proposal would be to require a reallocation of positions and employees and force changes in AFLC\u2019s staffing patterns, the union\u2019s proposal was \u201cintegrally related to, so as to be determinative of,\u201d the numbers of employees assigned to a work project, organizational entity or tour of duty. 19 F.L.R.A. at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">The FLRA resolved the conflict between the rights reserved to management by section 7106(b)(1) and the union\u2019s right to negotiate for official time as provided under section 7131(d) in favor of the agency. La-belling its statutory construction an \u201caccommodation\u201d between management\u2019s right to accomplish its mission and the union\u2019s right to perform its representational function, the FLRA concluded that \u201cwhere the agency can show, in the circumstances of a given case, that the use of official time will interfere with the accomplishment of the agency\u2019s work, the exercise of management\u2019s rights will take precedence.\u201d 19 F.L.R.A. at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"Arv\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1618-6\">Congress has entrusted the FLRA with the primary responsibility for administering and interpreting the FSLMR. The FLRA was intended to develop specialized expertise in the field of federal labor relations and to use this expertise to give content to the Statute\u2019s principles and goals. <em>See Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, </em>464 U.S. 89, 97, 104 S.Ct. 439, 444, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983). Consequently, the FLRA\u2019s interpretation of its Statute, if reasonable, is entitled to deference. <em>See American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>778 F.2d 850, 856 (D.C.Cir.1985). Where Congress has not spoken to the question at issue, a court must affirm the agency\u2019s construction of its statute if that construction is \u201cpermissible.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-8\">The deference due to the FLRA\u2019s interpretation, however, \u201c\u2018cannot'be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia which results in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress.\u2019\u201d <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, </em>464 U.S. at 97, 104 S.Ct. at 444 (quoting <em>American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, </em>380 U.S. 300, 318, 85 S.Ct. 955, 967, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965)). A court must not \u201crubber-stamp\u201d an agency\u2019s statutory construction if that construction is inconsistent with a statutory mandate or frustrates a congressional policy underlying the statute. <em>See Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, </em>464 U.S. at 97, 104 S.Ct. at 444; <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>750 F.2d 143, 146 (D.C.Cir.1984). Where an agency\u2019s interpretation would deprive a statutory provision of virtually all effect, a court should not affirm the agency\u2019s interpretation absent \u201clegislative history of exceptional clarity.\u201d <em>American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2782 v. FLRA, </em>702 F.2d 1183, 1187 (D.C.Cir.1983). In the instant case, we find that even under the deferential standard of <em>Chevron, </em>the FLRA\u2019s interpretation of the Statute is an impermissible one. It ignores the familiar canon that statutes should be construed \u201cto give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\u201d <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979); <em>see also Washington Hospital Center v. Bowen, </em>795 F.2d 139, 145 (D.C.Cir.1986). The result of the FLRA\u2019s construction here is to drain the official time provision of any reasonable meaning and thus to frustrate the intent of Congress. We therefore reject the FLRA\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>B. <em>The Effects of Official Time</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUI\">We find nothing in the record to contradict the FLRA\u2019s conclusion that in the specific circumstances of this case the direct effect of AFGE\u2019s proposal would be to require AFLC to increase the number of employees or positions in certain of its work projects. We conclude, however, that this effect by itself is insufficient to eliminate an agency\u2019s duty to bargain over proposals for official time. Any bargaining proposal concerning official time for representational activities necessarily reduces the number of person-hours available for performing the work of the agency, and therefore has a direct effect on agency staffing patterns. Application of a \u201cdirect effects test\u201d to reach an \u201caccommodation\u201d between section 7106(b)(1) and section 7131(d) will always make official time proposals negotiable only at the agency\u2019s election. The FLRA\u2019s accommodation thus results in an effective repeal of section 7131(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-4\">The FLRA seeks to avoid this critique of its statutory interpretation by stating that for purposes of determining negotiability, it distinguishes between direct and indirect effects on staffing patterns on the basis of whether the agency can accomplish its mission merely by reallocating tasks to existing employees in a work project or whether the agency must hire new employees or reallocate employees or positions from one work project to another. <em>Compare </em>19 F.L.R.A. at 220-22 (finding official time proposal negotiable only at agency\u2019s election) <em>with Overseas Federation of Teachers and Department of Defense Dependent Schools, Mediterranean Region, APO New York, </em>21 F.L.R.A. No. 81 (1986) (finding official time proposal negotiable). This refinement takes us nowhere: if this test were consistently applied to the negotiability of new proposals for official time, its effect would be to make such proposals negotiable at the agency\u2019s election whenever an agency is efficiently run. Any provision for additional official time in an efficiently run organization will require the agency to reassign work to other employees and, if present employees are already busy throughout the day, to hire additional employees to perform these reassigned duties. <em>Cf. National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>793 F.2d 371, 374-75 (D.C. Cir.1986) (FLRA\u2019s reasoning was defective since it would render any proposal concerning working conditions nonnegotiable unless an agency were \u201csquandering its resources\u201d). The FLRA\u2019s interpretation would penalize employees who work productively throughout their working day by denying them any additional amount of official time for union activities, regardless of whether the amount of official time sought is 100% or 1% of an employee\u2019s workday. We cannot attribute any such absurd intent to Congress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1619-7\">In specifically providing for official time, Congress must have envisioned either some reallocation of positions or some additional hiring and hence some limitation in management\u2019s right to determine the number of employees assigned to a work project or organizational subdivision. Otherwise, the official time provision of section 7131(d) would be a dead letter. As Judge Scalia recently wrote in <em>American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2782 v. FLRA, </em>702 F.2d at 1187, \u201c[i]t would require legislative history of exceptional clarity to induce us to adopt an interpretation which ... would deprive [a provision of the FSLMR] of virtually all effect.\u201d <em>See also Washington Hospital Center v. Bow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1530\">*1530</page-number><em>en, </em>795 F.2d 139, at 145 (D.C.Cir.1986). The legislative history in this case fails to indicate that Congress intended any such perverse effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, whatever ambiguities exist in sections 7106(b)(1) and 7131(d), we cannot accept the FLRA\u2019s accommodation as a reasonable one. The FLRA cannot assume that Congress\u2019 explicit provision for official time was not meant to be a meaningful guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\">The FLRA\u2019s generalized concern to protect the ability of agencies to carry out their mission cannot displace a specific congressional provision providing for the negotiability of official time proposals. Although the FLRA presents its \u201cdirect effects\u201d approach as a means of determining on a case-by-case basis whether an official time proposal will interfere with the accomplishment of the agency\u2019s work, the \u201cdirect effects test\u201d in fact isolates only those official time proposals that will require an agency to hire or transfer an employee. Thus, the only impairment of managerial prerogatives against which the FLRA provides protection is the very impairment that Congress must have contemplated in providing for official time at <em>all </em>\u2014 i.e., infringement of management\u2019s right to determine the number of employees in an organizational subdivision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1620-9\">The FLRA\u2019s suggestion that its interpretation is necessary to protect the ability of agencies to function effectively also ignores the express language of section 7131(d). In that section Congress has provided that the agency and the union together should determine the amount of official time \u201creasonable, necessary, and <em>in the public interest\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Congress thus committed the determination of the public interest to the union and the agency together, not to the agency alone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1620-10\">Finally, the FLRA\u2019s prediction of the dire consequences following from a determination that an official time proposal is negotiable reflects a misunderstanding of the concept of negotiability. A finding of negotiability means only that a proposal is a proper subject of bargaining, not that the proposal ought to be implemented on the merits. An agency has no obligation to abandon what it conceives to be the best interests of the agency merely because it must negotiate on an official time proposal. <em>See Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d at 1157.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-4\">We therefore conclude that to the extent that the FLRA considers official time nonnegotiable because it would require an agency to hire another employee or change its staffing pattern, its approach is an unreasonable interpretation of the Statute. Accordingly, we reverse the application of the direct effects test in this situation and remand this case to the FLRA so that it may issue an appropriate remedial order. <em>See also American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2782 v. FLRA, </em>702 F.2d at 1186-88 (rejecting direct effects test for determining when a bargaining proposal permitted under section 7106(b)(3) is barred by section 7106(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-5\">The union contends that the proper remedy in this case is to include retroactively the union\u2019s official time proposal in the existing AFLC-AFGE collective bargaining agreement. This argument relies on an arbitration award handed down before the FLRA\u2019s negotiability decision at issue in this case. When AFLC and AFGE proved unable to reach agreement on the official time proposal and other issues, the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) \u201cdirected that the impasse be referred to mediation-arbitration for resolution.\u201d <em>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Locals, No. 214, </em>18 F.L.R.A. 710, 710 (1985); <em>see also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7119. Under an arbitrator\u2019s direction, AFGE and AFLC eventually reached agreement on all disputed issues except the official time proposal. The arbitrator then determined that the union\u2019s proposal was the \u201cmore reasonable approach to official time\u201d and directed the parties to include the union\u2019s proposal in their collective agreement. The FLRA, however, set aside this award on the ground that the FLRA had not yet determined the negotiability of the disputed official time proposal. Under the FSLMR, only the FLRA and not the FSIP can resolve an agency\u2019s claim of nonnegotiability. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(a)(2)(E); <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>778 F.2d at 854. The FLRA concluded that in imposing the union\u2019s proposal on AFLC the arbitrator had implicitly found the union\u2019s proposal negotiable. His award was therefore contrary to section 7105(a)(2)(E), which vests the FLRA with the sole authority to resolve such negotiability issues. <em>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Locals, No. 214, </em>18 F.L.R.A. 710, 712 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-8\">AFGE argues that an order directing AFLC to bargain with AFGE on its proposal would merely duplicate the earlier process in which its official time proposal was found to be \u201cthe more reasonable approach.\u201d This argument is more properly made to the FLRA in the first instance as it raises issues that the FLRA has not yet had the opportunity to address. The union\u2019s argument turns in part on an interpretation of the original decision to refer the parties\u2019 dispute to arbitration. It seems probable that the arbitrator\u2019s award was intended to take effect only if the FLRA eventually resolved the negotiability issue in favor of the union. Otherwise, the arbitration process was a completely futile exercise. If, however, the FSIP erred in directing that the official time dispute be arbitrated, we leave it to the FLRA to devise an equitable remedy for this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1616-8\">.

The legislative history of the FSLMR consists primarily of \"conflicting generalities, providing assurance, if they are all to be taken at face value, that the proposed bill offers the best of both worlds, fully preserving the prerogatives of federal managers (statements upon which the [FLRA] justly relies) while yet fully promoting collective bargaining on all significant issues (statements which the [FLRA] understandably tends to ignore).\u201d <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Local 2782 </em>v. <em>FLRA, </em>702 F.2d at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-6\">Although the legislative history contains no discussion of the interrelationship between sections 7106(b)(1) and 7131(d), it does indicate that both the Senate and the House contemplated that official time for representational activities would be negotiable. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 112-13 (1978); H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 59 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 2723.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1620-7\">. Although AFLC is subject to congressionally imposed limits on the number of positions available for staffing its work, <em>see </em>19 F.L.R.A. at 220, we need not address today the negotiability of an official time proposal that would require an agency to exceed congressionally imposed limits on staffing in order to maintain the agency\u2019s present level of productivity. The record in this case reveals that AFLC was operating with vacancies. 10 F.L.R.A. at 221. In reaching its negotiability decision, moreover, the FLRA clearly did not rely on section 7117(a), which provides that the duty to bargain does not extend to matters inconsistent with federal law. Had the FLRA relied on section 7117(a) as support for its negotiability decision, it would not, of course, have found the proposal negotiable at AFLC's option: an agency may not negotiate concerning a proposal inconsistent with federal law. The FLRA\u2019s decision thus reveals that the FLRA relied solely on the effect of the proposal on AFLC's staffing pattern. Accordingly, we leave for the FLRA in the first instance the issue of the potential conflict between sections 7117(a) and 7131(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1620-12\">. Moreover, the union\u2019s obligation to bargain in good faith, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7117, sets some limits on the amount of official time that a union may request and thus to some extent protects the agency\u2019s ability to function efficiently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1620-13\">. An examination of section 7106 as a whole reinforces our conclusion that section 7131(d) takes priority over section 7106(b)(1). Section 7106(a) delineates certain management preroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>tives that are not negotiable subjects of bargaining, including the authority of management to determine the organization and number of employees of an agency and to assign work. <em>See American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA, </em>778 F.2d 850, 852-53 (1985). Unless section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106(a), section 7106(a) would preclude any negotiation of official time provisions, since official time always affects an agency\u2019s ability to assign work. If official time proposals are not affected by section 7106(a), however, then they are also not affected by section 7106(b)(1). Section 7106(b)(1) serves only to <em>limit </em>the reach of section 7106(a). Section 7106(b)(1) takes certain management prerogatives listed in section 7106(a) and makes them negotiable at the agency\u2019s election rather than not negotiable at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
