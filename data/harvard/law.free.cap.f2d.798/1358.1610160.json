California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Petitioner was charged and convicted of grand theft in the Circuit Court of the 13th Judicial District, Hillsborough County, Florida. After a long complicated procedural history pursuing state relief, petitioner exhausted his state remedies and applied to the federal district court for habeas corpus relief. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida found that petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights under <em>Faretta </em>had been denied and granted the Great Writ. The State of Florida now appeals from this judgment. Finding a grave violation of petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-8\">I. <em>Facts and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"AC6\">A. <em>The State Court Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aao\">On or about January 17, 1978, the State Attorney of Hillsborough County, Florida filed an information charging Richard T. Dorman (\u201cDorman\u201d or \u201cpetitioner\u201d) with grand theft in the second degree. From the outset of the prosecution, Dorman asserted his desire to proceed pro se, which was continually denied. The involved procedural history of Dorman\u2019s efforts to be his own lawyer is probably best summarized in the following chronology of events:</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-13\">1/17/78 The State of Florida charges \u2022 Dorman with grand theft in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-15\">5/8 to 5/30/78 Dorman files a series of pro se pretrial motions in preparation for trial, all of which were either denied or ignored. Dorman\u2019s request to proceed pro se was expressly denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-17\">6/6/78 Dorman sends a letter to the trial judge, Hon. Harry L. Coe III, requesting the dismissal of the public defender, Terry Rogers, and expressing his desire to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-19\">7/5/78 Dorman sends another letter to Judge Coe requesting that he be allowed to proceed pro se.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-21\">7/10/78 Dorman files a petition for a writ of mandamus in the state Court of Appeals requesting an order to Judge Coe to respond to and grant Dorman\u2019s pro se motions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1 Record, doc. 37, Exh. \u201cL\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-24\">7/11/78 Judge Coe denies Dorman\u2019s requests and other pro se motions in the letters dated 6/6/78 and 7/5/78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-26\">7/13/78 Dorman files in the trial court a motion to disqualify Judge Coe on grounds of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"ANd\">Dorman claims that Judge Coe is prejudiced against him because he will not respond to Dorman\u2019s pro se motions or allow him to proceed pro se. In this motion Dorman cites <em>Faretta v. California.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>7/17/78 The Office of the Public Defender (Rogers) moves to withdraw as counsel for Dorman on grounds that Dorman would not cooperate with his attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 2 Record at pp. 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">7/24/78 Dorman appeals to the state Court of Appeals Judge Coe\u2019s denial of his requests (see 7/11/78).

It is postponed, apparently because of the public defender\u2019s withdrawal from the case and the trial court\u2019s search for new counsel to appoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-15\">Late August/Ear- Judge Coe appoints Wayne</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-16\">ly Sept.

During a hearing held around this time, Judge Coe gives Dorman the option of accepting newly appointed counsel or hiring his own counsel. Since he can not afford to pay for private counsel Dorman acquiesces to the court\u2019s appointment of new counsel. Also, Dorman is prohibited from further speaking up in court. 2 Record at p. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-30\">Dorman goes to trial and is convicted of grand theft. 10/24/78</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-31\">Dorman files a pro se notice of appeal to the state Court of Appeals. 1 Record, doc. 35, no. 5. 10/26/78</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-32\">Assistant Public Defender, Wayne Chalu, is appointed to handle Dorman\u2019s appeal. 11/3/78</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-33\">Dorman sends a letter to the clerk of the trial court inquiring about the status of his trial transcript. 1 Record, doc. 37, Exh. \"J\u201d. 11/14/78</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-34\">Dorman files a pro se motion in the trial court to expedite the preparation of the trial transcript for purposes of appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1451-35\">The public defender (W.

Dorman also files about this time a federal habeas corpus petition (No. 79-528) complaining about the denial of the Rule 3.850 motion by Judge Coe, the adverse disposition on appeal, and the denial of his right to reinstitute his direct appeal. 1 Record, doc. 7, para. IV; <em>see also </em>2 Record at p. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-22\">12/3/79 Federal habeas petition number 79-528 is denied as being without merit. In this petition Dorman complained of the state\u2019s refusal to allow him to reinstitute his direct appeal. The district court, adopting the report of the magistrate, found that Dorman\u2019s due process right to appellate review of his conviction was not violated, the state having provided him an opportunity to present his claim. The court found further that \u201cthe lack of a transcript becomes harmless when viewed in the light of petitioner moving for and securing a dismissal of his appeal\u201d. Consequently, \u201chis failure to secure effective review is attributable solely to his own action in dismissing his appeal.\u201d 1 Record, doc. 55, Exh. \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d. <em>See also infra </em>note 16 for further explanation of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-28\">12/10/79 Dorman files another federal habeas corpus petition (No. 79-1264). 1 Record, doc. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-30\">12/14/79 Dorman files his final federal habeas corpus petition (No. 79-1290). 1 Supp. Record, doc. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-32\">1/22/80 United States Magistrate, Paul Game Jr., for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, enters an order consolidating Dorman\u2019s Section 2254 habeas petitions Nos. 79-1264 and 79-1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-34\">In petition Number 79-1264, Dorman alleged the following grounds for habeas corpus relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-35\">1) unconstitutional identification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-36\">2) denial of fair trial due to the prejudice of the trial judge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-37\">3) insufficient evidence to support a conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-38\">In petition Number 79-1290, Dorman alleged two other grounds for relief;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-40\">4) denial of his right to a speedy trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-41\">5) denial of his right to proceed pro se.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1452-42\">In its response to Magistrate Game\u2019s show cause order, the state contended that four of the grounds for relief raised by Dorman in the federal forum could have been raised on direct appeal to the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, Dorman\u2019s voluntary dismissal of his direct appeal constituted a deliberate bypass of state procedure as mentioned in <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963) and therefore, Dorman was precluded from raising these issues in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">To the claim that Dorman was denied a fair trial due to the prejudice of the trial judge, the state argued that this complaint had not been presented in the state court pursuant to a Rule 3.850 motion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, Dorman had failed to exhaust his state remedies and this claim could not \u201cbe the subject of federal habeas review\u201d. 1 Record, doc. 7, para. VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">In response to the state\u2019s motion to dismiss on grounds of deliberate bypass and failure to exhaust state remedies, Dorman contended that the deliberate bypass rule of <em>Fay v. Noia </em>was inapplicable to these facts because the dismissal of his direct appeal was not done \u201cknowingly and understanding^ in order to secure some benefit to the Petitioner\u201d. 1 Record, doc. 25. Dorman also claimed that it was the state\u2019s undue delay in the preparation of the trial transcript that caused him to dismiss the appeal, which resulted in a vain attempt to obtain speedier review of his conviction. He summarized the countless attempts he had made to present every available ground of relief to the state courts, both at the trial and at the appellate level, and to give the state the opportunity to \u201capply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon his constitutional claim\u201d. 1 Record, doc. 25 at p. 3. Dorman contends that his efforts more than satisfied any exhaustion defense that the state might raise. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">Magistrate Game scheduled an evidentiary hearing to pass on the issues of deliberate bypass and failure to exhaust state remedies. In his report Magistrate Game recommended that Dorman\u2019s petition be denied. Specifically, the magistrate found that 1) there was no basis in fact to the claim of an unconstitutional identification of Dorman by the victim because the trial transcript disclosed that the victim was well known by Dorman prior to the crime, 2) the alleged prejudice of Judge Coe against Dorman \u201crelates solely to his dissatisfaction with the judge\u2019s (sic) decisions\u201d, (3) even if Dorman\u2019s factual allegations were true, they were \u201cinsufficient to form a basis for disqualification of the judge (sic) nor do the facts asserted establish a basis for habeas corpus relief in this Court\u201d, 4) there was sufficient evidence supporting the conviction to pass constitutional muster under <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), 5) Dorman\u2019s denial of his right to a speedy trial under state law did not present facts that would establish denial of his right to a speedy trial under the Constitution; and 6) the alleged denial of Dorman\u2019s right to represent himself at trial \u201cis not borne out of the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-10\">On this last finding the magistrate held that \u201c[a]t no time, at the trial court level, did he [Dorman] waive his right to appointed counsel\u201d and that even though in a letter to Judge Coe he asked to be relieved of appointed counsel Dorman \u201cdid not express a desire to represent himself.\u201d Magistrate Game concluded that \u201c[petitioner has failed to satisfy his burden of proof that he was forced to accept representation of counsel or that he voluntarily and intelligently elected to defend himself without counsel.\u201d The magistrate did not reach nor discuss the issue of deliberate bypass, an argument raised by the state in regard to Dorman\u2019s voluntary dismissal of his direct appeal. Needless to say, Dorman timely objected to all of the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>The United States District Court, Judge William J. Castagna, rejected the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the magistrate did not explicitly discuss the issue of deliberate bypass, the district court presumed that this issue had been resolved in Dorman\u2019s favor. Ruling that the state had not demonstrated that Dorman\u2019s dismissal of his direct appeal was an \u201cintentional relinquishment of abandonment of a known right or privilege [citing <em>Fay v. Noia]\", </em>the court reasoned that the appeal was dismissed because of the incorrect advice of a jailhouse lawyer and that Dorman had gained no tactical advantage from the dismissal of his direct appeal. In short, the state had not demonstrated that Dorman had made a \u201cknowing and informed decision to bypass review under state procedures\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">On the merits of Dorman\u2019s claims, the court found no basis for relief on the first four contentions but noted that the magistrate\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions regarding Dorman\u2019s constitutional rights under <em>Faretta </em>were not \u201crealistic\u201d. The court rejected the conclusion of the magistrate that Dorman had never explicitly stated that <em>\u201che </em>wanted to represent himself.\u201d The only factor that the district court could find in support of the magistrate\u2019s recommendation was Dorman\u2019s failure to discharge his second appointed counsel (Timmerman), a private attorney, a fact which could be interpreted as a desire by Dorman to represent himself only if the remaining option was the public defender\u2019s office. The district court found that \u201c[s]uch conjecture is not justified on this record\u201d and that \u201c[t]he fact that Tinneman (sic) was not ever discharged and was not a public defender does not negate the fact that the state court trial judge continually denied Petitioner\u2019s clear desire to represent himself.\u201d The court concluded that Dorman \u201cclearly invoked his right of self-representation sufficient to comply with the teachings of <em>Faretta v. California </em>and that the trial court denied him that significant constitutional right.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-7\">In response to the district court\u2019s order, the state filed a \u201cMotion For New Trial or to Alter or Amend Judgment\u201d, which raised the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d doctrine for the first time in these proceedings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court entered a second Order (of June 20, 1985) granting a stay of its first Order pending appeal of the case to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The court adhered to its original judgment, however, and entered supplemental findings and conclusions in support of its decision to grant Dorman relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-8\">In its second Order, the district court addressed several contentions raised by the state in its motion for new trial: 1) that the court had improperly considered Dorman\u2019s subjective intent in regard to the dismissal of his direct appeal, 2) that under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>Dorman did not satisfy the requirement of cause and prejudice sufficient to obtain review of his claim by a federal district court, 3) that the disposition of Dorman\u2019s federal habeas petition No. 79-528 resolved the issue of Dorman\u2019s dismissal of the direct appeal in favor of the state, and 4) that Dorman allegedly waived his right of self-representation when he failed to object to the appointment of pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>vate counsel (Timmerman) as his trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">First, the district court noted that it had relied on <em>Buckelew v. United States </em>575 F.2d 515, 519 (5th Cir.1978) in making its finding on the deliberate bypass issue and that <em>Buckelew </em>was still good law. Second, in regard to the issue of procedural default under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>the court concluded that Dorman\u2019s case fell within the purview of the cause and prejudice standard \u201cas interpreted by the Eleventh Circuit subsequent to Sykes.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In regard to Dorman\u2019s federal habeas petition No. 79-528 the court reasoned that the issue presented there involved a different aspect of Dorman\u2019s dismissal of his direct appeal and the decision in that proceeding was not controlling on the question of deliberate bypass or procedural default.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, the court rejected the state\u2019s allegation that Dorman had waived his <em>Faretta </em>right by failing to continue to object to the appointment of Timmerman. Citing <em>Brown v. Wainwright, </em>665 F.2d 607 (5th Cir., Unit B 1982) (en banc), the court noted that while it was possible for a petitioner to waive his <em>Faretta </em>right, neither was it necessary for Dorman to continually renew his request to proceed pro se after it had been conclusively denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">The state filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment and the case was sent up for appellate review. Finding that the state denied Dorman his constitutional right to proceed pro se, that he did not waive this right, that the district court had the power to address the deprivation of this right, and that this claim is not barred by any considerations of federalism, comity, or the negligence or misbehavior of the petitioner, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-12\">In <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the United States Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant in this country has a constitutional right to be his own lawyer; a Sixth Amendment right which, while difficult to discern from the text of the Constitution, is probably in harmony with the cultural character of the American people. <em>See McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 176-77, 104 S.Ct. 944, 950-51, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984) (\u201c[t]he right to appeal pro se exists to affirm the dignity and autonomy of the accused and to allow the presentation of what may, at least occasionally, be the accused\u2019s best possible defense\u201d). But unlike other constitutional rights, the right to be one\u2019s own counsel can easily be overlooked or waived if a defendant does not properly invoke the right or inadvertently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>waives it through some procedural misstep. Consequently, even though there is no question that the right to proceed pro se exists, difficult issues arise in determining the scope of that right vis-a-vis the legitimate interests of both the state and federal judicial systems in the administration of justice. <em>See Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 852, 95 S.Ct. at 2549 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">This appeal presents several issues regarding the petitioner\u2019s invocation and retention of his <em>Faretta </em>right as well as issues regarding the power of the federal courts to reach alleged violations of constitutional rights that were inadequately or erroneously disposed of in the state court. Specifically, we must determine, first, whether the district court erred in finding that Dorman properly invoked his right to proceed pro se and, second, that he did not waive this right by acquiescing to the appointment of private counsel (Timmerman). Third, we must decide whether the court erred in finding that Dorman did not deliberately bypass an opportunity for review of an alleged constitutional deprivation or, fourth, commit some other procedural default that should have precluded the federal district court from reaching the alleged constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">\n<em>Invocation of the Right to Proceed Pro Se</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">The state contends that the district court erred in finding that Dorman adequately invoked his right to self-representation. It argues that there is no finding that Dorman made a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of his right to counsel or that he was made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. <em>See Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-7\">This is a specious argument. Under the facts here, the trial court never bothered to inquire whether Dorman was making a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel or was aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. The constant summary denial of his requests prevent us from even reaching this step of the analysis. In <em>Faretta, </em>the Court noted that the petitioner had \u201cclearly and unequivocably declared to the trial judge\u201d his desire to proceed pro se. <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541. In <em>Brown v. Wainwright, </em>the \u201cold Fifth\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> provided guidelines for determining when the mutually exclusive right to counsel and the right to self-representation were in operation. 665 F.2d at 610-12. <em>Brown </em>held that the right to counsel was preeminent over the right to self-representation in the sense that the former attached automatically and had to be affirmatively waived to be lost whereas the latter did not attach unless and until it was <em>asserted. Brown, </em>665 F.2d at 610 (emphasis is original).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-12\">The magistrate in this cause reasoned that Dorman never properly invoked his right to self-representation because he never explicitly waived his right to counsel and never expressed that <em>he </em>wanted to represent himself. The district court correctly rejected this reasoning. To invoke his Sixth Amendment right under <em>Faretta </em>a defendant does not need to recite some talismanic formula hoping to open the eyes and ears of the court to his request. Insofar as the desire to proceed pro se is concerned, petitioner must do no more than state his request, either orally or in writing, unambiguously to the court so that no reasonable person can say that the request was not made. In this Circuit, the court must then conduct a hearing on the waiver of the right to counsel to determine whether the accused understands the risks of proceeding pro se. <em>United States v. Charney, </em>662 F.2d 1148, 1152 (5th Cir., Unit B 1981). This hearing never occurred and these findings were never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">No reasonable person could deny that Dorman wanted to conduct his own defense. Not only did he cite <em>Faretta </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>several written requests to the trial judge but he began civil proceedings against the Public Defender hoping, to create a conflict of interest that would force the trial judge to discharge appointed counsel and allow Dorman to defend himself. <em>See </em>2 Record at p. 16. The district court did not err in finding that Dorman clearly invoked his desire to proceed pro se. And although he never had a formal opportunity to show that he had the requisite knowledge and intelligence to waive his right to counsel, the record more than adequately reflects Dorman\u2019s awareness of the significant constitutional right that he wanted to give up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">The state argues next that even if Dorman properly invoked his right to represent himself he subsequently waived that right by acquiescing to the appointment of Tim-merman. Dorman\u2019s wish, claims the state, was not to proceed pro se, but to avoid having his case handled by the Public Defender. Although he was financially unable to retain his own attorney, Dorman was willing to accept representation by private counsel appointed by the court. Having done so, Dorman waived or abandoned his desire to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">We acknowledge the viability of this argument. Under the law of this Circuit, it is much easier to waive one\u2019s right to self-representation than to waive other constitutional rights, such as the right to counsel. In <em>Brown, </em>we held that \u201c[a] waiver may be found if it reasonably appears to the court that defendant has abandoned his initial request to represent himself.\u201d 665 F.2d at 611. Moreover, a court has no duty to conduct a hearing or otherwise confront the defendant about his desire to proceed pro se even if by conduct subsequent to the invocation of his right the defendant appears to be vacillating on his decision. <em>Id. </em>at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-9\">The record contained two or three hints of Dorman\u2019s dissatisfaction with attorneys from the public defender office.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Other than these faint inferences defectible in the record, however, Dorman\u2019s wish to proceed pro se rings out loud and clear. It is true, as the state points out, that from the time Timmerman was appointed until after the trial, Dorman stopped filing letters and requests to proceed pro se. But there is evidence that Dorman was on the verge of being in contempt of court by his repeated letters and motions to the court<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and it would be a weak right indeed if a defendant had to risk sanctions by the court to keep a constitutional right. Again, in <em>Brown </em>we stated that \u201c[ajfter a clear denial of the request, a defendant need not make fruitless motions or forego cooperation with defense counsel in order to preserve the issue on appeal.\u201d 665 F.2d at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-10\">The district court, contrary to the report of its magistrate, reviewed the evidence in support of a finding of waiver and rejected it. We can not say that the court was either factually or legally incorrect on this point and leave its ruling undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahq_\">\n<em>Procedural Default: Based on Concepts of Waiver and Abstention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATW\">The last two issues in this appeal involve two doctrines that limit the discretion of a federal court in reviewing alleged constitutional deprivations in state criminal proceedings. One, the notion of \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d, is identified with <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>The other, the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exception, is identified with <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). It would be incorrect to say that these doctrines were created by <em>Fay </em>and <em>Sykes, </em>respectively, because their roots can be traced through a previous line of jurisprudence. <em>See Sykes, supra; Fay, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">In spite of these limiting doctrines there is no question that a federal court has the power to grant a state habeas petitioner relief if alleged constitutional deprivations are made out. <em>Fay, </em>372 U.S. at 425-27, 83 S.Ct. at 841-43. Habeas corpus relief being founded in equity, the final judgment of a state court on federal claims is not res judicata and only considerations of comity and federal-state relations compel us to decline relief, if appropriate. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. at 80, 97 S.Ct. at 2502.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">The state argues, first, that the district court should have dismissed Dorman\u2019s habeas corpus petition because he \u201cdeliberately bypassed\u201d a state procedure for relief, that is, direct appellate review, when he dismissed his appeal in May 1979. Second, the state contends that the court erred in finding that \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d existed to allow relief despite Dorman\u2019s procedural default of dismissing his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">\n<em>Deliberate Bypass</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">The so called deliberate bypass rule is a type waiver doctrine that precludes federal review of even meritorious constitutional claims. <em>Fay, </em>372 U.S. at 439, 83 S.Ct. at 849; <em>Montgomery v. Hopper, </em>488 F.2d 877, 879 (5th Cir.1973). Because of the harshness of this result, <em>Fay </em>held that in asserting that a petitioner had deliberately bypassed a state remedy the state had the burden of showing that a petitioner\u2019s procedural default was an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d 372 U.S. at 439, 83 S.Ct. at 849 (citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). In this Circuit we have construed the deliberate bypass rule in favor of habeas corpus petitioners, requiring in most cases an evidentiary hearing to show the intentional relinquishment of a right and the benefit of a tactical advantage by such relinquishment. <em>Buckelew v. United States, </em>575 F.2d 515, 519 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">The state contends that \u201cthe indiscriminate use of the <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>formulation to determine deliberate bypass has not survived the test of time and that the Supreme Court in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) \u201cteaches that this test is only to be apply (sic) to those rights that protect a fair trial.\u201d We disagree with the state\u2019s application of <em>Schneckloth. </em>That case involved the waiver of petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by consenting to the search of his car. The issue presented was whether the petitioner\u2019s ignorance of his Fourth Amendment rights invalidated the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of his consent. The Court held that the voluntariness of a consent search was a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances and that knowledge of the right to refuse consent constituted only one factor to be considered in making such an assessment. <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. at 2047.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-10\"><em>Schneckloth </em>also addressed the argument that a consent is a \u201cwaiver\u201d of a person\u2019s constitutional rights and that under the doctrine of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>the state had to demonstrate the petitioner\u2019s intentional relinquishment of a known right or privilege. 412 U.S. at 235, 93 S.Ct. at 2051. But the Court refused to incorporate the <em>Johnson </em>formulation of waiver into the area of Fourth Amendment searches and seizures reasoning that it was meant to safeguard only those constitutional guarantees necessary to preserve a fair trial. 412 U.S. at 236-37, 93 S.Ct. at 2052-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-11\">Relying on this language, the state argues that only an appeal is at issue here, not Dorman\u2019s right to a fair trial. Therefore, the \u201cknowing and intelligent relinquishment of a known right or privilege\u201d test of <em>Johnson, </em>is not applicable here. The state contends that since no fundamental constitutional right (to a fair trial) is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>issue here and since, acting as his own counsel, Dorman deliberately dismissed his direct appeal, he should be held responsible for the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">Were it not for the state's own misfeasance in the preparation of Dorman\u2019s trial transcript we would find this argument more compelling. The state essentially urges us to exercise a wooden application of the deliberate bypass rule. But this case does not lend itself to the tidy application of judicial catchphrases. To do justice, we must look beyond the literal meaning of the phrases which lawyers and judges alike use to encapsulate complex concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">In regard to the deliberate bypass doctrine, the issue is not whether Dorman\u2019s decision to dismiss his direct appeal was deliberate (of course it was), it is whether Dorman was trying to either sandbag the court or engage in other conduct that should disentitle him from receiving the relief that he seeks. <em>See Fay, </em>372 U.S. at 438, 83 S.Ct. at 848. Another factor we must consider is whether the integrity of the state\u2019s administration of justice is in any way compromised by allowing Dorman to raise his claims in a federal forum. <em>See id. </em>at 433-39, 83 S.Ct. at 845-49. Finally, we must consider the importance of the constitutional right at issue in regard to the fairness of the trial. <em>See Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 236-37, 93 S.Ct. at 2052-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">Analyzed in this manner we cannot say that Dorman\u2019s dismissal of his direct appeal constitutes the type of conduct that should disentitle him from relief. The record reflects that he had to request several extensions of the appellate timetable to keep the appeal alive and that only the state\u2019s failure to timely provide Dorman with a trial transcript prevented him from following up the appeal. He cannot be faulted for seeking alternative relief after such an unreasonable delay in the preparation of his trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-21\">The record also reveals that the state\u2019s interest in the administration of its criminal justice system free of undue federal interference has not been compromised. Dorman presented the state with ample opportunities to address his constitutional claims, especially that of the right to self-representation. Having failed to even address the question, that state cannot now complain about the federal court\u2019s exercise of its power over the state in vindicating constitutional guarantees. Finally, although we may question whether the right to proceed pro se is fundamental to the fairness of a trial, our refusal to recognize it under the facts presented in this case would completely repudiate the viability of the right. Moreover, it would reward the state for its sluggishness in providing indigent petitioners the means for state appellate review of alleged constitutional infirmities in their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-22\">\n<em>The \u201cCause &amp; Prejudice\u201d Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-23\">The state argues that the district court erred in finding that there was \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d, as articulated in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>sufficient to excuse Dorman from the procedural default he committed (dismissing his direct appeal) and that the district court wrongfully used this doctrine as a means of circumventing the deliberate bypass standard of <em>Fay v. Noia. </em>We disagree. Although he committed a procedural default when he dismissed his direct appeal, the district court correctly found that Dorman met his burden of showing cause and prejudice for the default. Consequently, the court did not err in reaching the merits of the alleged constitutional violation or in finding in favor of Dorman on the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-24\">On its face, <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>appears to rest on the well-known but elusive doctrine of independent and adequate state grounds.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> At first blush, the underlying premise of <em>Sykes </em>seems to be that a habeas petitioner should not be able to raise in a collateral proceeding <em>(i.e., </em>habeas corpus) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>federal issues that could not have been raised on direct review under the doctrine of independent and adequate state grounds. A more thorough analysis, however, reveals that this doctrine rests on jurisdictional concepts pertinent to direct appellate review that are inapposite with the unquestioned power of federal courts in the area of habeas corpus. <em>See Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. at 428-30, 83 S.Ct. at 843-44 (\u201c[t]he jurisdictional prerequisite [for federal habeas corpus] is not the judgment of a state court but detention simpliciter\u201d). The independent and adequate state grounds rule \u201cis a consequence of the Court\u2019s obligation to refrain from rendering advisory opinions or passing upon moot questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 83 S.Ct. at 844; <em>see also 2 </em>Fed.Pro. \u00a7\u00a7 3:93-3:94 (Law.Ed.1981). Contrariwise, the Supreme Court has consistently reiterated that in habeas corpus proceedings federal courts possess the power to reach the merits of federal claims. <em>See generally Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986); <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, supra; Fay v. Noia, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">Principles of comity and federalism then, rather than notions of power and jurisdiction, govern a federal court\u2019s discretion in refusing to hear petitions otherwise cognizable in federal court. As such, the type of procedural default in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>involves a type of abstention. <em>See Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 2678-79 (Brennan, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-9\">In the recent decision of <em>Murray v. Carrier, supra </em>the Supreme Court gave us further guidance on the doctrine of procedural default under <em>Sykes </em>and the proper application of the cause and prejudice standard. <em>Carrier </em>held that the cause and prejudice doctrine applies to all procedural defaults regardless of what stage of the proceeding, trial or appellate, the default at issue occurs. <em>Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 2646-47. We have already acknowledged that a procedural default occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-14\"><em>Carrier </em>further provides that \u201cthe existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 2646. That requirement has certainly been met here. The state unabashedly argues that Dorman should not have dismissed his direct appeal and that he should now live with the consequences of his actions. We cannot agree. The state\u2019s failure to provide Dorman with a trial transcript within a reasonable time to perfect his appeal constitutes an external factor out of Dorman\u2019s control that suffices as \u201ccause\u201d for the dismissal of the direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-17\">Finally, given the nature of the constitutional right at issue here, we are compelled to find inherent prejudice in the denial of the right. The Supreme Court has held that the denial of the right to proceed pro se is not amenable to harmless error analysis. <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 177 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 944, 951 n. 8, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984) (\u201cThe right [to proceed pro se] is either respected or denied; its deprivation cannot be harmless.\u201d). If the deprivation of this right cannot be harmless it must, by definition, be prejudicial. In this case Dorman\u2019s constitutional right to proceed pro se was unquestionably denied. Therefore, regardless of the fairness of the trial at which he was convicted, he was prejudiced. The district court did not err in so finding and, accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1450-10\">. Dorman made the following pretrial motions: a motion to suppress evidence (5/28/78); a motion to suppress an unduly suggestive identification and a motion for discovery (5/30/78); a request for the removal of the public defender (6/26/78); a motion to compel (6/28/78); a motion to be present at the deposition of witnesses and a petition for a statement of particulars (7/2/78). <em>See </em>1 Record, Doc. 37, Exh. <em>\"L\".</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1450-11\"><em>. </em>Dorman testified at his federal evidentiary hearing that he had filed a civil suit against the Office of the Public Defender and his appointed attorney, Terry Rogers, to create a conflict of interest and thereby force Judge Coe to disqualify the public defender's office from representing him. 2 Record at p. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1450-30\">.

LaValle, </em>391 U.S. 234, 239, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 1560, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968), mootness did not preclude this action from proceeding. 1 Record, doc. 52 (Order of May 1, 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1454-9\">.

In habeas petition No. 79-528, the only issue Dorman raised was the denial by the state of his right to a direct appeal. As mentioned above, Dorman had dismissed his direct appeal in an attempt to expedite review of his conviction via an alternative proceeding (a Rule 3.850 motion). Dorman was apparently under the impression that since the direct appeal was dismissed without prejudice, he would be able to reinstate it if his Rule 3.850 motion was denied. When the trial court denied relief on the Rule 3.850 motion, Dorman appealed to the state court of appeals. He also filed habeas action No. 79-528.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">The magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation in that cause, which the district court adopted in its entirety, reviewed the constitutional obligations of a state to make direct appellate review available to petitioners, including the provision of a trial transcript or some reasonable alternative, if necessary, to assure meaningful appellate review. The magistrate concluded that even though Dorman, as an indigent, had a right to a free transcript, \"the lack of a transcript becomes harmless when viewed in the light of petitioner [Dorman] moving for and securing a dismissal of his appeal.\" See 1 Record, doc. 55, Exh. \"B\" at p. 2. The magistrate reasoned that Dorman had failed to prosecute his appeal because he wanted instead to proceed with a Rule 3.850 motion in the trial court and not because \"he was unable to prosecute the appeal due to lack of his trial transcript\". <em>Id. </em>Consequently, Dorman\u2019s failure to secure an appeal was \"attributable solely to his own action in dismissing his appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The state does not challenge the district court\u2019s disposition of this argument and the question is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1456-8\">. <em>Bonner v.

Moreover, Dorman discharged the public defenders appointed to represent him in both state and federal court. He allegedly discharged the public defender (Chalu) appointed to handle the direct appeal of his conviction as well as the federal public defender appointed to handle his habeas corpus causes.

Put another way, the cause and prejudice doctrine focuses on procedural missteps by a petitioner (or his counsel) that, pursuant to principles of comity and federalism, should compel the district court to refrain from the exercise of its jurisdiction, absent an exculpatory reason for the misstep and a showing of prejudice flowing from the error, whether committed intentionally, inadvertently, or negligently. On the other hand, the deliberate bypass doctrine focuses on conduct of a petitioner (or his counsel) that lends itself to a waiver analysis. <em>See Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U.S. at 438, 83 S.Ct. at 848. This distinction may provide a starting point for placing these two doctrines in perspective, even though their application to specific facts more often than not results in imperfect fits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
