The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that Golden Rule failed to prove a sufficient misrepresentation under Nebraska law to avoid liability on the policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-11\">Welsh at the suggestion of her insurance agent had become interested in changing health insurance carriers, and on May 9, 1983, she filled out an application to Golden Rule. In relevant detail, she listed her weight as 180 pounds and answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question whether within the past ten years she had had \u201cany indication, diagnosis, or treatment of cancer, tumor, cyst, or growth of any kind.\u201d She reported that she had had a complete hysterectomy in July 1981; but when a Golden Rule underwriter called to ask for more information, she said the operation had not involved a malignancy. Golden Rule issued the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-15\">In January 1984, following surgery for lung cancer, Welsh submitted a claim for benefits to Golden Rule. The insurance company in investigating that claim discovered that the postoperative pathology report from Welsh\u2019s hysterectomy had showed \u201ccarcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix\u201d and that Welsh at the time of her application likely was about 35 pounds heavier than she stated. Because of these discrepancies (among others), Golden Rule denied Welsh\u2019s claim for benefits, announced it was setting aside her policy for misrepresentation, and refunded the premiums she had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-16\">Under Nebraska law, an insurer may avoid liability on a policy on the basis of false statements in the application only if it proves, \u201camong other things, that the misrepresentations were made knowingly with intent to deceive, that the insurer relied and acted upon such statements, and that the insurer was deceived to its injury.\u201d <em>White v. Medico Life Insurance Co., </em>212 Neb. 901, 327 N.W.2d 606, 609-10 (1982); <em>see also </em>Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 44-358 (1984); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 44-710.14 (false statement must have \u201cmaterially affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer\u201d). The district court found that Welsh\u2019s false statement regarding the cancer was not made knowingly because, even if she had been told of the diagnosis of \u201ccarcinoma,\u201d she had not understood that that meant cancer or malignancy, and that Welsh\u2019s false statement regarding her weight was not made with intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-17\">Golden Rule argues that Welsh had to have known that she had cancer because she knew, in her own words, that the hys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>terectomy was necessary because of her \u201cdiseased and dangerous uterus\u201d and because any woman of average intelligence would have known from the tests and procedures leading up to the operation that the doctors\u2019 concern was with cancer. Golden Rule further asserts that it is incredible that the court, in the face of testimony to the contrary by the doctors, believed Welsh\u2019s \u201ctotally impeached\u201d testimony that her doctors did not explain her medical problems to her in terms of cancer or malignancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">We may, however, set aside a district court\u2019s factual findings only if clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). This means that regardless of how we might have decided the case ourselves, we may not reverse unless \u201c \u2018on the entire evidence [we are] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)); <em>see O\u2019Connor v. Peru State College, </em>781 F.2d 632, 634 (8th Cir.1986). When there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s view must prevail. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>781 F.2d at 634. Furthermore, findings based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses are entitled to particular deference and may \u201cvirtually never\u201d be clearly erroneous. <em>Anderson, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1513; <em>see Davis v. Lambert of Arkansas, Inc., </em>781 F.2d 658, 660 (8th Cir.1986). The district court in this case gave the testimony of the doctors less weight than would Golden Rule, observing that although the doctors testified that they normally would have explained carcinoma to a patient in Welsh\u2019s situation, they had no recollection of actual conversations with Welsh. In addition, the court commented on the lengthy, technical, and guarded explanations given by the doctors when asked if Welsh had indeed had cancer and concluded that the emphasis of the doctors in treating Welsh had been not in explaining cancer to her but in explaining that her problem was cured and that she was not in danger. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Welsh never understood that she had had cancer or a malignancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">Turning to the district court\u2019s conclusion that Welsh had no intent to deceive when she misrepresented her weight on the insurance application, Golden Rule attempts to avoid this finding by making the issue a matter of law. Golden Rule relies on the reasoning in <em>White </em>that \u201cwhen an applicant makes an untrue statement with respect to a material fact peculiarly within his knowledge, the finder of fact may, from the mere occurrence of the false statement, conclude it was made knowingly with intent to deceive.\u201d 327 N.W.2d at 610. Golden Rule, however, cites no precedent indicating that in Nebraska this inference is mandatory, rather than permissive. The district court apparently credited Welsh\u2019s testimony that, since her weight fluctuated widely and she did not know her exact weight at that time, she put down on her application a figure which she thought approximated the weight listed on her drivers license (although the license was shown at trial to have said 185, rather than 180). The finding of the court that Welsh did not intend to deceive Golden Rule regarding her weight is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">We have carefully considered Golden Rule\u2019s arguments with respect to various other false statements by Welsh not detailed above, and we cannot find that the district court clearly erred in finding no intent to deceive with respect to those discrepancies either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1293-12\">.
