After this court held that the Bail Reform Act of 1984 could be applied to a defendant, such as Zannino, who had been released on bail under the 1966 Bail Act, <em>see United States v. Zannino, </em>761 F.2d 52 (1st Cir.1985), the district court on May 16, 1985 revoked Zannino\u2019s bail pursuant to a finding that \u201cno conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d On July 17, 1985, soon after trial of Zannino and his co-defendants had begun, Zannino suffered cardiac arrest and was severed from the trial, without government objection. Zannino ultimately was placed in custody in the maximum security unit of the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital, where he still remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Trial of Zannino\u2019s .co-defendants concluded on February 26, 1986. Subsequently, the district court, in response to Zannino\u2019s July 30,1985 Motion for Reconsideration of Detention Order (in which Zannino sought release on bail on the grounds that he was no longer \u201cdangerous\u201d and that his indefinite detention while physically unable to stand trial violated due process), appointed a panel of cardiologists to assist the court\u2019s determination of Zannino\u2019s ability to stand trial. After reviewing the panel\u2019s report, the district court concluded \u201cthat Zannino at the present time is, and for the foreseeable future will remain, medically unable to withstand the several months of trial that would be needed to prosecute him on all pending counts in the instant indictment.\u201d The court left open the possibility of trying Zannino on one count at a time, as the government proposed, rather than trying him on all twenty counts of the indictment together. However, on June 17, 1986, the court ordered Zannino\u2019s temporary release on bail pending the court\u2019s determination, after further consultation with the panel of cardiologists, whether Zannino could stand trial to this limited extent. The court set various conditions for Zannino\u2019s release, including the following: that Zannino not leave his residence without court approval except for medical visits; that Zannino receive no visitors without approval of Pretrial Services except counsel and his immediate family; and, with Zannino\u2019s consent, that the government monitor his telephone calls. The government appealed from the temporary release order. Upon the government\u2019s motion, this court stayed Zannino\u2019s release pending further order of this court. Given the unusual circumstances present in this case, we now reverse the temporary release order.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The district court elaborated its reasoning for its temporary release order in its July 1, 1986 Memorandum in Support of Order for Temporary Release on Bail and, following this court\u2019s request for certain further findings, its July 24, 1986 Memorandum in Response to Court of Appeals\u2019 July 18,1986 Order. The court specifically held that Zannino remains \u201cdangerous\u201d for purposes of the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142, and that its bail conditions did not suffice to neutralize his dangerousness. The court nonetheless found that continued pretrial detention of Zannino beyond thirteen months (commencing May 16, 1985) would raise serious questions as to the constitutionality of the Bail Reform Act as applied. The court accordingly found that avoiding this potential due process violation constituted a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to justify Zannino's temporary release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(i), which provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">\u201cThe judicial officer may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person\u2019s defense or for another compelling reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In the alternative, the court held that if this statutory basis for release were faulty, release was mandated by the due process clause of the fifth amendment. The court made clear that Zannino\u2019s release was in fact temporary, \u201conly until such time as a final determination is made ... whether he is medically fit to stand trial under any proposed format.\u201d If he were then deemed fit, the court explained, he could be returned to detention pending an imminent trial; if he were deemed unable to stand trial, the court would then make a further ruling as to his detention, likely finding his continued release to be constitutionally compelled. The court estimated that it would reach a decision on Zannino\u2019s fitness for trial, following receipt of a further report from the panel of cardiologists, in early- to mid-September, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Because of the district court\u2019s alternative holding that Zannino\u2019s temporary release is mandated by due process, we cannot resolve this case on non-constitutional grounds alone. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s statutory ground of decision \u2014 its invocation of the temporary release provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(i) \u2014 was premised wholly on the court\u2019s determination that release under \u00a7 3142(i) was necessary for the \u201ccompelling reason\u201d of averting the serious constitutional problems it thought posed by continued detention. Therefore, our holding, <em>infra, </em>that continued detention pending an imminent medical finding will not offend due process renders it unnecessary for this court to consider whether \u00a7 3142(i) could provide a proper basis for temporary release in a case such as this. Instead, we now proceed to a consideration of the constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">As an initial matter, the parties dispute the proper standard of review to be applied to pretrial bail orders under the Bail Reform Act. The government urges that we undertake \u201c[a]n independent review of the bail decision tempered by deference to the district court\u2019s firsthand judgment of the situation,\u201d the standard applied by this court to post-conviction bail decisions under <em>United States v. Bayko, </em>774 F.2d 516, 520 (1st Cir.1985). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Portes, </em>786 F.2d 758, 762 (7th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>779 F.2d 1467, 1470-73 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Maull, </em>773 F.2d 1479, 1487 (8th Cir.1985) (en banc); <em>United States v. Motamedi, </em>767 F.2d 1403, 1406 (9th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Hazime, </em>762 F.2d 34, 36-37 (6th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Delker, </em>757 F.2d 1390, 1399-1400 (3d Cir.1985). Zannino argues that the proper standard is a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d or \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fortna, </em>769 F.2d 243, 250 (5th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Chimurenga, </em>760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>753 F.2d 329, 333 n. 12 (4th Cir.1985). However, we are not here called upon to review a pretrial release decision made by application of the standards set out in the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. Temporary release was ordered here in order to avert \u201cserious questions as to the constitutionality of the 1984 Bail Reform Act as applied here,\u201d or, in the alternative, because compelled by the fifth amendment. No matter what the proper standard of review of pretrial release decisions based on statutory criteria may be, there is no question that we must make a de novo determination \u2014 with deference to the district court\u2019s underlying findings of fact \u2014 as to the instant constitutional question. Accordingly, we do not decide what standard ordinarily should govern our review of pretrial bail decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Zannino argues, relying on the recent opinion of the Second Circuit in <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>794 F.2d 64 (2d Cir. 1986), that the Bail Reform Act is facially unconstitutional in that it provides for pretrial detention solely on the ground that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). However, we are in agreement with the dissenting opinion of Chief Judge Feinberg in <em>Salerno </em>that this aspect of the Act does not violate substantive due process. We adopt the reasoning stated in Part I of Chief Judge Feinberg\u2019s opinion. All other circuits which have con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>sidered the question have found no violation of the fifth amendment. <em>See United States v. Perry, </em>788 F.2d 100, 112-13 (3d Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Portes, </em>786 F.2d 758, 767 (7th Cir.1986). Zannino has not specifically suggested any other constitutional flaw on the face of the Bail Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We turn, then, to Zannino\u2019s primary contention that the Act cannot constitutionally be applied to subject him to any further pretrial detention, since the resulting length of detention is substantial enough to constitute \u201cpunishment\u201d without trial, in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment. We acknowledge that, as Zannino argues, other courts have found pretrial detention too prolonged to withstand due process challenge when imposed for periods of time substantially shorter than the sixteen months that Zannino will have been in custody as of mid-September, 1986. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Melendez-Carrion, </em>790 F.2d 984, 1008 (2d Cir.1986) (Feinberg, C.J., concurring) (eight months); <em>United States v. Theron, </em>782 F.2d 1510, 1516 (10th Cir.1986) (over four months); <em>United States v. LoFranco, </em>620 F.Supp. 1324 (N.D.N.Y.1985) (six months), <em>appeal dismissed sub nom. United States v. Cheeseman, </em>783 F.2d 38 (2d Cir.1986). <em>Cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3164(b) (ninety-day limit of Speedy Trial Act). We need not quarrel with the above-cited decisions to observe that this case presents unusual circumstances not present in any of them: a palpably dangerous defendant, whose continued detention is the result of prolonged physical inability to stand trial, whose inability nevertheless does not prevent his continuing dangerousness, and who faces an imminent determination of his present medical fitness for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The primary factors guiding the determination when due process requires a release from pretrial detention have been identified in <em>United States v. Accetturo, </em>783 F.2d 382, 388 (3d Cir.1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">Because due process is a flexible concept, arbitrary lines should not be drawn regarding precisely when defendants adjudged to be flight risks or dangers to the community should be released pending trial. Instead, we believe that due process judgments should be made on the facts of individual cases, and should reflect the factors relevant in the initial detention decision, such as the seriousness of the charges, the strength of the government\u2019s proof that defendant poses a risk of flight or a danger to the community, and the strength of the government\u2019s case on the merits. Moreover, these judgments should reflect such additional factors as the length of the detention that has in fact occurred, the complexity of the case, and whether the strategy of one side or the other has added needlessly to that complexity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALy\">Here, the charges against Zannino are of the gravest order, including predicate acts of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. If convicted of all offenses charged, Zannino would face a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 130 years. As far as can be discerned from the record before us, the government\u2019s case on the merits of these charges appears strong. The government\u2019s showing of Zannino\u2019s dangerousness, too, is strong. In ordering Zannino\u2019s detention in May 1985, the district court noted that Zannino played a continuing leadership role in mob activities, to which he has \u201cdevoted his life,\u201d and that Zannino fell within the rebuttable presumption of dangerousness under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). In its July 24, 1986 memorandum, the district court concluded, \u201c[T]he court is of the view that Zannino's coronary problems are not so disabling \u2014 and further that no bail conditions can be realistically fashioned\u2014 so as to substantially eliminate the prospect of his continuing to engage in criminal activities.\u201d The evidence of record strongly supports the district court\u2019s conclusion in that it indicates that Zannino, even though detained in a hospital, continues to play a role in directing illegal activities through communications with associates. These factors, therefore, militate in favor of a finding that due process permits a longer period of pretrial detention here than in cases involving defendants less demonstra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>bly dangerous and charged with less serious offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Even so, we shall assume that in many, perhaps most, cases, sixteen months would be found to exceed the due process limitations on the duration of pretrial confinement. What makes this case different is that here trial has been delayed because of Zannino\u2019s insistence, supported at least so far by the district court\u2019s findings from the medical evidence before it, that his cardiac condition renders him physically unfit to stand trial, and that nevertheless this condition has not rendered him non-dangerous. The record substantiates the government\u2019s contention that it has steadfastly pressed for trial throughout the period of Zannino\u2019s detention. Under these circumstances we think pretrial detention of longer duration may be imposed without running afoul of due process limitations. <em>United States v. Salerno, supra, </em>at 75 (Feinberg, C.J., dissenting) (\u201cThough length of time may be the best measure of the impact of incarceration on a person accused of crime, perhaps due process judgments should take into account the reasons for pretrial delay in unusual circumstances.\u201d). <em>Cf. United States v. Theron, </em>782 F.2d 1510, 1516 (10th Cir.1986) (\u201cWe think some extension [of the ninety-day limit on incarceration before trial imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3164] is constitutionally permissible. Delays, for example, that the defendant caused would not raise a problem.\u201d). Otherwise, courts often would be forced by the duration of detention alone to release a palpably dangerous defendant, or a defendant palpably likely to flee or intimidate witnesses, where that defendant had suffered a serious physical disorder that had forced postponement of trial for more than a few weeks. Such a result would virtually scuttle the important governmental purposes promoted by the Bail Reform Act\u2019s pretrial detention provisions in cases where a defendant\u2019s physical ailments temporarily thwarted attempts by the government to bring about a speedy trial. By the happenstance of a defendant\u2019s medical difficulties, pretrial release would be necessary, despite the Act, before the government had any opportunity for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Congress dealt with similar concerns in the Speedy Trial Act, which excludes from the computation of the time within which trial must commence \u201cdelay resulting from any proceeding, including any examinations, to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(A), and \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent or physically unable to stand trial.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(4). Congress recognized that where a defendant is physically unfit for trial, the time constraints normally imposed upon the criminal process need not apply with full force. Congress, of course, acted in a different context, but we think the principle it recognized in the above-quoted provisions may properly be accorded weight in the due process calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">We also find indirect support in the settled authority upholding against due process challenge indefinite pretrial commitment of dangerous defendants found mentally incompetent to stand trial. <em>See Jackson v. Indiana, </em>406 U.S. 715, 731-33, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1854-55, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972); <em>Greenwood v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 366, 76 S.Ct. 410, 100 L.Ed. 412 (1956). Although the district court is manifestly correct that this line of authority cannot be dispositive of issues involving pretrial detention of mentally competent defendants, such as Zannino, nevertheless these cases do indirectly buttress the proposition that the due process clause imposes less stringent time limits upon the pretrial detention of a dangerous defendant who has been physically unable to stand trial. If a dangerous defendant can constitutionally be held indefinitely because mentally unfit for trial, it is reasonable that due process will permit a dangerous defendant to be held longer than would otherwise be permissible because physically unfit for trial although fit enough to remain dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Our conclusion that the circumstances of this case would permit a longer period of detention than the norm should not be tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>en to mean that in such cases the unusually long period of sixteen months is necessarily permissible. However, having found that the Act\u2019s purpose that society be protected from dangerous defendants applies with full force to Zannino, we cannot say that sixteen months\u2019 detention under the circumstances here \u201cappears excessive in relation to [that] purpose,\u201d <em>Schall v. Martin, </em>467 U.S. 253, 269, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 2412, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984). We reiterate that the government has done all it could to bring Zannino to trial expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We are also influenced by the fact that we are approving only a short, discrete, and finite additional period of detention. The district court is now in the process of submitting a series of questions to the panel of cardiologists, and has made it clear that its determination of Zannino's fitness for trial will be made next month (September 1986). Our result could be different if Zannino were now to be held on an open-ended basis pending some future determination of his fitness for trial to be made at an uncertain time. Nor do we necessarily suggest by our holding that Zannino can be detained indefinitely without trial in the event it is determined that his medical condition is chronic and deteriorating, that his dangerousness has been substantially reduced, if not eliminated, and that he cannot soon, or ever, be tried under any conditions. We merely hold that, under the unique circumstances of this case, pretrial detention will not cross the line between regulatory detention and impermissible \u201cpunishment\u201d by the time the district court, in early fall, determines Zannino\u2019s capacity to stand trial. Following that determination, the district court will need to make a further bail decision, as it acknowledged in its July 1 memorandum. Any outcome of the district court\u2019s medical inquiry other than the setting of an immediate trial date may raise anew the difficult constitutional issue discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The district court\u2019s order for temporary release on bail is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
