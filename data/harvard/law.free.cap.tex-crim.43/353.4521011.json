We have heretofore held that under an ordinary charge of theft prosecution could not be maintained, as contended by appellant, under the terms and conditions of article 884; that is, a charge under indictment for ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>theft could not be maintained for driving stock from the accustomed range. Long v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 461; Carr v. State, 9 Texas Crim. App., 463; Sands v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 578. It appears from the evidence here that the thief took the animal in charge, and rode it to the home of defendant, placed it in defendant\u2019s possession and custody. This would not constitute driving stock from its accustomed range, as contemplated by article 884, but would be an ordinary theft of .said animal. If appellant\u2019s contention be correct, under every case where the animal in question was taken from the range defendant must be prosecuted under article 884, Penal Code. We do not think this position is the law. If one take an animal from its range, and carry it off and sell it, in one sense this would be taking it from one range to another, but not within contemplation of article 884. Said article contemplates a driving of stock from its accustomed range, and not the bare theft of an animal running at large near the home of its owner, taken in custody by a thief, carried to another or adjoining neighborhood and sold.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b373-9\">[Hote.\u2014Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing was overruled without a written opinion.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In his second bill of exceptions, appellant complains because the court failed to sign the special charge requested by him and given to the jury by the court. The court explains this bill by stating that at the time said charge was read to the jury the court stated to the jury that he gave the same as the law applicable to the case. This complies with the spirit of the law, and appellant\u2019s contention is without merit. The jury had the charge in their possession. It was given them by the court, and the fact that the court did not sign the same would not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Appellant also insists that new trial should be granted on account of newly discovered evidence of Mrs. E. V. Terry, by whom he expected to prove that the mule in controversy had a brand on it prior to the time appellant took it. This testimony could have been secured by the use of even ordinary diligence, the witness being appellant\u2019s mother. Because the State proved said fact upon the trial, and appellant was surprised thereby, affords no legal basis for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Ho reversible error appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
