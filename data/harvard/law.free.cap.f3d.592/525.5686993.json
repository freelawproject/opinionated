(\u201cUnited\u201d) appeals a district court order affirming a bankruptcy court judgment allowing the bankruptcy trustee to avoid and recover certain payments made to United during the 90 days prior to the bankruptcy petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">Partitions Plus of Wilmington, Inc. (\u201cthe Debtor\u201d) filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on September 1, 2004. The case was subsequently converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding. Prior to its bankruptcy filing, the Debtor had subcontracted in several construction projects, and United had subcontracted with the Debtor to supply rental equipment. The Debtor executed payment and performance bonds with United States Fire Insurance Company (\u201cthe Surety\u201d), for the construction of several of these projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">In the 90-day period prior to the Debt- or\u2019s bankruptcy filing, the Debtor made three payments to United totaling $75,849.40 for amounts owed for United\u2019s prior provision of rental equipment and parts (\u201cthe transfers\u201d), $67,470.60 of which was for bonded projects. The bankruptcy trustee (\u201cthe Trustee\u201d) filed this action seeking to avoid and recover the transfers as preferential payments. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(b) (West 2004 &amp; Supp.2009). United denied that the transfers were avoidable and asserted defenses under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(c)(1), (3), and (4) (West 2004 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">The Bankruptcy Code\u2019s preference section serves two goals. First, it prevents companies from \u201cracing to the court-house to dismember the debtor during his slide into bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Harmon v. First Am. Bank of Md. (In re Jeffrey Bigelow Design Group, Inc.), </em>956 F.2d 479, 487 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). And second, it protects \u201cequality of distribution among creditors of the debtor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Except as specified in the Bankruptcy Code, a bankruptcy trustee may avoid as a preference a transfer made by an insolvent debtor to a creditor on account of an antecedent debt within 90 days before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition if a certain condition is satisfied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(b). That condition is that the transfer to be avoided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>must have enabled the creditor to receive more than it would have received from the debtor\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy on the debt the transfer extinguished if the payment sought to be avoided had never been made. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Section 547(c) provides exceptions for certain preferential transfers, the avoidance of which would not further the purposes of \u00a7 547(b). Section 547(c)(1) provides that a transfer cannot be avoided \u201cto the extent [it] was ... intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit [it] was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor; and [it] in fact [was] a substantially contemporaneous exchange.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(c)(1). The purpose of the \u00a7 547(c)(1) exception is \u201cto encourage creditors to continue to deal with troubled debtors without fear that they will have to disgorge payments received for value given.\u201d <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 547.04 (Alan N. Resnick <em>&amp; </em>Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed.2009). As its legislative history demonstrates, \u00a7 547(c)(1) was designed to address the \u201cgeneric problem [that] those on the verge of bankruptcy still need to buy things ... and the fact that checks are used (with a brief gap between purchase and payment) ought not render the payment avoidable as one made for an antecedent debt.\u201d <em>Collins v. Greater Atl. Mortgage Corp. (In re Lazarus), </em>478 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir.2007) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, at 373 (1977)); <em>see Batian v. TransAmerica Commercial Fin. Corp. (In re Smith\u2019s Home Furnishings, Inc.), </em>265 F.3d 959, 965 n. 4 (9th Cir.2001) (explaining that \u00a7 547(e)(1) \u201cwas designed to prevent trustees from avoiding payments that were clearly intended to support a new transaction, instead of an antecedent debt, even though the actual payment was not recorded until after the transaction\u201d). Protecting contemporaneous exchanges for new value from avoidance does not harm the preference section\u2019s goal of protecting the equality of distribution among the debtors because such exchanges do not diminish the size of the debtor\u2019s estate. <em>See Jones Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cent. States, Se. &amp; Sw. Areas Pension Fund (In re Jones Truck Lines), </em>130 F.3d 323, 326 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The Trustee moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the transfers satisfied the \u00a7 547(b) requirements, and United moved for summary judgment. The Trustee argued that it had established all of the \u00a7 547(b) elements as a matter of law. As is relevant here, United responded that the Trustee could not establish that the transfers were preferences under \u00a7 547(b) because the transferred funds were not property of the estate. United also argued that the Trustee could not satisfy \u00a7 547(b)(5) with regard to the transfers because United would have received full payment from the Surety by enforcing its bond rights had the Debtor .not made the transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">United further contended that the \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense applied because the transfers had the effect of discharging United\u2019s right to file and enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien. United finally maintained that certain payments from the Debtor to United were in exchange for new value in the form of credit extended to the Debtor after the transferred funds were received.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Considering the parties\u2019 cross-motions, the bankruptcy court ruled as a matter of law that the Trustee met its burden of establishing that the transfers were preferences under \u00a7 547(b). Regarding United\u2019s argument that had the challenged transfers not been made, United still would have received full payment from the bond, the court reasoned that the critical question with regard to \u00a7 547(b)(5) was not whether the creditor would have received payment from <em>another source </em>had the challenged transfer not been made, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>rather, whether it would have received payment from the Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate. As for United\u2019s new-value defense, the bankruptcy court noted that the Trustee did not dispute United\u2019s assertion that some payments made to the Debtor were in exchange for credit that United extended to the Debtor after the transferred funds were received. The bankruptcy court thus ruled that United was \u201centitled to a minimum credit of $8885.66 based on new value, and it has the right to try to increase that amount upon an appropriate showing at trial.\u201d J.A. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The case then proceeded to trial regarding United\u2019s \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense. United sought to prove that the transfers were substantially contemporaneous exchanges for new value because they extinguished United\u2019s rights to file and enforce a hen as well as its rights to obtain payment through the bond. The bankruptcy court found that the \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense was not established because the discharge of United\u2019s inchoate lien rights and bond rights did not constitute new value. The court noted that United had not perfected any lien or security interest in property to secure the Debtor\u2019s debt and thus had no interest to release in exchange for the transfers. The court ruled that to establish the \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense with regard to its inchoate lien and bond rights, United would have to prove that it would have timely enforced these rights and been paid in full had the challenged transfers not been made, and that at that time the Debt- or was still owed funds by the general contractor on which the Surety could have asserted a lien. Concluding that United failed to establish the former point, the court ruled that the Trustee was entitled to recover the remainder of the challenged transfers \u2014 $66,963.74\u2014for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. United then appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">United argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting partial summary judgment against it regarding whether the transfers were preferences under \u00a7 547(b). We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We review a grant of partial summary judgment by the bankruptcy court and the affirmance thereof by the district court de novo. <em>See Bank of N.Y. v. Treco (In re Treco), </em>240 F.3d 148, 155 (2d Cir. 2001). Summary judgment in bankruptcy is governed by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, which incorporates the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 into bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7056; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Thus, in reviewing a grant of partial summary judgment, we view the facts and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See EEOC v. Navy Fed. Credit Union, </em>424 F.3d 397, 405 (4th Cir.2005). Partial summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Cline v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 294, 300 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Section 547(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">Except as provided in [11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(c) and (i) ], the trustee may avoid any interest of the debtor in property-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">(2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">(3) made while the debtor was insolvent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">(4) made-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-14\">(A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-15\">(B) between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tion, if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an insider; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0T\">(5) <em>that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive \u00a5-</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\n<em>(A) the case were a case under chapter 7 of this title;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>(B) the transfer had not been made; and</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\n<em>(C) such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(b) (emphasis added); <em>see Morrison v. Champion Credit Corp. (In re Barefoot), </em>952 F.2d 795, 798 (4th Cir.1991). The bankruptcy trustee bears the burden of proving that a transfer is avoidable under \u00a7 547(b). <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(g) (West 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">United contends that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding at the summary judgment stage that the Trustee had established the fifth \u00a7 547(b) requirement as a matter of law. This is so, United argues, because had the transfers not been made, United could have received full payment from the Surety by enforcing its bond rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court properly rejected this argument, however. The \u00a7 547(b)(5) inquiry focuses \u201cnot on whether a creditor may have recovered all of the monies owed by the debtor <em>from any source whatsoever, </em>but instead upon whether the creditor would have received less than a 100% payout\u201d from the bankruptcy estate. <em>Smith v. Creative-Financial Mgmt., Inc., (In re Virginia-Carolina Fin. Corp.), </em>954 F.2d 193, 199 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">United next argues that the district court erred in finding that it did not establish a \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">We review the district court decision de novo, \u201ceffectively standing in its shoes to consider directly the findings of fact and conclusions of law by the bankruptcy court.\u201d <em>Cypher Chiropractic Ctr. v. Runski (In re Runski), </em>102 F.3d 744, 745 (4th Cir.1996). \u201c[W]e review legal conclusions by the bankruptcy court de novo and may overturn its factual determinations only upon a showing of clear error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\">The party against whom recovery or avoidance is sought bears the burden of proving a \u00a7 547(c) defense. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(g). As we have explained, \u00a7 547(c)(1) pre-vents a bankruptcy trustee from avoiding a transfer \u201cto the extent [it] was ... intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit [it] was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor; and [it] in fact [was] a substantially contemporaneous exchange.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(c)(1). The Bankruptcy Code defines \u201cnew value\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-18\">money or money\u2019s worth in goods, services, or new credit, or release by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>transferee of property previously transferred to such transferee in a transaction that is neither void nor voidable by the debtor or the trustee under any applicable law, including proceeds of such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(a)(2) (West 2004). \u201cNew value,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not include an obligation substituted for an existing obligation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">United argues that it established a \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense under the \u201cindirect transfer theory.\u201d In this regard, United first contends that had the Debtor not made the transfers, United nonetheless could have obtained full payment by enforcing its bond rights. United maintains that had the Surety paid such a claim under the bond, the Surety would have automatically received an equitable lien by subrogation against the funds the general contractor owed the Debtor. Relying on <em>O\u2019Rourke v. Seaboard Surety Co. (In re E.R. Fegert, Inc.), </em>887 F.2d 955 (9th Cir. 1989) <em>(\u201cFegert\u201d), </em>United argues that the money that the Debtor was eventually paid (that the Surety could have obtained directly from the general contractor had United enforced its bond rights) constituted new value to the Debtor for purposes of \u00a7 547(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In <em>Fegert, </em>a general contractor (\u201cthe debtor\u201d) defaulted on its payments to two subcontractors. <em>See Fegert, </em>887 F.2d at 956. The subcontractors, in turn, sued the debtor and the surety that had issued a payment and performance bond on the debtor\u2019s behalf. <em>See Fegert, </em>887 F.2d at 956. Prior to trial, the debtor and the surety made payments to the subcontractors that, when combined, satisfied the debt and resulted in dismissal of the suit. <em>See id. </em>Within 90 days of these payments, the debtor filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition that was later converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding. <em>See id. </em>In a subsequent adversary proceeding, the bankruptcy trustee sought to avoid the payments from the debtor as preferential. <em>See id. </em>The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment against the trustee, and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. <em>See id. </em>at 956-57. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that if the debtor had not paid the debt in full, the subcontractors would have been paid by the surety, which then would have had an equitable lien against the funds owed the debtor by the owner. <em>See id. </em>at 958-59. The court noted that \u201c[t]wo circuits have held that payments by a debtor in exchange for a secured creditor\u2019s release of its security interest falls within the exception of section 547(c)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 959 (citing <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Fuel Oil Supply &amp; Terminating, Inc. (In re Fuel Oil Supply &amp; Terminating, Inc.), </em>837 F.2d 224, 229-30 (5th Cir.1988), and <em>Kenan v. Fort Worth Pipe Co. (In re George Rodman, Inc.), </em>792 F.2d 125, 127 (10th Cir.1986)). The court therefore held that \u201c[t]he security interest constitutes the \u2018new value\u2019 that is \u2018contemporaneously exchanged\u2019 \u201d and noted that \u201cthe value of the debtor\u2019s estate is not diminished.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Without deciding the correctness of the <em>Fegert </em>court\u2019s conclusion that the release of the surety\u2019s security interest in that case constituted \u201cnew value\u201d contemporaneously received by the debtor, we conclude that that was not the case on the facts before us. Since United never even attempted to make any claim on the bond here, the Surety never obtained any lien that it could release. It is therefore not surprising that United does not even argue to us that the Debtor received new value by virtue of the removal of the possibility that any such lien would ever be created.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">What United does argue is that new value was given to the Debtor in the form of the <em>money </em>that it eventually received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>from the general contractors that might have instead been paid to the Surety had the Surety paid a bond claim. This argument does not work. Even if the money the Debtor paid to United in the transfers was eventually offset by the Debtor\u2019s later receipt of funds that the Surety might otherwise have claimed, United has not shown when the Debtor received this \u201cnew value.\u201d Accordingly, regardless of whether the transfers set in motion a chain of events that resulted in the Debtor\u2019s recoupment of the amounts paid, United did not show that such new value was \u201c \u2018given to the debtor\u2019 ... as part of a \u2018contemporaneous exchange.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. v. Cage (In re Ramha, Inc.), </em>416 F.3d 394, 399-400 (5th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[I]t is the precise benefit received ..., and not the secondary or tertiary effects thereof, that must fit within one of the five categories of \u2018new value\u2019 ... enumerated in \u00a7 547(a)(2).\u201d). In this case, the only benefit that United showed the Debt- or was given as part of the contemporaneous exchange for the transfers was the extinguishment of its debt, which does not fit within any of the five new-value categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Furthermore, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the transfers were part of a contemporaneous exchange for new value, United produced no evidence that the Debtor and United intended that would be the case. United failed to produce evidence that the parties viewed this transaction as anything more than the payment of the debt of an as-yet unsecured creditor; no evidence demonstrated when the parties believed the Debtor might recoup some of the transferred funds or even that they believed any funds would be recouped.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Similar to its argument that it could have pursued payment from the Surety, United contends that had the transfers not been made, it also could have pursued its right to file a North Carolina mechanic\u2019s lien on the real property improved by one of the construction projects. To the extent that United maintains that the new value given to the Debtor was money \u2014 the money it retained by not having to face offset claims that the property owner would have gained from United\u2019s enforcement of its lien rights \u2014 the argument fails for the same reasons we have discussed regarding its bond argument. United argues, however, that the discharge of United\u2019s inchoate lien rights themselves constitutes new value, independent of any financial benefit the Debtor received from the discharge. In particular, United claims that it held a security interest in the owners\u2019 properties at the time of the transfers (and thus \u201chad property previously transferred,\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(a)(2)) because the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes immediately grant a security interest to a supplier who furnishes labor or material to improve the property. The Code\u2019s definition of \u201ctransfer\u201d indeed includes \u201cthe creation of a lien.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(54)(A) (West Supp.2009). However, just as the Surety did not have an equitable lien to release since it had not paid a claim on the bond, United did not have a security interest to release because it never filed the mechanic\u2019s lien claim necessary to obtain such an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Under North Carolina law, a person who improves real property, including by providing rental equipment pursuant to a contract with the owner, \u201cshall, upon complying with the provisions of this Article, have a right to file a claim of lien on real property [also known as a mechanic\u2019s lien] on the real property to secure payment of all debts owing for\u201d rented equipment. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 44A-8 (2009); <em>see also </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 44A-12 (2009) (providing the place, time, and contents of the filing required for a mechanic\u2019s lien). Such a lien \u201cshall relate to and take effect from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the time of the first furnishing of labor or materials at the site of the improvement by the person claiming the claim of lien on real property.\u201d N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 44A-10 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">A first-, second-, or third-tier subcontractor who has furnished rental equipment in the improvement of real property, upon compliance with certain requirements, may also enforce the contractor\u2019s lien on real property. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-23 (2009). Once a subcontractor has filed a lien, it may enforce the lien within 180 days after the last furnishing of labor or materials to the real property by filing a lawsuit. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 44A-13 (2009). A mechanic\u2019s lien is discharged by failure to enforce the claim of lien within the prescribed time. <em>See </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 44A-16(3) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As we have explained, United claims that it held a security interest in the owners\u2019 properties at the time of the transfers because the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes immediately grant a security interest to a supplier who furnishes labor or material to improve the property. United bases this argument on the notion that a mechanic\u2019s lien, once filed, is retroactively effective to the time the material or labor were furnished. United\u2019s conclusion does not follow from its premise, however. North Carolina\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statutes grant a supplier of labor or material only <em>the right to file a mechanic\u2019s lien, </em>which United did not do here. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 44A-8 (\u201cAny person who ... furnishes rental equipment ... shall, upon complying with the provisions of this Article, have <em>a right to file a claim of lien </em>on real property.\u201d (emphasis added)). Only upon the filing of a claim for a mechanic\u2019s lien is the owner\u2019s property encumbered. Nee N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 44A-10 <em>(\u201cA claim of lien </em>on real property granted by this Article shall relate to and take effect from the time of the first furnishing of labor or materials at the site of the improvement by the person claiming the claim of lien on real property\u201d (emphasis added)). Because United had not filed such a claim when the transfers were made, no interest had been transferred to United and United had no such interest to release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">United argues that it would not make sense from a policy standpoint to force a subcontractor in United\u2019s position to refuse tendered payments and file a mechanic\u2019s lien. But it does not necessarily follow from our holding that subcontractors would need to take that course. Indeed, United argues in this very appeal that the Trustee, in order to prove that the transfers were even preferences under \u00a7 547(b), should have been required to show that had the transfers not been made, United would not have promptly filed lien claims and thereby attained secured-creditor status such that it could have obtained full payment in a hypothetical Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Whether United\u2019s argument is correct is an issue that will have to wait for another case in which the issue is properly preserved. <em>See supra, </em>at 531 n. 2 (explaining that we do not address this argument because United raised it for the first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">Our holding today is limited to the conclusion that United did not establish the \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense beyond the amounts determined by the bankruptcy court at the summary judgment stage. This holding makes perfect sense when viewed in the context of \u00a7 547(c)(i )\u2019s purpose, to accommodate the need of financially unsteady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>companies to use checks to pay for new transactions. <em>See In re Lazarus, </em>478 F.3d at 18; <em>In re Smith\u2019s Home Furnishings, Inc., </em>265 F.3d at 965 n. 4. The facts of this case, wherein the transfers were not made substantially contemporaneously with United\u2019s supplying of the equipment and parts that generated the debt, present a completely different scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court judgment in favor of the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-15\">. Unsecured creditors may then share in any avoided payments on a pro rata basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\">. United similarly argues that the court's resolution of the \u00a7 547(b) issue at the summary judgment stage was improper because the Trustee failed to show as a matter of law that, had the transfers not been made, United would not have obtained full payment from the hypothetical Chapter 7 estate by enforcing its lien rights and thereby attaining secured-creditor status. Because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we do not address it. <em>See Williams v. Prof'l Transp. Inc., </em>294 F.3d 607, 614 (4th Cir.2002) (\"Issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally not considered absent exceptional circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-20\">. United also argues that it established a defense under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 547(c)(6). Because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we do not consider it. <em>See Williams, </em>294 F.3d at 614.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">. United argues that <em>McCoy v. Wood, </em>70 N.C. 125 (1874), is to the contrary. However, as United concedes, <em>McCoy </em>did not interpret the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes at issue here. Indeed, the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes considered in McCoy did not have comparable wording to those before us now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
