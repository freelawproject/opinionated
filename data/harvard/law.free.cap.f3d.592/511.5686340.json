The district court sentenced him to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Before trial, Williams filed a motion to suppress the machine gun, the silencer, and a DVD containing the pornography, arguing that the search for and seizure of them exceeded the scope of the search warrant and that their seizure was not justified by the \u201cplain-view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. The district court denied the motion, and Williams now appeals this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the search for and seizure of the child pornography fell within the scope of the warrant or, alternatively, that its seizure was justified under the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement. We conclude that the seizure of the machine gun and silencer was justified by the plain-view exception. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">In September 2007, the Fairfax Baptist Temple in Fairfax Station, Virginia, began receiving threatening e-mail messages from an individual identifying himself as \u201cFranklin Pugh.\u201d Similar and related emails were later received from several other e-mail accounts, registered in the names of children attending the Fairfax Baptist Temple School, who had been referred to in the earlier e-mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">In an e-mail dated October 16, 2007, Pugh named several young boys who attended the Fairfax Baptist Temple School, describing their physical characteristics. He stated that he was a pedophile, that he could not face life without having sex with the boys, and that he could not attend the Fairfax Baptist Temple again unless he could give oral sex to a boy at the church whom he identified by name. At the end of the e-mail, he stated, \u201cI know your boy\u2019s names. I know where they go for lunch after church. I know where they live. I know when they come and leave school. There\u2019s boys I\u2019d love to sleep with right now. There is an endless supply. Boy dick is everywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">In an e-mail dated October 22, 2007, the sender, now identifying himself as one of the boys named in an earlier e-mail, wrote in the same vein as earlier e-mails. After sending several more e-mails, the sender announced that he would be getting a new account to send further messages. Nonetheless, several more e-mails were sent under this name, continuing to discuss molesting the boys at the Fairfax Baptist Temple School, sacrificing them to God <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>like Abraham and Isaac, and having sex with one of the boys post-sacrifice, unless \u201cGod makes me burn him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Beginning on October 24, 2007, similar e-mails were received from an account registered under the name of the father of the pastor of Fairfax Baptist Temple. Again the messages discussed molesting the boys there. One of these e-mails included the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">I think I might be close to getting saved. Jesus allowed me to see [Boy l\u2019s] erection last night. I prayed all day and all night and Jesus showed it to me. Just like Isaac\u2019s and Ishmael\u2019s penis[es] in the bible book. [Boy 1] is the most beautiful boy I have ever seen. Why did God make boys so beautiful if we aren\u2019t allowed to enjoy them? I know it will be a sin to have sex with [Boy 1] or [Boy 2] or especially the younger boys, but I can\u2019t see any way not to do it. Now that Jesus showed me his erection I know it is alright to love [Boy 1],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asu\">Upon investigation, the Fairfax County Police determined that at least one of the e-mail accounts from which e-mails had been received had been accessed repeatedly by an Inter net account registered to Karol Williams, in Clifton, Virginia, who is the wife of the defendant, Curtis Williams. Both Karol and Curtis were active members of the Fairfax Baptist Temple. Upon learning this, the police applied for a warrant to search Karol and Curtis Williams\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In the affidavit supporting the warrant application, Fairfax County Detective Craig Paul summarized the e-mails, detailed the police investigation to date, and stated that the evidence supported his belief that violations of state law had occurred, particularly \u00a7 18.2-60 of the Virginia Code, prohibiting any person from communicating threats to kill or do bodily harm to persons at elementary, middle, or secondary schools, and \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1, prohibiting harassment by computer by communicating \u201cobscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or makfing] any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature.\u201d To support his concern for the safety of the boys at the school, Detective Paul highlighted the e-mail statements, \u201cI know your boy\u2019s names. I know where they go for lunch after church. I know where they live. I know when they come and leave school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">In addition to providing the factual basis for the violations, Detective Paul explained, \u201cIt has been your Affiant\u2019s training and experience that adults who are engaged in the sexual exploitation of children keep images and related documents with them. They also collect images and texts describing sexual interaction with minors and child erotica.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The detective described the child pornography market, the use of computers and other recording devices, and the need to seize and search various types of electronic media to locate evidence of the threat crimes, including evidence properly characterized as child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Based on Detective Paul\u2019s affidavit, a Fairfax County magistrate issued a search warrant on October 25, 2007, that \u201ccommanded\u201d officers to search for and seize from the home of Karol and Curtis Williams:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">Any and all computer systems and digital storage media, videotapes, videotape recorders, documents, photographs, and Instrumentalities indicative] of the offense of \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 Harassment by Computer and \u00a7 18.2-60 Threats of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>death or bodily injury to a person or member of his family; threats to commit serious bodily harm to persons on school property, Code of Virginia (as amended). Police, along with the FBI, executed the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axl\">warrant the next day and seized several computers, CDs, DVDs, and other electronic media devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The police also seized a machine gun and a silencer, both without serial numbers, which they discovered during their search in a small lockbox in Williams\u2019 garage. Detective Peter Charles found the lockbox while searching the garage, and, believing that it might contain evidence authorized by the warrant, he opened it. Inside, Detective Charles observed a machine gun and silencer, although it was not immediately clear that these firearms were illegally owned. Detective Charles picked up the gun to determine whether it was loaded and, during the course of this inspection, noticed that neither the gun nor the silencer had a serial number on it. As Detective Charles later explained, \u201cBased on the examination, which is primarily for my own safety, to make sure [the gun] wasn\u2019t loaded, I noticed that neither the silencer nor the weapon itself had any serial numbers. In my experience and training, there is no reason for any weapon to have \u2014 not have any serial numbers and still be legally owned.\u201d Having identified the guns and silencer as contraband, Detective Charles seized them and continued his search.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The FBI agents who had participated in the search of the Williams\u2019 house took the computers and electronic media and later searched their contents. During the course of that search, FBI Agent Michael French reported in an e-mail sent to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Eastern District of Virginia that \u201cwe found many deleted images of young male erotica from September-October 2007. We also found [that] the anonymizer software TOR had been installed.\u201d He concluded by saying that he hoped to find Williams\u2019 \u201ccollection\u201d on the lap top and USB thumbdrives the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Sometime later during his search, Agent French opened a DVD that had been seized from the Williams\u2019 home, labeled with the words, \u201cVirus Shield, Quaranteed Files, Destroy.\u201d Upon opening the DVD, he observed over a thousand images in \u201cthumbnail view\u201d of minor boys, some of which were sexually suggestive and some of which were sexually explicit. Of the total number of images, approximately 39 constituted child pornography.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Williams was indicted on two counts of possession of an unregistered firearm (the machine gun and the silencer), in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871, and one count of possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and 2256(8)(A). After he was indicted, Williams filed a motion to suppress the child pornography, the machine gun, and the silencer, contending that their seizure exceeded the scope of the warrant and was not justified by the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The district court denied Williams\u2019 motion. The court explained, with respect to the child pornography, \u201cThe fact that a person who\u2019s already under suspicion for threatening to do bodily harm to minors would have imagery within his computer or within his home showing significant mistreatment of minors in my view is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ciently within the ambit of those concerns to permit the agents to search for that [under the warrant].\u201d The court concluded that the child pornography was \u201cevidence and instrumentalities of criminal activity\u201d and therefore that its seizure was authorized by the warrant. With respect to the machine gun and the silencer, the court concluded that their seizure was justified under the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">The officer was legitimately in the location where he saw the item, because the lockbox was large enough to hold the specific items that were involved in the warrant....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">The detective in my view was \u2014 legitimately had the right to handle the weapon to make sure it was not armed. In doing so he notices no serial number on either the silencer or the machine gun. That in my view was more than sufficient probable cause for the officer to believe that he had contraband per se in his possession. He was therefore obligated in my view to seize it at that point. That\u2019s not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Williams agreed to be tried by the court on stipulated facts, and the court found him guilty of all three charges. Williams now appeals the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress the DVD containing images of child pornography, the machine gun, and the silencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Williams contends first that the government\u2019s seizure of a DVD containing 39 images of child pornography, which formed the basis for his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and 2256(8)(A), violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. He asserts that the search warrant did not authorize a search of his computer and related digital media for child pornography. Rather, it only authorized a search for and seizure of evidence relating to two designated Virginia crimes involving threats of bodily harm and harassment by computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Indeed, his argument is more nuanced. Reasoning that \u201c[s]ince computers can hold so much information, touching on virtually every aspect of a person\u2019s life, the potential for invasion of privacy in a search of electronic evidence is significantly greater than in the context of a non-computer search,\u201d Williams argues that traditional Fourth Amendment rules cannot be successfully applied in this context. He specifically relies on an article by Professor Orin Kerr, in which Professor Kerr maintained that a new approach is needed for applying the Fourth Amendment to searches of computers and digital media. <em>See </em>Or\u00edn S. Kerr, <em>Searches and Seizures in a Digital World, </em>119 Harv. L.Rev. 531 (2005). Professor Kerr explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-12\">The new dynamics of computer searches and seizures teach important lessons about the Fourth Amendment. For most of its first two centuries, the Fourth Amendment was used almost exclusively to regulate government searches of homes and containers. The mechanisms of home and container searches directed Fourth Amendment doctrine to focus primarily on the entrance to the home or container. In a world of physical barriers, actions that broke down those physical barriers became the focus of judicial attention. The world of digital search and seizure shows that this focus is contingent on the architecture of physical searches. As computer searches and seizures become more common in the future, we will begin to see twentieth-century Fourth Amendment doctrine as a contingent set of rules that achieves the foundational goals of the Fourth Amendment law given the dynamics of searching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>physical property. Those physical rules will be matched by a set of rules for digital searches and seizures that attempts to achieve the same purpose in a very different factual context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 584-85; see <em>also </em>Raphael Winick, <em>Searches and Seizures of Computers and Computer Data, </em>8 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 75, 105 (1994) (\u201cSince electronic storage is likely to contain a greater quantity and variety of information than any previous storage method, computers make tempting targets in searches for incriminating information.\u201d). <em>But see </em>David J.S. Ziff, Note, <em>Fourth Amendment Limitations on the Execution of Computer Searches Conducted Pursuant to a Warrant, </em>105 Colum. L. Rev. 841, 861-72 (2005) (arguing that traditional Fourth Amendment rules can successfully be applied to digital searches).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Emphasizing the basic principle that a search warrant must not authorize general searches but must particularize the place and items to be searched, Williams argues that the warrant in this case must not be read to have authorized officers to view each file on the computer, but rather to have authorized a search of <em>only those files </em>in his computer that related to the designated state offenses. Applying this limitation to the search in this case, Williams argues that the authorization for the search of his computers and digital media was limited to files relating to the two Virginia crimes of threatening bodily harm and harassment by computer, and that the files relating to child pornography fell outside the scope of the warrant and therefore were seized without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In addition, Williams argues that the search for and seizure of child pornography in this case did not fall within any recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. To apply the plain-view exception in the context of computer searches would, Williams argues, \u201ceffectively read [] the warrant requirement out of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Relying heavily on <em>United States v. Carey, </em>172 F.3d 1268, 1273 (10th Cir. 1999), which held that child pornography discovered on a computer during the course of a search for evidence of drug transactions must be suppressed because it was not \u201cinadvertently discovered,\u201d Williams argues that the plain-view exception cannot be applied in the context of computer searches unless the files sought to be seized pursuant to the exception are discovered \u201cinadvertently.\u201d In this case, Williams observes that the officers suspected him of possessing child pornography from the outset of their investigation and that they used the warrant\u2019s authorization to search for such materials, which, he maintains, fell outside the scope of the warrant. Such a scenario, he concludes, can hardly be thought of as \u201cinadvertent,\u201d and thus the plain-view exception cannot justify the seizure of the images.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The government contends that the child pornography images fell within the scope of the search warrant as \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d of the designated Virginia crime involving threats to persons on school property. The government notes that Williams had been involved in \u201cextensive e-mail communications with church officials regarding the sexual exploitation of children. These e-mails involved both overt and thinly disguised threats to molest and kill real children attending the church. Further, at least one of these e-mails made express reference to the fact that defendant had knowledge of when the children \u2018come and leave school.\u2019 \u201d The government argues that in response to this threat, police officers obtained a search warrant authorizing the seizure of computer-based evidence of the designated crimes and instrumentalities for the commission of those crimes, which, because of the nature of the offenses, included an authorization to search for and seize child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The government also notes that, while it does not need to rely on the affidavit supporting the search warrant, the affidavit explained that individuals involved in the criminal conduct identified often collect images of the sexual exploitation of children and tend to collect these images through the Internet. Thus, it reasons, the district court was correct in finding that child pornography constituted an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of the designated crimes. It concludes, \u201cSimply stated, the child pornography constituted, among other things, computer-based evidence and/or an instrumentality indicative of the offense of Section 18.2-60 threats to commit serious bodily harm to persons on school property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Alternatively, the government contends that if the child pornography was seized without the warrant\u2019s authorization, its seizure was nonetheless justified under the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement. It observes that the war rant authorized officers to search Williams\u2019 computer and computer storage devices and that, during the search of those items, the officers came upon the DVD containing thumbnail images of child pornography, whose nature as contraband was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The parties\u2019 contentions thus present two questions: (1) whether the government\u2019s search for and seizure of child pornography fell within the scope of the warrant\u2019s authorization; and (2) whether the evidence of child pornography was in any event properly seized under the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement. We address these in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d and provides that \u201cno warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d At its core, the Fourth Amendment protects against general warrants that authorize \u201cexploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings ... by requiring a particular description of the things to be seized.\u201d <em>Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 480, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). The particularity requirement is fulfilled when the warrant identifies the items to be seized by their relation to designated crimes and when the description of the items leaves nothing to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant. <em>See Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 480-82, 96 S.Ct. 2737; <em>Stanford v. Texas, </em>379 U.S. 476, 485, 85 S.Ct. 506, 13 L.Ed.2d 431 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">When a search is conducted pursuant to a warrant, it \u201cis limited in scope by the terms of the warrant\u2019s authorization.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>588 F.3d 218, 223 (4th Cir.2009); <em>see also Walter v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 649, 656, 100 S.Ct. 2395, 65 L.Ed.2d 410 (1980) (plurality opinion); <em>United States v. Sqtiillacote, </em>221 F.3d 542, 555 (4th Cir.2000). But the terms of the warrant are not to be interpreted in a \u201chypertechnical\u201d manner. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>275 F.3d 371, 380 (4th Cir.2001). Rather, they should be read with a \u201ccommonsense and realistic\u201d approach, to avoid turning a search warrant into a \u201cconstitutional straight jacket.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>588 F.3d at 223 (quoting <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965), and <em>United States v. Dornhofer, </em>859 F.2d 1195, 1198 (4th Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">When a search requires review of a large collection of items, such as papers, \u201cit is certain that some innocuous documents will be examined, at least cursorily, in order to deter mine whether they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>are, in fact, among those papers authorized to be seized.\u201d <em>Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 482 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2737; <em>see also United States v. Crouch, </em>648 F.2d 932, 933-34 (4th Cir. 1981) (holding that officers may conduct \u201csome cursory reading\u201d of documents discovered during the course of a search to determine their relevance to the crime providing the basis for the search). If, in those circumstances, documents not covered by the warrant are improperly seized, the government should promptly return the documents or the trial judge should sup press them. <em>See Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 482 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2737. While the constitutional protection cannot demand perfection, any tolerance of imperfection does not give officers \u201cfree rein to ransack and take what they like[ <em>Phillips, </em>588 F.3d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In this case, the warrant authorized a search for and seizure of \u201c[a] ny and all computer systems and digital storage media, ... documents, photographs, and Instrumentalities\u201d indicative of the Vmginia state law offenses stated in Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 (harassment by computer) and 18.2-60 (threats of death or bodily injury to a person or member of his family; threats to commit serious bodily harm to persons on school property). A violation of the referenced harassment by computer offense includes using a computer or computer network \u201cto communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or to make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. The district court held that within the scope of that offense was the narrower conduct of making violent and sexual threats against children from the Williams\u2019 residence. The court concluded that it was relevant to any prosecution of the designated offense that the defendant possessed images in which children were sexually exploited. It thus found that the images of child pornography on the DVD were \u201cinstrumentalities\u201d of the computer harassment charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We agree with the court\u2019s reasoning. While the warrant did not explicitly authorize a search for child pornography, it did authorize a search for instrumentalities of computer harassment and \u201cphotographs ... indicative] of\u2019 this offense, which involves communicating \u201cobscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language,\u201d or making a \u201csuggestion or proposal of an obscene nature,\u201d or threatening an \u201cillegal or immoral act.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. Particularly in the context of the threats made in this case, which indicated that the person sending the emails to the church was a pedophile, pornographic images involving children were relevant to demonstrating the authorship and purpose of the e-mails. The e-mails stated that the sender could not face life without having sex with the boys and that he could not attend the church again unless he could give oral sex to a specific boy at the church, whom he identified by the child\u2019s actual name. In addition, the sender of the e-mail stated, \u201cI know your boy\u2019s names. I know where they go for lunch after church. I know where they live. I know when they come and leave school. There\u2019s boys I\u2019d love to sleep with right now. There is an endless supply. Boy dick is everywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The fact that the DVD containing child pornography might also have indicated crimes other than those described in the warrant does not preclude its seizure. \u201cCourts have never held that a search is overbroad merely because it results in additional criminal charges.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>588 F.3d at 224. Thus, the fact that possession of child pornography is itself a crime does not render the seizure outside the scope of an investigation into the computer harassment crime. Whether seized evidence falls within the scope of a warrant\u2019s au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>thorization must be assessed solely in light of the relation between the evidence and the terms of the warrant\u2019s authorization. <em>See id,.; United States v. Srivastava, </em>540 F.3d 277, 290 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In this case, we believe that the district court did not err in concluding that the images of child pornography contained on the DVD were sufficiently relevant to the crimes designated in the warrant to justify their seizure under the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Even if we were to conclude that the warrant did not authorize a search for child pornography, we conclude alternatively that the seizure of the images portraying child pornography was, in any event, justified by the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">As a general rule, warrantless searches or seizures are per se unreasonable. But there are \u201ca few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 390, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978) (quoting <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)); <em>see also United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 824-25, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982). One such exception is that \u201cunder certain circumstances the police may seize evidence in plain view with out a warrant.\u201d <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 465, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (plurality opinion). Under this exception, police may seize evidence in plain view during a lawful search if (1) the seizing officer is \u201clawfully present at the place from which the evidence can be plainly viewed\u201d; (2) the seizing officer has \u201c \u2018a lawful right of access to the object itself \u201d; and (3) \u201cthe object\u2019s \u2018incriminating character [is] ... immediately apparent,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Legg, </em>18 F.3d 240, 242 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 136-37, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990)); <em>see also United States v. Uzenski, </em>434 F.3d 690, 707 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe plain-view doctrine is grounded on the proposition that once police are lawfully in a position to observe an item first-hand, its owner\u2019s privacy interest in that item is lost; the owner may retain the incidents of title and possession <em>but not privacy.\u201d Illinois v. Andreas, </em>463 U.S. 765, 771, 103 S.Ct. 3319, 77 L.Ed.2d 1003 (1983) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The justification for the plain-view exception becomes evident when considering the difference between searches and seizures. \u201cA search compromises the individual interest in privacy; a seizure deprives the individual of dominion over his or her person or property.\u201d <em>Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 133, 110 S.Ct. 2301. \u201cIf an article is already in plain view, neither its observation nor its seizure would involve any invasion of <em>privacy. </em>A seizure of the article, however, would obviously invade the owner\u2019s <em>possessory </em>interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133-34, 110 S.Ct. 2301 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Thus, the <em>mere observation </em>of an item in plain view during the course of a lawful search does not implicate any Fourth Amendment concerns and therefore does not need to be justified by any exception to the warrant requirement. And its <em>seizure </em>is justified by the fact that any ownership or possessory interest in the item is defeated by its illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">In this case, the warrant authorized a search of Williams\u2019 computers and digital media for evidence relating to the designated Virginia crimes of making threats and computer harassment. To conduct that search, the warrant impliedly authorized officers to open each file on the computer and view its contents, at least cursorily, to determine whether the file fell within the scope of the warrant\u2019s authori<em>zation </em>\u2014 i.e., whether it related to the des<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ignated Virginia crimes of making threats or computer harassment. <em>See Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 482 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2737; <em>Crouch, </em>648 F.2d at 933-34. To be effective, such a search could not be limited to reviewing only the files\u2019 designation or labeling, because the designation or labeling of files on a computer can easily be manipulated to hide their substance. Surely, the owner of a computer, who is engaged in criminal conduct on that computer, will not label his files to indicate their criminality. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>459 F.3d 966, 978 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c \u2018Criminals will do all they can to conceal contraband, including the simple expedient of changing the names and extensions of files to disguise their content from the casual observer\u2019 \u201d (quoting with approval the district court\u2019s opinion)); <em>United States v. Gray, </em>78 F.Supp.2d 524, 527 n. 5 (E.D.Va.1999) (\u201c[Computer files can be misleadingly labeled, particularly if the owner of those files is trying to conceal illegal materials\u201d); see <em>also United States </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>906 F.2d 841, 845 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201c[F]ew people keep documents of their criminal transactions in a folder marked \u2018drug records\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Once it is accepted that a computer search must, by implication, authorize at least a cursory review of each file on the computer, then the criteria for applying the plain-view exception are readily satisfied. <em>See </em>Ziff, <em>supra, </em>at 861-66. <em>First, </em>an officer who has legal possession of the computer and electronic media and a legal right to conduct a search of it is \u201claw fully present at the place from which evidence can be viewed,\u201d thus satisfying the first element of the plain-view exception. <em>See Legg, </em>18 F.3d at 242 (quoting <em>Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 136, 110 S.Ct. 2301). <em>Second, </em>the officer, who is , authorized to search the computer and electronic media for evidence of a crime and who is therefore legally authorized to open and view all its files, at least cursorily, to determine whether any one falls within the terms of the warrant, has \u201ca lawful right of access\u201d to all files, albeit only momentarily. <em>Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 136, 110 S.Ct. 2301; <em>see also Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 482 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2737; <em>Crouch, </em>648 F.2d at 933-34. And <em>third, </em>when the officer then comes upon child pornography, it becomes \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d that its possession by the computer\u2019s owner is illegal and incriminating. <em>See Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 136, 110 S.Ct. 2301. And so, in this case, any child pornography viewed on the computer or electronic media may be seized under the plain-view exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Williams, relying on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Carey, </em>advances an argument that the plain-view exception cannot apply to searches of computers and electronic media when the evidence indicates that it is the officer\u2019s <em>purpose </em>from the outset to use the authority of the warrant to search for unauthorized evidence because the unauthorized evidence would not then be uncovered \u201cinadvertently.\u201d <em>See Carey, </em>172 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">This argument, however, cannot stand against the principle, well-established in Supreme Court jurisprudence, that the scope of a search conducted pursuant to a warrant is defined <em>objectively </em>by the terms of the warrant and the evidence sought, not by the <em>subjective </em>motivations of an officer. <em>See Maryland v. Garrison, </em>480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S.Ct. 1013, 94 L.Ed.2d 72 (1987) (\u201cThus, the scope of a lawful search is \u2018defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe it may be found\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 824, 102 S.Ct. 2157)); <em>see also Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (\u201cSubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis\u201d). As the Court stated in <em>Horton, </em>\u201c[t]he fact that an officer is interested in an [unauthorized] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of a search should not invalidate its seizure if the search is confined in area and duration by the terms of a war rant or a valid exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d 496 U.S. at 138, 110 S.Ct. 2301. In that case, the Court <em>explicitly </em>rejected the very argument that Williams makes in this case, that unauthorized evidence must be suppressed because its discovery was not \u201cinadvertent.\u201d As the <em>Horton </em>Court explained, \u201c[Ejven though inadvertence is a characteristic of most legitimate \u2018plain view\u2019 seizures, it is not a necessary condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 110 S.Ct. 2301.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">While Williams relies accurately on <em>Carey, </em>which effectively imposes an \u201cinadvertence\u201d requirement, such a conclusion is inconsistent with <em>Horton. </em>Inadvertence focuses incorrectly on the subjective motivations of the officer in conducting the search and not on the objective determination of whether the search is authorized by the warrant or a valid exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In this case, because the scope of the search authorized by the warrant included the authority to open and cursorily view each file, the observation of child pornography within several of these files did not involve an intrusion on Williams\u2019 protected privacy interests beyond that already authorized by the warrant, regardless of the officer\u2019s subjective motivations. <em>See Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 133-34 &amp; n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 2301. And neither did the seizure of these photographs interfere with Williams\u2019 possessory interests, for once their nature as contraband became apparent, Williams\u2019 possessory interests were forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">At bottom, we conclude that the sheer amount of information contained on a computer does not distinguish the authorized search of the computer from an analogous search of a file cabinet containing a large number of documents. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Andresen, </em>\u201c[T]here are grave dangers inherent in executing a warrant authorizing a search and seizure of a person\u2019s papers that are not necessarily present in executing a warrant to search for physical objects whose relevance is more easily ascertainable.\u201d 427 U.S. at 482 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2737. While that danger certainly counsels care and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>respect for privacy when executing a warrant, it does not pre vent officers from lawfully searching the documents, nor should it undermine their authority to search a computer\u2019s files. <em>See United, States v. Giberson, </em>527 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2008) (holding that \u201cneither the quantity of information, nor the form in which it is stored, is legally relevant in the Fourth Amendment context\u201d). We have applied these rules successfully in the context of warrants authorizing the search and seizure of non-eleetronic files, <em>see Crouch, </em>648 F.2d at 933-34, and we see no reason to depart from them in the con text of electronic files.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Thus, the warrant in this case, grounded on probable cause to believe that evidence relating to the Virginia crimes of threatening bodily harm and computer harassment would be found on Williams\u2019 computers and digital media, authorized the officers to search these computers and digital media for files satisfying that description, regardless of the officers\u2019 motivations in conducting the search. If, in the course of conducting such a search, the officers came upon child pornography, even if finding child pornography was their hope from the outset, they were permitted to seize it as direct evidence of criminal conduct and, indeed, bring additional charges based on that evidence. <em>See Phillips, </em>588 F.3d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Williams also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the machine gun and silencer found by police during the search of his home. He argues that because the gun and silencer were lying in a lockbox, they did not pose a risk to the searching officers, and therefore the officers did not have any justification to pick them up to discover that they lacked serial numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">To support his argument, Williams relies most heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987), where the Court held that an officer violated the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when the officer, even though legally in the defendant\u2019s apartment in response to a shooting that had just taken place, picked up some stereo components without a warrant to see their serial numbers and determine whether they had been stolen. <em>Id. </em>at 323-26, 107 S.Ct. 1149. Williams maintains that because the officers searching his home did not have probable cause to believe that the machine gun and silencer were illegal before one of the officers handled the items to make a safety inspection, the inspection of the machine gun and silencer was, like in <em>Hicks, </em>an unreasonable warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The government responds by arguing that this case is distinguishable from <em>Hicks </em>because of \u201cthe fundamentally different character of an officer moving an innocuous piece of stereo equipment that is completely unrelated to the reason the officer is lawfully present in an apartment and an officer temporarily handling a firearm in order to ensure officer safety in a home where the potential for violence existed.\u201d The government relies on our opinion in <em>United States v. Legg, </em>18 F.3d 240 (4th Cir.1994), in which we held that officer safety gave police executing a warrant in a defendant\u2019s home the right to handle a gun that had accidentally fallen on the floor when members of the defendant\u2019s family refused to cooperate and insisted on walking around the house. Based on this, the government argues that concerns for officer safety gave Detective Charles the right to inspect the gun to ensure that it was not loaded and that its incriminating nature became \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d during the course of this lawful inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>While we agree with Williams that the mere fact that the item involved was a gun rather than a stereo does not serve to distinguish this case from <em>Hicks, </em>we believe Detective Charles\u2019 decision to inspect the gun was justified here because he had the authority under the warrant to conduct a thorough search of the lockbox. The warrant authorized the police to search for things like disks and \u201cthumbnail drives,\u201d which, the evidence showed, could be as small as a dime, and which could very easily have been stored in the lockbox with the gun and silencer. A thorough search of the lockbox would therefore have required Detective Charles to move the gun and silencer, even if only within the confines of the lockbox. And before moving the gun, Detective Charles was entitled to pick it up and determine whether it was loaded, for his own safety. It was during that legitimate operation of determining whether the gun was loaded that detective Charles discovered the missing serial number, manifesting the gun\u2019s illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Thus, because it was during the course of a legitimate safety inspection that the incriminating character of the machine gun and silencer became \u201cimmediately apparent,\u201d Detective Charles\u2019 warrantless seizure of them was justified by the plain-view exception. <em>See Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 136-37, 110 S.Ct. 2301.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">For the reasons given, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">. \"Child erotica\u201d is understood to refer to non-pornographic images of children, apparently used for sexual gratification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">. After observing these images, Agent French obtained a second search warrant from federal authorities specifically to authorize a search for child pornography on Williams' computers and electronic media. Williams' challenge to the search and seizure, however, is directed to the authority of the officers to search the computers and electronic media under the state warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">. We note that several of our cases decided prior to <em>Horton </em>required that evidence discovered during the course of a search be discovered \"inadvertently\u201d in order to be seized pursuant to the plain-view exception. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Talbott, 902 </em>F.2d 1129, 1132 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201cUnder the plain-view doctrine, the warrantless seizure of property is permissible if the following criteria are satisfied: (1) the police officer must first be engaged in a lawful intrusion or must otherwise legitimately occupy the position affording a plain view of the evidence seized; (2) the discovery of the evidence must be inadvertent; and (3) it must be immediately apparent that the evidence may be either contraband or evidence of a crime\u201d); <em>United States v. Fawole, </em>785 F.2d 1141, 1145 (4th Cir.1986) (\"The warrantless seizure of private possessions is permissible under the 'plain view' doctrine if the seizure meets three conditions .... Second, the police officer must discover the incriminating evidence 'inadvertently' \u201d). These cases relied on a statement to this effect in the Supreme Court's plurality opinion in <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 469-70, 91 S.Ct. 2022, which the Supreme Court specifically repudiated in <em>Horton. See Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 130, 110 S.Ct. 2301 (\"In this case we revisit an issue that was considered, but not conclusively resolved, in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971): Whether the warrantless seizure of evidence of crime in plain view is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment if the discovery of the evidence was not inadvertent. We conclude that even though inadvertence is a characteristic of most legitimate 'plain-view' seizures, it is not a necessaiy condition\u201d). To the extent that these cases suggested that inadvertence is a requirement of a warrantless plain-view seizure, they are now overruled by <em>Horton.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
