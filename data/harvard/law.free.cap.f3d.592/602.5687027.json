First, Abdelshafi contends the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt of aggravated identity theft, as a matter of law, because the Government failed to prove that he used Medicaid patients\u2019 identifying information \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Second, Abdelshafi argues that his sentence on the health-care-fraud counts should be vacated because he should not have received a two-level, offense-level enhancement for abuse of trust. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although the parties vigorously contest how the law applies to the essential facts of this case, those facts are not in dispute. Virginia Premier Health Plan (\u201cVirginia Premier\u201d), a health maintenance organization, contracts with the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services to provide medical services \u2014 including medical transportation services \u2014 to Medicaid patients in Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some medical transportation services are provided directly by Virginia Premier, while others are contracted to third-party vendors. Abdelshafi owned and operated one such third-party vendor, Shafi Medical Transportation (\u201cSMT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Virginia Premier contracted with SMT to provide medical transportation to some of its members. Typically, Virginia Premier would send SMT a daily trip log, which included patients\u2019 identifying information, contact information, and trip details. Importantly, the patient\u2019s identifying information included that person\u2019s Medicaid identification number. The data in these trip logs served as SMT\u2019s direction to transport patients and to bill Virginia Premier. For example, each handwritten claim form Abdelshafi submitted on behalf of SMT included the patient\u2019s name, date of birth, Medicaid identification number, date of service, pick-up and drop-off locations, and number of miles traveled. Virginia Premier would then pay SMT based on such factors as the mileage traveled, driver\u2019s wait time, whether wheelchair transportation was provided, and whether transportation was provided outside of normal business hours, all as submitted by Abdelshafi.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">SMT\u2019s billing practices came under suspicion after Virginia Premier discovered that several claim forms Abdelshafi submitted contained substantially inflated mileage amounts. The ensuing investigation by state and federal authorities revealed that Abdelshafi not only inflated mileage amounts, but also submitted claim forms for trips that did not, in fact, occur. Investigators concluded these billing practices allowed Abdelshafi to collect at least $308,329.00 in fraudulent payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">At trial, Abdelshafi argued in a motion for acquittal that he could not be guilty of aggravated identity theft because he did not use Medicaid patients\u2019 identifying information \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Abdelshafi contended that since Virginia Premier specifically furnished him with patients\u2019 identifying information for use in SMT\u2019s billing, he was in lawful possession of the Medicaid identification numbers and other identifying information. In Abdelshafi\u2019s view, \u201cexcessive use\u201d of that legitimately obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>identifying information \u201cover and above\u201d what was authorized by Virginia Premier did not constitute a use \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 384. Abdelshafi argued that to be a use \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d an individual must \u201ctry [ ] to take someone else\u2019s identity and pretend to be that person or ... pretend that they have been providing services for that person.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court considered the matter and ruled that the aggravated-identity-theft statute \u201cdoes not require that\u201d another\u2019s identifying information \u201cbe stolen\u201d or misappropriated. <em>Id. </em>at 394. Further, the court read 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) to proscribe the use of another \u201cperson\u2019s identity for any unlawful purpose! ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARq\">The Court is of the opinion that reading the statute over, it indicates that it is unlawful to use a person\u2019s identity for any unlawful purposes, and that it\u2019s the use of it that is important. They may have the authority to have the identification for one purpose but yet may not use it for another unlawful purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">This situation is the latter. There was no authority to use the identity of either of these two individuals for the purpose of filing a false medical claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_4\"><em>Id. </em>at 394-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">At sentencing, Abdelshafi also objected to a proposed two-level enhancement of his Guidelines offense level on the health-care-fraud counts for abusing a position of trust. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. First, Abdelshafi maintained that his relationship with Virginia Premier consisted of a mere \u201cordinary commercial contract\u201d and thus did not involve a position of trust. J.A. at 418. Second, focusing on the limited services SMT provided, Abdelshafi argued that he did not possess the \u201csignificant amount of discretion\u201d necessary to support such an enhancement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The district court determined that the appropriate inquiry turned on \u201cthe total discretion\u201d Abdelshafi possessed \u201cwith respect to the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. Abdelshafi, in the district court\u2019s view, \u201cexercise[d] discretion\u201d in recording \u201chow many miles that he drove, the time of day, [and] the type of transportation\u201d in what was \u201csomewhat of a self-policing relationship\u201d in regard to billing Virginia Premier. <em>Id. </em>at 427. In addition, Abdelshafi\u2019s discretion in this regard occurred in the context \u201cof providing Medicaid services\u201d and clearly involved \u201ccompensat[ion] from Medicaid funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426. The district court consequently overruled Abdelshafi\u2019s objection and increased his offense level by two levels for abusing a position of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">On appeal, Abdelshafi reasserts these arguments in contending that the district court erred in denying his motion for acquittal on the aggravated identity theft counts and in imposing a Guidelines enhancement for abuse of trust. \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion, made pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>470 F.3d 150, 160 (4th Cir.2006). Similarly, we \u201creview de novo the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of what constitutes \u2018a position of trust\u2019 under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 3B.3,\u201d but our review of the district court\u2019s \u201cfactual findings\u201d is only \u201cfor clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 535-36 (4th Cir.2005). We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">A. Aggravated Identity Theft</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">The aggravated-identity-theft statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, in pertinent part reads as follows: \u201cWhoever, during and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection (c), knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>means of identification of another person shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). This mandatory two-year sentence must run consecutive to \u201cany other term of imprisonment imposed on the person under any other provision of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1028A(b)(2). .</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">To establish a violation of \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), the Government must prove the defendant (1) knowingly transferred, possessed, or used, (2) without lawful authority, (3) a means of identification of another person, (4) during and in relation to a predicate felony offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l); <em>see also United States v. Stephens, </em>571 F.3d 401, 404-405 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 606-07 (11th Cir.2007), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). Abdelshafi\u2019s convictions for health care fraud qualified as predicate felony offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The argument on appeal relates only to the second element of a \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) offense, as Abdelshafi maintains that his use of Medicaid patients\u2019 identifying information was not \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d In order to use the identification of another without lawful authority, Abdelshafi contends that a defendant must \u201cmisappropriat[e] or misrepresent [ ] ... someone\u2019s identity or identifying information.\u201d Opening Brief at 16. Because he \u201cdid not steal or otherwise unlawfully obtain,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, Medicaid patients\u2019 identifying information or \u201cmisrepresent [ ] ... his own or some other person\u2019s identity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 22, Abdelshafi argues he did not commit aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">When engaging in statutory interpretation, we \u201cfirst and foremost strive to implement congressional intent by examining the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Passaro, </em>577 F.3d 207, 213 (4th Cir.2009). \u201c[AJbsent ambiguity or a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary,\u201d we thus give a statute its \u201cplain meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 68 (4th Cir.1993). A statute\u2019s plain meaning is determined by reference to its words\u2019 \u201cordinary meaning at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>247 F.3d 118, 122 (4th Cir.2001). We remain mindful that in \u201cinterpreting the plain language of a statute, we give the terms their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, absent an indication Congress intended\u201d the statute\u2019s language \u201cto bear some different import.\u201d <em>Stephens ex rel. R.E. v. Astrue, </em>565 F.3d 131 (4th Cir. 2009) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">As the Supreme Court noted in its discussion of \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), \u201c[n]o special context is present here.\u201d 129 S.Ct. at 1891. Our analysis accordingly focuses on the statute\u2019s plain text. We agree with the Eleventh Circuit that \u201c[n]othing in the plain language of the statute requires that the means of identification\u201d at issue \u201cmust have been stolen\u201d- \u2014 -or as Abdelshafi characterizes the point \u201cmisappropriated\u201d\u2014 \u201cfor a \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) violation to occur.\u201d <em>Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d at 607. Consequently, \u201cstrong textual reasons\u201d support our rejection of Abdelshafi\u2019s version of the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1890.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">The Eleventh Circuit in <em>Hurtado </em>aptly stated the pertinent point: \u201cFor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>sure, stealing and then using another person\u2019s identification would fall within the meaning of \u2018without lawful authority.\u2019 However, there are other ways someone could possess or use another person\u2019s identification, yet not have \u2018lawful authority\u2019 to do so.\u201d 508 F.3d at 607. For example, in this case, Abdelshafi came into lawful possession, initially, of Medicaid patients\u2019 identifying information and had \u201clawful authority\u201d to use that information for proper billing purposes. He did not have \u201clawful authority,\u201d however, to use Medicaid patients\u2019 identifying information to submit fraudulent billing claims. We thus find no textual basis in the statute for Abdelshafi\u2019s assertion that identifying information must be stolen or \u201cmisappropriated\u201d to be used \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Section \u00a7 1028A(a)(l)\u2019s \u201cbroader context\u201d further supports our conclusion that a person need not \u201cmisappropriate\u201d another\u2019s identity to use it \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d <em>Passaro, </em>577 F.3d at 213. As noted in <em>Hurtado, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028 \u2014 the section preceding \u00a7 1028A \u2014 \u201cenumerates eight identity-fraud violations.\u201d 508 F.3d at 607-08. Two of these violations specifically require that an identification document be <em>\u201cstolen </em>or produced without lawful authority.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028(a)(2) &amp; (6) (emphasis added); <em>see also Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">If Congress had wished to include a misappropriation element in the aggravated-identity-theft statute it stands to reason that it would have included language in \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) similar to that used in the immediately preceding section. As the <em>Hurtado </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">If Congress intended to provide for an enhanced penalty only when an identification was stolen by a defendant and then used in the commission of another crime (such as passport fraud), it easily could have used the words \u201cstolen\u201d or \u201ctheft\u201d in \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). The fact that Congress used the word \u201cstolen\u201d in \u00a7 1028, but chose the broader phrase \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d in \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) plainly indicates that Congress intended to prohibit a wider range of activities in \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) than just theft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">508 F.3d at 608. The fact that Congress did not include such language in \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) supports our conclusion that the aggravated-identity-theft statute does not contain a misappropriation element: \u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dean v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 1854, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009) (quoting <em>Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983)) (alteration in original); <em>see also Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Contrary to Abdelshafi\u2019s assertions, the aggravated-identity-theft stat-' ute\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d is \u201cbroad and unambiguous.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>United States v. Monsanto, </em>491 U.S. 600, 609, 109 S.Ct. 2657, 105 L.Ed.2d 512 (1989); <em>see also Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d at 608 n. 6. The statute prohibits an individual\u2019s knowing use of another person\u2019s identifying information without a form of authorization recognized by law. <em>See United States v. Hines, </em>472 F.3d 1038, 1039-40 (8th Cir.2007). While Abdelshafi had authority to possess the Medicaid identification numbers, he had <em>no </em>authority to use them unlawfully so as to perpetuate a fraud. We, therefore, decline to narrow the application of \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) to cases in which an individual\u2019s identity has been misrepresented, as it would clearly be inappropriate for us \u201cto adopt an interpretation [ ] not supported by the plain text of the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Pressley, </em>359 F.3d 347, 351 (4th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Our conclusion in this regard is not altered by Abdelshafi\u2019s representation that \u201cevery single incident of health care fraud by a provider would also constitute aggravated identity theft\u201d if his conduct is deemed to violate the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Opening Brief at 21. Section 1028A(a)(l) provides an enhanced penalty for those who unlawfully use another\u2019s identifying information during and in relation to a broad array of predicate offenses, including crimes related to the \u201ctheft of government property\u201d and \u201cfraud,\u201d as well as offenses involving \u201cunlawful activities related to passports, visas, and immigration.\u201d <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1888-89. That a single type of health care fraud related to provider payments \u2014 a subset of crimes involving fraud- and theft \u2014 may fall within the statutory ambit is not particularly noteworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\u201cEven if we were more persuaded than we are by [this] policy argument [ ], the result in this case would be unchanged. Resolution of the pros and cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or narrowly is for Congress.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>466 U.S. 475, 484, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 80 L.Ed.2d 492 (1984). We adhere to the principle that \u201c[federal crimes are defined by Congress, and so long as Congress acts within its constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tional power in enacting a criminal statute, this Court must give effect to Congress\u2019 expressed intention concerning the scope of conduct prohibited.\u201d <em>United States v. Kozminski, </em>487 U.S. 931, 939, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988). Congress\u2019 decision to impose additional punishment on those who use another\u2019s identifying information to submit fraudulent claims for payment for health-care related services \u201cis not so \u2018absurd or glaringly unjust\u2019 as to lead us to question whether Congress actually intended what the plain language of [\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) ] so clearly imports.\u201d <em>Rodgers, </em>466 U.S. at 484, 104 S.Ct. 1942 (quoting <em>Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 450, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932)) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">After all, the use of another person\u2019s means of identification makes a fraudulent claim for payment much harder to detect and, therefore, more likely to succeed. It also often easts undue suspicion on the individuals whose identifying information is misused and infringes their interest in keeping personal information private and secure. These factors pro vide ample justification for the increased punishment of those who use another\u2019s identifying information in fraudulently billing for medical services. A literal reading of the unambiguous terms of the statute, \u201cin light of ordinary principles of statutory interpretation,\u201d therefore, will not produce \u201cabsurd results\u201d or \u201cthwart the obvious purpose of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Morison, </em>844 F.2d 1057, 1064 (4th Cir.1988) (quotations omitted). Consequently, our \u201cinquiry is complete\u201d and \u201cthere is no need to consult legislative history nor to look to the \u2018rule of lenity.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). We thus conclude that the district court did not err in ruling that Abdelshafi\u2019s conduct was \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d and violated \u00a7 1028A(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">B. Abuse of Trust Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">We now turn to Abdelshafi\u2019s claim that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement to his Guidelines\u2019 offense level for abuse of trust. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. On appeal, Abdelshafi argues that he \u201chad no relationship with Medicaid and was given no discretion by Virginia Premier. Therefore the position of trust enhancement is inapplicable.\u201d Opening Brief at 26. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Section 3B1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by two levels \u201c[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d Accordingly, the enhancement applies if \u201cthe defendant abused a position of trust and that abuse significantly contributed to the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>or concealment\u201d of the underlying offense. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 203 (4th Cir.1999). Whether a defendant held a position of trust must be assessed from the perspective of the victim. <em>See United States v. Bollin, </em>264 F.3d 391, 415 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In evaluating application of the enhancement, we generally weigh three factors to determine whether a particular defendant abused a position of trust, including (1) whether the defendant had special duties or special access to information not available to other employees, (2) the extent of the discretion the defendant possessed, and (3) whether the defendant\u2019s actions indicate that he is more culpable than others in similar positions who engage in criminal acts. <em>See Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d at 203. In this case, however, resort to the traditional balancing test proves unnecessary. Application note 2(B) to \u00a7 3B1.3 specifies that an abuse-of-trust enhancement applies, \u201c[notwithstanding Application Note 1, or any other provision of this guideline,\u201d when the defendant \u201cexceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position in order to obtain, transfer, or issue unlawfully, or use without authority, any means of identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The facts of this case fall plainly within the scope of application note 2(B). Abdelshafi abused the authority of his position in using Medicaid patients\u2019 identifying information, without authority, to file fraudulent claims for payment. Application note 2(B) cites as an example of an abuse of trust under the guideline \u201ca hospital orderly who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position by obtaining or misusing patient identification information from a patient chart.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 application note 2(B)(ii). Abdelshafi, quite similarly, abused the authority of his position in misusing the patient identification information listed on trip logs he received from Virginia Premier.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Abdelshafi\u2019s arguments in regard to his lack of discretion and fiduciary relationship with Medicaid are beside the point in the face of the plain reading of application note 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We, therefore, do not address Abdelshafi\u2019s arguments in regard to either application note 1 or our precedents regarding its scope.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that Abdelshafi enjoyed a position of trust in regard to patients\u2019 identifying information comparable to that of a hospital orderly in the application note (2)(B) example. This conclusion remains valid regardless of whether we consider the victim in this case to be Medicaid, Virginia Premier, the patients whose identifying information Abdelshafi misused, or all of them. Further more, Abdelshafi\u2019s abuse of trust significantly facilitated his commission of aggravated identity theft, as it granted him access to the patient identifying information necessary to file fraudulent billing claims. We accordingly uphold the district court\u2019s decision to impose an abuse-of-trust enhancement. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>McHan, </em>386 F.3d 620, 623 (4th Cir.2004) (recognizing we are entitled to affirm on any ground sup ported by the record, including theories not relied upon by the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-13\">. The district court imposed concurrent, thirty-eight-month sentences on the fifteen healthcare-fraud counts. Separately, the court imposed twenty-four month sentences on the two aggravated-identity-theft counts, to ran concurrently with each other and consecutive to Abdelshafi's sentence on the health-care-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>fraud counts. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(b)(2) &amp; (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-13\">. The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services administers Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program. <em>See HCMF Corp. v.

For purposes of \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d is defined as \"any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7); <em>see also United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 230, 234-35 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\">. The only language in \u00a7 1028A that could support Abdelshafi\u2019s argument is the statute\u2019s title of \"Aggravated identity <em>theft.\" </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A (emphasis added). Abdelshafi wisely does not press this point to support his argument, as it is well established that \" 'the title of a statute cannot limit the plain meaning of [its] text.' \u2019\u2019 <em>United States v. Buculei, </em>262 F.3d 322, 331 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Pa. Dep't of Con. v. Yeskey, </em>524 U.S. 206, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998)). Neither does Abdelshafi argue that the plain language of \u00a7 1028(a)(1) is ambiguous. We therefore agree with the <em>Hurtado </em>Court that \"we need not consider the title of \u00a7 1028(A) ('Aggravated Identity Theft') because the phrase 'without lawful authority\u2019 in \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) is plain and unambiguous.\u201d 508 F.3d at 608 n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\">. We similarly reject Abdelshafi\u2019s contention that to use another person\u2019s identifying information \u201c 'without lawful authority\u2019 there must be no authority for the basic, underlying use to which it is put,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the statute \u201cis not meant to apply to instances where the basic use is clearly authorized but the authorization is then abused or used excessively.\u201d Opening Brief at 22. Section \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) does not distinguish between \"basic uses\u201d and \"excessive uses\u201d of another person's identifying information. Rather, the statute applies to any knowing use of another\u2019s identifying information performed without a form of authorization recognized by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">. During oral argument in this case, Abdelshafi\u2019s counsel argued that \u00a7 1028A(a)(l)'s separate use and predicate felony elements necessitate that the use without lawful authority for which a defendant is charged under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) be \"different than the predicate act use.\u201d Counsel contended that otherwise the statute\u2019s use language would be \u201csuperfluous.\u201d Because this argument was not presented in Abdelshafi\u2019s opening brief, it has been waived. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>308 F.3d 425, 427 n. 1 (4th Cir.2002). Even if we were to consider this argument, we would conclude that it lacked merit. Section \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) establishes an enhanced penalty for those who knowingly transfer, possess, or use another person\u2019s identifying information <em>\"during and in relation to </em>\" a wide array of predicate offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1028A(c). Although the same underlying transfer, possession, or use may occasionally support both a defendant\u2019s predicate felony and a \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) enhancement, on other occasions a different predicate act will serve as the basis for the enhancement. No more need be said to show that our interpretation does not render the statute\u2019s \"use\u201d language superfluous. <em>See Davis v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) (recognizing that \u201cthe words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">. We note that Abdelshafi has failed to refer us to any portion of \u00a7 1028A(a)(l)'s legislative history that suggests our interpretation of the statute is \" \u2018demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.' \u201d <em>Morison, </em>844 F.2d at 1064 (quoting <em>United States v. Locke, </em>471 U.S. 84, 93, 105 S.Ct. 1785, 85 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">. At oral argument, Abdelshafi\u2019s counsel pointed us to the rule of lenity and the interpretative canon that criminal statutes must be strictly construed. We note that the rule of lenity does not apply in this case because \u00a7 1028A(a)(l)\u2019s text is unambiguous. <em>See United States v. Helem, </em>186 F.3d 449, 455 (4th Cir.1999). Furthermore, \"[t]he canon in favor of strict construction [of criminal statutes] is not an inexorable command to override common sense and evident statutory purpose. ... [I]t is satisfied if the [statute's] words are given their fair meaning in accord with the manifest intent of the lawmakers.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 145, 96 S.Ct. 335, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975) (quoting <em>United States v.
