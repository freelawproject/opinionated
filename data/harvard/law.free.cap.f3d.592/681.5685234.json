We find no error in the BIA\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we DENY Nieto\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">Nieto is a native and citizen of Mexico. He was admitted into the United States in 1981. In 1997, Nieto was convicted of second degree felony possession of marijuana under Texas Health &amp; Safety Code (\u201cTHSC\u201d) \u00a7 481.121. One year later, Nieto was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm under Texas Penal Code (\u201cTPC\u201d) \u00a7 46.04(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">Because of his convictions, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) charged Nieto with removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). At his removal hearing, Nieto conceded that his conviction under THSC \u00a7 481.121 made him subject to removal under the INA. To avoid being removed to Mexico, Nieto petitioned the IJ to cancel his removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), which grants the Attorney General discretionary authority to cancel the removal of an otherwise removable alien. To be entitled to cancellation, an alien must show that he \u201chas not been convicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). The IJ found that Nieto\u2019s conviction under TPC \u00a7 46.04 was for an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii). Section 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as including \u201can offense described in section 922(g)(1) ... of title 18, United States Code.\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony to possess, in or affecting interstate commerce, any firearm. The IJ found that Nieto\u2019s conviction under TPC \u00a7 46.04 fell under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(E)(ii)\u2019s definition of aggravated felony, and, based on that finding, the IJ concluded that Nieto was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">Nieto appealed the IJ\u2019s cancellation decision to the BIA. In his brief to the BIA, Nieto argued that the IJ erred in finding that his firearms conviction under TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) constituted an aggravated felony. Specifically, he argued that his conviction under TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) was not an aggravated felony as \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) because TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) did not contain an interstate commerce element, whereas \u00a7 922(g)(1) did. The BIA rejected Nieto\u2019s argument, finding that it was foreclosed by its decision in <em>Vasquez-Muniz, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 207 (B.I.A.2002), which held that state felon-in-possession offenses need not have an interstate commerce element in order for the offense to be an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">Nieto then appealed the BIA\u2019s decision to this court, pressing the same argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that he made before the BIA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Nieto argues that the BIA erred in finding that his firearms conviction under TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii), which defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as including an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Nieto argues that his firearms conviction was not an offense described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) because TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) does not contain an interstate commerce element. We hold that state felon-in-possession offenses, such as TPC \u00a7 46.04(a), need not have an interstate commerce element in order for the offense to be an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Accordingly, we deny Nieto\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\n<em>A. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">This Court has jurisdiction to review \u201clegal and constitutional issues raised pertaining to removal orders.\u201d <em>Vasquez-Martinez v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 712, 715 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cThe BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is ineligible for discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal is a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In conducting our analysis, we first review the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA itself, including its definition of the INA\u2019s words and phrases. <em>Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306 (5th Cir.2005). We then review de novo whether a petitioner\u2019s conviction under a state statute constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d and renders him ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 306; <em>United States v. Garza, </em>250 Fed.Appx. 67 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">\n<em>B. Meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(IS)(E)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as an offense \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). According to the BIA, for an offense to be \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), it only has to have the same substantive elements as \u00a7 922(g)(1); jurisdictional elements, such as \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce element, are irrelevant. <em>See Vasquez-Muniz, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 210-11, 213. The BIA applied this interpretation of the INA in affirming the IJ\u2019s finding that Nieto\u2019s conviction under TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) constituted an aggravated felony as described in \u00a7 922(g)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nieto argues that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We need not determine the precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>degree of deference to be afforded the BIA\u2019s interpretation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because we conclude that it is correct as a matter of statutory interpretation. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\u201cIf a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.\u201d); <em>see also Negrete-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 497, 503 (7th Cir.2008) (adopting the BIA interpretation at issue); <em>Garza, </em>250 Fed.Appx. at 71 (\u201cLooking at \u00a7 922(g)(1), the core of the offense proscribed is conviction of a felony and ownership and possession of a handgun.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Section 1101(a)(43)\u2019s \u201cpenultimate sentence\u201d supports the BIA\u2019s interpretation that jurisdictional elements, such as \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce element, are not necessary for an offense to be an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cdescribed in\u201d \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>Negrete-Rodriguez, </em>518 F.3d at 502; <em>Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d at 1024; <em>see United States v. Everist, </em>368 F.3d 517, 519 (5th Cir.2004) (describing \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce element as a \u201cjurisdictional requirement\u201d). In its \u201cpenultimate sentence,\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(43) states that \u201c[t]he term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Section 1101(a)(43)\u2019s penultimate sentence plainly evidences Congress\u2019s intent that an offense constitute an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E) regardless of whether the offense falls within the jurisdiction of the states or the federal government. Because \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce element is simply an element that ensures federal jurisdiction, finding that such an element is necessary for a state offense to be one that is \u201cdescribed in\u201d \u00a7 922(g)(1) would undermine Congress\u2019s evident intent that jurisdiction be disregarded in applying this definition of \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>Negrete-Rodriguez, </em>518 F.3d at 502 (\u201cClearly Congress did not intend [\u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s jurisdictional element, which] is not necessary in state law[,] to be the factor determining whether the state offense can be considered the equivalent of a \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The text of \u00a7 1101(a)(43) also shows that Congress intended more than a negligible number of state firearm offenses to be encompassed within \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii)\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony,\u201d and \u201cinterpreting the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) as essential for a state offense to qualify as an aggravated felony would\u201d undermine that intent. <em>See Negrete-Rodriguez, </em>518 F.3d at 501-02 (discussing <em>Cas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number><em>tillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d at 1023). Section 1101(a)(43)\u2019s \u201cpenultimate sentence\u201d shows that \u201cCongress clearly intended state crimes to serve as predicate offenses for aggravated felonies,\u201d and the fact that Congress \u201cused the looser standard \u2018described in\u2019 for [\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)], rather than the more precise phrase \u2018defined in\u2019 used elsewhere in [\u00a7 1101(a)(43), demonstrates] that Congress \u201cwanted more than a negligible number of state [firearms] offenses to count as aggravated felonies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Interpreting \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce element \u201cas essential for a state offense to qualify as an aggravated felony\u201d would violate Congress\u2019s intent to include more than a \u201cnegligible number\u201d of state offenses under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii), \u201cbecause state firearms [statutes] would \u2018rarely, if ever\u2019 [contain an interstate commerce element and convictions under such statutes would rarely, if ever] specify whether the commerce element was met.\u201d <em>Negrete-Rodriguez, </em>518 F.3d at 501-02 (\u201cThat would eliminate the intended inclusion of most state statutes, since states do not operate under the same jurisdictional constraints as the federal government.\u201d); <em>Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d at 1023-24 (\u201cConsequently, we do not believe that this minimal jurisdictional nexus was meant [to] substantially ... narrow or to eliminate the range of state offenses that Congress intended to incorporate under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii)....\u201d); <em>Garza, </em>250 Fed.Appx. at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">We conclude that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)\u2019s \u201cdescribed in\u201d language is in accord with the text and purpose of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii), and we adopt it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\n<em>C. Cancellation of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The IJ and the BIA found that Nieto was ineligible for cancellation of removal because his firearms conviction under TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) constituted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cdescribed in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). To determine whether Nieto\u2019s firearm offense constitutes an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d we apply a \u201c \u2018categorical approach,\u2019 under which we refer only to the statutory definition of the crime for which the alien was convicted ... and ask whether that legislatively-defined offense necessarily fits within the INA definition of an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 463 (5th Cir.2006). We conclude, as we did in <em>Garza, </em>that Nieto\u2019s offense under TPC \u00a7 46.04(a) fits within 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii)\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Garza, </em>250 Fed.Appx. at 71. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in finding that Nieto was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Nieto\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">. Nieto only appeals the IJ and the BIA's cancellation decision. Thus, the only issue before us is whether the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Nieto was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">. Although unpublished opinions are not precedent, this case addressed the exact question presented here, interpreting the same statutes in the context of a sentencing calculation. We find the reasoning of that opinion persuasive and adopt it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\">. The BIA\u2019s interpretation is based on a Ninth Circuit decision, <em>United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir.2001) (\"We thus hold that a state felon in possession offense is not required to include a commerce nexus as one of its elements in order to qualify as an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes.\u201d). Nieto asserts in his brief that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Castillo-Rivera </em>was overruled. Nieto\u2019s assertion is incorrect. The Ninth Circuit recently affirmed and applied the holding in <em>Castillo-Rivera </em>in <em>Anaya-Ortiz v. Mukasey, </em>553 F.3d 1266, 1272 (9th Cir.2009) (stating that a petitioner\u2019s contention that his conviction was not an aggravated felony as described in \u00a7 922(g)(1) because \"an interstate-commerce element [was] not present\u201d was \"foreclosed by <em>United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>which held that a state crime of conviction need not have the interstate-commerce element contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) to qualify as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii)\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-16\">. Nieto also argues that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). Nieto's reliance on <em>Lopez </em>is misplaced. The Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>decision in <em>Lopez </em>only considered whether \"conduct treated as a felony by the State\u201d but only punishable as a misdemeanor under the federal Controlled Substances Act could constitute an \"aggravated felony\u201d as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). <em>Id. </em>at 50, 60, 127 S.Ct. 625. The Court did not consider whether state firearm offenses need to have the same jurisdictional elements as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) in order to fall under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii)'s definition of aggravated felony. <em>See also Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266 (5th Cir.2009) (explaining that <em>Lopez </em>provides a \"hypothetical approach\u201d where a court \"looks to conduct proscribed by state law, not just the elements of the state law offense and compares that conduct to federal law\u201d), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1012, L.Ed.2d -, 78 U.S.L.W. 3356, 2009 WL 2058154 (U.S. Dec. 14, 2009) (No. 09-60).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-14\">.
