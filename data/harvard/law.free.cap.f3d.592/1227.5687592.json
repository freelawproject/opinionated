We must also determine whether the court properly denied Defendants qualified immunity. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we AFFIRM IN PART AND REVERSE IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AeJ3\">\n<em>A. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">The following facts are taken from Plaintiffs Complaint. On April 24, 2007 Mitchell Vinson Harper was arrested by Town Creek, Alabama police officer Joe Fike for failing to appear in court on public intoxication charges. Fike transported Harper to the Lawrence County Jail in Alabama<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where he was processed and incarcerated by Kevin Blake Robinson, a night-shift jailer. As alleged, Harper did not receive an \u201cappropriate or reasonable\u201d medical examination and/or screening upon admission to the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-8\">According to the Complaint Harper was an alcoholic, and while in jail he experienced severe alcohol withdrawal. He displayed symptoms of that affliction, including hallucinations, slurred speech, incoherence, and difficulty walking. Robinson and/or Wilford Jerome Reed, another night-shift jailer, contacted Fike and informed him of Harper\u2019s strange behavior. Fike informed one or both of them that he (Fike) would contact Jerry Garrett (Town Creek\u2019s police chief) about Harper\u2019s behavior, and that the Town Creek Defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would make a decision regarding Harper\u2019s medical care. During a shift change Robinson and/or Reed informed Tim Taylor, a Lawrence County day-shift jailer, of Harper\u2019s behavior. Moreover, inmates informed Taylor, Reed and Robinson of Harper\u2019s strange behavior, informing them that Harper was saying \u201ccrazy things,\u201d was \u201ctalking off the wall,\u201d and was having trouble keeping his balance. Harper did not receive any medical care and died of problems related to alcohol withdrawal in the Lawrence County Jail on April 28, 2007, four days after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-13\">Plaintiff Sheila T. Harper, the personal representative of Harper\u2019s estate, filed a two-count Complaint on April 14, 2008 against the following Defendants: Lawrence County, the Lawrence County Commission, Lawrence County Sheriff Gene Mitchell, jail administrator Kenneth Mitchell, jail administrator Mary Brown, Taylor, Reed, Robinson, the City of Town Creek, Garrett, and Fike. <em>See </em>D.E. #1. In Count I Plaintiff sued all Defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for deliberate indifference to Harper\u2019s serious medical needs, as prohibited by the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Count II Plaintiff sued all Defendants for negligence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>wantonness under Alabama state law for failing to provide medical treatment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">\n<em>B. Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">On May 6, 2008 Defendants Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, Brown, Reed, and Robinson filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) with attached exhibits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>D.Es. #27-28. In their motion Defendants asserted the defense of qualified immunity to the section 1983 claims against them in their individual capacities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Plaintiff filed an opposition with her own attached exhibits. <em>See </em>D.E. #36. Defendants filed a motion to strike Plaintiffs response or, in the alternative, to convert their Rule 12(b)(6) motion to a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56. <em>See </em>D.E. #42.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">The district court granted the alternative requested relief and converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>D.E. #44. The court later rescinded that order, finding that \u201cthe current body of evidence simply is insufficient to support a ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>See </em>D.E. #66. Analyzing the motion as a motion to dismiss, the court denied qualified immunity on the section 1983 claims against Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, Brown, Reed, and Robinson. <em>See id. </em>Those Defendants appeal both rulings here \u2014 the court\u2019s decision to rescind its order converting their motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, and the denial of their qualified immunity. We address each issue in turn.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">\n<em>A. Conversion of Motion for Summary Judgment Back into Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-15\">Defendants claim that the district court erred in rescinding its order converting their motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion. We disagree. It is permissible for a district court to rescind its own interlocutory order. <em>See, e.g., Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cIn this case, the court\u2019s order for a new trial was an interlocutory order, and therefore the trial court had the power to revoke it and reinstate the judgment.\u201d); <em>Hardin v. Hayes, </em>52 F.3d 934, 938 (11th Cir.1995) (district court may reconsider and amend interlocutory orders at any time before final judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-16\">We review a district court\u2019s reversal of its own interlocutory order for abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Lanier Const., Inc. v. Carbone Props. of Mobile, LLC, </em>253 Fed.Appx. 861, 863 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]the district court\u2019s denial of [the plaintiffs] motion for leave to amend the complaint was simply an interlocutory decision ... which the district court had ample discretion to reconsider.\u201d); <em>Sanchez v. Triple-S Mgmt., Corp., </em>492 F.3d 1, 12 n. 12 (1st Cir.2007) (\u201c[A]bsent a particularly egregious abuse of discretion, district courts are free to reconsider their interlocutory orders.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rescinding its order converting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion. The court made clear when it did so that discovery was stayed, and that it did not consider any evidence outside the pleadings when ruling on the motion as a motion to dismiss. Further, the parties are not precluded from filing a summary judgment motion in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">Defendants argue that it was not enough for the court to have declined to consider the outside documents in ruling on the motion to dismiss \u2014 rather, it should have <em>excluded </em>them pursuant to Rule 12(d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This argument has no merit. A judge need not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment as long as he or she does not consider matters outside the pleadings. According to case law, \u201cnot considering\u201d such matters is the functional equivalent of \u201cexcluding\u201d them\u2014 there is no more formal step required. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Auto. Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn., </em>917 F.2d 1528, 1532 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201c[I]f the judge does <em>consider ... </em>outside matters, i.e., if the judge does not <em>exclude </em>them, Rule 12(b) requires the judge to comply with the requirements of Rule 56.\u201d) (emphases added); <em>see also, e.g., Austin v. Modern Woodman of Am., </em>275 Fed.Appx. 925, 926 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e discern no reversible error [in the district court\u2019s refusal to construe the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment]. Although the parties\u2019 motions had affidavits, the record demonstrates that the district court did not consider matters outside the pleadings.\u201d); Ware <em>v. Assoc. Milk Producers, Inc., </em>614 F.2d 413, 414 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cAlthough Rule 12(b) provides that a 12(b)(6) motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment when matters outside the record are presented to the court and not excluded, in the instant case the express wording of the Order of Dismissal affirmatively indicates that the district court did not consider the extra-pleading matters.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">In sum, we find that the district court properly exercised its discretion to reconsider and rescind its order converting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">\n<em>B. Denial of Qualified Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">The court analyzed Plaintiffs section 1983 claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs and determined that they were not subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) based on qualified immunity. With one exception, we agree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rule 8(a)(2) requires only \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d The Supreme Court has clarified that to satisfy Rule 8, \u201c[fjactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The plaintiff must allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d to \u201cnudge[] [the] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">However, this Circuit has tightened the application of Rule 8 in section 1983 cases where qualified immunity is at issue, like this one. In such cases, the \u201cheightened pleading standard\u201d applies and \u201c[s]ome factual detail in the pleadings is necessary.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1367 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also Danley v. Allen, </em>540 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cUnder the heightened pleading requirement, the relevant facts must be alleged with some specificity.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). The purpose of the heightened pleading standard is for the plaintiff to provide facts with \u201csufficient detail for Defendants to understand what alleged rights were violated ... and which of their actions allegedly violated those rights,\u201d as well as \u201cfor the court to determine whether those facts indeed set out a violation of rights and whether those rights were clearly established when these incidents occurred.\u201d <em>Amnesty Int\u2019l, USA v. Battle, </em>559 F.3d 1170, 1180 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">Here, Plaintiff brought claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs against individual Defendants. Specifically, she brought two different types of deliberate indifference claims: those for \u201cpersonal participation\u201d against Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, Brown, Reed, and Robinson; and those for \u201csupervisory liability\u201d against Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, and Brown.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-11\">Below, we analyze both types of claims to see if the district court correctly denied Defendants qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-12\">\n<em>1. \u201cPersonal Participation\u201d Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-13\">As stated above, Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, Brown, Reed, and Robinson all asserted qualified immunity as a defense to the \u201cpersonal participation\u201d section 1983 claims against them. This Circuit generally follows a two-step analysis to determine if qualified immunity applies to any section 1983 claim. The first step is to determine \u201cwhether the [defendant\u2019s] conduct amounted to a constitutional violation,\u201d and the second step is to \u201canalyze[ ] whether the right violated was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time of the violation.\u201d <em>Lewis v. City of West Palm Beach, Fla., </em>561 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cWhether a constitutional right was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time of the violation turns on whether it would be clear to a reasonable [defendant] that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Gray ex rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>458 F.3d 1295, 1306 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cWe recognize three sources of law that would put a government official on notice of statutory or constitutional rights: specific statutory or constitutional provisions; principles of law enunciated in relevant decisions; and factually similar cases already decided by state and federal courts in the relevant jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Goebert v. Lee County, </em>510 F.3d 1312, 1330 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>\n<em>a. Violation of constitutional rights?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">To perform the first step of the qualified immunity analysis, we must determine whether Plaintiff properly stated a \u201cpersonal participation\u201d claim for deliberate indifference under the Fourteenth Amendment against Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, Brown, Reed, and Robinson. Specifically, Plaintiff must sufficiently allege \u201cboth an objectively serious medical need and that a Defendant acted with deliberate indifference to that need.\u201d <em>Burnette v. Taylor, </em>533 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To establish \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d Plaintiff must demonstrate that Defendants (1) had subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregarded that risk; and (3) acted with more than gross negligence. <em>Id. </em>She must also show that those Defendants\u2019 conduct caused Harper\u2019s injuries. <em>See Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1028 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">With respect to the \u201csubjective knowledge\u201d component, we have stated that defendants \u201cmust both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and [] must also draw the inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bozeman v. Orum, </em>422 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation omitted). \u201c[I]mputed or collective knowledge cannot serve as the basis for a claim of deliberate indifference. Each individual Defendant must be judged separately and on the basis of what that person knows.\u201d <em>Burnette, </em>533 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">Here, there are two main ways Plaintiff alleges Defendants knew of Harper\u2019s serious medical needs. First, Plaintiff claims that they \u201chad full knowledge that Harper was an alcoholic who would experience delirium tremens (DT\u2019s) due to alcohol withdrawal if left untreated,\u201d because he had been arrested before and placed in the Lawrence County Jail on various alcohol-related charges. Compl. at 8. She also alleges that during the course of one or more of his prior arrests Harper \u201cinformed the defendants that he had a history of seizures due to alcohol withdrawal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. However, these allegations do not meet the Rule 8 standard, much less the heightened pleading standard. Plaintiff did not offer any facts to suggest why <em>these </em>Defendants in particular (a sheriff, two jail administrators, and two jailers) would know of Harper\u2019s specific medical history, nor did she offer any specific facts regarding Harper\u2019s past arrests. Moreover, even if those Defendants did know of Harper\u2019s history of alcoholism and/or past alcohol-related arrests, they would still have needed to know that Harper was in serious need of medical attention during the time period in question, April 24, 2007 to April 28, 2007. In our view, Plaintiff does not \u201craise [her] right to relief above the speculative level\u201d in this instance. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">Second, Plaintiff claims Defendants were aware of Harper\u2019s condition because of his symptoms and behavior at the jail. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that several days after his initial incarceration Harper was hallucinating, slurring his words, physically weak, and incoherent. According to the Complaint, Reed and/or Robinson told both Taylor and Fike that Harper was displaying erratic and strange behavior. Compl. at 7-8. The Complaint also alleges that other inmates informed Reed and Robinson that Harper was acting strangely, losing his balance, and had urinated on himself. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Based on these allegations we hold that Plaintiff adequately alleged Reed and Robinson had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the risk of serious harm to Harper if left untreated. However, the Complaint does not allege how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>other three Defendants, Sheriff Gene Mitchell and administrators Kenneth Mitchell and Brown, could possibly have had such actual knowledge. Thus, the court should have dismissed the \u201cpersonal participation\u201d claims as to those three Defendants based on qualified immunity, and we reverse the district court\u2019s order in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">As explained above, Plaintiff must also sufficiently allege that Reed and Robinson disregarded the risk of serious harm to Harper with conduct that was more than negligent. \u201c[0]fficials, to be liable [for deliberate indifference], must be aware of a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmates and not take reasonable measures to alleviate that risk.\u201d <em>Marsh, </em>268 F.3d at 1027. \u201cDeliberate indifference\u201d can include \u201cthe delay of treatment for obviously serious conditions where it is apparent that delay would detrimentally exacerbate the medical problem, the delay does seriously exacerbate the medical problem, and the delay is medically unjustified.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Here, Plaintiff alleges that Reed and/or Robinson called Fike regarding Harper\u2019s strange behavior. Fike allegedly told one or both of them that he (Fike) would contact Garrett about Harper\u2019s behavior, and that the Town Creek Defendants would make a decision regarding Harper\u2019s medical care. Plaintiff also alleges that Reed and/or Robinson told Taylor about Harper\u2019s behavior at the shift change. However, despite their awareness of Harper\u2019s condition, neither Reed or Robinson took any steps to actually secure immediate medical attention for Harper, whose need for prompt treatment appeared dire. Thus, Plaintiff adequately alleged that Reed and Robinson violated Harper\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">\n<em>b. Were Harper\u2019s rights clearly established at the time?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">In order to clear the qualified immunity hurdle for Reed and Robinson, Plaintiff must also show that Harper\u2019s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time they were allegedly violated. We find that Plaintiff can clear this hurdle. This Circuit has stated that its prior cases \u201cestablished that a jail official who is aware of but ignores the dangers of acute alcohol withdrawal and waits for a manifest emergency before obtaining medical care is deliberately indifferent to the inmate\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Lancaster v. Monroe County, Ala., </em>116 F.3d 1419, 1426 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also id. (\u201cMorrison </em>clearly established that sheriffs and jailers cannot place or keep a chronic alcoholic in jail without any medical supervision, when the defendants are aware that the alcoholic is suffering from a severe form of alcohol withdrawal.\u201d) (citing <em>Morrison v. Washington County, </em>700 F.2d 678 (11th Cir. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Thus, Plaintiff properly stated \u201cpersonal participation\u201d section 1983 claims for deliberate indifference against Reed and Robinson, and the district court was right to deny those Defendants qualified immunity. We therefore affirm the district court in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">\n<em>2. \u201cSupervisory Liability\u201d Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">Plaintiff also sues Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, and Brown for deliberate indifference in their capacity as supervisors. Because those Defendants asserted qualified immunity to the \u201csupervisory liability\u201d claims against them, we must again perform the qualified immunity analysis. That is, we must analyze whether Plaintiff properly stated a violation of Harper\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>those Defendants, and whether those rights were clearly established at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">\n<em>a. Violation of constitutional right?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Supervisory liability lies where the defendant personally participates in the unconstitutional conduct or there is a causal connection between such conduct and the defendant\u2019s actions. There are three ways to establish such a causal connection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHN\">when a history of widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor - on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation, and he fails to do so. Alternatively, the causal connection may be established when a supervisor\u2019s custom or policy ... result[s] in deliberate indifference to constitutional rights or when facts support an inference that the supervisor directed the subordinates to act unlawfully or knew that the subordinates would act unlawfully and failed to stop them from doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\"><em>Cottone, </em>326 F.3d at 1360-61 (internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">Here, because there are no allegations in the Complaint regarding the supervisors\u2019 personal participation in the denial of Harper\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights, we look to whether Plaintiff has alleged a \u201ccausal connection.\u201d Although Plaintiff does mention \u201cwidespread\u201d constitutional rights deprivations <em>(see </em>Compl. at 16), it seems that the bulk of her facts against Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, and Brown allege \u201ccausal connection\u201d based on their customs or policies that resulted in harm to Harper. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that those Defendants, who were responsible for the management and administration or oversight of the jail, had customs or policies of improperly screening inmates for alcohol withdrawal, improperly handling inmates addicted to alcohol or drugs, delaying medical treatment and restricting access to outside medical providers in order to save money, primarily using emergency medical treatment for physical injuries only, and also failing to train jailers in identifying inmates with alcohol dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">As factual support, the Complaint refers to an incident with Clyde O\u2019Neal Parker, who was also a pretrial detainee in the Lawrence County Jail. The Parker incident is strikingly similar to this case \u2014 and occurred only one month before the Harper incident. According to that complaint, Parker was taken into custody on a DUI charge and did not receive a proper medical screening, which would have revealed his alcoholism and potential for suffering from withdrawal. The complaint states that Parker did in fact experience alcohol withdrawal but was not treated at the jail \u2014 even though Parker\u2019s wife informed jail personnel that Parker was an alcoholic and would need emergency treatment. The complaint states that a jailer informed Parker\u2019s daughter that Parker would not receive medical care because he was not \u201cbleeding.\u201d Parker was eventually released to family members so that they could take him to a hospital for medical treatment. Parker ended up suffering brain damage. The Parker complaint contains similar allegations against the same three supervisory Defendants as the Harper Complaint \u2014 that they maintained a custom or policy of improper medical screening, of burden-shifting medical treatment onto other entities out of financial concerns and \u201cdenying or delaying treatment for serious health conditions to save money.\u201d Parker Compl. at 8. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>Parker complaint also sues jailers Reed and Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\">In sum, given the Complaint\u2019s factual detail about Harper\u2019s incident and the similar incident involving Parker just one month before, as well as the specific allegations regarding the customs or policies put in place by the supervisors, Plaintiff met both the Rule 8 and heightened pleading standards.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that Plaintiff sufficiently alleged that the supervisory Defendants violated Harper\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights based on their customs or policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">\n<em>b. Were Harper\u2019s rights clearly established at the time?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, and Brown claim they are entitled to qualified immunity on the \u201csupervisory liability\u201d claims because, even if Plaintiff properly alleged they violated Harper\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights, it was not \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time that their alleged actions would be unlawful. This is because, they argue, no factually similar case could have put them on notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">Plaintiff does not point to any such factually similar case, and we were unable to find one. However, as we explained above, the existence of a factually similar case is not the only way to put officials on notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct. Indeed, \u201c[a] government official can be put on notice that his actions will violate a constitutional or statutory right by ... a legal principle announced by a decision from a court with jurisdiction over the place where the violation of rights was committed.\u201d <em>Danley, </em>540 F.3d at 1313. In our view, our prior pronouncements on the illegality of delayed or inadequate treatment for alcohol withdrawal should have sufficed to put the supervisory Defendants on notice. Specifically, the <em>Lancaster </em>and <em>Morrison </em>cases <em>(see </em>supra p. 1235) should have put any government actor on notice that delayed or inadequate treatment of alcohol withdrawal would be unlawful. Those cases should also have put supervisors on notice that policies or customs of delayed investigation into and treatment of alcohol withdrawal would be unlawful as well. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, and Brown\u2019s qualified immunity defense to Plaintiffs \u201csupervisory liability\u201d claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court in all respects but one: we reverse the court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity to Gene Mitchell, Kenneth Mitchell, and Brown on the \u201cpersonal participation\u201d section 1983 claims. Accordingly, the order of the district court denying Defendants qualified immunity is</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">.
