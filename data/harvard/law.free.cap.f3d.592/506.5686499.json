Fennell was sentenced to 97 months imprisonment. After the adoption of Amendment 706 (i.e., the crack cocaine amendment) to the Sentencing Guidelines, Fennell sought resentencing, advocating for an 80-month sentence. The district court resentenced Fennell to 96 months, one month less than his original sentence, in the belief that 96 months was the lowest sentence that could be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Fennell appeals, contending that the district court misapprehended the scope of its discretion at the resentencing. We agree with Fennell, and for the reasons set forth below, we vacate Fennell\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">On April 18, 2005, Fennell pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. This offense carries a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of ten years (120 months) imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The presentence report indicated that Fennell\u2019s offense level was 29 and that his criminal history category was IV, resulting in a guideline range of 121-151 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">During the sentencing hearing, the government moved for a departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 based on Fennell\u2019s substantial assistance to the government. The district court granted the motion and sentenced Fennell to 97 months imprisonment. Fennell did not appeal his conviction or his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">On May 1, 2008, Fennell filed a motion seeking a reduction of his sentence in light of the retroactivity of Amendment 706. In his motion, Fennell stated that his sentence represented approximately 20% of a downward departure from the bottom of his original guideline range (121 months). Fennell asked that the court comparably reduce his sentence by 20% from the bottom of the new guideline range, namely offense level 27, which he maintained was 100 to 125 months. A 20% reduction from 100 months would yield an 80-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">The resentencing report prepared by a probation officer indicated that Fennell\u2019s new total offense level was 27, but in light of the statutory minimum sentence for his offense, Fennell\u2019s guideline range would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>120-125 months, rather than the 100-125 months that Fennell proposed. The report noted that \u201c[w]ere it not for the statutory impact ... the guideline imprisonment range would have been 100 to 125 months.\u201d J.A. 16. The report concluded that a 20% reduction from the bottom of this new guideline range would yield a 96-month sentence, which is only one month less than Fennell\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Fennell disagreed with the resentencing report, arguing that the 120-month statutory minimum was \u201cwaived\u201d by virtue of the government\u2019s \u00a7 3553(e) motion. Therefore, according to Fennell, his guideline range would be 100-125 months. In the alternative, Fennell suggested that the district court use a comparability analysis based on the <em>top </em>of the guidelines range recommended by the probation officer. Fennell\u2019s original sentence was a 36% departure from the top of his original guidelines. He suggested that the district court impose a new sentence that represents a 36% departure from the top of the new guidelines range (125 months), which would yield a sentence of 80 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">During the resentencing hearing on July 9, 2008, the district court adopted the recommendation of the resentencing report. The district court noted that it had previously valued Fennell\u2019s substantial assistance at 20%; therefore, it imposed a comparable downward departure of 20% from the low end of Fennell\u2019s amended guidelines range. Fennell\u2019s counsel urged the court to make the reduction from the amended guidelines range of 100-125 months. The court, however, maintained that the bottom of Fennell\u2019s amended guidelines range was the 120-month statutory minimum sentence. Accordingly, the court imposed a 96-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Fennell\u2019s counsel sought clarification from the court as to its reasons for departing only one month and the court responded that it thought it did not have the discretion to do otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">Mr. DuBois: Just one question, your Honor, just so I can report back to Mr. Fennell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">Is it your ruling that this was a discretionary decision not to give more than a month, or that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">The Court: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">Mr. DuBois: \u2014 or you felt like you did not have the authority to give more than one month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">The Court: You know, I was couching it a little bit, but I just \u2014 these\u2014I think that I don\u2019t have the discretion. I think Mr. Brasher\u2019s arguments about the impact of the 3553 motion and the way that \u2014 you know, how we got to a point where we could be considering a sentence below the statutory minimum is pretty compelling. And I think this probably falls in line with other judges, as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">J.A. 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Fennell has appealed from the court\u2019s imposition of the 96-month sentence, contending that the district court\u2019s belief that it lacked discretion to impose a sentence below 96 months was erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The propriety of the district court\u2019s determination that there was only one permissible method of calculating a reduction during resentencing is purely a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 727 (4th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Sentencing courts have the power to reduce the sentence of a defendant who has been sentenced based on a Sentencing Guidelines range that has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This reduction is applicable in crack cocaine cases after Amendment 706 retroactively reduced the base offense level for most crack-cocaine cases by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), p.s. Where a defendant\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range applicable at the time of the original sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) precludes a downward departure below the amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Dunphy, </em>551 F.3d 247, 252 (4th Cir. 2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2401, 173 L.Ed.2d 1296 (2009). On the other hand, where the original sentence falls below the original guideline range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not preclude a downward departure below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Moreover, a district court may depart from the statutory minimum sentence in any instance in which the government has moved for a departure pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e). Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines gives the sentencing judge discretion to award an \u201cappropriate reduction\u201d consistent with the non-exclusive list of factors, all related to the nature and quality of a defendant\u2019s assistance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1; <em>United States v. Pearce, </em>191 F.3d 488, 492 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that under \u00a7 5K1.1, a sentencing court may only consider the \u201cnature, extent, and significance\u201d of the defendant\u2019s assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">This court has never held that a sentencing court must use a specific method in calculating a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. <em>See United States v. Lindsey, </em>556 F.3d 238, 245 (4th Cir.2009) (explaining that a sentencing court may use a lower offense category, a percentage-based departure or a flat number of months to depart based on substantial assistance). Rather, a sentencing court need only articulate its reasons for departing as it did. <em>See United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">In this case, it is evident that the district court did not believe that, during resentencing, it had discretion to use a method other than the precise one apparently used at the initial sentencing in calculating a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. (\u201cI think that I don\u2019t have the discretion.\u201d J.A. 28.). This mistaken belief constitutes reversible procedural error. Sentencing courts are not bound to use one specific method in reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence. In <em>Lindsey, </em>556 F.3d at 245-46, we explained that a sentencing court may use a lower offense category, a percentage, or a flat number of months, to calculate a departure based on substantial assistance. We now hold that these same methods, or any other reasonable method that results in a comparable reduction, are available to a sentencing court during a resentencing held pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Indeed, a sentencing court may use any reasonable method in calculating a downward departure during resentencing and is not limited by any specific method previously used. There are several reasons for allowing flexibility in calculating a reduction. First, the plain language of the Sentencing Guide lines provides for flexibility. The Guidelines state that, where \u201cthe original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ed by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing,\u201d the defendant may receive a \u201creduction comparably less than the amended guideline range\u201d in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. U.S.S.G \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The application notes to \u00a7 1B1.10 explain the percentage-based method as an example of a comparable reduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">For example, in a case in which: (A) The guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing was 70 to 87 months; (B) the defendant\u2019s original term of imprisonment imposed was 56 months (representing a downward departure of 20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing); and (C) the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1) is 57 to 71 months, a reduction to a term of imprisonment of 46 months (representing a reduction of approximately 20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1)) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">This provision, however, does not state that a percentage-based method of departing is the only permissible method. Nor does it preclude the use of other methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The Guidelines do not state that only an <em>identical </em>departure is permissible. <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>2008 WL 2941242, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2008). The Guidelines simply require a <em>comparable </em>reduction. Nothing in the Sentencing Guidelines requires mathematical precision. And, although the percentage-based method is the only method listed as an example of a comparable departure in the Guide lines, the Guidelines themselves and indeed, this court, do not preclude the use of any other method.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Second, as a practical matter, a defendant may not have the same judge at sentencing and resentencing, and the latter may not be aware of the method employed by the former. Thus, it would be wholly impractical, even futile in many instances, to require the identical method for both. Even the same judge may forget the method she employed during the original sentencing. Here, for instance, the district court stated that \u201cthe Court valued [Fennell\u2019s] assistance at about 20%, and took it down from <em>presumably </em>the low end to 97 months.\u201d J.A. 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Third, allowing flexibility in sentence reductions is important because different districts within this circuit employ different methods. In the Southern District of West Virginia, for example, sentencing judges use a percentage-based method. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Green, </em>2008 WL 1757787, at *1 n. 1 (S.D.W.Va. Apr.16, 2008) (50% reduction); <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>2008 WL 1443290, at *1 (S.D.W.Va. Apr.9, 2008) (42.8% reduction). In contrast, District of Maryland judges customarily depart by offense levels. In <em>Lindsey, </em>we discussed the Western District of North Carolina\u2019s method of departing, which used offense levels as well. 556 F.3d at 245. Other districts, and individual judges within a district, no doubt employ a myriad of methodologies. We have never required homogeneity and we do not require it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Finally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides sentencing courts exceptional authority to reduce sentences. <em>United States v. Hood, </em>556 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir.2009). A sentence reduction that is \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), is valid. A sentencing court has discretion to give a reduction based on the revised sentencing range, calculated by any reasonable means, so long as it yields <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>a new sentence congruent with the policy statements of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Here, Fennell candidly concedes that the district court properly gave a <em>comparable </em>reduction, and we agree. The district court erred, however, when it determined that it was bound to use the <em>identical </em>percentage-based reduction method that apparently was employed at the initial sentencing. To the contrary, the district court was entitled, in exercising its discretion, to use any of the reasonable methods \u2014 such as those we have described in <em>Lindsey </em>\u2014 to calculate a sentence comparable to that previously imposed, in light of the purpose and effect of Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate Fennell\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">. We note that Fennell does not challenge on appeal the district court's finding that the appropriate guideline range was 120-125 months as a result of the mandatory statutory minimum. Indeed, this finding is consistent with the guidelines, which dictate that where the statutory minimum is greater than the bottom of the range, the statutory minimum becomes the bottom of the range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c); <em>see also United States v. Rast, </em>293 F.3d 735, 739-40 (4th Cir.2002) (\"Under the Guidelines, when the statutory minimum sentence is greater than the minimum sentence of the Guidelines range, the district court must impose a sentence not less than the statutory minimum.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-17\">. Of course, the sentencing court\u2019s authority to modify a sentence pursuant to subsection (c)(2) is not limitless; rather, the sentencing court must apply the revised guideline range. <em>See Dunphy, </em>551 F.3d at 250 (stating that, under 18 USCS \u00a7 3582(c), a reduction below the amended guideline range is prohibited when the original sentence was within the original guideline range).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
