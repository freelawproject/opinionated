The BIA adopted and affirmed the determination of the immigration judge (IJ) that Marynenka had failed to meet her burden of establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because the IJ committed substantial legal error in rejecting certain of Marynenka\u2019s corroborating evidence, we grant her petition for review, vacate the BIA decision, and remand to allow the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>to reconsider Marynenka\u2019s application in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Marynenka entered the United States on May 29, 2003, traveling under a J-l exchange visitor visa that expired on October 1, 2003. She overstayed her visa and, on March 2, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security served her with a notice to appear charging her with removability. Marynenka conceded removability, and in the meantime, in December 2003, filed an application for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and CAT relief, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The following facts are drawn from Marynenka\u2019s statement in support of her application and her testimony and documentary evidence presented at the hearing before the IJ on May 22, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Marynenka is a member of Zubr, a Belarusian youth organization that opposes the government and works to promote democracy and freedom in Belarus. Marynenka joined Zubr in November of 2001 with her close friend, Hanna Chuyashkova, while both were attending a university in Gomel, Belarus. Chuyashkova, who currently lives with Marynenka in the United States, has also applied for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Marynenka and Chuyashkova attended their first Zubr demonstration on December 27, 2001, in Minsk, Belarus. The demonstration took place in front of the Committee for State Security (BKGB) building to commemorate the death of Zubr member Andrei Zaytsev. Zaytsev had committed suicide, allegedly in reaction to pressure from the BKGB. No arrests were made at this demonstration. On January 28, 2002, Marynenka and Chuyashkova participated in a second demonstration commemorating Zaytsev\u2019s death, this time at their university in Gomel. The police axrested Marynenka at this event and held her for interrogation. When Marynenka did not respond to police questions about her involvement in Zubr, she was beaten. She was detained for three days and, once released, spent five days in bed due to her injuries. Chuyashkova was also arrested, interrogated, and beaten as a result of her participation in the same demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">On July 27, 2002, Marynenka and Chuyashkova joined other Zubr members in a demonstration in Minsk to mark the anniversary of Belarus\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union. Marynenka testified that she was arrested for carrying an outlawed red and white flag. She was taken to the BKGB building where she was again interrogated and beaten. She was detained for five days and thereafter spent five days in a hospital because of two cracked ribs and a ruptured left kidney. Marynenka testified on cross-examination that Chuyashkova had suffered essentially the same injuries after her own arrest at the same event: two broken ribs and a damaged left kidney.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">After Marynenka\u2019s release from the hospital, her parents received anonymous phone calls warning them that Marynenka should end her participation in Zubr. On September 16, 2002, three internal affairs agents searched the home of Marynenka\u2019s parents. According to Marynenka, these agents told her parents \u201cthat their daughter would get imprisoned for her actions as a member of Zubr.\u201d J.A. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Marynenka and Chuyashkova were called to the dean\u2019s office at their university on October 13, 2002. The dean asked them if they were members of Zubr. A BKGB agent who was present accused the two women of participating in Zubr activities, slapped Marynenka on the face, knocked her to the floor, and then kicked her in the stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>On November 2, 2002, Marynenka and Chuyashkova took part in a government-sanctioned march in Minsk. When they returned to Gomel the following day, November 3, they were met at Chuyashkova\u2019s residence by policemen who forced them into a car and drove them to a forest. Both women were then raped by four policemen. Marynenka submitted a medical record showing that the next morning, on November 4, 2002, she was treated at a clinic for sexual assault. The medical record characterized Marynenka as a \u201cvictim\u201d and reported that during her examination \u201cthe following was determined: there are numerous abrasions and bruises in the groin area, the entire body reveals multiple lacerations, bruises and scratches, inside the vagina there are numerous ruptures. All of the findings indicate a recent sexual act.\u201d J.A. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In further support of her application, Marynenka introduced statements from her mother Nadezhda Marynenka, Hanna Chuyashkova, Zubr member Kiryl Zhurau, and Anzhalika Shuppo. She also submitted documentary evidence establishing that country conditions in Belarus were consistent with her testimony. The regime was undemocratic, brutally oppressive, and engaged in human rights violations to stifle dissent. Rape and sexual abuse of women was widespread.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Marynenka\u2019s mother\u2019s statement supports Marynenka\u2019s activity with Zubr, her allegations of the beatings she received in January and July of 2002, the harassing phone calls and police search, and the November 3, 2002, rape. Chuyashkova\u2019s statement confirms both her and Marynenka\u2019s association with Zubr. Chuyashkova \u201cpersonally witnessed what [Marynenka] went through,\u201d and Chuyashkova mentions the \u201canonymous phone calls which [the two] received periodically, warnings from the rector, house searches, threats,\u201d and \u201cdetentions and beatings.\u201d J.A. 143. Chuyashkova\u2019s statement focuses on and describes the rapes of both women by four police officers on November 3, 2002. At Marynenka\u2019s removal hearing on May 22, 2006, a question was raised as to why Marynenka\u2019s friend and roommate, Chuyashkova, did not appear and testify. On cross-examination Marynenka acknowledged that Chuyashkova had personal knowledge of the events described above. When asked why Chuyashkova did not appear as a witness, Marynenka answered that Chuyashkova \u201chad a brain concussion and because of that ... she is getting treatment and being advised not to be exposed to anything that make[s] her upset.\u201d J.A. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Zhurau\u2019s statement confirms Marynenka\u2019s membership in Zubr. He confirms her attendance at the December 27, 2001, and July 27, 2002, demonstrations, and he saw Marynenka being arrested by police officers during the July 27, 2002, event. Shuppo\u2019s statement does not mention the basis for her knowledge, but she says that Marynenka was a member of Zubr and that Marynenka participated in the December 27, 2001, and November 2, 2002, demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The IJ denied Marynenka\u2019s application in an oral statement at the conclusion of the May 22, 2006, hearing. The IJ \u201crecognize^] that country conditions in Belarus have gone from bad to worse.\u201d J.A. 167. Although the IJ questioned some aspects of Marynenka\u2019s testimony, the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility determination with respect to her testimony. The IJ found, however, that Marynenka \u201cfailed to meet her burden in establishing past persecution and that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution should she return to Belarus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, according to the IJ, Marynenka \u201c[did] not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>submit [] persuasive corroborating evidence that she was a Zubr member, that she was politically active, that she was arrested, that she was harmed and that she fled Belarus in fear for her life.\u201d J.A. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The IJ expressed concern \u201cthat [Marynenka] appears to have filed virtually an identical asylum application to that of her friend, Hanna Chuyashkova.\u201d J.A. 167. Nevertheless, the IJ recognized that \u201c[i]t would indeed not be unusual for friends and fellow activists to be involved in similar activities, to be arrested at similar times and to be harmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While accepting that \u201call of these similarities could happen,\u201d the IJ was troubled \u201cthat Hanna Chuyashkova [wa]s not present to testify on behalf of [Marynenka].\u201d J.A. 168. The IJ noted that Marynenka and Chuyashkova, who were roommates, \u201ccould have traveled to Court together today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The IJ then expressed skepticism about Marynenka\u2019s explanation for Chuyashkova\u2019s absence. The IJ observed that Chuyashkova\u2019s \u201calleged brain concussion\u201d occurred in 1999 and that she thereafter \u201cjoined Zubr, then participated in numerous demonstrations and was arrested and harmed on several occasions,\u201d despite the \u201crequirement that she avoid stress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Chuyashkova\u2019s statement provided specifics about the rapes that she and Marynenka suffered together, the IJ otherwise saw nothing in Chuyashkova\u2019s statement that referred to \u201carrests with\u201d Marynenka or \u201cbeing called to the dean\u2019s office\u201d with her. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The IJ found it \u201cimplausible ... that after th[e] alleged brutal assault [the rape], that [Marynenka] would not go immediately to an emergency room,\u201d but rather waited \u201cuntil 10:00 the next morning\u201d to \u201cseek medical assistance.\u201d J.A. 169. The IJ also discounted Marynenka\u2019s medical record of the rape because the document was not on clinic letterhead and because she had not established its chain of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The IJ noted the lack of documentation to support Marynenka\u2019s claim that she was hospitalized in July 2002 after being interrogated and beaten. The IJ also noted that Shuppo\u2019s statement did not provide any foundation for her knowledge of Marynenka\u2019s membership in Zubr or her participation at two demonstrations. Nor did Shuppo mention that Marynenka had been harmed or arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Although Zhurau\u2019s statement confirmed Marynenka\u2019s participation in Zubr and her arrest at the July 27, 2002, demonstration, the IJ did not credit Zhurau because \u201cthere is absolutely no way for this Court [the IJ] to corroborate the information in [Zhurau\u2019s] affidavit.\u201d J.A. 170. Finally, the IJ explained that Marynenka\u2019s mother\u2019s statement did not overcome the \u201caforementioned concerns and indeed this letter does not constitute independent evidence of [Marynenka\u2019s] alleged persecution.\u201d J.A. 170 (citing <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 359 (4th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Based on the foregoing reasoning, the IJ found that Marynenka failed to meet her burden of proof and denied her application for asylum. Similarly, the IJ found that Marynenka did not satisfy her burden of proving eligibility for withholding of removal. Finally, the IJ denied Marynenka\u2019s request for protection under CAT because she failed to prove that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Belarus.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Marynenka appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the IPs decision and dismissed Marynenka\u2019s appeal. Like the IJ, the BIA did not make an express adverse credibility finding. Instead, the BIA found that Marynenka \u201cha[d] not met her burden of proof to establish eligibility for relief.\u201d J.A. 293. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Marynenka petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">To establish eligibility for the discretionary grant of asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the applicant has the burden of showing either that she was subjected to past persecution or that she has a \u201cwell-founded\u201d fear of future persecution \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). Fear of future persecution \u201ccontains a subjective and an objective component.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 201 (4th Cir.1999). The subjective component is satisfied \u201cby presenting candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cThe objective element requires the asylum [applicant] to show, with specific, concrete facts, that a reasonable person in like circumstances would fear persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202. If the applicant establishes past persecution, a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution is also established. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal, the applicant must establish that if she is removed, there is a clear probability that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened ... because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). An applicant \u201cwho has failed to establish the less stringent well-founded fear standard of proof required for asylum relief is necessarily also unable to establish an entitlement to withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Anim v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 243, 253 (4th Cir.2008) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">To be eligible for protection under CAT, the applicant must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(1), (2); <em>see Gandziami-Mickhou, </em>445 F.3d at 354. The likelihood of torture, however, need not be tied to a protected ground under CAT. <em>See Dankam v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 113, 115-16 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s administrative findings of fact under the substantial evidence rule, and we are obliged to treat them as conclusive unless the evidence before the BIA was such that any reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Haoua v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.2007). We review legal issues de novo. <em>Abdel-Rahman v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 444, 449 (4th Cir.2007). The agency decision that an alien is not eligible for asylum is \u201cconclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D). When, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and includes its own reasons for affirming, we review both decisions. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">In considering Marynenka\u2019s petition for review, we \u201cpresume that [she] testified credibly\u201d because neither the IJ nor the BIA made an express adverse credibility determination. <em>Lin-Jian v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 182, 191 (4th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Even though a few of the IJ\u2019s statements im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>plied doubt about certain aspects of Marynenka\u2019s testimony, both the IJ and the BIA rested then.' decisions on the lack of persuasive corroborating evidence. At oral argument the government conceded that Marynenka\u2019s testimony must be taken as credible because the IJ did not make an express adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">An applicant\u2019s credible testimony, standing alone, \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain [her] burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cHowever, even for credible testimony, corroboration may be required when it is reasonable to expect such proof and there is no reasonable explanation for its absence.\u201d <em>Lin-Jian, </em>489 F.3d at 191-92 (citing <em>In re S-M-J- </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, Interim Decision 3303 (BIA 1997)). An IJ may not rely on \u201cspeculation, conjecture, or an other wise unsupported personal opinion\u201d to discredit an applicant\u2019s testimony or her corroborating evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006) (citation and quotations omitted); <em>Zuh v. Mukasey, </em>547 F.3d 504, 508-10 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The IJ denied Marynenka\u2019s asylum application because she did \u201cnot submit [] persuasive corroborating evidence that she was a Zubr member, that she was politically active, that she was arrested, that she was harmed and that she fled Belarus in fear for her life.\u201d J.A. 170. As we explain below, the IJ offered reasons that are unsupportable as a matter of law in discrediting key pieces of Marynenka\u2019s corroborating evidence. This evidence relates to Marynenka\u2019s rape, her Zubr membership, and her arrest at the July 27, 2002, demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The IJ committed legal error in discrediting the medical record showing that on November 4, 2002, Marynenka was treated for sexual assault at a clinic in Gomel. The IJ was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d by the document because it was not written on clinic letterhead and because Marynenka did not establish a chain of custody. J.A. 169. However, the document bears a rectangular seal or stamp that reads \u201cGomel City Clinic No. 10.\u201d J.A. 136. The document, which describes in detail the results of a physician\u2019s examination, confirms a brutal rape and notes the date and time of the examination. The government offered no reason for the IJ to doubt the legitimacy of the document. And the IJ had no basis, other than conjecture, for rejecting the document on the ground that it was not writ ten on printed letterhead. Finally, with respect to the chain of custody, \u201cthe rules of evidence do not apply strictly in administrative adjudications of immigration cases, and here the immigration judge ... offer[ed] no other [valid] reason\u201d to doubt the authenticity of the document. <em>Kourouma v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 234, 242 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Rejection of the medical document as corroboration apparently cleared the way for the IJ to reach another unsustainable conclusion. The IJ thought it \u201cimplausible ... that after this alleged brutal assault [specifically, the rape], that [Marynenka did] not go immediately to an emergency room,\u201d but instead waited until early the next morning to \u201cseek medical assistance.\u201d J.A. 169. Waiting overnight to seek medical attention after a traumatic sexual assault is not implausible; if anything, it is understandable. Even in the United States, when the perpetrator of a rape is a stranger, the crime is not reported to police 54 percent of the time. <em>See </em>Callie Marie Rennison, Rape and Sexual Assault: Reporting to Police and Medical Attention, 1992-2000, at 3 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, August 2002), <em>available at </em>http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/ rsarp00.pdf. In addition, of the victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>who do not report their rapes to police, only 17 percent seek medical attention. <em>Id. </em>The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Marynenka would not have waited a few hours to seek medical care appears to be based on conjecture or unsupported personal opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The IJ also committed legal error when she discounted the corroborating evidence from Kiryl Zhurau, a member of the Gomel branch of Zubr since 2001. Zhurau\u2019s statement established that Marynenka was an active Zubr member. He confirms that he participated with Marynenka in the July 27, 2002, demonstration in Minsk and \u201csaw [her] being arrested by police officers and taken to their vehicle.\u201d J.A. 148. The IJ discounted Zhurau\u2019s statement because \u201cthere is absolutely no way for this Court [the IJ] to corroborate the information in this particular [statement].\u201d J.A. 170. There is no general rule that evidence offered in corroboration requires independent corroboration. Zhurau\u2019s statement therefore could not be discredited on the ground that it <em>automatically </em>required corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">When we take Marynenka\u2019s testimony as credible, \u201cwe cannot uphold the IJ\u2019s decision based on the stated rationale\u201d that she failed to provide persuasive corroborating evidence. <em>Zuh, </em>547 at 513. The IJ used legally unsupportable reasons to reject the corroborating medical record that confirms Marynenka\u2019s rape. The IJ also committed legal error in rejecting Zhurau\u2019s statement under what the IJ appeared to regard as a general rule that corroborating evidence requires further corroboration. In short, the IJ\u2019s reasoning renders her decision \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D). We recognize, of course, that \u201cour role is not to weigh the evidence and determine which of the competing views is more compelling.\u201d <em>Zuh, </em>547 F.3d at 513 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted, emphasis removed). The better course is to vacate the BIA decision and remand the case to that body with instructions that the case be returned to the IJ. The IJ will reconsider Marynenka\u2019s application in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Marynenka\u2019s petition for review is granted. We vacate the BIA\u2019s decision denying Marynenka\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. The case is remanded to the BIA, which will, in turn, remand it to the IJ for reconsideration of Marynenka\u2019s application in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\"> This principle was codified as follows in the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L.
