L. 483, applies to appeals from judgments of justices of the peace: Miller &amp; Co. v. Satterly, 27 Dist. Rep. 338; Lincoln v. Reading Electric Co., 9 Berks Co. L. J. 133; Ege v. Arnold, 27 Dist.

Rep. 832.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-5\"><em>William Fackenthal, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Aqyg\">Trexler, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, is as its title expresses, an act relating to practice in the courts of common pleas, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In its first section it limits its application to actions of assumpsit and trespass \u2014 \u201cbrought in\u201d any court of common pleas. Are the proceedings in appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace to be regarded as an action \u201cbrought in\u201d the court of common pleas? If they are, it follows that the plaintiff in such action must file a statement, as provided by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The court below took the view that the act did not apjply. The decisions of the lower courts are not harmonious. The words \u201cbrought in\u201d are equivalent to instituted or begun. They have a phrasal meaning which is distinctive and well known. The idea of taking from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>one place to another is properly expressed by the employment of the word \u201cbring\u201d but it has not that meaning by any usage when the word is applied to a lawsuit. To \u201cbring\u201d suit is to initiate. A suit is brought when it is commenced: \u201cWords and Phrases,\u201d Vol. 11, page 875. The argument that uniformity is desirable might be entitled to consideration if the legislative expression were obscure, but the act is plain. If its provisions were to apply to all suits in the common pleas, that idea could have been well expressed by the omission of the words \u201cbrought in\u201d for a suit is a suit until it be ended, but a suit is \u201cbrought\u201d or begun but once. It is not \u201cbrought in\u201d a justice court and again when it is appealed to the common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">The argument that on an appeal from a justice of the peace the case is tried de novo has little force for as was said in Deihm v. Snell, 119 Pa. 316, \u201cIt is nevertheless the same case, \u2014 the cause of action remains the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">As to the objection that the plaintiff\u2019s book of original entries was admitted as proof of delivery of the goods to the defendant without the production of shipping receipts, we know of no case that has changed the law that the books import delivery. They are prima facie proof of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
