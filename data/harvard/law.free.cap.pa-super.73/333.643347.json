Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-12\">The court below filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-13\">In this action brought by Lillian Campbell administratrix of the estate of Charles F. Campbell, against the Great Eastern Casualty Company, upon a policy insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ing her husband against accident, she recovered seven hundred and fifty dollars, the full amount of the policy, on account of the accidental death of the insured while he was at work for his employer, the Eastern Pennsylvania Light, Heat &amp; Power Company, on December 1, 1917. The defendant has filed a motion for a new trial, and for judgment n. o. v. We will consider these motions in the order stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-3\">The first eleven paragraphs of the plaintiff\u2019s statement were not denied by the defendant, and made out a prima facie case upon which the plaintiff relied at the trial. To meet this, the defense sought to establish, (1) that the policy was void for a breach of warranty respecting the occupation of the insured at the time of its issue; (2) that the work in which the insured was engaged at the time of his death, was in an occupation which was not insurable by the company, and plaintiff therefore could not recover; (3) that the work in which the insured was engaged at the time of his death was more hazardous than the occupation given by him when he was insured, and the defendant was therefore but proportionately liable, or for one-fifth of the amount of the policy, as determined by the classification of the occupation in which he met his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-4\">The fifth and sixth paragraphs of the plaintiff\u2019s statement aver that the policy of insurance was in full force and effect at the time of the accidental death of the insured. In view of this admission, in our opinion, the court was fully justified in stating to the jury in its charge that the question whether the policy was void on the ground that the occupation of the insured had been misrepresented when he obtained it, did not arise. In fact, the defendant does not now urge this instruction as a reason for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">When the case attached for trial the plaintiff\u2019s statement was not in the files, so that a careful comparison between it and the affidavit of defense was not made by the trial judge, on account of the hurry of the trial, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>after the evidence had been closed. The defenses above referred to were stated orally to the court by defendant\u2019s counsel, as arising out of the pleadings, and his statement was not challenged by counsel for the plaintiff, nor were any of the objections made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the admission of testimony, supported by specifically directing attention to the only defense or defenses, set forth in the affidavit of defense. Counsel for the plaintiff did object, however, to the admission of the classification manual of the insurance company, adopted May 1, 1916, which was offered for the purpose of showing that the insured was engaged at the time of his death in an uninsurable occupation, and if not in such an occupation, then in an occupation the hazard of which was so great, compared with the one in which he was insured, as to require the payment of but one-fifth of the face of the policy, with its accumulations, on the ground that the manual did not tend to prove anything at issue in the case, and that it was not admissible for any purpose, because it was not in force when the policy of insurance was issued: see pages 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36 of the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-3\">When the points were presented and argued the court called the attention of counsel for the defendant to the fact, that, in its opinion, the question of proportionate liability was not raised by the affidavit of defense, and that the only question for submission to the jury, under the pleadings, was whether the plaintiff was entitled to the full amount of the policy, or was precluded from recovering anything, because the insured was engaged in an uninsurable occupation when he was killed. No application to amend the pleadings was made then or since, and the jury was charged as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">Counsel contends, in support of the motion for a new trial, that the defendant was injured by the withdrawal of the question of proportionate liability from the jury, because in support of that defense evidence had been admitted, and also because the defense of proportionate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>liability is claimed to be set forth in the affidavit of defense. It seems quite clear that if the trial judge discovered error in his ruling admitting evidence offered by the defendant, that he was not required to submit the irrelevant testimony to the jury. The affidavit of defense does not set forth the defense of proportionate liability. The averment of the defendant in his affidavit of defense, that in an effort to effect an amicable adjustment, it paid the plaintiff one hundred and fifty dollars, before suit was brought, and that the said sum was accepted by the plaintiff, does not, taken in connection with the other averments of the affidavit of defense in respect to the conditions of the policy, raise or even suggest the defense of proportionate liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-3\">In construing a rule of court in Westmoreland County in Whitehead v. School Dist., 145 Pa. 418, 428, which provided that when the plaintiff filed a specification of his claim under oath, the averments not denied by the affidavit of defense should be taken as admitted at the trial, Clark, J., said: \u201cUnder the rules of practice referred to, they constitute, as it were, part of the pleadings, their object being to reduce the contest at the trial to the points actually in dispute: Bair v. Hubartt, 139 Pa. <em>96; </em>and the court should take notice of these admissions as disclosed by the record, and confine the contest to the matters in issue. As we said in Neely v. Bair, 144 Pa. 250: \u2018The object of this and similar rules of court, obviously, is to dispense with the formal proof, on trial, of all such facts and circumstances, material to the plaintiff\u2019s case, as the defendant shall be required to deny under oath, which facts, if not so denied as required by the rule, shall, for the purposes of the trial, be taken as admitted. A proper system of practice under such rules, greatly facilitates and expedites the trial of causes, and often relieves the jury from consideration of a heterogeneous mass of testimony bearing upon facts which the defendant cannot deny, but which the plaintiff would otherwise be required to establish by formal proof. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>controversy is thus narrowed down to such items of claim and material matters of fact as are really disputed. In such cases, it is the province of the court to examine the respective affidavits, and thus ascertain what items of claim, and averments of fact in support thereof, are not denied by the defendant, and then confine the testimony to such items of claim and material averments of fact as are denied.\u201d See also Jacoby v. Insurance Co., 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 171, 178; Easton Power Co. v. Ry. Supply Co., 22 Pa. Superior Ct. 538, 543.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-3\">From this it appears to be clear that the court should not, on general principles, submit anything to the jury for its determination when it is not in issue, but \u201cPractice Act, nineteen fifteen\u201d plainly so provides in section 16, as follows: \u201cSection 16. Neither party shall be permitted at the trial, to make any defense which is not set forth in the affidavit of defense, or plaintiff\u2019s reply, as the case may be, except as provided in sections seven and thirteen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">The defense of proportionate liability, if in issue by the pleadings, rests entirely upon the classification manual of the defendant company, adopted May 1, 1916. The classification in the manual adopted May 1, 1916, relied upon by the defense, is that by which an \u201cElectrician, transformer work\u201d is placed in Class X, which pays, with full accumulations, one hundred and fifty dollars. Although the classification manual was offered generally by the defendant, attention was not directed to two other classifications which the jury would have been warranted in finding from the evidence, that the insured was engaged in when he met his death, and each of which paid more than one hundred and fifty dollars, with accumulations. The classifications referred to are \u201celectrician, foreman, superintending only, outside, not climbing poles\u201d and \u201celectrician, outside work, not climbing poles.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The policy was issued July 8, 1910. The manuals in force then were adopted January 1, 1908, and October 1, 1909. The relevant provision in the contract of insurance is as follows: \u201c15. I understand and agree, (1) that if I contract illness or am injured, fatally or otherwise, after having changed my occupation to one classified by the company as more hazardous than that herein stated, or if I am injured while doing any act or thing pertaining to any occupation so classified, the liability of the company shall be only for such proportion of the principal sum or other indemnity as the premium paid by me will purchase at the rates fixed by this company for such more hazardous occupation.\u201d This is clearly a reference to the classification manual of the company, and in no other way are any of the classifications contained in said manual referred to, and none of the said classifications are made a part of the application for the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the classification manuals of the defendant company, if relevant at all, are the manuals adopted January 1, 1908, or October 1, 1909: Morse v. Fraternal Acc. Assn. of America, 77 N. E. 491, 492. But the question of the relevancy of the classification manuals, must be decided against the contention of the defendant, and we hold that none of the said manuals were relevant for any purpose under the evidence in this case, even though the defense of proportionate liability had been set forth in the affidavit of defense, because none of the provisions of the said manuals were contained in the application for the insurance: Mowry v. National Protective Society, Appellant, 27 Pa. Superior Ct. 390, 396; Bayard, Adm., v. Continental Casualty Co., 60 P. L. J. 181, 182. This disposes of all the questions raised by the reasons assigned for a new trial, so that specific reference to each of said reasons is unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">The motion for judgment n. o. v. is based on the refusal of the court to affirm the point of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>asking for the direction of a verdict in its favor. The contention of the defense in support of this motion is that the check or checks mailed by it to the plaintiff, without her authority, constitute payment, because she did not return the said checks, and that the said alleged payment is for the largest sum which the jury could have awarded the defendant under the evidence, notwithstanding the admission that the said checks were not presented by the plaintiff for payment, and that the defendant was notified of her refusal to accept them. These checks, unless paid upon presentation by the plaintiff, were not payment: Leas, Appellant, v. Hafer, 39 Pa. Superior Ct. 160, 162. There is no merit in the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aov\">February 28, 1920:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-2\">For the reasons stated the motions for a new trial and the motion for judgment n. o. v. must be overruled, and the rules to show cause heretofore granted, discharged'.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-3\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were the charge of the court, refusal of defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-4\"><em>Daniel W.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Charles F. Campbell, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, was insured under an accident policy in the defendant company, \u201cagainst the effects of bodily injuries, caused directly and independently of all other causes by ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ternal violent and accidental means,\u201d etc. In Ms application lie stated Ms occupation to be \u201csuperintendent, supervising only,\u201d and the duties incident to this occupation were described as \u201csuperintendent, supervising only.\u201d He was classified under the rules of the company with a rating by which they agreed to pay for a loss of life, the sum of $500. On the trial it was shown he was a foreman of a light, heat and power company, and discharged the duties of a foreman in doing all kinds of electric work, except that he did not climb poles.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\">On the evening of December 1, 1917, he went alone to a lot, adjoining the power house, to repair a transformer. After an absence of an hour he was found dead, lying on the ground at the base of the transformer. No person, was present at the time of his death. It is referred to by both parties as accidental, and it was clearly shown, that at the time he started to do the repair work, the transformer had been disconnected by the superintendent, and there were no marks on his person to indicate the cause of his death. It was conceded, that the burden was on the defendant to show that, at the time of his death he was engaged in an act that was not insurable under the policy. There was no evidence in the case showing how long the act which he started out to do would probably have required, to show how he fell to the ground, how long he was upon the ground before he was found, that he had completed his work and returned and subsequently come in contact with a wire, or whether he was placed in contact with a live wire when his work upon the uncharged transformer was completed, while in the act of coming away from his work. The trial judge, after a fair review of the testimony, said, \u201cCan you find, under these circumstances, by the weight and fair preponderance of the evidence, that the deceased was engaged in an act that was not insurable at the time of his death? If you do, then your verdict must be in favor of the defendant.\u201d The converse proposition was presented, that if the jury found that his death was ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>cidental, and occurred in an employment which was insurable, while discharging the duties of superintendent, supervising only, and that any manual labor in which he was engaged at the time of the accident was merely casual and incidental to his employment, and not so far out of its scope as to lead reasonable men to know that it was beyond the scope of the term superintendent, supervising only, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">The court held, that the question of proportionate liability did not arise, and we think rightly, for the reason that there was no proof at all of the cause of death, or the character of work in which he was then engaged. The case was very thoroughly tried by able counsel, and fairly and adequately submitted in a charge which presented the questions of fact in such a manner that the jury could not be in doubt as to the respective contentions of the parties. It was purely a question of fact for their solution. The opinion of the trial judge in discharging rules for a new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto, is a complete answer to the assignments of error as urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
