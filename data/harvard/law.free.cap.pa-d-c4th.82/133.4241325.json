(defendants), appeal an order dated August 4,2006 denying defendants\u2019 motion for issue preclusion against Joan Wood Barnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Plaintiff June Hall commenced this action against the named defendants on May 17, 2005. On September 22, 2004, defendant Joan Wood Barnes was an agency nurse employed by Med-Staff Inc. Defendants\u2019 motion, \u00b61. During Barnes\u2019 shift, the feeding tubes of six residents were severed, including that of the decedent. Defendants\u2019 motion, \u00b65.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Barnes was accused of \u201cknowingly, intentionally, recklessly caused/attempted to cause bodily injury to the complainant Sallie Hall, age 85, by cutting her feeding tube.\u201d See criminal complaint (09/26/04). On March 8, 2005, Barnes was tried before the Honorable Felicia Rowley Stack and found guilty. See defendants\u2019 motion, \u00b614. Barnes response, \u00b614. Findings of facts were not issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">On July 7, 2006, defendants filed a motion for issue preclusion against Barnes. Defendants sought to have it conclusively determined that Barnes \u201cintentionally and surreptitiously\u201d cut the peg tube of decedent. Defendants failed to attach a complete copy of the transcripts of the criminal proceeding. The portion presented provided only that Judge Stack found Barnes \u201cguilty as charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>However, the charges are in dispute. Plaintiff and defendants assert that Barnes was convicted of simple assault and neglect of a care-dependent person. However, plaintiff submitted documents which provided that Barnes was only convicted of \u201cneglect of person.\u201d See plaintiff\u2019s response, exhibit A. According to plaintiff\u2019s documents, charges of possession of the instrument of crime, simple assault, and recklessly endangering another person were withdrawn. Defendants presented no evidence of a finding of surreptitious behavior. Accordingly, said motion was denied on August 4, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">Defendants sought and were granted permission from the appellate court to appeal the court\u2019s August 4 order. A statement of matters complained of on appeal was requested on November 21,2006 and properly tendered on November 29, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">STATEMENT OF MATTERS COMPLAINED OF ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Based upon the criminal trial and guilty verdict, defendants contend that the court should have granted an order providing that, \u201cit should be deemed established as a fact of record that on September 22,2004, Joan Wood Barnes <em>intentionally and surreptitiously </em>cut the peg tube of plaintiff\u2019s decedent, resident Sallie Mae Hall.\u201d Defendants\u2019 proposed order, (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Litigants agree that Barnes was convicted of neglect of care-dependent person. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a72713. Pursuant to Pennsylvania statute, a person is guilty of neglect of care-dependent person if he or she \u201c[i]ntentionally, know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ingly <em>or </em>recklessly\u201d causes injury to a care-dependent for whom he or she is responsible. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a72713(a) (1). (emphasis added) The Commonwealth needs only to prove, and a fact-finder find, beyond a reasonable doubt that Barnes acted with intent, knowledge <em>or </em>recklessness. The use of the disjunctive term \u201cor\u201d is not insignificant nor an unintended happenstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">To do as defendants suggest, a court would have to speculate as to whether the fact-finder found intent, knowledge or reckless behavior and bind a litigant based upon that speculation rather than a specific finding by a competent court. The court is troubled by this endeavor and declines defendants\u2019 invitation to broaden the doctrine of collateral estoppel/issue preclusion to include the circumstances at bar. Absent evidence of a judicial determination of the presence of intent, as opposed to knowledge or recklessness, the court rightfully declined defendants\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Lastly it should be noted that surreptitious is not an element of the crime charged, nor the tort sued upon herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The order of August 4, 2006 should be affirmed as defendants\u2019 failed to establish that another court found Barnes to have acted \u201cintentionally and surreptitiously\u201d.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
