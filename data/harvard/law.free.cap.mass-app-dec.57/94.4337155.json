Town of Groveland, App. Div. No. 8319 (Northern Essex No. 51-1974) and Merrimack Transportation, Inc. v. Town of Groveland, App. Div.

The Town of Groveland Municipal Light Commission is subject to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 164, Sections 34 to 69 inclusive and is regulated by the Massachusetts Department of Utilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\"><em>\"2. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s action is based on the action of the defendant\u2019s Municipal Light Commission in abating the November billings for all of its residential customers to the exclusion of its commercial customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">There was no evidence presented, no statement of agreed facts or any other matter presented except oral arguments on the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The trial court allowed the motions and dismissed the three actions. From these dismissals, the plaintiffs claimed to be aggrieved and are before this Division on reports which state they contain all the evidence material to the questions reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number> Rule 22 of the Rules of the District Courts (1954) requires notice of hearings on motions be given to adverse party at least three days before hearing, <em>unless the court otherwise orders. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The fourth paragraph of Rule 22 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\"The court need not hear any motion, or opposition thereto, grounded on facts, unless the facts are verified by affidavit, or are apparent upon the record and filed, or are agreed to and stated in writing signed by the attorneys for the parties interested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This permits the court, not forbids it, to hear motions without affidavits. See <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Estes, </em>353 Mass. 90, 96 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> \"A motion to dismiss must be based upon matters appearing on the face of the record. <em>Zwick v. Goldberg, </em>304 Mass. 66 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> However, we, as did the trial justice and the parties, will examine the substance of the pleading and are not bound by its form, title, name or description. <em>Parks Shellac Co. v. Jones, </em>265 Mass. 108 (1928); <em>Held v. Brandano, </em>37 Mass. App. Dec. 184 (1967) and consider the true nature of the pleading as an answer in abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\"> Outside of the face of the record, the parties stipulated to two facts \u2014 (1). that the defendant is subject to G.L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a734 through 69 and is regulated by the Department of Public Utilities, and (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 actions are based on the defendant\u2019s abating the November billing for residential customers and not for the commercial customers. With these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>municipally owned electric plants, their service pracfacts added to the record, the defendant raises the issue of the District Court not having jurisdiction over each count of the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration \u2014 which seeks reimbursement for the November bill paid by each plaintiff based on an alleged discriminatory practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The provisions of G.L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a734 through 69 give to the Department of Public Utilities various regulatory powers over municipal light departments such as the defendant. In <em>Holyoke Water Power Co. v. City of Holyoke, </em>349 Mass. 442 (1965) (where the plaintiff claimed unreasonable discrimination in the municipal power department offering price discounts to certain users) the court, at pages 445 - 446 stated that by the provisions of c. 164 \"the department has been given sufficient powers of supervision over tices, and charges to make it appropriate for a person, affected by practices of such a plant allegedly to be discriminatory, to apply to the department for relief in the first instance before seeking relief in the courts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Further \"exhaustion of the possibilities of departmental action should precede independent action in the courts to prevent alleged discriminatory practices.\u201d ibid, p. 447. <em>Scottie Industries, Inc. v. Donohoe, et al, Admin., </em>Mass. App. Ct. Adv. Sh. (1973) 695, where the jurisdiction of the Superior Court was challenged, cited by the plaintiffs, is distinguishable on its facts 'because in that case there was no evidence that the supplier of electricity was regulated by the Department of Public Utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\"In the absence of a statutory directive to the contrary, the administrative, remedies should be exhausted before resort to the courts.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Hardware Mutual Casualty Co., </em>361 Mass. 582, 587 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
