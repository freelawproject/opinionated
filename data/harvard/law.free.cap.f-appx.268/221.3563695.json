She was subsequently convicted and sentenced to two years\u2019 probation, with the first six months to be served in home detention. On appeal, Bland contends that the district court erred by sentencing her as a felon, rather than as a misdemeanant. Because we find that Bland pleaded guilty to a felony offense under \u00a7 1097(a) and that her guilty plea is supported by a sufficient factual basis, we find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-21\">In 2001, Bland opened the Art and Science Institute of Cosmetology and Massage Therapy (\u201cASIC\u201d) in Fairmont, West Virginia. In September 2004, she applied to the United States Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d) for ASIC to become certified to participate in the federal financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Education Act of 1965 (\u201cTitle IV\u201d). Pub.L. No. 89-329, 79 Stat. 1219 (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1070 et. seq.). As a Title IV eligible institution, qualified ASIC students would have been allowed to seek federal financial aid to help fund their tuition. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1070. Bland commenced the certification process by submitting an \u201cInitial Application for Approval to be Designated as an Eligible Institution and to Participate in the Federal Financial Assistance Programs\u201d pursuant to the Title TV regulations. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.20(a). Next, Bland was required to obtain and submit an audited financial statement for ASIC for fiscal year 2003, prepared in accordance with \u201cGovernment Auditing Standards.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 668.23. She hired Michael Henderson, CPA (\u201cHenderson\u201d) of the accounting firm Oliver &amp; Henderson, who prepared a compilation report<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of ASIC\u2019s financial standing, rather than a more costly audited financial statement. Bland subsequently used the information entered in the compilation report to create a false audited financial statement, forged Henderson\u2019s signature, and submitted the statement to the DOE on a fabricated Oliver &amp; Henderson letterhead. The fraudulent submissions were detected by the DOE. During the course of the ensuing DOE investigation, a DOE employee contacted Bland and informed her that ASIC\u2019s Title IV application would not be considered for approval until Bland submitted an additional audited financial statement for fiscal year 2004. Bland never submitted the statement and the application was never approved. As a result, neither ASIC nor any of its students received funds from the DOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Bland was later indicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia on five counts stemming from her submission of the fraudulent application. Bland entered into a plea agreement in which she agreed to plead guilty to one count of federal financial aid fraud, in violation of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1097(a), in exchange for the dismissal of the other four counts. The agreement indicated that the maximum statutory penalties to which Bland would be exposed were: \u201c(1) imprisonment for a period of not more than 5 years;\u201d \u201c(2) a fine of up to $250,000;\u201d \u201c(3) up to three (3) years of supervised release;\u201d and, \u201c(4) a special assessment of $100.00.\u201d J.A. 11-12. The government agreed to recommend as \u201clenient a sentence as an application of the advisory sentencing guidelines will allow.\u201d J.A. 13. Bland, in turn, waived \u201cany right she may have [had] for a jury determination of any and all facts relevant to sentencing,\u201d and consented to the determination of such facts by the sentencing court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">At Bland\u2019s plea hearing, the district court first sought to determine whether Bland was aware of the contents of the plea agreement and the ramifications of a guilty plea. As part of this determination, the court asked Bland if she understood that the statutory \u201cmaximum period of imprisonment\u201d for the crime to which she was pleading guilty was \u201cfive years.\u201d Plea Hr\u2019 g Tr. at 19. Bland responded, \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Bland responded in the same manner when asked whether she understood that \u201cthere[] [was] a one hundred dollar mandatory special assessment that has to be paid for the felony conviction on or before the date of your sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The court next sought to determine whether there existed a sufficient factual basis to support Bland\u2019s guilty plea. To so establish, the government called as a witness George Blissman (\u201cBlissman\u201d), a Special Agent employed with the DOE Office of Inspector General. Blissman testified that after interviewing Bland\u2019s accountant, Henderson, he discovered that the 2003 financial statements submitted by Bland \u201cweren\u2019t prepared by the CPA who was represented as preparing them.... They were not signed by him and the letterhead used on the reports were not ones that he would use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. Blissman further testified that Bland admitted to him that she had prepared the financial statements with the assistance of a member of her staff, and that they had forged Henderson\u2019s signature. Following Bliss-man\u2019s testimony, Bland entered her plea of guilty, at which time the following dialogue took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">THE COURT: Did you in fact do what Mr. Blissman testified regarding the preparation of the application for financial aid and the further preparation of the financial statements that were questioned later by the Department of Education?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">THE COURT: Okay. You took information that Mr. Henderson had done as a compilation, which is a term of art under accounting, and then you managed to put it into a format that was required by the Department of Education and then signed his name to it, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">THE COURT: All right. So in point of fact then, you took someone else\u2019s compilation of financial information, put it in a different format and represented that it had been done by Mr. Henderson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">on behalf of you and your school, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 35-37. The court then made the following findings in regard to Bland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">I find that you are aware of the consequences of the plea and that there is a factual basis for the tendered plea and that\u2019s based both on the testimony of Mr. Blissman and your allocution to the ... elements of the offense. I find that ... because there is a factual basis for the plea and that you knew what you were doing here, that your plea of guilty to Count One should be accepted and I, therefore, accept your plea of guilty to Count One.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Immediately following the acceptance of Bland\u2019s plea, the court asked the government if Bland would \u201chave any licensure issues [with respect to the operation of ASIC] now that she\u2019s tendered a plea of guilty to a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. The government responded, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what effect \u2014 I\u2019m not aware of anything.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. The court then addressed the question to Bland\u2019s attorney who answered, \u201cWell, certainly there could be some fallout from a guilty plea\u201d but it is \u201cnot automatic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There was no further discussion on the issue and the hearing concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) was prepared on November 9, 2006. It listed Bland\u2019s offense as a \u201cClass D Felony\u201d with a corresponding penalty of \u201c5 years/$250,000.\u201d J.A. 117. The PSR indicated that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d), the base offense level for a violation of \u00a7 1097(a) was 6. The PSR suggested that the offense level be increased by 6 levels in this case based upon the estimated $48, 710 to $69,520 intended loss range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Bland\u2019s fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The PSR also recommended that Bland be given a 2-level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. section 3El.l(a) for Acceptance of Responsibility. Though Bland filed four written objections to the PSR, she made no objection to the PSR\u2019s classification of the offense as a Class D Felony, the listed maximum statutory penalties, or the estimated intended loss range.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In her sentencing memorandum filed December 1, 2006, Bland asserted for the first time that because her attempted fraud was unsuccessful and procured no funds, she should be sentenced under the \u201cmisdemeanor exception\u201d of \u00a7 1097(a). As will be discussed more fully below, the \u201cmisdemeanor exception\u201d limits the punishment for certain violations of \u00a7 1097(a) to a fine of no more than $5000 and a term of imprisonment not to exceed one year. At the sentencing hearing on January 3, 2007, the district court rejected Bland\u2019s argument, finding that the government\u2019s contention that unsuccessful attempts at procuring funds illegally are not covered by the exception \u201cma[de] the most sense.\u201d J.A. 79. The court further found that \u201cunder 20 U.S.C. Section 1097(a), this is not a misdemeanor offense. This is a felony offense. Moreover, I find as a fact that that is exactly what Ms. Bland knew when she pled guilty to the offense back in September of 2006.\u201d J.A. 79-80. Therefore the court concluded that it \u201cw[ould] not sentence her as a misdemeanant,\u201d but \u201cw[ould] sentence her pursuant to the felony provisions of the statute.\u201d J.A. 80. Then, based on the intended loss range in the PSR, Bland was sentenced, as a felon, to two years\u2019 probation with the first six months in home detention-the bottom of the Guideline range. Bland filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">On appeal, Bland challenges neither her conviction under \u00a7 1097(a), nor the factual basis supporting the conviction, nor \u201cthe actual term of her sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. Instead, she assigns error solely to the district court\u2019s decision to sentence her as a felon rather than as a misdemeanant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Section 1097(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">Any person who knowingly and willfully embezzles, misapplies, steals, obtains by fraud, false statement, or forgery, or fails to refund any funds, assets, or property provided or insured under this subchapter and part C of subchapter I of chapter 34 of Title 42 or attempts to so embezzle, misapply, steal, obtain by fraud, false statement or forgery, or fail to refund any funds, assets, or property, shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both, <em>except if the amount so embezzled, misapplied, stolen, obtained by fraud, false statement, or forgery, or failed to be refunded does not exceed $200, then the fine shall not be more than $5,000 and imprisonment shall not exceed one year, or both.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1097(a) (emphasis added). Because the final clause of \u00a7 1097, emphasized above, limits the imprisonment term to one year for any crime falling within its parameters, it has been characterized as the \u201cmisdemeanor exception.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (classifying any crime for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>which the maximum term of imprisonment exceeds one year as a felony, and any crime for which the maximum term authorized is limited to one year or less as a misdemeanor.).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Bland argues that the plain language of the statute requires that she be sentenced under this exception \u201cbecause [her] unper-fected fraud procured zero dollars.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. That is, because \u201cthe amount\u201d she \u201cobtained by fraud ... d[id] not exceed $200,\u201d she was guilty only of a misdemeanor violation of \u00a7 1097(a). The government, however, contends that the same language unambiguously renders the misdemeanor exception inapplicable to Bland\u2019s attempted crime, because \u201c[b]y its terms, it only applies when a person, <em>who actually receives funds, </em>receives less than $200.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 8. Both Bland and the government\u2019s \u201cplain language\u201d interpretations lead to somewhat anomalous results. Under Bland\u2019s theory, every attempted fraud, no matter the intended loss amount, could only be punished as a misdemeanor. Conversely, under the government\u2019s interpretation, every unsuccessful attempt would be considered a felony and could be punished with a maximum five-year prison term, even when a successful attempt involving the same or lesser amount of money, so long as less than $200, would be considered a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Although the applicability of the misdemeanor exception to an attempted crime under \u00a7 1097(a) appears to be an issue of first impression for this court, as well as for the other circuit courts of appeal, we need not resolve the issue here, because we find, consonant with the district court, that Bland pleaded guilty to a felony and that there exists a sufficient factual basis to support her plea. Notwithstanding Bland\u2019s post hoc contention that she \u201cdid not specifically agree to a felony plea,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2, the record plainly indicates that she did in fact plead guilty to a felony and was aware of such both when she signed the plea agreement and when she entered her plea in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">As the district court pointed out during Bland\u2019s sentencing hearing, \u201c[fit\u2019s very clear from the provisions of the plea agreement\u201d that the parties contemplated a felony plea. J.A. 74. First, the plea agreement provides that \u201c[t]he maximum statutory penalties to which Ms. Bland will be exposed by virtue of her plea of guilty\u201d are five-years\u2019 imprisonment; \u201ca fine of up to $250,000\u201d; \u201cup to three (3) years of supervised release\u201d; and \u201ca special assessment of $100.00.\u201d J.A. 11-12. Bland acknowledges, as she must, that these are the maximum penalties for a <em>felony </em>charge under \u00a7 1097(a). If Bland were agreeing to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, \u201cthe maximum statutory penalties to which [she] w[ould] [have] be[en] exposed,\u201d J.A. 11, were one year in prison and a fine of up to five thousand dollars. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1097(a). Further, if Bland had been pleading to a misdemeanor, she would have only owed, and presumably only paid, a maximum special assessment fee of twenty-five dollars. <em>Id. </em>Instead, she was assessed, and paid on the date of her sentencing hearing, a fee of one hundred dollars, which is charged only to individuals convicted of a <em>felony offense. See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(a) (providing that any individual convicted of an offense against the United States be charged an amount from \u201c$5 to $25\u201d \u201cin the case of an infraction or a misdemean- or\u201d and \u201c$100 in the case of a felony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The PSR also alerted Bland to the fact that she had pleaded guilty to a felony by, again, listing the felony penalties as those to which she would be subject, and by describing Bland\u2019s offense as a <em>\u201cClass D </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>Felony.\u201d </em>J.A. 117. Notably, although Bland made four objections to the PSR, she did not dispute the statutory m\u00e1xi-mums or the classification of her offense as a felony. <em>See </em>J.A. 142-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The plea colloquy further demonstrates that Bland intended to and understood that she was pleading guilty to a felony offense. In fact, when this issue was raised at Bland\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court stated to Bland\u2019s counsel, \u201cI will be candid with you ... I was quite surprised to see that, particularly since I handled the plea hearing[,] that you and Ms. Bland thought she was pleading to a misdemean- or.\u201d JA. 68. The court\u2019s bewilderment is understandable. At the plea hearing, after having the government summarize the terms of the plea agreement, including those discussed above that plainly indicate that the parties negotiated a felony plea, the court explained in detail each maximum penalty for a <em>felony </em>violation of \u00a7 1097(a) and asked Bland whether she understood that she would be exposed to such penalties. At no time during this extended colloquy did Bland\u2019s counsel interject or object; nor did Bland express any consternation or confusion. Rather, she simply indicated her understanding, responding, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Plea Hr\u2019g Tr. 19-20. Significantly, during this conversation the court specifically mentioned the word \u201cfelony,\u201d asking Bland whether she understood that there was \u201ca one hundred dollar mandatory special assessment that has to be paid for the <em>felony </em>conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20 (emphasis added). Again, Bland responded, \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The classification of Bland\u2019s offense was also a key part of a later exchange between the court and Bland\u2019s counsel, when, after accepting Bland\u2019s plea, the court asked whether Bland would \u201chave any licensure issues now that she\u2019s tendered a plea of guilty to a <em>felony.\u201d Id. </em>at 39 (emphasis added). Again, there was no expression of shock, hesitation, or mention of a misdemeanor charge. Instead, Bland\u2019s counsel simply answered the question and the hearing concluded without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">These exchanges, combined with the contents of the plea agreement, led the district court to find that Bland had pleaded guilty to \u00e1 felony offense and to further \u201cfind as a fact\u201d that she knew \u201cexactly\u201d that at the time she entered the plea. We find no error in these findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Having determined that Bland pleaded guilty to a felony charge under \u00a7 1097(a), the only remaining issue is whether her plea was supported by a sufficient factual basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under Rule 11(b)(3), \u201c[bjefore entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). The district court in this case made such a finding, which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 531 (4th Cir.2002). We cannot find error \u201cso long as the district court could reasonably have determined that there was a sufficient factual basis based on the record before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mastrapa, </em>509 F.3d 652, 660 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Bland was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, knowingly and willfully attempting to obtain federal funds by fraud, false statement, and forgery. J.A. 6; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u00a7 1097(a). Blissman, the DOE investigator, testified that through examination of the fraudulent documents, Bland\u2019s own admission, and talking with Bland\u2019s accountant, he learned that Bland created a fraudulent audited financial statement, copied it on a fabricated letterhead, forged the accountant\u2019s signature, and submitted the statement to the DOE in an attempt to procure Title IV funds for her institution and its students. Bland fully corroborated this testimony. If successful, the district court found, Bland\u2019s fraud and forgery would have swindled the government out of approximately $50,000. With this record before it, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding a sufficient factual basis for Bland\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Because Bland pleaded guilty to a felony offense under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1097(a), and there existed a sufficient factual basis to support that plea, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-5\">. A compilation report is a collection of financial statements created solely from the representations of management, with no audit or independent review of the reported figures. A compilation report does not conform to Government Auditing Standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">. The Guidelines require calculation of the loss at issue in each specific case, which is the greater of the intended loss and the actual loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. Cmt. n. 3(A). Section 2B 1.1 (b)(1) sets out the offense-level increases corresponding to various ranges of loss amounts. The estimated intended loss figures in this case were predicated upon Title IV eligibility percentages and grant and loan amounts from similar institutions in the state of West Virginia and schools with similar student populations in the Fairmont area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\">. Because we conclude that Bland pleaded guilty to a felony and therefore need not reach the statutory interpretation issue, we likewise have no need to resolve her subsidiary arguments regarding the proper calculation of the intended loss of her unperfected fraud and the application of the rule of lenity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-13\">. Although Bland does not explicitly challenge the district court\u2019s finding of a sufficient factual basis for the plea, we proceed prudentially and construe her argument as including such a challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
