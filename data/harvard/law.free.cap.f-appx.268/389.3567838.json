BUNNING, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">This appeal arises out of litigation between Kevin King and Steven Gowdy. Plaintiffs counsel, Daniel E. Manville, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs motion for taxable costs and Plaintiffs motion for costs and related expenses. For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for reasons discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b413-21\">In 2002, Plaintiff-Appellant Kevin King, a prisoner in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC), filed a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which alleged that Defendant-Ap-pellee Steven Gowdy retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment right to file grievances. J.A. at 18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Plaintiff filed this lawsuit <em>pro se, </em>Daniel E. Manville was appointed as counsel by the district court. The jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff, awarding him $416.00 in compensatory damages and $2,080.00 in punitive damages for a total of $2,496.00. J.A. at 31-33. On January 4, 2006, the $2,496.00 jury award was paid to Plaintiff. In addition, $3,744.00, which amounts to 150% of the judgment, was paid to Plaintiffs counsel as attorney fees pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-22\">Post-verdict, Plaintiff filed a motion for costs and related expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, requesting that the district court enter an order granting costs and expenses in the amount of $5,593.44. J.A. at 34-41. Manville\u2019s motion provided the following itemized list of costs and expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>1.

Depositions: $2,033.38 TOTAL: $5,593.49</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-22\">J.A. at 41.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff also filed a motion for taxable costs pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) in the amount of $659.57, representing the costs of the filing fee and the mileage and attendance of the court reporter at depositions. J.A. at 47-51. In response, Defendant argued that the expenses Plaintiff seeks relating to his attorney\u2019s travel, attorney\u2019s meals for depositions and trial, parking, telephone, postage, photocopying, and Graphic copying are not reimbursable as \u2018costs\u2019 pursuant to Rule 54, E.D. Mich. L.R. 54.1, or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 but, rather, are included as a component of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 attorney fees. J.A. at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-25\">A hearing concerning Plaintiffs motions was held on July 26, 2006. J.A. at 75-83. On August 4, the district court issued an order which granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs motion for taxable costs and Plaintiffs motion for costs and related expenses. J.A. at 74. Rather than explicitly setting forth its reasoning, the district court\u2019s order stated that its conclusion was based on \u201cthe reasons stated on the record, and in accordance with the terms stated on the record.\u201d J.A. at 74. The hearing transcript indicates that the district court found that recovery of the at-issue expenses was limited by the PLRA\u2019s 150% monetary judgment cap. J.A. at 78. The district court did find that Plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs in the amount of $622.64 ($150.00 for Plaintiffs filing fee and $472.64 for trial subpoenas). J.A. at 83. Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal of the partial denial of Plaintiffs request for related expenses. J.A. at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-26\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b414-27\">Pursuant to Rule 54(d)(1), \u201c[ujnless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs \u2014 other than attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 should be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d Costs recoverable under Rule 54(d) are specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. <em>Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gib</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>bons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 441-42, 107 S.Ct. 2494, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987) (\u201cSection 1920 enumerates expenses that a federal court may tax as a cost under the discretionary authority found in Rule 54(d).\u201d). Section 1920 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">A judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">(1) Fees of the clerk and marshal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">(2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">(3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">(4) Fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">(5) Docket fees under section 1923 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">(6) Compensation of court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation services under section 1828 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">In awarding costs, the district court looks at whether the expense is an allowable cost item under the statute and, if so, that the amount is reasonable and necessary. <em>BDT Products, Inc. v. Lexmark Intern., Inc., </em>405 F.3d 415, 417 (6th Cir.2005). District courts may not award costs not authorized by the statute. <em>Crawford Fitting, </em>482 U.S. at 441, 107 S.Ct. 2494.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">The district court is in a unique position to assess which costs were necessarily incurred in this case. Based on the current record, we are unable to determine whether the requested items were reasonably necessary and, thus, recoverable. Therefore, on remand, the district court shall determine which costs are recoverable under \u00a7 1920 and which are not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For example, copying expenses are taxable as costs pursuant to \u00a7 1920 if \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(4). The district court should make a determination as to whether or not the photocopying in this case satisfies this requirement. The graphic copying expenses sought by Plaintiff should be analyzed in a similar fashion. However, without more information as to what this graphic copying entailed, this Court lacks sufficient information to review the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">Deposition expenses are generally taxed as costs under \u00a7 1920. <em>Sales v. Marshall, </em>873 F.2d 115, 120 (6th Cir.1989) (\u201c[S]ub-sections (2) and (4) of \u00a7 1920 have been interpreted to authorize taxing as costs the expenses of taking, transcribing and reproducing depositions.\u201d). However, this Court lacks the information required to assess whether these depositions were necessary and exactly what types of costs associated with the depositions are being requested. Similarly, the recovery of travel and subsistence expenses will turn on factors such as whether the costs were incurred by the attorney or for a witness. <em>See id. </em>at 122 (\u201cFederal courts may secure payment of expenses incurred by a non-party witness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(c)(4), which provides that \u2018[a]ll normal travel expenses\u2019 of a witness \u2018shall be taxable as costs pursuant to section 1920 of this title.\u2019 This provision does not relate to travel expenses of parties.\u201d); <em>Calderon v. Witvoet, </em>112 F.3d 275, 276 (7th Cir.1997) (holding that outlays for travel and related expenses by attorneys and paralegals may not be reimbursed as costs, as they are not listed in \u00a7 1920). Other items, such as telephone and postage expenses, are not taxable as costs pursuant to \u00a7 1920. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Northcross v. Bd. of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, </em>611 F.2d 624, 639 (6th Cir.1979) (concluding that telephone expenses are not recoverable pursuant to \u00a7 1920); <em>Duckworth v. Whisenant, </em>97 F.3d 1393, 1399 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that postage expenses are \u201cclearly nonrecoverable\u201d under \u00a7 1920). On remand, the district court should examine each requested expense in accordance with this opinion, applicable case law, and the dictates of \u00a7 1920.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the judgment of the district court arid REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-23\">. The Complaint specifies that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for filing grievances against him and for assisting others in filing grievances against him. J.A. at 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-23\">. Plaintiff recognized that, if the cost of the filing fee and costs related to the attendance and mileage of the court reporter for depositions were granted by way of Plaintiff's motion to tax costs, the total would be reduced by these amounts. J.A. at 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-15\">. Although Plaintiff moved for recovery of the at-issue expenses pursuant to \u00a7 1988, the Court finds that the requested items are arguably recoverable pursuant to \u00a7 1920.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b416-16\">. Plaintiff has moved for the recovery of the at-issue expenses under \u00a7 1988, arguing that \u00a7 1988 expenses are not included as a component of attorney fees for purposes of the PLRA\u2019s 150% monetary judgment cap. However, in light of the remand to the district court for a determination of whether the at-issue expenses can be taxed as costs pursuant to \u00a7 1920, we will leave this issue for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
