Gates, McDonald and Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). \u201c[T]o establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: (1) she participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court has held that Title VII does not protect against all retaliation, but only retaliation that results in an injury or harm. <em>Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2414, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). In discussing the second prong of a <em>prima facie </em>retaliation case, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2415 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">Contrary to Byrd\u2019s assertion, her new job description in the CUPA survey was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>not a demotion because she remained Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs after her CUPA job description changed. Additionally, the reclassification was not a retaliatory action against Byrd, but was based on the fact that the university discovered that it had been misreporting a number of individuals\u2019 positions, including Byrd\u2019s, and corrected the ei'ror by accurately reporting salaries and job titles to the survey. As such, a reasonable employee would not have found the reclassification materially adverse or been dissuaded from making or supporting a charge of discrimination, as Byrd maintained her position as Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and continued to receive raises, including one of over eight percent in 2005-2006. <em>See Burlington Northern, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2415.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">As to Byrd\u2019s other claims of retaliation, she has also failed to establish an adverse employment action. She was rated \u201ccommendable\u201d on her performance evaluation and received an 8.6% raise, and a reasonable employee would not have found this performance evaluation materially adverse or have been dissuaded from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. As to the letter from Vice Chancellor for Financial and Administrative Services Jac-quilyn P. Roberts on overspent scholarship accounts and the e-mail from Vice Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs Roger Ritvo regarding the staff classification and compensation study, these criticisms of Byrd\u2019s job performance did not have any adverse impact on Byrd\u2019s employment, which is evidenced by the fact that she continued to receive raises. Further, Ritvo\u2019s instruction that she must consult with him about her employee\u2019s salary issues before going to other departments within the university, the misassignment of two student discipline cases, and being inadvertently left off of an e-mail are the ordinary tribulations of the workplace and petty slights that are not actionable. <em>See Burlington Northern, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2415 (\u201cAn employee\u2019s decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Viewing the facts in Byrd\u2019s favor, she failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation because the evidence does not support a finding that she suffered an adverse employment action. Thus, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of AUM.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-12\">. CUPA is the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources. AUM participates in CUPA, which is a compensation survey for colleges and universities, showing how an institution\u2019s salaries compare to those of comparator institutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-13\">. As an initial matter, AUM argues that Byrd's claim is not properly before us as she advanced the claim for the first time in response to AUM\u2019s summary judgment motion. However, the district court addressed the issue involving Byrd's CUPA reclassification despite that the issue was impermissibly asserted for the first time in her response to AUM\u2019s summary judgment motion. Thus, we will address this issue because the district court addressed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
