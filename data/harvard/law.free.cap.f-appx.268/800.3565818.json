MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b824-21\">Pro se plaintiff Rojelio Barron, a Kansas inmate, appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-22\">Barron complains that his little finger was broken when his hand was caught in the van door during a transport between the county jail and the courthouse. He claims that during the five hours he waited to appear before a judge, he was in severe pain. According to Barron, when he was returned to the jail, he had to make several requests before he received any medical treatment, and the pain medication he eventually received was inadequate. He asserts that he cannot bend his finger without pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Barron filed suit asserting that jail personnel were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. The district court granted Barron\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis. The court then evaluated his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), and dismissed it for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of an in forma pauperis complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim. <em>Kay v. Bemis, </em>500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir.2007). \u201c \u2018Factual allegations [in a complaint] must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218 (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). In reviewing the complaint, we accept as true the plaintiffs allegations and construe them, and any reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 1217. \u201cIn addition, we must construe a pro se appellant\u2019s complaint liberally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Barron was a pretrial detainee at the time his claims arose. \u201cPretrial detainees are protected under the Due Process Clause rather than the Eighth Amendment, [and] this Court applies an analysis identical to that applied in Eighth Amendment cases brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Olsen v. Layton Hills Mall, </em>312 F.3d 1304, 1315 (10th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). \u201cA prison official\u2019s deliberate indifference to an inmate\u2019s serious medical needs is a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Mata v. Saiz, </em>427 F.3d 745, 751 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). \u201c \u2018Deliberate indifference\u2019 involves both an objective and a subjective component.\u201d <em>Sealock v. Colo., </em>218 F.3d 1205, 1209 (10th Cir.2000). For the objective component, a \u201cprisoner must first produce objective evidence that the deprivation at issue was in fact \u2018sufficiently serious.\u2019\u201d <em>Mata, </em>427 F.3d at 751 (quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). The subjective component requires \u201cevidence of the prison official\u2019s culpable state of mind,\u201d which may be fulfilled by showing that the official \u201c[knew] of and disregarded] an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and she must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">Barron claims that he was in pain for five hours while awaiting his court appearance and that he did not thereafter receive adequate pain medication. He contends that jail personnel neglected his suffering. In addition, he sustained a broken little finger which he asserts continues to cause him pain when he moves it.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">Barron\u2019s factual allegations do not meet the test\u2019s subjective component. As the district court observed, Barron \u201ccited no swelling, discoloration, bleeding, or [visible] broken bones that would make his injury as one obviously needing immediate medical care.\u201d R. Doc. 6, at 2. On appeal, Barron does not challenge this observation. Moreover, his claims of neglect\u2014 that jail personnel neglected his suffering and failed to take him to the infirmary\u2014 are insufficient. Accordingly, we conclude that the complaint does not state a claim that the jail officials knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his health or safety. Because the subjective component fails, Barron\u2019s deliberate-indifference claim was properly dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>The district court granted Barron leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, but he is reminded that he is obligated to make partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in full. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
