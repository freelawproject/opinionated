R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b676-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In May 1999, a California state court jury convicted Juan Heredia Monarrez of attempted premeditated murder of Jesus Beltran, street terrorism, and two firearms violations. Monarrez appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Monarrez argues that his constitutional right to due process was violated by a police detective\u2019s testimony at trial regarding Monarrez\u2019s tattoo of a man holding a gun, and the gang-related significance of that tattoo. Monarrez argues that admission of this evidence raised a real risk that he was convicted for his lifestyle, and not for the crimes with which he was actually charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a federal habeas court must defer to a state court\u2019s resolution of a prisoner\u2019s constitutional claims unless the state court\u2019s decision is contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). Because the state courts did not address this due process claim, we must \u201cperform an \u2018independent review of the record\u2019 to ascertain whether the state court decision was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Himes v. Thompson, </em>336 F.3d 848, 853 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Admission of evidence at trial violates due process only when it \u201cis so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair,\u201d <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 825, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), and \u201cviolates those fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions, and which define the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d <em>Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 353, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">In this case, the evidence of gang membership was relevant to establishing a material issue of the case, namely Monarrez\u2019s motive for committing the crime. <em>See Dawson v. Delaware, </em>503 U.S. 159, 165, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309 (1992); <em>United States v. Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 52-55, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984). Because the trial court\u2019s admission of this relevant evidence is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent, it was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">Monarrez relies on <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), but that case does not assist him. Unlike the defendant in <em>Old Chief, </em>Monarrez has not shown that there was equally probative information that the prosecution could have relied on in lieu of his tattoo. Moreover, <em>Old Chief </em>concerns Federal Rule of Evidence 403 balancing, not the violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">Monarrez also raises two uncertified issues in his appeal. He claims his due process rights were violated by the admission of (1) evidence that he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>chrome handgun similar to the gun involved in the crime the day before the shooting, and (2) evidence that Mexican Mafia graffiti was etched in the wood outside the courtroom. This admitted evidence was relevant: the gun evidence was probative of Monarrez\u2019s identity as the shooter, and the graffiti evidence was relevant to prove the state of mind of a witness who recanted earlier statements inculpating Monarrez. Because Monarrez has not shown that the admission of this evidence \u201cis so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair,\u201d <em>Payne, </em>501 U.S. at 825, 111 S.Ct. 2597, he has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We therefore decline to expand the certificate. <em>See Solis v. Garcia, </em>219 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
