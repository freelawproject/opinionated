The district court sentenced him to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. Valdez appealed, and this court ordered a limited remand for clarification. The district court issued a written order and an amended judgment, which Valdez again appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b318-21\">In 2004, the United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>(ICE) received information that Valdez\u2019s co-defendant, Armando Nolasco, was trafficking narcotics from Mexico to San Antonio and Dallas, Texas. ICE initiated a court-authorized wire interception of No-lasco\u2019s cellular telephone, during which ICE learned Nolasco was arranging for a then-unknown individual, Valdez, to carry methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Based on the telephone calls, ICE determined that Nolasco planned to meet Valdez in the parking lot of the Incarnate Word University in San Antonio. While surveilling the meeting, ICE observed No-laseo deliver to Valdez a bag that ICE assumed contained narcotics. As Valdez left the scene, ICE notified the San Antonio Police Department to develop probable cause for a traffic stop. During the stop, Valdez permitted the officers to search his vehicle. The officers found the bag, which contained nearly seven kilograms of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Valdez and eight co-defendants were charged with trafficking in methamphetamine. Valdez pleaded guilty to one of the two counts against him. Valdez admitted he knew Nolasco through their telephone calls, and that a \u201crich guy\u201d at a party in Piedras Negras, Mexico had recruited Valdez. Valdez anticipated this would be a one-time transaction, for which he would be paid a few thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The probation office determined that the weight and purity of the narcotics found in Valdez\u2019s vehicle resulted in a base offense level of 38 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The probation officer reduced the offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and by three levels for acceptance of responsibility. With an offense level of 33, Valdez\u2019s presentence report recommended a sentence range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">At sentencing, Valdez requested a sentence below the advisory range, citing <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court said the plea agreement demonstrated that Valdez had played a minor role, which would have reduced Valdez\u2019s offense level to 27, with a range of 70 to 85 months\u2019 imprisonment. Citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court declined to sentence Valdez within the adjusted range of 70 to 85 months\u2019 imprisonment. Instead, the district court sentenced Valdez to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. Valdez appealed, and this court granted a limited remand requiring the district court to clarify its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Valdez originally argued that the district judge was unclear whether the sentence was a non-Guidelines or Guidelines sentence. We note at the outset that, on limited remand, the district court stated it intended a non-Guidelines sentence. We review all sentences under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, we must ensure the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the Guidelines range, then we must review for substantive reasonableness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">We begin by examining whether the district court committed significant procedural errors; specifically in this case, we must determine whether the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>court improperly calculated the applicable Guidelines range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the original sentencing, Valdez requested a minor-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), which requires a two-level downward adjustment if the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a reduction would trigger a further downward adjustment under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">At the original sentencing, the district court \u201cf[ound] that the defendant played a minor role\u201d and granted him one two-level downward adjustment. The district court then stated \u201cif I traditionally followed the sentencing Guidelines,\u201d Valdez would receive a series of adjustments \u201cresulting] in a recommended sentencing guideline of 70 to 87 months. That is not appropriate in this case.\u201d On limited remand, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\"><em>Post-Booker </em>this Court is still required to determine a properly calculated Guideline sentence. As stated above, the Court found Valdez\u2019s criminal history category at I and his total offense level at 33. The Court, however, elected to exercise its discretion to give a non-Guideline sentence (as requested by Defendant\u2019s counsel) after considering other ranges that could apply to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">During the sentencing hearing the Court was aware that if it granted a minor role adjustment, a total offense level of 27 would be the result. The Court determined that a sentence in that range would not be appropriate because the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">Defendant did not care as to what contraband he was conspiring to traffic in, and he expected to receive [ ] substantial remuneration for his efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">The Court also concluded that a sentence at a total offense level of 33 was not appropriate because of \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the fact that Valdez played a minor role in these transactions. Accordingly, the Court pronounced a sentence at a total offense level of 31 and ordered Defendant to be imprisoned for a term of 108 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">At the original sentencing, it appeared the district court had merged its Guidelines calculation with its individualized assessment \u2014 essentially calculating the Guidelines range and rejecting it per \u00a7 3553(a) in one step. Now, we conclude the judge has improperly calculated the Guidelines range. On remand, the district judge again stated \u201cthe Court was aware that <em>if </em>it granted a minor role adjustment, a total offense level of 27 <em>would be </em>the result.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the district judge previously <em>found </em>Valdez had a minor role that merited the downward adjustment, therefore the total offense level <em>was </em>27 \u2014 not 33, as the district judge found on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">While a district court\u2019s error in applying the Guidelines ordinarily requires this court to vacate the sentence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we conclude, based on the record\u2019s entirety, that the district court\u2019s miscalculation was harmless and did not affect the selection of the sentence imposed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cIf a district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>imposes a non-Guideline sentence, and the sentence did not \u2018result from\u2019 any error in applying the Guidelines or calculating the advisory range,\u201d we need not vacate the sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In this case, the district court was aware of the correct Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district judge concluded that such a sentence \u201c[wa]s not appropriate in this case.\u201d We find it improbable that the district judge would have imposed a different sentence had he explicitly stated that this range <em>was </em>the correct Guidelines range, as opposed to one of \u201cother ranges that could apply to the Defendant,\u201d as the district judge wrote.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We now must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence using an abuse-of-discretion standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court imposed a non-Guidelines sentence because \u201cthe Defendant did not care as to what contraband he was conspiring to traffic in, and he expected to receive [ ] substantial remuneration for his efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Valdez first argues the district judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the type of contraband was unreasonable because the facts show Valdez knew he was trafficking \u201ccrystal meth,\u201d though he did not know its purity. Moreover, Valdez argues the court\u2019s \u201cminor role\u201d finding included an \u201cimplicit [finding] that he did not know about the quality of the drug he carried.\u201d Specifically, Valdez notes that the Guidelines\u2019 commentary makes clear that purity-based departures are \u201cprobative of the defendant\u2019s role or position.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Additionally, Valdez argues the Guidelines already make a purity-based distinction in setting the defendant\u2019s base offense level. Therefore, he argues the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">As a general matter, \u201ccourts may vary [from Guidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus like the holding in <em>Kimbrough v. United States </em>that a district court can disagree with the 100-to-l erack-to-cocaine sentencing ratio,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the district judge can disagree with the Guidelines\u2019 policy that purity is indicative of role or that purity is adequately provided for in Valdez\u2019s base level.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">Next, Valdez argues that the district judge\u2019s conclusion that Valdez\u2019s payment expectations merited a non-Guidelines sentence is unreasonable. The record clearly establishes that Valdez believed he would receive a substantial cash payment for the transaction. Since the record establishes Valdez\u2019s belief, we defer to the district court to impose a sentence based upon that fact. As the Supreme Court recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG6\">The sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) in the individual case. The judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record. The sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>before him than the Commission or the appeals court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"># * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">While the district judge erred in calculating the applicable Guidelines range, the miscalculation was harmless. Finding no abuse of discretion, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
