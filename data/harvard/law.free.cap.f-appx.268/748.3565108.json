The motion is filed pursuant to <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc). In response, defendant concedes that the government\u2019s motion is well taken, and that the appeal should be dismissed, because the appeal falls within the scope of the appeal waiver, defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights, and enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See id. </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-22\">Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b772-24\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
