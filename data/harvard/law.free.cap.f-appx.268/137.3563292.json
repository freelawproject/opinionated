Sept. 30, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Yang\u2019s untimely motion to reopening after finding that she failed to demonstrate that changed country conditions qualify her for an exception to the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). It is well-established that the birth of children in the United States constitutes a change in personal circumstances rather than a change country conditions. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the birth of the petitioner\u2019s two children in this country was evidence of changed personal circumstances, rather than of changed conditions in China); <em>Jian Huan Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">Yang\u2019s further argument that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006), and the evidence at issue in that case, support a finding of changed country conditions in China is unavailing. The BIA has since assessed the <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>documents and determined that such evidence did not demonstrate that Chinese nationals would be persecuted for having two U.S.-born children. <em>Matter of S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 247, 258-59 (BIA 2007) appeal docketed No. 07-3415 (2d Cir. Aug 9, 2007). Moreover, this Court will not remand a case to the agency with an instruction to consider evidence that was not in the record at the administrative level. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 261 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The outstanding motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is GRANTED. As we have completed our review, Yang\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
