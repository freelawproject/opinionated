We hold that the IJ abused its discretion in failing to balance all relevant factors in favor of and against granting asylum and therefore VACATE the judgment of the BIA and REMAND for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b548-20\">Worku is a native and citizen of Ethiopia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She is of Oromo ethnicity and while in Ethiopia belonged to the OLF, a political organization which defends the rights of and works to establish an independent nation for the Oromo people. Security agents arrested Worku several times because of her work for the OLF. After learning from her family that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>would be arrested and killed if security-agents found Worku, she fled the country and entered the United States using a fake passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On May 29, 2001, Worku filed her request for asylum with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d). The INS served Worku with a Notice to Appear. Worku petitioned the IJ for asylum, withholding from removal, and for relief under CAT. After a hearing lasting several days, the IJ held Worku ineligible for asylum as a matter of discretion. The IJ also denied Worku relief under CAT but granted her withholding from removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s judgment without opinion, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as it would that of the BIA. <em>Gulla v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 911, 915 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Mamouzian v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 1129 (9th Cir.2004). We review the Attorney General\u2019s decision to grant or deny asylum to an eligible applicant for abuse of discretion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D); <em>Gulla, </em>498 F.3d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who has applied for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158; <em>Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1137 (9th Cir. 2004). The grant of asylum is a two-step process: First, the applicant must establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating that she meets the statutory definition of a \u201crefugee,\u201d and second, the applicant must show entitlement to asylum as a matter of discretion. <em>Kalubi, </em>364 F.3d at 1137. The IJ may deny asylum as a matter of discretion notwithstanding the IJ\u2019s determination that the applicant is statutorily eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">This Court has repeatedly held that in exercising its discretion the IJ <em>must </em>consider and weigh all relevant favorable and adverse factors. <em>Kalubi, </em>364 F.3d at 1139; <em>Mamouzian, </em>390 F.3d at 1138 (reversing IJ discretionary denial of asylum because the IJ failed to balance all favorable and adverse factors). Conclusory statements simply denying asylum as a matter of discretion are inappropriate, \u201cthe IJ must explain sufficiently how each factor figures in the balance so the court can determine that the factor has been heard, considered, and decided.\u201d <em>Gulla, </em>498 F.3d at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">While there is no definitive list of factors which the IJ must consider, this Court has held that the IJ should consider the context in which the applicant sought asylum, evidence of past persecution, and humanitarian reasons for granting asylum. <em>See Gulla, </em>498 F.3d at 919 (holding that the IJ should have considered the fact that the applicant had been beaten and tortured before entering the United States, and that if ordered to return to Iraq, the applicant testified he would instead seek a way to end his life rather than face the torture and death which awaited him in Iraq); <em>Rodriguez-Matamoros v. INS, </em>86 F.3d 158, 161 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201c[Humanitarian reasons may also influence the favorable exercise of discretion in some cases.\u201d); <em>Kalubi, </em>364 F.3d at 1139 (holding that the applicant\u2019s mere membership in SNIP, a terrorist organization, insufficient to render him statutorily ineligible for refugee status, but relevant to the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Here, in denying asylum as a matter of discretion, the IJ considered <em>one </em>factor \u2014 -the OLF\u2019s suspected use of landmines, which according to the State Department\u2019s Report caused civilian deaths <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The IJ did not give any consideration whatsoever to other relevant factors such as Worku\u2019s past persecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the IJ abused its discretion in denying Worku asylum because the IJ did not properly consider all relevant factors weighing in favor of and against granting asylum. <em>See Gulla </em>498 F.3d at 919 (determining the IJ abused its discretion in failing to balance all factors in favor of a discretionary grant of asylum against those factors which weighed against a discretionary grant); <em>Mamouzian, </em>390 F.3d at 1138 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Because we determine that the IJ abused its discretion in failing to balance all relevant factors, we VACATE the judgment of the BIA and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b548-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-13\">. In its opposition papers, the Government argued that Worku failed to raise an objection to the IJ\u2019s discretionary ruling in her opening brief and therefore waived the right to appeal the issue. At oral argument, however, the Government conceded that Worku raised this issue. We agree. The issue therefore is properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-22\">. Because the IJ found Worku credible, we accept as true the testimony given by Worku at the immigration hearing. <em>Mamouzian v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 1129, 1133 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\">. Worku does not challenge the IJ\u2019s ruling denying her relief under CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. While the report may contain relevant and helpful information about the OLF's activities, it is not conclusive. Indeed, the IJ\u2019s reliance on the report is puzzling because the IJ expressed concerns about the report\u2019s usefulness at the hearing. Furthermore, Worku testified that she did not know of or participate in the OLF\u2019s alleged use of landmines and the IJ found her credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">. Because Worku was granted withholding of removal, future persecution was irrelevant to the IJ's inquiry. <em>Kalubi, </em>364 F.3d at 1141.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b550-6\">BEA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3k\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Because the IJ\u2019s decision \u2014 read as a whole \u2014 demonstrates he considered all relevant factors before making his discretionary decision to deny Worku\u2019s asylum claim, I respectfully dissent. The majority states the \u201cIJ did not give any consideration whatsoever to other relevant factors such as Worku\u2019s past persecution.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Not so. The IJ discussed Worku\u2019s past persecution at length in his opinion, concluding Worku had credibly established both that she had been the subject of past persecution, and she had a well-founded fear of future persecution. Based on this conclusion, the IJ found Worku statutorily eligible for asylum. The IJ further found Worku eligible for withholding of removal, because it appeared \u201crather clear, in fact, overwhelming from reading the State Department report, that an OLF member, once detected, would be incarcerated and mistreated.\u201d Thus, the IJ not only considered Worku\u2019s testimony regarding her past persecution, but he also gave it sufficient weight to merit a determination she was statutory eligible for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Despite this evidence of past and likely future persecution, however, the IJ denied Worku\u2019s asylum claim as a matter of discretion due to her membership in the OLF \u2014 and organization that, according to the State Department Country Report, has killed innocent civilians through its use of land mines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Worku\u2019s membership in this organization did not render her statutorily ineligible for asylum, the IJ properly considered Worku\u2019s involvement in the OLF as a relevant factor in his discretionary asylum determination. <em>See Kalubi, </em>364 F.3d at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Notwithstanding the IJ\u2019s extensive discussion of Worku\u2019s past persecution, the majority appears to fault the IJ for not explicitly incorporating this discussion into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the portion of his opinion in which he denied Worku\u2019s asylum claim as a matter of discretion. Under this court\u2019s precedent, the IJ is not required to incorporate previous portions of his opinion into later portions of the same opinion, as if he were a plaintiff preparing a complaint containing multiple causes of action (e.g., \u201cI hereby incorporate the discussion of past persecution contained in paragraphs 14-28 of this oral opinion into the next section of the opinion.\u201d). Instead, the IJ\u2019s decision must demonstrate he has \u201cheard, considered, and decided\u201d the petitioner\u2019s asylum claim based on all relevant factors. <em>See Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1140-41 (quoting <em>Rodriguez-Matamoros v. INS, </em>86 F.3d 158, 160 (9th Cir.1996)). Here, the IJ\u2019s decision satisfies this requirement. Thus I would deny Worku\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-13\">. Other than past persecution, Worku cites no additional factors the IJ should have considered in making his discretionary decision to deny asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-14\">. Which, I suppose, is one way it \"defends the rights of and works to establish an independent nation for the Oromo people.\u201d Maj. at 524.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
