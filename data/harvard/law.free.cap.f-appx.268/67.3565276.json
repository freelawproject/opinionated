D\u2019Angelo denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Saliou, </em>No. A 95 855 934 (B.I.A. Sept. 13, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 855 934 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, June 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">When the BIA affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), this Court \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d This jurisdictional rule is absolute with respect to the requirements that an alien appeal to the BIA before filing a petition for review, <em>see Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162, 165-69, 174 (2d Cir. 2004), and that on appeal to the BIA, he or she raise each category of relief subsequently raised in this Court. <em>See Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Beharry v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 51, 59 (2d Cir.2003)). In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust the categories of relief they seek, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), petitioners must also raise to the BIA the specific issues he or she later raises in this Court. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). While not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, we have held that a petitioner\u2019s \u201cgeneralized protestations\u201d that he or she is eligible for a category of relief are insufficient to preserve an issue for appeal. <em>Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Here, Saliou failed to file a brief to the BIA. Saliou\u2019s Notice of Appeal to the BIA stated generally that the IJ\u2019s decision was \u201cwrong\u201d with regard to the various categories of relief he sought, but it did not mention the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was the basis for the IJ\u2019s denial of Saliou\u2019s application. Because Saliou failed to raise before the agency the issue on which the IJ\u2019s denial of all of his claims turned, he has failed to preserve that issue for review. Accordingly, we decline to review his claims for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
