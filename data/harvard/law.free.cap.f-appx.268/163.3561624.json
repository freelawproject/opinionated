We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">We write exclusively for the parties, so we recount only the facts essential to our decision. Sandhu is a Canadian commercial truck driver who frequently makes deliveries in the United States. Accordingly, he is subject to U.S. regulations that require him to, <em>inter alia, </em>maintain a logbook that accurately reflects his driving and off-duty hours, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8 (1998), and refrain from driving more than ten consecutive hours without at least eight hours of rest in-between (the so-called \u201cten hour rule\u201d). 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.3 (1998);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Sandhu, </em>462 F.Supp.2d 663, 664-65 (E.D.Pa.2006). On September 22, 1999, Sandhu was traveling on Interstate 78 in Berks County, Pennsylvania, when he lost control of his truck and collided with a van traveling in the opposite direction, killing four of its occupants and seriously injuring two others.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) investigated the incident and discovered that in the weeks preceding the crash, Sandhu had falsified his logbook entries 42 times. Records revealed that Sandhu frequently misstated the times at which he crossed the border, and toll receipts showed that in many cases, Sandhu was driving when he claimed to be off-duty in the sleeper berth of his truck. Accordingly, Sandhu was indicted on, and pleaded guilty to, 42 counts of making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(e). Before he was sentenced, San-dhu sought to exclude evidence relating to the September 22 crash. The District Court denied Sandhu\u2019s motion, finding the evidence potentially relevant to the required sentencing inquiry. <em>Sandhu, </em>462 F.Supp.2d at 663, 671-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">At Sandhu\u2019s sentencing hearing, the District Court heard from a truck driver who witnessed the crash, the agent who investigated Sandhu\u2019s logbook, and several of Sandhu\u2019s friends and family. The Court also considered Sandhu\u2019s presentence report (PSR), which calculated an advisory Guidelines range of 8-14 months, but noted that an upward departure might be warranted because \u201cdeath resulted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.1. Although neither party objected to the advisory Guidelines range, the government argued for a sentence at the top while Sandhu advocated for the bottom of the range.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">The District Court declined to depart under \u00a7 5K2.1 of the Guidelines because there was insufficient evidence that San-dhu was fatigued at the time of the crash, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>or that he was violating the \u201cten hour rule.\u201d Nevertheless, the District Court, after applying the relevant factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), imposed a variance that resulted in a sentence of 48 months in prison, 3 years of supervised release, a $5,000 fine, and a $4,200 special assessment. The term of imprisonment, reasoned the Court, represents roughly \u201ca month ... for each of the violations as to which the defendant has pled guilty,\u201d and is well below the statutory maximum 210 month sentence to which Sandhu was exposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Sandhu challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, he argues that the District Court erred by imposing an upward variance without making \u201ca specific finding of an aggravating circumstance\u201d or determining whether an aggravating circumstance \u201cwas present to such a degree as to take the case out of the Guidelines\u2019 \u2018heartland.\u2019 \u201d Second, he argues that the Court improperly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Because Sandhu failed to raise his first claim in the District Court, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Couch, </em>291 F.3d 251, 252-53 (3d Cir.2002). We will reverse only if we find that: (1) the District Court committed error (2) that was plain, and (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 192 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">At sentencing a district court must: (1) calculate the Guidelines range, (2) decide whether a departure under the Guidelines is appropriate, and (3) decide whether to vary from the Guidelines based on the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). As Sandhu correctly argues, aggravating or mitigating circumstances remain relevant to the court\u2019s decision whether to depart under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 247 (noting that at step two, our <em>pre-Booker </em>case law continues to have advisory force). Once the court decides not to depart, however, its <em>post-Booker </em>discretion to vary from the guidelines at step three is bounded by \u00a7 3553(a) and our reasonableness review, not by findings of aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Id.; <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Here, Sandhu\u2019s first argument fails because it ignores the distinction between a departure and a variance. <em>See Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247 n. 10. The District Court explicitly declined to apply an upward <em>departure </em>because \u201cthere was not sufficient evidence that [Sandhu] was suffering from fatigue at the time of the accident, nor was there sufficient evidence to conclude that ... [Sandhu] was violating the ten-hour rule.\u201d Because the District Court did not depart from the Guidelines, it was not required to identify aggravating circumstances; rather it was required to give meaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329; <em>see </em>Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">We are aware of no case, and Sandhu cites none, that requires a district court to identify aggravating circumstances in exercising its discretion to vary from the Guidelines based on \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Cf. Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (rejecting an appellate rule that required \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances to justify a variance). Accordingly, we find that the District Court committed no error, much less plain error, in not identifying aggravating circumstances to justify its variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Sandhu next argues that the District Court\u2019s failure to properly consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors resulted in an unreasonable sentence. We review the District Court\u2019s sentence under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Thus, we consider: (1) whether the District Court gave meaningful consideration to the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) whether the Court reasonably applied those factors to the circumstances of the case. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">In Sandhu\u2019s case, we answer both questions in the affirmative. The Court considered the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1), observing that \u201cfalsification of logbooks in order to circumvent DOT safety regulations is a serious offense that carries risk far greater than those for most document falsifications,\u201d as well as the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d <em>id., </em>recognizing Sandhu\u2019s otherwise \u201cunblemished life.\u201d The Court emphasized the need for the sentence to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and to provide \u201cadequate deterrence\u201d to similar conduct, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), when it characterized Sandhu\u2019s conduct as \u201ca violation of safety regulations with potentially fatal consequences,\u201d and sought to send \u201ca clear message that safety violations are a serious offense, and if violated, will result in serious penalties.\u201d The District Court also examined sentences imposed in similar situations, \u00a7 3553(a)(6), but found those situations distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Any concern Sandhu had that the District Court was prejudiced by his accident, or relied solely upon that fact in determining his sentence, is dispelled by the District Court\u2019s thorough \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. Moreover, the District Court explicitly stated that the upward variance reflected Sandhu\u2019s \u201crepeated violations over a short period of time\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8, not his \u201ccausing or being involved in [the] accident.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion and the judgment of sentence will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">. This rule has since been modified. <em>See </em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Office of Pub. Affairs, <em>Revised Hours-of-Service Rule to Help Ensure Truck Drivers Get Adequate Rest, </em>Apr. 24, 2003, http://www.dot.gov/affairs/fmcsa0403. htm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-16\">. Sandhu was also charged in state court with vehicular manslaughter and related offenses. These charges were dismissed, however, and Sandhu pleaded guilty to the summary offense of careless driving. <em>See Sandhu, </em>462 F.Supp.2d at 663.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\">. \u201cThe court need not discuss every argument made by a litigant if an argument is clearly without merit. Nor must a court discuss and make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors if the record makes clear the court took the factors into account in sentencing.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329. Moreover, the court need not invoke particular \"magic words\u201d in explaining its sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
