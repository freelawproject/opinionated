For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not reiterate the factual or procedural background. In order to obtain asylum or withholding of removal, Petitioners must establish that they are \u201crefugees\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). That statute provides relief from removal if an alien can establish \u201c[1] persecution or [2] a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>See also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Mulanga v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Here, the government correctly notes that Krestianti did not raise the IJ\u2019s denial of her claim for relief based on Chinese ancestry and that Sutedja did not raise the IJ\u2019s denial of his claim based on religion as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). They have therefore failed to exhaust those claims and we do not have jurisdiction to review them. <em>Abdulrah-man v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 594-95 (3d Cir.2003). Accordingly, we can only consider Sutedja\u2019s petition for review of the IJ\u2019s denial of his claim based on his Chinese ethnicity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Our review is narrow. When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e), we review the decision of the IJ as the final agency decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249 (3d Cir.2003) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cIf a reasonable fact finder could make a particular finding on the administrative record, then the finding is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our review of the IJ\u2019s conclusions of law is <em>de novo, </em>but we afford the IJ deference pursuant to <em>Chevron v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Sutedja argues that the IJ erroneously interpreted 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii) as requiring documentary corroboration of his testimony in order to establish \u201cfear of persecution\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). In doing so, he mischaracterizes the IJ\u2019s ruling. Moreover, we agree that the evidence he offered falls woefully short of the quantum of proof required to establish either past per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>secution, a well founded fear of future persecution, or a likelihood of torture. In <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1239 (3d Cir. 1993), we explained that \u201cpersecution\u201d in the asylum context refers to \u201cextreme conduct!,]\u201d it does not \u201cencompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d 12 F.3d at 1240 n. 10. The most serious incident was the bombing of a church Sutedja was attending. Insofar as his claim for relief based on ethnicity is concerned, the following testimony is indicative of his claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">Q. Were you ever being physically harmed when you were in Indonesia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">A. Not too serious, but it happened so many times when I drove my bike\u2014 when I rode my bike and people would call me Chinese, Chinese, and sometimes they hit me, but its\u2019s not too serious. I do not understand why they hit me, what\u2019s the reason they did that to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKr\">4/8/2005 N.T. p. 64-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Although the mistreatment and harassment Sutedja received was certainly unpleasant, he conceded that \u201cit\u2019s not too serious.\u201d His testimony simply did not establish persecution. Moreover, the IJ correctly noted that Petitioner\u2019s family continues to reside in Indonesia without incident. That, combined with Sutedja\u2019s less than compelling testimony about the incidents that occurred before he left Indonesia, supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he had not established his entitlement to relief by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 186 (3d Cir.2003) (since the test for withholding of removal is more demanding than the test for asylum, failure to establish a claim for asylum is fatal to a claim for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">(3] Similarly, the record is devoid of any evidence of the governmental involvement or acquiescence required for relief under the CAT. <em>See Silva-Rengifo v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>473 F.3d 58 (3d Cir.2007). Although there is testimony that various individuals were hostile to Petitioners, mistreated and harassed them, there is nothing to suggest the conduct of those individuals is attributable to the government of Indonesia or its agents. To the extent that there is evidence that police were informed of the mistreatment that Krestianti and Sutedja were subjected to, the record shows only dereliction of duty and corruption. It does not suggest a likelihood of torture if either is returned to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">!4] Petitioners also argue that the IJ erred in excluding certain police reports and documents pertaining to a robbery of Krestianti\u2019s father. That claim, like Kres-tianti\u2019s claim for religious and ethnic persecution, has been waived because it was not presented to the BIA. <em>See Abdulrah-man, </em>330 F.3d at 594-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we will deny the Petition for Review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\">. We note, however, based on our review of the IJ\u2019s ruling, that the record is sufficient to support the denial of Krestianti's ethnically based claim as well as Sutedja\u2019s claim based on his religion. As the IJ correctly held, even assuming their testimony to be true, the record does not contain sufficient evidence of governmental involvement or acquiescence to support those claims. Accordingly, we would deny their challenge to those claims even if they were before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-15\">. We realize that Petitioners are challenging the validity of the \"streamlining\u201d regulations that provide for summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1. We have already rejected that argument in <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir.2003) <em>(en banc), </em>and need not address it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
