Videla denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xiao Hong Guo, </em>No. A79 682 227 (B.I.A. Aug. 31, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 682 227 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 23, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Where the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>See Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). However, when the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Guo had not carried her burden of proof, but made no mention of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Thus, it is unclear whether the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. In such circumstances, we assume the applicant\u2019s credibility for purposes of our decision. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir. 2005) (assuming, without determining, an applicant\u2019s credibility for purposes of reviewing the BIA\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">This Court reviews legal issues, and the application of law to fact, <em>de novo. See Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the denial of relief in this case was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ and the BIA properly concluded that Guo did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. Guo argues in her brief that she will be subject to \u201cpregnancy checkups and IUD insertion\u201d if she returns to China. However, as the IJ found, her arguments in this respect were \u201cmerely speculative,\u201d where she had only one child and failed to produce any evidence that similarly situated persons are persecuted under China\u2019s family planning policy. In a similar context, this Court has held that if a petitioner claims that she will face sterilization in China, but has only one child, such claim of fear of persecution may appropriately be considered \u201cspeculative.\u201d <em>Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The IJ also properly found that Guo did not present evidence establishing her eligibility for asylum or withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>removal based on her illegal departure from China.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the IJ found, punishment for illegal departure by the Chinese government does not \u201crise to the level of persecution\u201d in the absence of evidence that authorities are motivated by anything other than law enforcement. <em>See Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 359 (BIA 1983) (criminal prosecution and punishment for illegal departure do not constitute persecution in the absence of evidence that the authorities have a motive other than law enforcement for such prosecution); <em>see also Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201c[P]unishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">With respect to Guo\u2019s CAT claim, this Court has concluded that evidence that some individuals who left China illegally are imprisoned, and that human rights violations including torture occur in Chinese prisons, is insufficient to establish a clear probability of torture for a particular illegal emigrant. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). Here, without particularized evidence other than Guo\u2019s assertion that a relative was detained and beaten after repatriation, the agency did not err in finding that she failed to carry her burden of establishing a likelihood of torture. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">. To the extent Guo attempts to present new evidence on appeal, regarding China\u2019s treatment of those who have departed the country illegally, we decline to consider such evidence. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260 (2d Cir.2007); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
