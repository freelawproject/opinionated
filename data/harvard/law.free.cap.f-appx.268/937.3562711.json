Nicholson, </em>No. 05-0278. Lau-rente also responds to the court\u2019s order and moves the court to \u201cre-review the evidence\u201d and grant him Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Laurente appealed, through counsel, to the CAVC from an August 11, 2004 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that denied his service-connection claim for pulmonary tuberculosis. On appeal, Lau-rente argued only that the Board failed to ensure that the Secretary had complied with his notification requirements pursuant to 88 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) and that he was entitled to an adverse presumption to establish inservice incurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis because his service medical records were destroyed in the 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">In its November 2006 affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision, the CAVC reviewed the Board\u2019s determination regarding the adequacy of section 5103(a) notice under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. The CAVC determined that there was a plausible basis in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that a November 2001 letter informed Laurente what information and evidence was necessary to substantiate his claim. The CAVC also determined that Laurente\u2019s adverse presumption argument based on the 1973 fire was without merit. Laurente appealed, seeking review, inter alia, of whether the CAVC applied the appropriate standard of review to the Board\u2019s section 5103(a) determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">The Secretary moves to summarily affirm the CAVC\u2019s decision on the ground that <em>Garrison v. Nicholson, </em>494 F.3d 1366 (Fed.Cir.2007) and <em>Cromer v. Nicholson, </em>455 F.3d 1346 (Fed.Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2265, 167 L.Ed.2d 1093 (2007) are controlling. Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">In the present case, it is clear that summary affirmance is warranted. The CAVC\u2019s application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review to the Board\u2019s determination that the Secretary had complied with his section 5103(a) notification requirements was clearly correct in light of our recent decision in <em>Garrison. Garrison, </em>494 F.3d at 1370. In addition, the CAVC\u2019s determination that Laurente is not entitled to an adverse presumption based on the 1973 fire is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cromer. Cromer, </em>455 F.3d at 1350-51 (no presumption of service connection due to alleged destruction of documents by fire). Because the CAVC\u2019s decision was clearly correct as a matter of law, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Concerning Laurente\u2019s requests that we review the evidence and grant benefits, the court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions of the CAVC is limited and does not include challenges to factual determinations or laws or regulations as applied to the particular facts of a case. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>see Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to summarily affirm is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>(2) Laurente\u2019s motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
