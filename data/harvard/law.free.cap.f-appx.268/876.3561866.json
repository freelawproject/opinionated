The district court concluded that their complaint is not ripe. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Butler is the owner of Ipharmacy, which sold products, including controlled substances, on-line. In 2005, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida filed a complaint for civil forfeiture of property that Butler and Ipharmacy owned. The property was seized. In March 2007, the civil forfeiture proceeding was stayed pending the resolution of a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">On October 27, 2006, Butler filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), that the defendants cannot prohibit a legitimate doctor-patient relationship without a face-to-face meeting and the defendants cannot interfere with the \u201coperation of legitimate electronic commerce in pharmaceuticals.\u201d The complaint also sought an injunction to bar the defendants from interfering with Ipharmacy and the return of the assets and documents seized in the civil forfeiture proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">The complaint contends that the practices of Ipharmacy comply with the federal law that regulates the prescription of controlled substances. \u201cCongress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to ... distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the [Controlled Substances Act].\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 13, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 2203, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 844(a)). \u201cA prescription for a controlled substance to be effective must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">In 2001, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued written guidance that \u201ca bona fide doctor/patient relationship\u201d is required to comply with the Act. Dispensing and Purchasing Controlled Substances over the Internet, 66 Fed.Reg. 21, 181, at 12, 182 (Apr. 27, 2001). The guidance stated that, under the laws of many states, the completion of a questionnaire reviewed by a doctor without face-to-face contact with a patient is not sufficient to establish a doctor-patient relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 183. The Administration has clarified that its guidance reflects its understanding of \u201cstate laws and existing professional stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>dards,\u201d which govern doctor-patient relationships. Kamir Garces-Mejias, M.D., Revocation of Registration, 72 Fed.Reg. 54, 931, at 54, 935 n. 4 (Sept. 27, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The district court concluded that the dispute was not ripe and there was no final agency action for review. The district court also concluded that Butler could not collaterally challenge the civil forfeiture proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">We review challenges to subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Elend v. Basham, </em>471 F.3d 1199, 1204 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The jurisdiction of federal courts is limited by the requirement of the Constitution that federal courts consider only \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. Ill, \u00a7 2. \u201cThe ripeness doctrine is \u2018drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Park Hospitality Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>538 U.S. 803, 808, 123 S.Ct. 2026, 2030, 155 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2003) (quoting <em>Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 43, 57 n. 18, 113 S.Ct. 2485, 2495 n. 18, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993)). This doctrine allows us to avoid \u201c \u2018entangling ourselves in abstract disagreements,\u2019 and also to shield agencies from judicial interaction \u2018until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Konikov v. Orange County, Fla., </em>410 F.3d 1317, 1322 (2005) (quoting <em>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Whether a claim is ripe depends on \u201c1) whether the issues are fit for judicial decision and 2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One consideration for determining whether a challenge to an agency action is ripe is whether that action is \u201cfinal.\u201d <em>Atlanta Gas Light Co. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>140 F.3d 1392, 1404 (11th Cir. 1998). The district court concluded the complaint of Butler and Ipharmacy was not ripe, because it did not concern a final action of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">We agree with the district court that the complaint does not concern a ripe controversy. An agency action can be final only if it \u201caffects the legal rights and obligations of the parties.\u201d <em>Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Whitman, </em>336 F.3d 1236, 1248 (11th Cir.2003). The guidance issued in 2001 by the Administration that clarified its understanding of state law creates no legal obligation, and the decision of an agency to investigate someone does not affect that person\u2019s legal rights, <em>see Sec. Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Jerry T. O\u2019Brien, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 735, 742, 104 S.Ct. 2720, 2725, 81 L.Ed.2d 615 (1984). Because the Administration has made no final decision regarding how it will interpret the Controlled Substances Act, we conclude that a challenge to a possible future interpretation is not ripe. Any challenge to future investigations by the Drug Enforcement Administration also is not ripe. Ipharmacy and Butler also offer no authority for a collateral attack of a pending civil forfeiture action.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">The dismissal of the complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
