We reverse and remand to the district court with the instruction to enter judgment for Golden Eagle dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">We need not decide whether application of defective paint physically injures the walls and/or homes on which the paint was applied under Arizona law because the Policy defines \u201cproperty damage\u201d to include \u201cMoss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured,\u201d Policy \u00a7 V.15, and the parties do not dispute that homeowners lost use of their homes while the walls were repainted; thus, the losses incurred by CMS were covered under the \u201cproperty damage\u201d clause of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">However, the Policy excludes \u201c \u2018[property damage\u2019 to \u2018impaired property\u2019 ... arising out of [a] defect, inadequacy or dangerous condition in \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work.\u2019 \u201d Policy \u00a7 I.A.2.m. Under the Policy, \u201c \u2018[ijmpaired property\u2019 means tangible property ... that cannot be used or is less useful because [i]t incorporates \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019 that is known or thought to be defective ... if such property can be restored to use by [t]he repair, replacement, adjustment or removal of \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 V.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">Clearly the homes are tangible property and, at a minimum, they were less useful because of CMS\u2019s defective paint; thus, the only issue is whether, as argued by Golden Eagle, the homes were restored to use by repair <em>or </em>replacement of CMS\u2019s product, namely the defective paint. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>this regard, SWA argues that the defective paint has not been repaired or replaced because: (1) the defective paint still sits on the walls, (2) sealant had to be used prior to application of the new paint, and (3) the new paint was not supplied by CMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We need not consider whether the defective paint was repaired because the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201creplace\u201d is dispositive. <em>See Liristis v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>204 Ariz. 140, 61 P.3d 22, 25 (2002) (\u201cWe construe provisions of an insurance policy according to their plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The <em>Merriamr-Webster Dictionary </em>(the <em>\u201cDictionary\u201d) </em>defines the word \u201creplace\u201d as \u201c1: to restore to good condition esp[.] by replacing parts or putting together something torn or broken[;] 2: to take the place of; supplant [;] 3: <em>to put something new in the place of.\u201d Dictionary </em>at 593 (Henry Bosley Woolf ed., Simon &amp; Schus-ter, Inc.1974) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Here, the homes were restored to use by replacement of the defective CMS paint with sealant and new paint, which \u201cput something new in the place of\u2019 the defective paint. Replacement does not require that the defective paint be removed from the walls; nor does it preclude use of a sealant. Furthermore, neither the Policy nor the ordinary meaning of \u201creplace\u201d requires the defective CMS paint to be replaced by new CMS paint, as opposed to another brand.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Consideration of Golden Eagle\u2019s ability to challenge the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement is unnecessary because it is not liable for any part of the settlement between SWA and CMS. <em>See United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Morris, </em>154 Ariz. 113, 741 P.2d 246, 254 (1987) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cIf the insurer wins on the coverage issue, it is not liable for any part of the settlement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT FOR GOLDEN EAGLE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
