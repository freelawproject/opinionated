The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) issued an oral opinion denying the asylum and withholding application because of an adverse credibility finding. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed in a <em>per curiam </em>order without opinion and Vilehez petitioned this court for review. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we grant the petition, remanding for a new determination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-20\">Because the IJ described no \u201cnon-verbal communication,\u201d substantial evidence does not support the finding that Vilchez\u2019s demeanor undermined his credibility. <em>Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 686 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>dence does not support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Vilchez\u2019s testimony regarding the beatings he received lacked detail and therefore was not credible. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081, 1090-91 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that \u201c[t]he ability to recall precise dates of events years after they happen is an extremely poor test of how truthful a witness\u2019s substantive account is,\u201d pai\u2019ticularly in cases of physical abuse). Vilchez\u2019s initial failure to note a prior unsuccessful attempt to travel to the United States was not an omission going to the heart of his claim, and therefore does not support the credibility finding. <em>See Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Vilchez\u2019s testimony regarding his coerced participation in Shining Path activities and their simultaneous antipathy toward him comported with the country conditions evidence in the record regarding the Shining Path\u2019s recruitment and agitation tactics, so it is not inherently unbelievable. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1110 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Duarte de Guinac v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir. 1999) (country conditions evidence provides context in which to evaluate an applicant\u2019s credibility). We also do not find it to be inherently unbelievable that the Shining Path would have targeted Vilchez only a couple of months after he became president of the Student Union, in light of the group\u2019s documented practice of targeting community leaders and the fact that Vilchez had previously been Vice President of the Student Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The IJ noted that, at different points in his testimony, Vilchez stated that the police killed a student named Arrasco, but later said that he believed the Shining Path had killed him. But the general understanding that the police killed Arrasco was not inconsistent with Vilchez\u2019s contrary belief, especially in light of the description of Shining Path methods in the report of country conditions, nor is it inconsistent with Vilchez\u2019s being pressured to organize a protest against the killing of Arrasco by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Vilchez\u2019s failure to describe his cousin\u2019s death in his initial asylum application, though it was later described in Vilchez\u2019s declaration and testimony, is not substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1382 (9th Cir.1990) (omission of a fact from asylum application does not necessarily undermine credibility). Finally, the fact that the Shining Path did not carry out its threats against other members of Vilchez\u2019s family does not undermine Vilchez\u2019s credibility with respect to the fact that threats were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Because there has been no ruling on the facts with Vilchez\u2019s testimony accepted as credible, we grant the petition for review on the asylum and withholding claims and remand to the BIA for such further proceedings and rulings. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
