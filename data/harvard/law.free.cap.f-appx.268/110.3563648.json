May 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 205 534 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 9, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The agency\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Liu has not challenged the pretermission of her asylum application before this Court, or raised any argument regarding the denial of CAT relief, we deem those claims abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly we review only Liu\u2019s challenge to the denial of her application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ based her adverse credibility determination in part on her observation of Liu\u2019s demeanor while testifying. The IJ noted instances where Liu was unresponsive to the specific questions asked of her. We accord particular deference to such findings. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the Court can be \u201cmore confident in [its] review of observations about an applicant\u2019s demeanor where ... they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony\u201d); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The agency also noted a contradiction between Liu\u2019s statement in her asylum application that she had suffered two involuntary abortions, and her testimony, in which she described only one abortion, and never mentioned a second abortion at all. Rather, when asked what happened after her abortion, Liu stated, \u201c[n]othing extraordinary happened.\u201d Contrary to Liu\u2019s assertion that this omission was \u201cnot material,\u201d the agency could reasonably conclude that it was a dramatic inconsistency that went to the heart of her claim. <em>See Ma-jidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir. 2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). As such, the IJ did not err by failing to ask specifically why Liu had omitted any mention of the second alleged abortion. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">The IJ further found that Liu\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>first testified that she resigned from her job voluntarily, but later stated that she lost her job. Moreover, whereas Liu initially stated that the abortion occurred in July 2003, later in her testimony and in her asylum application she indicated that the date was July 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Together, these discrepancies provide substantial evidence in support of the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Moreover, while Liu attempted to provide explanations for these inconsistencies, including that she was \u201ctense\u201d and \u201cconfused,\u201d no reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to accept them. <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Accordingly, the agency properly relied on these discrepancies where they were substantial when measured against the record as a whole. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09. Indeed, they call into question whether Liu ever experienced mistreatment, particularly an involuntary abortion, and therefore whether her fear of persecution is reasonable. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">While the IJ observed other more minor inconsistencies, as well as Liu\u2019s lack of corroboration, we need not reach these findings because the proper findings identified above were sufficient to support the overall adverse credibility determination. Because Liu failed to establish past persecution due to her incredible testimony, she was not entitled to the presumption of a likelihood of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). Furthermore, because the only evidence of a threat to Liu\u2019s life or freedom depended on her credibility, the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal was proper. <em>Wu Biao Chen, </em>344 F.3d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
