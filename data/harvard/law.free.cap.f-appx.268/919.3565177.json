Nicholson, </em>No. 04-306. James H. Pinder has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Pinder served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 1956 to August 1965 and in the Air Force Reserves from September 1965 to June 1968. He appealed, through counsel, to the CAVC from a February 2, 2004 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that denied disability benefits for hypertension, secondary to a service-connected ganglion cyst of the right wrist. On appeal, Pinder argued only that the Secretary had failed to provide adequate notification as to who was responsible for obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate his claim as required by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">In its October 31, 2006 affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision, the CAVC reviewed the Board\u2019s determination regarding the adequacy of section 5103(a) notice under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. The CAVC determined that there was a plausible basis in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that a May 2001 letter informed Pinder who was responsible for obtaining the evidence was necessary to substantiate his claim. Pinder appealed, seeking review of whether the CAVC applied the appropriate standard of review to the Board\u2019s section 5103(a) determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">The Secretary moves to summarily affirm the CAVC\u2019s decision on the ground that <em>Garrison v. Nicholson, </em>494 F.3d 1366 (Fed.Cir.2007) is . controlling. Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994). In the present case, it is clear that summary affirmance is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">In <em>Garrison, </em>the court affirmed the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review when reviewing the Board\u2019s finding that the Secretary had complied with his section 5103(a) notification requirements. <em>Garrison, </em>494 F.3d at 1370. In light of <em>Garrison, </em>it is clear that the CAVC\u2019s decision was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b944-17\">(1) The motion to summarily affirm is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-18\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
