See Marie Addoo v. New York City Board of Education, </em>No. 04 CV 2255(ARR)(LB) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">Addoo, an employee of the BOE since 1987, claims that her employer subjected her to a \u201cpattern of harassment\u201d after she became temporarily disabled in 2001 from leg injuries that exacerbated a pre-existing back condition. The alleged harassment included: (1) receipt of baseless negative performance evaluations, (2) assignment to a basement classroom, (3) transfer from Queens to the Bronx, and (4) not receiving salary increases to which she was entitled. In her complaint, Addoo alleges that the BOE\u2019s conduct constitutes employment discrimination on the basis of a disability in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">The BOE moved for summary judgment and Addoo, then represented by counsel, opposed. The District Court ruled in favor of the BOE, holding that no reasonable juror could find that Addoo was disabled under the ADA. Assuming arguendo that Addoo\u2019s leg and back pain constituted an \u201cimpairment\u201d for the purposes of the statute, the District Court concluded that it did not \u201csubstantially limit\u201d any major life activity because the impairment was (a) not severe, (b) of limited duration, and (c) unlikely to have a permanent or long-term impact \u2014 indeed, Addoo herself described the condition as \u201ctemporary\u201d in the complaint. <em>See Capobianco v. City of New York, </em>422 F.3d 47, 57 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cFactors to consider in determining whether a major life activity is substantially limited include: the nature and severity of the impairment; its duration or expected duration; and the existence of any actual or expected permanent or long term impact.\u201d). Because Addoo could not prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that her purported impairment \u201csubstantially limits one or more ... major life activities,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A), she could not prevail under the ADA, <em>see Ca-pobianco, </em>422 F.3d at 56 (\u201cNot every impairment is a \u2018disability\u2019 within the meaning of the ADA; rather, there are two requirements: the impairment must limit a major life activity and the limit[ation] must be substantial.\u201d) (brackets in original), or under the Rehabilitation Act, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d) (adopting ADA standards for determining employment discrimination on the basis of disability); <em>see also Bartlett v. N.Y. State Bd. of Law Exam\u2019rs, </em>226 F.3d 69, 78 n. 2 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We agree with the District Court that, under the circumstances presented, Addoo could not establish that her leg and back pain constituted a substantial limitation on any major life activity. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, summary judgment in favor of defendant BOE was proper, and the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\">. Addoo\u2019s complaint also invokes Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>but there are no facts alleged in her complaint or set forth in the record indicating that Addoo suffered any discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\u201d 42 USCS \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
