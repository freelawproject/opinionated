At sentencing, Williams faced a mandatory life sentence for Count 3. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (if any person violates \u00a7 860 after two or more convictions for felony drug offenses, that person shall be sentenced to mandatory term of life imprisonment). Pursuant to the government\u2019s substantial-assistance departure motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted a sentencing departure of 15%, using 470 months as the starting point for Williams\u2019s life sentence. Accordingly, the court sentenced Williams to concurrent prison terms of 400 months on Count 3 and 262 months on Count 9, to be followed by concurrent terms of 6 and 8 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-22\">Williams argues that the district court erred when it determined that his life sentence was equivalent to 470 months for purposes of calculating his substantial-assistance departure. Based on our prior decisions, however, we cannot say that the court erred. <em>See United States v. Jensen, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>493 F.3d 997, 1000 (8th Cir.2007) (stating that 470 months, derived from updated empirical data of inmate life expectancy, is one acceptable starting point for departure from life sentence), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1069,169 L.Ed.2d 803 (2008) (in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)); <em>United States v. Keller, </em>413 F.3d 706, 711 &amp; n. 5 (8th Cir.2005) (concluding that it was not error for district court to use starting point of 470 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-16\">.
