Travis, Office of the United States Attorney District of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b755-9\">Jose Juan Farias, Herlong, CA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b755-10\">Before KELLY, ANDERSON, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">ORDER DENYING REQUEST FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">This matter is before the court on Jose Juan Farias\u2019s <em>pro se </em>requests for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and for permission to proceed on appeal <em>in forma, pauperis. </em>Farias, a federal prisoner, seeks a COA so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court grants Farias\u2019s request to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Because, however, he has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2), this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Farias pleaded guilty to possession -with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(a). His plea agreement contained waivers of both appellate and collateral-attack rights. Farias nevertheless brought the instant \u00a7 2255 motion claiming his plea agreement was obtained through ineffective assistance of counsel. In particular, Farias asserted (1) he did not knowingly waive his right to directly appeal his sentence and (2) he was coerced into pleading guilty based on his counsel\u2019s promise that he would receive a ten-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">The district court dismissed Farias\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion with prejudice. The district court began by recognizing that although waivers of collateral-attack rights were generally enforceable, an exception existed for challenges involving claims of ineffective assistance with regard to entering the plea or negotiating the agreement. <em>United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d, 1179, 1183 (10th Cir.2001). The district court nevertheless concluded Farias\u2019s conclusory allegations of ineffective assistance were directly contrary to his statements in the plea agreement and thus insufficient to state a claim. In signing the plea agreement, Farias specifically acknowledged he had been advised of and understood the limitations on his direct appeal and collateral-attack rights. He further expressly acknowledged that it was the district court alone that would impose a sentence and acknowledged the district court\u2019s sentence could differ from any sentence estimated by the prosecution or defense counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>When measured against these specific statements in the plea agreement, Farias\u2019s conclusory allegations of ineffective assistance were clearly insufficient. <em>Lasiter v. Thomas, </em>89 F.3d 699, 702 (10th Cir.1996) (holding conclusory allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are insufficient to overcome solemn declarations on the part of a movant, like those present in this case, that a plea is knowing and voluntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The granting of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to Farias\u2019s appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). To be entitled to a COA, Farias must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Farias has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of her claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Farias need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Having undertaken a review of Farias\u2019s appellate filing, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record before this court pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El, </em>we conclude Farias is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Farias\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not reasonably subject to debate and the issues he seeks to raise on appeal are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, this court DENIES Farias\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-13\">. The district court did not issue Farias a COA within thirty days of the filing of his notice of appeal. Accordingly Farias\u2019s request for a COA in the district court is deemed denied. 10th Cir. R. 22.1(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
