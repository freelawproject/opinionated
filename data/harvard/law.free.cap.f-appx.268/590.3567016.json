We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Under California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act, \u201cexhaustion of the administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.\u201d <em>Okoli v. Lockheed Technical Ops. Co., </em>36 Cal. App.4th 1607, 1613, 43 Cal.Rptr.2d 57 (1995). \u201cAllegations in the civil complaint that fall outside of the scope of the administrative charge are barred for failure to exhaust.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, </em>265 F.3d 890, 897 (9th Cir.2001). Here, Centner\u2019s FEHA complaint made no mention of the letter or of any retaliatory conduct based on the letter. Even the supplemental information she provided to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing failed to properly put the defendants or the Department on notice that she asserted a claim of retaliation based on her involvement with the letter. Centner therefore failed to exhaust that claim, and the district court committed no error in dismissing it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Centner signed the bankruptcy documents under penalty of perjury and stated therein that the value of this lawsuit was $3,424. At trial, however, Centner\u2019s position was that she suffered more than one million dollars in damages. Admission of the bankruptcy schedules to establish Centner\u2019s prior inconsistent statements concerning her damages and the value of this lawsuit was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, </em>376 F.3d 1002, 1007 (9th Cir.2004). Centner had an opportunity to persuade the jury to disregard the bankruptcy schedules and to return a larger verdict, but the jury was not persuaded. Because the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial, confusing, or misleading, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it. <em>See Tritchler v. County of Lake, </em>358 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Boyd argues that the jury\u2019s verdict against him on Centner\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim was not supported by substantial evidence. To prevail on such a claim, Centner must establish, among other things, that she \u201cspoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1958, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). Centner\u2019s contributions to the letter clearly satisfy this requirement. Moreover, contrary to Boyd\u2019s suggestion, evidence at trial did link him to the alleged retaliation. We find Centner established her prima facie claim for retaliation and that the defendants failed to demonstrate legitimate administrative interests outweigh Centner\u2019s First Amendment rights under the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test. <em>Thomas v. City of Beaverton, </em>379 F.3d 802, 808 (9th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968)). Substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict against Boyd, and we therefore uphold it. <em>See Poppell v. City of San Diego, </em>149 F.3d 951, 962 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Boyd alternatively asserts that he is entitled to qualified immunity from Centner\u2019s First Amendment retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>claim because the law was not clearly established that Centner\u2019s speech involved a matter of public concern or that the balance of interests tilted in her favor. By 1995, however, the law in this circuit was clearly established that Centner\u2019s contributions to the letter were matters of public concern and that the any disruption caused by the investigation of the letter would not weigh heavily against her interest in whisleblowing. <em>See Hyland v. Wonder, </em>972 F.2d 1129, 1137 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Roth v. Veteran\u2019s Admin. of the U.S., </em>856 F.2d 1401, 1407-08 (9th Cir.1988). Boyd is therefore not entitled to qualified immunity-</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
