Petitioner argues that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s findings that Petitioner is removable and ineligible for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-20\">1. Petitioner is not a \u201cnational of the United States\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(3) because, as he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>cedes, he did not complete the naturalization process. <em>Perdomo-Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 964, 968-69 &amp; n. 4 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">2. We reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that, because the government delayed sending notice of his swearing-in ceremony, the government is estopped from arguing that Petitioner is not a national. Petitioner\u2019s testimony \u2014 the only evidence introduced on this point \u2014 established only negligence on the part of the government. \u201cA party seeking to raise estoppel against the government must establish affirmative misconduct going beyond mere negligence .... \u201d <em>Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 1084, 1092 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1290, 170 L.Ed.2d 71 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">3. On the merits of Petitioner\u2019s CAT claim, we hold that the record compels a finding that it is more likely than not that Petitioner would be tortured if returned to Syria. <em>See Khup v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 898, 902, 907 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard applies to the BIA\u2019s findings underlying its determination that a petitioner is ineligible for relief under the Convention Against Torture); <em>Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 892, 895 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact ... for substantial evidence and must uphold the BIA\u2019s finding unless the evidence compels a contrary result.\u201d). The government did not rebut the expert witness\u2019 testimony that it is highly probable that Petitioner will be detained upon arrival in Syria and that, if detained, he will be tortured. The IJ found that Petitioner would not be tortured because Syria would not know the reason for Petitioner\u2019s removal. Substantial evidence does not support that finding because of the notoriety of Petitioner\u2019s crime and the fact that the information is</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">easily discoverable on the internet. Furthermore, the State Department\u2019s Country Report for Syria states that Syria may prosecute returning Syrians who have been deported, simply for that reason. We therefore hold that Petitioner is entitled to deferral of removal under CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a) (listing the requirements for CAT deferral of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Petition for deferral of removal under CAT GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
