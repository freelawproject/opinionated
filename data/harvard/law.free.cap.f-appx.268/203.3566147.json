The district court ruled that all of Drisco\u2019s claims were time-barred as to all parties. Drisco now challenges that portion of the district court\u2019s opinion dismissing her claims for improper investigation and malicious prosecution based on her failure to file her civil complaint within two years of the date that the criminal charges were dismissed. Because the parties now agree that the district court made a mistake about the date the charges were dismissed, we will vacate the district court\u2019s order in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Drisco\u2019s federal complaint was filed on January 22, 2008, and an amended complaint was filed on January 27, 2003. In the opinion accompanying the order dismissing certain of Drisco\u2019s claims under the applicable two-year statute of limitations, the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">The NJTCA [New Jersey Tort Claims Act] sets a time limit of two years for filing suit. [].... The time frame for the alleged improper investigation is unclear, but, in any event, the cause of action must have accrued by the time the charges against Plaintiff were dismissed on January 26, 2000. Because more than two years elapsed between the latest possible time of accrual of the improper investigation claim and the date of filing that claim is time-barred. Lastly, the malicious prosecution claim accrued on the date of dismissal of the charges against Plaintiff. [ ]. Because more than two years elapsed between the time of accrual of the malicious prosecution claim and the date of filing that claim is time-barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Dist. Ct. Op. at 4-5 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Drisco now maintains that the district court erred because the charges against her were not dismissed until January 23, 2001, rather than on January 23, 2000, as the district court believed. The defendants do not dispute that assertion. Ans. Br. at 19 (\u201cThe Court, in error, identified the dismissal date as having occurred on January 23, 2000.\u201d). Nevertheless, for reasons unknown to us, rather than allowing the district court to correct its own error pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), Dris-co filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Defendants contend that Drisco\u2019s claims remain time-barred regardless of the district court\u2019s error because the malicious prosecution and improper investigation claims were asserted in the amended complaint, filed on January 27, 2003, rather than in the original complaint filed on January 22, 2003. They also argue they are entitled to dismissal based on \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity under the NJTCA, an argument raised in the district court but not addressed because that court believed that all claims were time-barred. Since the district court never ruled on the merits of these claims, we believe that they can best be resolved by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">In light of the foregoing discussion, we will vacate the decision of the district court dismissing the claims of improper investigation and malicious prosecution as to all defendants. The decision of the court is otherwise affirmed in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
