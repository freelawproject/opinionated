Schoppert denying Zhang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Rong Zheng, </em>No. A 98 769 708 (B.I.A. May 3, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 769 708 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Oct. 18, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). Particular deference is given to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir .2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73-74. In addition, the Court generally will not disturb adverse credibility determinations that are \u201cbased on specific examples in the record of inconsistent statements ... about matters material to [an applicant\u2019s] claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ram-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>sameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201c \u2018specific, cogent\u2019 reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">A review of the evidence in this case indicates that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. Zheng testified that his wife had the x-ray performed because she wanted to obtain evidence to support his asylum application in the United States. He did not, however, explain why she went to the hospital to have the x-ray taken when her physical condition was \u201cvery bad,\u201d given that he did not need that documentation until he immigrated to the United States five-and-a-half years later. Accordingly, the IJ reasonably found it implausible that Zheng\u2019s wife had the x-ray taken only three days after she was forcibly sterilized and so long before Zheng immigrated to the United States, particularly given that she was in poor health. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It was reasonable for the IJ to rely on the inconsistency between Zheng\u2019s testimony that his wife mailed him the x-ray in March 2005 and his submission of a U.S. physician\u2019s evaluation of the x-ray that was conducted in February 2005. Zheng claimed that he had remembered the date incorrectly. Given that his asylum application and testimony included specific dates for several events that had taken place some time ago, it was not unreasonable for the IJ to discredit Zheng\u2019s claim of faulty memory of an event that had taken place only six months previously. <em>Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81. This discrepancy, though perhaps minor, further undermines Zheng\u2019s credibility. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Additionally, Zheng\u2019s failure to submit his wife\u2019s sterilization certificate was another factor demonstrating his lack of credibility. Because Zheng asserted that his wife received a sterilization certificate, yet failed to produce it in evidence, it was reasonable for the IJ to rely on the lack of this particular corroboration to support the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Liang Chen v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 107 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">The IJ found that the same photograph of Zheng\u2019s wife appearing on two documents, the U.S. physician\u2019s report and the x-ray taken six-and-a-half years earlier, \u201ccast[s] further doubt ... on the reliability of this evidence.\u201d Without more information, we cannot say that this was a reasonable inference to be drawn. <em>See Li Zu Guan v. INS, </em>453 F.3d 129, 139 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the use of the same photograph on two documents reduced the applicant\u2019s credibility was an \u201cunjustified assumption\u201d). That said, considering the IJ\u2019s analysis as a whole, we find no basis to remand this case because we can confidently predict that on remand the agency would reach no different result. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Because Zheng was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>tion needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on his claims for withholding of removal or relief under CAT that were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir.1991). To the extent Zheng argued that he is eligible for CAT relief based on his illegal departure from China, he has failed to present a meaningful challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of relief on that basis and any such argument will be deemed waived. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">. Because Zheng\u2019s claims for relief from persecution, as articulated in this record, are based solely on the assertion that his wife was sterilized, a ground that no longer lies following our decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308-10 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc), which was issued after the petition in this case was filed, it is doubtful that Zheng\u2019s claim would survive on remand even if it were sent back to the agency for further consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
