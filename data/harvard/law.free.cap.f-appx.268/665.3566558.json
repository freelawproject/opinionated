We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-26\">Velasquez challenges the district court\u2019s application of the firearm enhancement listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the weapon was possessed in connection with the offense and that Velasquez failed to establish that it was \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the firearm was connected to the drug conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2); <em>United States v. Lopez-Sandoval, </em>146 F.3d 712, 715-16 (9th Cir.1998). We reject Velasquez\u2019s contention that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2) unfairly imposes a heightened burden on the defendant to disprove that the firearm was possessed in connection with the offense. <em>See United States v. Restrepo, </em>884 F.2d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-27\">Velasquez asserts that a condition of supervised release prohibiting him from wearing or possessing items which may connote membership in a criminal street gang is unconstitutionally vague and over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>broad. Because Velasquez did not challenge the imposition of the condition before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Abbouchi, </em>502 F.3d 850, 857 (9th Cir.2007). We conclude that the condition was not unconstitutionally vague. <em>See United States v. Soltero, </em>510 F.3d 858, 866 (9th Cir.2007). Furthermore, \u201cshould any difficulty arise on the margin, [he] can always seek clarification from the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>476 F.3d 719, 723 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
