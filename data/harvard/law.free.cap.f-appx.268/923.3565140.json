Nicholson, </em>No. 05-0473. Maria R. Bautista has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-31\">Bautista is the surviving wife of Valeri-ano C. Bautista, who served as a recognized guerilla in the Philippines between June 1945 and January 1946. He passed away in September 1986 from cardio-pul-monary arrest. His death certificate indicated that pulmonary tuberculosis was a contributing factor in his death. In November 2001, Bautista filed a claim for dependency and indemnity compensation. In January 2005, the Board of Veterans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>Appeals denied her claim, finding that the medical records contained no evidence that her husband had pulmonary tuberculosis while he was in service or within three years after his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Bautista appealed to the CAVC, arguing that the regional office (1) did not comply with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) because it failed to inform her who would be responsible for obtaining medical evidence to substantiate her claim; and (2) violated 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A(d) by not obtaining a medical opinion regarding her husband\u2019s cause of death and its relation to his military service. The CAVC affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, concluding that (1) under \u00a7 5103(a), the Board\u2019s finding that Bautista was provided adequate notice was not clearly erroneous; and (2) under \u00a7 5103A(d), the Board\u2019s determination that a medical opinion was not necessary in adjudicating Bau-tista\u2019s claim was not arbitrary or capricious. Bautista appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The Acting Secretary moves to summarily affirm the CAVC\u2019s decision, arguing that (1) pursuant to <em>Garrison v. Nicholson, </em>494 F.3d 1366 (Fed.Cir.2007), the CAVC correctly applied the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard in concluding that the regional office complied with the notice provisions of \u00a7 5103(a); and (2) the CAVC properly concluded that the regional office did not violate \u00a7 5103A(d) by not obtaining an additional medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir.1994). In the present case, it is clear that summary affirmance is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">In <em>Garrison, </em>the court affirmed the CAVC\u2019s application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review when reviewing the Board\u2019s finding that the Secretary had complied with his \u00a7 5103(a) notification requirements. <em>Garrison, </em>494 F.3d at 1370. In <em>Wells v. Principi, </em>326 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed.Cir.2003), the court concluded that, where there is no competent evidence to show a connection between a disability and military service, the Secretary is under no obligation to obtain a medical opinion. In light of the above cases, it is clear that the CAVC\u2019s decision was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">(1) The motion to summarily affirm is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
