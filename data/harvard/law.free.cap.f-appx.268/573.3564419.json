We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm the convictions on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">The district court did not err in instructing the jury that a false statement can be a statement \u201cthat was made or used with reckless indifference as to whether it was, in fact, true or false.\u201d We have repeatedly held that fraudulent intent may be shown by reckless indifference to the falsity of a statement. <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>233 F.3d 1117, 1136 (9th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s jury instruction was a correct statement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">Garro requests reversal because the jury instructions were not recorded and transcribed as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b)(1) (1982). Mere failure to transcribe part of a trial, however, \u201cdoes not require a per se rule of reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Carrillo, </em>902 F.2d 1405, 1409 (9th Cir.1990). Garro must demonstrate that \u201cthe missing portion of the transcript specifically prejudices his appeal before relief will be granted.\u201d <em>Id., citing United States v. Gillis, </em>773 F.2d 549, 554 (4th Cir.1985). He has not done so. Garro argues that the lack of record means that \u201cit is impossible to demonstrate how the instructions were given to the jury,\u201d but we require a more specific showing of prejudice than \u201cpotential unknown errors.\u201d <em>United States v. Anzalone, </em>886 F.2d 229, 232 (9th Cir.1989). Garro makes no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">Garro challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence, which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Walgren, </em>885 F.2d 1417, 1426 (9th Cir. 1989). The district court denied Garro\u2019s motion for a new trial because it deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>mined that the evidence of Garro\u2019s mental condition was neither new nor was its presentation at trial likely to produce an acquittal. <em>See United States v. Kulczyk, </em>931 F.2d 542, 548 (9th Cir.1991). The evidence was not new because concerns about Garro\u2019s psychological state had been raised prior to trial; the district court had even authorized CJA funds to obtain a psychological evaluation before trial. The evidence was not likely to result in an acquittal because the government presented voluminous evidence of intentional deceit. The district court clearly has not abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Garro argues that the government failed to disclose to him material, exculpatory evidence, violating his due process rights under <em>Brady. See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 674, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Garro contends generally that materials from the government\u2019s investigation of others should have been produced to him, but never explains what piece of evidence should have been given to him or how it would have been material to his defense. Allegedly suppressed evidence is not material when defendants have only a \u201chunch\u201d that the government had useful information. <em>United States v. Abonce-Barrera, </em>257 F.3d 959, 970 (9th Cir.2001). Furthermore, Garro\u2019s claim that the government\u2019s flow chart introduced at trial was false and misleading fails because the government never claimed that the chart was a complete representation of Garro\u2019s financial transactions and, in any case, he was able to cross-examine the witness who prepared the chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Finally, Garro contends that the district court\u2019s refusal to admit a tape recording during Cimaglia\u2019s testimony forced Garro to testify in order to lay the foundation for the tape, violating his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. However, any decision of Garro to testify in order to lay foundation for the tape\u2019s admission was a tactical one and not compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Perkins, </em>937 F.2d 1397, 1404-1405 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that a defendant\u2019s \u201ctactical deeision[ ]\u201d to testify based on his \u201cown subjective perception of what constitutes a proper trial strategy\u201d is not compulsion triggering the Fifth Amendment, even if the defendant felt it necessary to testify because of a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The issues dealing with the sentence imposed on Garro are considered in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
