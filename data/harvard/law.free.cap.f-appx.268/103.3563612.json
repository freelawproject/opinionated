Aug. 2, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 384 883 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 22, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 145 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Manzur v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 288-89 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, as the record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Zheng\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with her credible fear interview in several respects.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zheng testified that her mother began practicing Fa-lun Gong in 1998, and that Zheng began practicing in 2002 after seeing that Falun Gong improved her mother\u2019s health. At Zheng\u2019s credible fear interview, however, Zheng indicated that both she and her mother began practicing in 2002. The IJ did not err in drawing an adverse inference from this discrepancy and reasonably declined to accept Zheng\u2019s proffered explanation \u2014 that she made a mistake at her credible fear interview. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Likewise, Zheng testified that the authorities came to her home on December 23, 2002, but stated at her credible fear interview that this occurred in February 2003. Although minor discrepancies may not always provide support for an adverse credibility finding, <em>see Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000), we have held that where an applicant alleges an \u201cevent of major importance,\u201d a fact-finder \u201cmight reasonably expect him to have had a clear recollection\u201d of the date it occurred, <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 77 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc). </em>Because Zheng based her past persecution claim on the beating she allegedly suffered during her attempted arrest, the IJ reasonably based his adverse credibility determination in part on Zheng\u2019s inability to recall the date of this event.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The IJ noted further discrepancies as well. For example, while Zheng testified that she hid at her aunt\u2019s house for five months after her mother\u2019s arrest, she indicated at her credible fear interview that she hid \u201cin different locations.\u201d In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tion, while Zheng testified at her hearing that she physically struggled with the authorities when they came to arrest her, at her credible fear interview she made no mention of such a struggle, but indicated instead that she \u201cran out through the back\u201d when the authorities arrived, that they searched the house for her, and that she went into hiding. These inconsistencies, when considered cumulatively, provided additional support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Taken as a whole, the adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence and was a proper basis for the denial of Zheng\u2019s asylum claim. Moreover, because the only evidence of a threat to Zheng\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination also precluded success on Zheng\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, which were based on the same factual predicate as the asylum claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). The agency reasonably denied these claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. Although Zheng failed to challenge the reliability of the credible fear interview in her brief to this Court, we note that where, as here, there is no indication that an applicant's testimony has been coerced, unfairly truncated, or mistranslated in any material way, \u201cit is entirely appropriate that a factfinder consider such testimony when making a credibility assessment.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 398 (2d Cir.2005) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">. By failing to raise any challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination regarding her illegal departure claim either before the BIA or this Court, Zheng abandoned that claim. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
