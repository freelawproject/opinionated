We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the district court with regard to Dine\u2019s claims raised under California law, although on different grounds, and remand to the district court for reconsideration under <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc). Because the parties are aware of the facts in this case, we recount them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The district court properly held that the California Department of Insurance\u2019s Notice of Withdrawal of Approval and Order for Information dated February 27, 2004 (the \u201cCDI Notice\u201d) does not compel <em>de novo </em>review of MetLife\u2019s decision. Dine argues that the CDI Notice retroactively renders unenforceable the clause in the plan that grants MetLife discretion over benefits decisions. This court recently rejected the same argument in <em>Saffon v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Long Term Disability Plan, </em>511 F.3d 1206 (9th Cir.2008), where it held that \u201c[e]ven if federal law permitted states to nullify an ERISA plan\u2019s grant of discretionary authority, California law doesn\u2019t authorize the Commissioner to do so retroactively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1211 (citing Cal. Ins.Code \u00a7 10291.5(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">The district court was correct to apply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing MetLife\u2019s decision to deny benefits because the plan unambiguously provides MetLife with absolute discretion in making benefits decisions. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). However, when conducting its review for abuse of discretion, the district court analyzed Met-Life\u2019s \u201cstructural\u201d conflict of interest (as both the funding source and the administrator of the disability plan) using a two-part burden-shifting methodology. After the district court\u2019s decision, this court disapproved the burden-shifting methodology in <em>Abatie, </em>458 F.3d at 967. The district court also did not discuss what weight it gave to Dine\u2019s claims that MetLife violated ERISA\u2019s procedural requirements, which is now required under <em>Abatie. Id. </em>at 972. Further, the district court was deprived of the recognition in <em>Abatie </em>that the district court may, in its discretion, weigh facts and circumstances outside the administrative record when evaluating what effect the plan administrator\u2019s conflict of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>had on its decision-making process. <em>Id. </em>at 970. Because <em>Abatie </em>so significantly alters the abuse of discretion analysis, and allows the district court to consider facts beyond the administrative record, we hold that the district court should apply <em>Abatie </em>in the first instance. We therefore vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for reconsideration in light of <em>Abatie </em>and, if appropriate, for the receipt of additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In remanding this matter to the district court for further consideration in light of <em>Abatie, </em>we alert the district court to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>Glenn v. MetLife, </em>461 F.3d 660 (6th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted in MetLife v. Glenn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1117, 169 L.Ed.2d 845 (2008), which involves review of a discretionary denial of benefits by a plan administrator laboring under a structural conflict of interest. The Court granted certiorari on the following specific question, which might affect the district court\u2019s analysis on remand: \u201cIf an administrator that both determines and pays claims under an ERISA plan is deemed to be operating under a conflict of interest, how should that conflict be taken into account on judicial review of a discretionary benefit determination?\u201d The district court may wish to stay its review of Dine\u2019s claims until the Court has issued its decision in <em>Glenn, </em>which is scheduled for argument on April 23, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
