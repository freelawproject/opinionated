(\u201cVIP\u201d) and Donald D. Kaiser-man (\u201cKaiserman\u201d) (collectively \u201cthe appellants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of RLI Insurance Co. (\u201cRLI\u201d)\u2019s summary judgment motion. VIP asserts that Maria Hernandez (\u201cHernandez\u201d) was a VIP \u201cemployee\u201d and, therefore, RLI should have defended Hernandez\u2019s lawsuit against VIP and covered its liability arising out of that lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">In determining whether the duty to defend is triggered, one looks to the policy, the complaint, and all facts known to the insurer from any source. <em>Montrose Chem. Corp. of Cal. v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153, 1161 (1993) (citing <em>Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co., </em>65 Cal.2d 263, 54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168, 176-77 (1966)). Additionally, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract was formed governs the interpretation of an insurance contract. <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253, 1264 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anr\">Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract ([Cal.] Civ.Code \u00a7 1639). The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 1644), controls judicial interpretation. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1638.) Thus, if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-19\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-20\">\u201cEmployee\u201d is defined in the insurance contract as \u201cany person who receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>wages or a salary from the <em>Entity </em>for work that is directed and controlled by the <em>Entity, </em>including part-time, seasonal and temporary workers.... \u201d Thus, in order to be considered VIP\u2019s \u201cemployee\u201d for coverage purposes, Hernandez must receive wages or a salary from VIP. It is undisputed that Hernandez received her check from Queen of the Valley Hospital (\u201cQOV\u201d) each month. Thereafter, VIP would reimburse QOV for the amount of Hernandez\u2019s salary, plus an additional 26% for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The district court properly held that Hernandez \u201creceive[d] wages or a salary\u201d from QOV, not VIP. That VIP reimbursed QOV does not change that fact that QOV was the entity paying Hernandez\u2019s salary and that, therefore, Hernandez was not a VIP employee as defined by the insurance contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-14\">. We note that VIP has paid Hernandez bonuses during the Christmas holiday seasons. In their briefs, the appellants did not assert that a bonus constitutes a \"wage or salary\u201d under the insurance contract. In fact, when questioned on the subject at oral argument, counsel for VIP took the position that the bonuses VIP paid Hernandez were not \"a wage or salary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
