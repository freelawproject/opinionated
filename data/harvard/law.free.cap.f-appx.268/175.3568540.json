She claimed that she was first subjected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the insertion of an IUD in 1979 following the birth of her second child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, she claimed the IUD fell out and that she became pregnant again, delivering a daughter in 1981. After this delivery, Chen was subjected to yet another procedure to have the IUD replaced. She stated in her amended asylum application<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that she was forced to put her third child up for adoption in 1981 because the baby could not be placed on her household register. Prior to fleeing from China in 1993, Chen believed the Chinese Government was preparing to have her sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In January 1997, Chen was served with an Order to Show Cause charging that she was subject to deportation because she entered the United States as an alien without inspection. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (\u201cAn alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrives in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General, is inadmissible.\u201d). In August 2001, Chen married George Chen (\u201cGeorge\u201d), a United States citizen. The marriage prompted George to file a visa petition on her behalf, which allowed Chen to proceed with a consular process. After initially filing a motion to adjourn her deportation proceedings which was granted in February 2004, Chen filed another motion to adjourn removal proceedings and stated: \u201cEven if unable to obtain third country processing prior to her individual hearing ... she agree[s] to accept voluntary departure before this Court due to the likelihood of success, as she can demonstrate a bona fide marriage to a U.S. citizen.\u201d On April 12, 2005, the IJ withdrew Chen\u2019s application for asylum and granted her request for a voluntary departure within a year. However, Chen subsequently filed a motion to reopen deportation proceedings for reinstatement of her asylum application in March 2006. She divorced her husband, a U.S. citizen, in January 2006. Chen requested that the IJ reinstate and reopen her case to pursue asylum based on \u201cthe birth control related persecution that she suffered in China.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">On April 17, 2006, the IJ denied Chen\u2019s motion to reopen. The IJ determined that her second marriage to a U.S. citizen that ended in divorce was insufficient to justify reopening the proceedings and, furthermore, that Chen\u2019s age, marital status, and three adult children dictated that the possibility of a forced sterilization was \u201cboth remote and speculative at this point in time.\u201d Chen filed an appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial to the BIA. The BIA dismissed Chen\u2019s appeal. It concluded that the IJ had appropriately found that she had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA further explained that it was not persuaded that Chen was either \u201cprima facie eligible for asylum based on past forcible insertion\u201d of an IUD, or that forcible insertion of an IUD was \u201cin the same category as a forcible abortion or forced sterilization.\u201d It recognized that some Courts of Appeals had considered the issue of whether forcible insertion of IUDs constituted persecution under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), but noted that the Third Circuit had yet to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">This timely petition for review followed. Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>IJ\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen, and set forth its own brief rationale, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004). We review any findings of fact for substantial evidence and the ultimate denial for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Korytnyuk v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 272, 280 (3d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion will be found if the denial of a motion to reopen \u201cis arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Filja v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 241, 251 (3d Cir.2006). We are mindful that motions to reopen are generally disfavored. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Chen argues that the BIA abused its discretion by affirming the denial of her motion to reopen. She asserts that the IJ\u2019s finding that she did not establish that she had a well founded fear of future persecution was nothing more than speculation and conjecture. Because there is nothing of record to contradict her claim that the IUDs she had were forcibly inserted, she contends there is no support for the BIA\u2019s determination that she failed to meet her burden of proof. In addition, she contends that the refusal to grant her motion to reopen conflicts with the BIA\u2019s decision in a case remanded by the Seventh Circuit. <em>See Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 804 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We find no error in the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen. The determination that Chen did not have a well founded fear of forced sterilization was not irrational in light of Chen\u2019s willingness in 2005 to withdraw her application for asylum and to voluntarily depart to China, and Chen\u2019s age and circumstances when she filed her motion to reopen. Although Chen relies on <em>Zheng </em>as authority that she has a viable claim that warranted reopening her application, she fails to recognize that <em>Zheng\u2019s </em>persuasiveness in the case <em>sub judice </em>is limited for several reasons. First, the facts in <em>Zheng </em>are distinguishable as the alien was only thirty six years old and the BIA assumed that her testimony that she was repeatedly forced to have an IUD inserted, despite suffering complications after the first procedure and having the IUD removed on three occasions, was credible. Second, the BIA also assumed that the alien\u2019s theory of persecution was cognizable even though no court of appeals had yet to weigh in on whether an alien can establish persecution on the basis that she was forced to submit to the implantation of an IUD. Remand was required, the Seventh Circuit concluded, because the denial of Zheng\u2019s claim was unsupported and unreasoned in light of the operative assumptions. These assumptions, however, are not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Accordingly, we will deny Chen\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order affirming the IJ\u2019s refusal to reopen her application for asylum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-16\">. The BIA had jurisdiction over Chen\u2019s motion to reconsider pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2. We have appellate jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen because it is a final order of removal for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 171 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-5\">. Chen was born in Changle City, Fujian Province on March 21, 1953. She and her first husband, who died, have three children in China; two sons were born in 1975 and 1977 respectively, and a daughter was bom in 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\">. In her initial 1993 asylum application, Chen stated that officials had removed furniture from her home and warned her to have surgery. Chen did not assert that an IUD was forcibly inserted until she amended her asylum application in 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
