The District Court rejected Graham\u2019s contention that he had not been credited for time he spent in custody prior to his federal sentencing for bank robbery pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-20\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because we find that Graham\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-21\">We need not repeat the background of this case or the details of Graham\u2019s claim here as they are well-known to the parties and are summarized in the District Court\u2019s memorandum. For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, we conclude that Graham\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition was properly denied. In brief, as explained by the District Court, Graham has already received credit towards his federal sentence for his prior custody from August 27, 2003 through November 9, 2003, and from September 12, 2004 through May 1, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The remaining time period in question \u2014 November 10, 2003 through September 11, 2004 \u2014 was previously credited to the service of a state sentence, and therefore its credit to his federal sentence would constitute an improper double credit. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). <em>See also Rios v. Wiley, </em>201 F.3d 257, 272 (3d Cir.2000) (superseded by statute on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-22\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-24\">.
