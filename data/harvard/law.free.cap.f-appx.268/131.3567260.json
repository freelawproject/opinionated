Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b156-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Defendant-Appellant Kirk Perry appeals from a June 22, 2006 amended judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Sif-ton, J.) resentencing him to a prison term of 168 months for possessing with the intent to distribute approximately eight kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Perry was originally sentenced to the identical sentence on November 6, 2000, and following Perry\u2019s appeal, this Court remanded the case to the district court on May 10, 2005 for possible resentencing in conformity with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005). Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s decision for unreasonableness, both as to \u201cthe sentence itself\u2019 and \u201cthe procedures employed in arriving at the sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir. 2006), we find no merit to Perry\u2019s claim that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider his failed cooperation and extraordinary rehabilitation in relation to \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). On the contrary, the court specifically noted that \u201cthe law that applies in the evaluation of cooperation and the evaluation of rehabilitative efforts\u201d had changed since Perry\u2019s first sentencing, and that it was now permitted to consider post-conviction rehabilitative efforts and failed cooperation despite provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.19 and in the absence of a \u00a7 5K1.1 letter from the government. With respect to post-conviction rehabilitation, the court noted that \u201cthe facts as set forth by both [defense] counsel and by the defendant himself, are not disputed by the government and will be considered in my determination of the appropriate sentence; in particular the rehabilitative efforts while in prison.\u201d Regarding Perry\u2019s failed cooperation, the district court observed that the facts surrounding those efforts had not changed since Perry\u2019s original sentence was rendered, but that those facts were nevertheless subject to its consideration. Thereafter, the court conducted a comprehensive review of all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including how each was affected by any changes in law or fact since the original sentencing, and concluded that the original sentence was reasonable and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Perry argues that the district court incorrectly assumed that it could consider the two \u00a7 3553(a)(1) factors <em>only </em>if it chose to impose a non-guidelines sentence and, in so doing, afforded the guidelines an \u201cimproper presumption of reasonableness.\u201d However, the way the district court commenced its sentencing analysis makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>clear that it did not act on this assumption. Rather, to Perry\u2019s benefit, the court stated categorically that it would not impose a sentence greater than that imposed at Perry\u2019s original sentencing, which was the lowest sentence in the Guidelines range. Thus, as the court observed correctly before considering reasons to impose an even a lower sentence, the \u201cquestion is whether to impose a sentence that is either a departure from those guidelines or a non-guidelines sentence.\u201d It was in that context that the court stated that it did \u201cnot believe that [the Section 3553 factors] in this case trump the guidelines and that the advice of the guidelines as to the appropriate sentence provides a sentence which remains reasonable for this defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
