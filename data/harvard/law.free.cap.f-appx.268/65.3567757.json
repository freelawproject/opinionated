July 7, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 79 561 356 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Mar. 1, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">As a preliminary matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the pretermission of Dia\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law, Dia\u2019s argument he testified consistently and specifically as to his flight from Mauritania to Senegal does not present a question of law. Instead, it is a challenge to the IJ\u2019s factual determination regarding his date of arrival and whether he applied for asylum within one year of that date. We lack jurisdiction to review such arguments and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 328-29 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">As to Dia\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal and CAT relief, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. We afford substantial deference to demeanor \u2014 related findings. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Likewise, the record reflects the IJ\u2019s observation that Dia failed to testify to any specifics regarding his or his father\u2019s political activities, such as the name of the political organizations to which they belonged, despite being asked to do so repeatedly. Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ditionally, the IJ accurately observed an inconsistency between Dia\u2019s testimony that he was arrested due to his membership in a political organization and his statement in his 1-589 application that he was arrested due to a \u201cquerell [sic] with a white moor.\u201d That inconsistency was substantial when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>381 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Dia\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case precludes success on Dia\u2019s claims for both withholding of removal and CAT relief, which were based on the same alleged facts. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
