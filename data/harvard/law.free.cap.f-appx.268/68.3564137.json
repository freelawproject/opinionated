We assume in the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">As an initial matter, Olesniewicz spends nearly half of the argument section of his brief contending that in view of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Sixth Amendment bars a sentencing judge from finding facts pertinent to the determination of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range using a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. This is no longer an open question: We have repeatedly held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not affect a district judge\u2019s obligation to perform a Guidelines calculation or the burden of proof applicable to facts relevant to sentencing upon which that Guidelines calculation is made.\u201d <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>489 F.3d 555, 558 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 220 n. 15. (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cJudicial authority to find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence survives <em>Booker.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Aside from this general objection, Oles-niewicz specifically disputes two aspects of the Guidelines range calculated by the district court: (1) its determination that, in tandem with his codefendant, Rafal Grzy-bowski, he trafficked in 100 or more false immigration documents, resulting in a nine-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2); and (2) a four-level enhancement imposed by the district court pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(3) based on the court\u2019s determination that Oles-niewicz knew, believed, or had reason to believe that certain of the false immigration documents he sold were intended to be used in the commission of a felony offense \u201cother than an offense involving violation of the immigration laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u201cWe have long reviewed a district court\u2019s findings of fact as they apply to sentencing enhancements only for clear error.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>413 F.3d at 221. To reject a finding of fact as clearly erroneous, we must, after carefully reviewing the entire record, be \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). \u201cWhere a defendant asserts that a district court\u2019s factual findings cannot, as a matter of law, support a particular Guidelines enhancement, we conduct <em>de novo </em>review of that legal question.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>413 F.3d at 222 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">With respect to the enhancement under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2), Olesniewicz argues primarily that the district court did not make sufficient findings \u2014 and the Government did not adduce sufficient evidence\u2014 to support the court\u2019s determination that he and Grzybowski were engaged in a joint criminal undertaking such that his sentence could be enhanced as a result of sales made by Grzybowski. <em>See United States v. Mulder, </em>273 F.3d 91, 118 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cMere \u2018knowledge of another participant\u2019s criminal acts\u2019 or \u2018of the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of the overall operation\u2019 will not make a defendant criminally responsible for his co-defendants\u2019 acts.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Studley, </em>47 F.3d 569, 575 (2d Cir.1995)). Having reviewed the full record, however, we see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s decision to hold Olesniewicz accountable for \u201call unlawful immigration documents in which both defendants dealt.\u201d As the district court noted, Oles-niewicz frequently took to using the first-person plural when discussing his operation; a cooperating witness testified that Olesniewicz would often complete document requests that originated with Grzy-bowski; and perhaps most tellingly, Oles-niewicz made clear, in a conversation that was surreptitiously recorded by the Government, that he was available to \u201ctak[e] care of\u2019 matters whenever Grzybowski was away.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">As to the enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(3), Olesniewicz contends that the record at the hearing held pursuant to <em>United States v. Fatico, </em>603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir.1979), could not have supported the district court\u2019s finding that he knew (or, at the very least, should have known) what the recipients of these documents intended to do with them. The ruling was grounded in \u201cdirect evidence that [Olesniewicz] was aware specifically that [the] documents he provided were to be used to ... violate ... a non-immigration offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Olesniewicz here maintains, as he did at sentencing, that he did not fully appreciate the potential uses of these documents, the district court need not have credited his position. \u201cThe law ... recognizes that the <em>mens rea </em>elements of knowledge and intent can often be proved through circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>United States v. MacPherson, </em>424 F.3d 183, 189 (2d Cir.2005). Chief Judge Mukasey could therefore permissibly infer that an individual who traded in such documents well understood their significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">. At the time judgment was entered, current Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey was Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. In challenging this enhancement, Olesniew-icz also questions whether the district court appropriately counted blank documents toward the requisite number. The Government urges us to take this opportunity to join other circuits that have found \"no reason to distinguish between completed and uncompleted documents\u201d in these circumstances, <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>70 F.3d 351, 352 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>see also United States v. Castellanos, </em>165 F.3d 1129, 1132 (7th Cir. 1999). Because we affirm the district court's finding as to the scope of the joint enterprise, we need not reach this question. In tandem with Grzy-bowski, Olesniewicz trafficked in at least 100 documents that were not blank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-11\">. Although the district court looked to one side of split authority for its construction of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(3), we have no occasion to decide if it correctly endorsed the formulation of this enhancement used in the Eleventh Circuit, <em>see United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248 (11th Cir.2004), or should instead have followed the approach of the Eighth Circuit, <em>see United States v. Lazaro-Guadarrama, </em>71 F.3d 1419 (8th Cir.1995). Olesniewicz failed to raise this issue in his brief on appeal. \u201cOrdinarily, we cannot reach out and consider issues the defendant himself did not raise or brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Crispo, </em>306 F.3d 71, 86 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
