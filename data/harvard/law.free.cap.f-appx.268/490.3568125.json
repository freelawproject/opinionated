For reversal, petitioners assert the agency violated their right to due process by failing to give sufficient consideration to their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-23\">We note that the order petitioners asked the BIA to reconsider- \u2014 its discretionary decision that petitioners failed to qualify for cancellation of removal \u2014 was itself un-reviewable. Therefore, we conclude that we also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b) (cancellation-of-removal eligibility requirements for nonpermanent residents); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) (no court shall have jurisdiction to review any discretionary judgment regarding granting relief under, inter alia, \u00a7 1229b); <em>Zacarias-Velasquez v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 429, 434 (8th Cir.2007) (whether alien meets exceptional-and-extremely-unusual-hardship threshold is \u201cprecisely the discretionary determination that Congress shielded from our review\u201d under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)); <em>cf. Rodriguez v. Ashcroft, </em>253 F.3d 797, 800 (5th Cir.2001) (if appellate court is divested of jurisdiction to review original hardship decision, it must also be divested of jurisdiction to review denial of motion to reopen; \u201cto hold otherwise would create a loophole that would thwart the clear intent of Congress that the courts not review the discretionary decisions of the BIA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-24\">Although petitioners purport to raise a due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s order, <em>see Munoz-Yepez v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 347, 351 (8th Cir.2006) (appeals court has jurisdiction to review constitutional claims raised in petition for review), we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>their challenge merely attacks the substance of the BIA\u2019s decision, <em>see Meraz-Reyes v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 842, 843 (8th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (although appellate review includes constitutional challenges, \u201ca petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an abuse of discretion argument in constitutional garb\u201d) (quoting <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001)); <em>see also Saloum v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>437 F.3d 238, 243-44 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam) (alien\u2019s invocation of due process language in petition for review of discretionary denial of removal relief did not allege colorable constitutional violation; alien did not allege denial of full and fair hearing or that he was otherwise denied due process, but only alleged that IJ erred in weighing evidence and reached wrong outcome).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
