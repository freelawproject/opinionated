Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history, we will not recount it here. We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings, including the determination that a petitioner has not established eligibility for asylum, for substantial evidence. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000). We grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Bibi did not suffer past persecution. In its analysis, the BIA failed to consider <em>Surita v. INS, </em>95 F.3d 814 (9th Cir.1996), a case quite similar to the one at bar. Indeed, Bibi presented even more significant evidence of persecution than did the petitioner in <em>Surita. </em>Bibi\u2019s home was invaded, her husband assaulted, and her family was forcibly removed from their home and driven into the jungle. The police refused to investigate the crime. Bibi tried to regain possession of her home for three months, but her family was refused entrance. Bibi was also told that she would be killed if she attempted to reclaim her house or any of the stolen property. This incident was preceded by other assaults and an episode in which all the family\u2019s livestock was slaughtered. Under <em>Surita, </em>the evidence Bibi presented compels the conclusion that Bibi suffered past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">\u201cA finding of past persecution triggers a regulatory presumption that the applicant has a well-founded fear of future persecution, which provisionally establishes the applicant\u2019s refugee status and eligibility for asylum.\u201d <em>Surita, </em>95 F.3d at 821; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). To rebut this presumption, the government must show \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, that since the time the persecution occurred conditions in the applicant\u2019s country ... have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of being persecuted if ... [she] were to return.\u201d <em>Surita, </em>95 F.3d at 821 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Here, Bibi has demonstrated that she was persecuted, so the presumption that she has a well-founded fear applies. Additionally, \u201c[i]f an applicant\u2019s \u2018life or freedom was threatened in the proposed country\u2019 \u201d of removal, a presumption that the applicant is entitled to withholding of removal is triggered. <em>Surita, </em>95 F.3d at 821 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16). We therefore remand this case to the BIA to resolve whether the United States can produce sufficient evidence to rebut, by a preponderance of the evidence, these two regulatory presumptions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Finally, because Bibi presented no evidence that she was tortured in Fiji, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a) (defining \u201ctorture\u201d), the BIA reasonably concluded that Bibi had not demonstrated she was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be subjected to torture if returned to Fiji.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b562-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
