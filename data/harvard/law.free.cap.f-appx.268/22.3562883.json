Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005). On appeal, he contends that his counsel provided ineffective assistance to him by failing to present certain arguments that, if made to the District Court, \u201cwould, most probably, have made a difference\u201d to the outcome of the <em>Crosby </em>remand. Appellant\u2019s Br. 14. At oral argument, he advanced the additional claim that the District Court failed to adequately discharge its duties on the <em>Crosby </em>remand. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">The Supreme Court has observed that, \u201cin most cases[,] a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective-assistance.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>accord United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 99-100 (2d Cir.2003). This is because it is generally better for ineffective assistance of counsel claims to \u201cbe litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.\u201d <em>Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690; <em>accord Khedr, </em>343 F.3d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">In keeping with the approach suggested by the Supreme Court, we decline to consider Toro\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims at this stage of his case. We therefore turn to Toro\u2019s claims regarding the District Court\u2019s conduct of the <em>Crosby </em>remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">Toro, adverting to the District Court\u2019s observation that the sentence originally imposed upon him was \u201creasonable,\u201d contends that the District Court used the wrong legal standard in deciding not to resentence him. However, the District Court\u2019s remark does not indicate \u2014 nor does our review of the record reveal \u2014 that the District Court failed to consider the requirements of section \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[W]e entertain a strong presumption that the sentencing judge has considered all arguments properly presented to her, unless the record clearly suggests otherwise. This presumption is especially forceful when, as was the case here, the sentencing judge makes abundantly clear that she has read the relevant submissions and that she has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 29, <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). In the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>stant case, the District Court declined to resentence Toro based on its understanding that the sentence imposed upon Toro appropriately reflected \u201call of the factors enumerated in Section 3553(a).\u201d Joint Appendix 90. When arriving at this conclusion, the District Court took particular note of \u201cthe nature and extent of Toro\u2019s criminal conduct and his obstruction of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Toro points to no evidence (1) contradicting the District Court\u2019s conclusions or (2) suggesting that the District Court misunderstood or misperceived any factual matters relevant to sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor is such evidence revealed by our review of the record. For these reasons, we decline to conclude that the District Court\u2019s refusal to resentence Toro was procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that a district court \u201cdemonstrate^] the adequate discharge of the duty to \u2018consider\u2019 matters relevant to sentencing\u201d if the court is \u201caware of both the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable, and nothing in the record indicates misunderstanding about such materials or misperception about their relevance\u201d). We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aq\">. Toro contends that the outcome of the <em>Crosby </em>remand would have been different had the District Court considered Toro's assistance to the government, Toro's acceptance of responsibility, and the conditions under which Toro was confined while awaiting extradition from Colombia to the United States. We disagree with the factual premise of Toro\u2019s argument. As the record reveals, the District Court was clearly aware of these factors but deemed them insufficient to warrant a below-Guidelines sentence in light of, <em>inter alia, </em>Toro's repeated lies to the Government \u201c[djuring proffer sessions following his arrest,\u201d his commission of perjury during his <em>Fatico </em>hearing, and his decision to \"jump[] bail and fle[e] to Canada and Colombia.\u201d <em>See </em>Joint Appendix 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
