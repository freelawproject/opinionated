Salvatierra appeals his 210-month sentence, arguing that the district court improperly applied a five-point enhancement to his offense level computation under Section 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). Salvatierra also contends that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of this case for abuse of discretion, and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimbrew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1151 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). The district court imposed a five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) because Salvatierra\u2019s offense involved the distribution of child pornography with the expectation of receiving a thing of value. We assume without deciding that a clear and convincing evidence standard is appropriate in this case because the enhancement arguably had \u201c \u2018an extremely disproportionate effect\u2019 \u201d on Salvatierra\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Pike, </em>473 F.3d 1053, 1057 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Hopper, </em>177 F.3d 824, 832-33 (9th Cir.1999)). As the record reveals, the child pornographic images Salvatierra sent from his email account to other consumers of child pornography were accompanied by messages such as \u201cyou can pic trade wit [sic] me,\u201d \u201chope to chat soon and pic trade,\u201d and \u201cIf you do have any [photographs of a particular minor], I\u2019d pay good $$$ for them for sure!!! ... Here are a few sexy ones you might like.\u201d Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that Salvatierra had an expectation of barter is supported by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) appl. n. 1 (\u201c\u2018Thing of value\u2019 means anything of valuable consideration^ including], in a case involving the bartering of child pornographic material, ... the child pornographic material received in exchange for other child pornographic material bartered in consideration for the material received.\u201d). The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Furthermore, Salvatierra\u2019s 210-month sentence, which lies at the bottom of the Guidelines range calculated in the Presentence Investigation Report, is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1280 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that this Court reviews sentences imposed by the district courts for reasonableness in the absence of error in applying the Guidelines). Salvatierra argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the \u201cneed to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). In particular, Salvatierra points our attention to the shorter sentences imposed on two individuals with whom he had corresponded and to whom he had distributed child pornography. In separate proceedings before different district judges, these defendants received 96- and 121-month prison terms, respectively. There is nothing in the record, however, to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>that those defendants distributed child pornography with the expectation of gaining a thing of value, thus subjecting them to the five-level sentencing enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B). The district court also pointed out that Salvatierra\u2019s child pornography collection exceeded that of one of the other defendants by a multiple of hundreds. Thus, the sentencing disparity between Salvatierra and the other two defendants does not render Salvati-erra\u2019s sentence unreasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The sentence imposed by the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>by 9th Cir.
