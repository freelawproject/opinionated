Instead, the district court entered a final judgment awarding compensation to Cape Ann Towing in the amount of $2706.37 on the basis of <em>quantum meruit </em>for marine towing services.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In order to establish a claim for a salvage award, a potential salvor must demonstrate (1) the existence of a maritime peril from which the property could not have been saved without the salvor\u2019s assistance; (2) a voluntary act on the part of the salvor; and (3) the salvor\u2019s success in saving the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Klein v. Unidentified Wrecked &amp; Abandoned Sailing Vessel, </em>758 F.2d 1511, 1515 (11th Cir.1985); <em>see also Fort Myers Shell &amp; Dredging Co. v. Barge NBC 512, </em>404 F.2d- 137, 139 (5th Cir.1968)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (explaining that the maritime peril need not be imminent but rather reasonably apprehended).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">On appeal, Cape Ann Towing argues that the district court erred in its determination that the M/Y Universal Lady was not in a situation of reasonable apprehension of maritime peril at the time Cape Ann Towing rendered its services. Additionally, Cape Ann Towing argues that the district court erred in calculating the compensation owed to Cape Ann Towing based on the standard hourly rate for marine towing rather than on the per foot of vessel charge which is customary in a salvage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">We are not permitted to set aside the judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury in an admiralty case, unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>McAllister v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954); <em>Harbor Tug &amp; Barge, Inc. v. Belcher Towing Co., </em>733 F.2d 823, 825 (11th Cir.1984). The district court\u2019s findings of fact are also reviewed for clear error. <em>See Flagship Marine Servs., Inc. v. Belcher Towing Co., </em>966 F.2d 602, 604 (11th Cir.1992), <em>reinstated by </em>23 F.3d 341 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Upon review of the district court\u2019s detailed factual findings of the circumstances under which Cape Ann Towing rendered services to M/Y Universal Lady, we find that the district court did not clearly err in its determination that the M/Y Universal Lady was not in a situation where there was a reasonable apprehension of maritime peril, thereby precluding Cape Ann Towing from entitlement to a salvage award. Notwithstanding Cape Ann Towing\u2019s assertions that the weather was still perilous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>and M/Y Universal Lady was positioned next to and above broken concrete pilings, upon review of the evidence presented at the non-jury trial, the district court found that (1) the weather had dramatically improved from the earlier hurricane conditions; (2) the M/Y Universal Lady was located in a marina, afloat, and secured by a rope to another boat, and (3) Cape Ann Towing had presented no credible evidence that the concrete pilings had damaged or posed further risk of damage to M/Y Universal Lady\u2019s hull.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The district court\u2019s factual findings cannot be reversed unless they are clearly erroneous such that \u201calthough there is evidence to support [them], the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d McAllister, 348 U.S. at 20, 75 S.Ct. 6. We do not find any such mistake here. While we recognize that there were strong wind conditions at the time Cape Ann Towing came upon the M/Y Universal Lady, the evidence presented also showed that the center of the hurricane had already passed through the area and was moving to the northeast. Thus, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that the weather conditions did not support a reasonable apprehension of maritime peril where the adverse weather conditions had begun to dissipate and would continue to do so as the hurricane moved on its northeastern track. Furthermore, although M/Y Universal Lady was next to several broken concrete pilings, the testimonial evidence and photographs demonstrate that she was afloat in the marina, secured by rope to another yacht and without any apparent damage that would have put her at risk of sinking. Given these circumstances, coupled with the improving weather conditions, we cannot state that the district court clearly erred in concluding that the broken concrete pilings did not pose a reasonable apprehension of maritime peril to M/Y Universal Lady.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Additionally, we find no merit to Cape Ann Towing\u2019s argument that the district court should have awarded compensation for the rendered services on a per foot of vessel charge typically used in salvage situations as the district court concluded that Cape Ann Towing had not established that it acted as a salvor to M/Y Universal Lady.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">. Salvage awards have been awarded as a matter of public policy to encourage seamen to render aid in emergency situations and are not limited to <em>quantum meruit </em>compensation but rather take into consideration several factors first articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>The Blackwall, </em>77 U.S.(10 Wall. 1) 1, 14, 19 L.Ed. 870 (1869), including the value of the property saved, the time and skill of the rescuers and degree of danger involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-13\">. At trial, the parties did not dispute that the actions of Cape Ann Towing were voluntary and successful, but rather only disagreed whether M/Y Universal Lady was subject to a maritime peril.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-14\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc), </em>the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b927-6\">. We also note that unlike other maritime salvage cases where courts have found the presence of a maritime peril, M/Y Universal Lady had not been driven aground, was not on fire, was not leaking with the possibility of sinking, nor was she at the mercy of the sea due to a collision or loss of power. <em>See Fine v. Rockwood, </em>895 F.Supp. 306, 309 (S.D.Fla. 1995) (listing numerous cases where courts historically have found the existence of a maritime peril for purposes of a salvage award).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
