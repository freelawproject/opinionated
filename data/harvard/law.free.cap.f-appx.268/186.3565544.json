Exostoses are benign bony growths that can cause varying degrees of pain and discomfort, can reappear if removed through surgery, and can grow to the size of a baseball. Denzel walks with a limp, apparently due to surgery that he had in 1996 to excise exostoses. Reactive depression/dysthymic disorder is marked by depressed mood, blunted affect, periods of restlessness, a soft-spoken nature, and anger episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Denzel\u2019s application for benefits, filed in early 2008, was denied initially and upon reconsideration by the local Social Security Administration office. After Ms. Morrison subsequently requested a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Denzel was not disabled for SSI purposes and thus was not entitled to benefits. Ms. Morrison appealed to the Appeals Council, which rejected her request to review the ALJ\u2019s decision. She then appealed to the District Court, which, as noted above, affirmed the denial of benefits. For the reasons discussed below, we will in turn affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1388(c)(3) and we now have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In situations like this, in which the Appeals Council has denied the appellant\u2019s request to review the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits, we review the decision of the ALJ. <em>Matthews v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 589, 592 (3d Cir.2001). In doing so, we apply the same standard as the District Court: we review all legal issues de novo and all factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Jones v. Barnhart, </em>364 F.3d 501, 503 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Knepp v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir.2000). Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>364 F.3d at 503. In order to allow us to conduct our review, the ALJ must give a reasoned explanation for his decision, including how he factored in evidence that arguably pointed to the opposite conclusion. <em>Burnett v. Comm\u2019r, </em>220 F.3d 112, 119-20 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 705 (3d Cir.1981). In <em>Jones, </em>we made clear that the purpose of this requirement is \u201cto ensure sufficient development of the record and explanation of findings to permit meaningful review.\u201d 364 F.3d at 505. The ALJ does not need \u201cto use particular language or adhere to a particular format in conducting his analysis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\"><em>A </em>child under eighteen is only eligible for SSI benefits if (1) he is not doing substantial gainful activity; (2) he has a medically determinable impairment or combination of impairments that is severe; and (3) the impairment or combination of impairments meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the severity of one or more of the impairments listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. 20 C.F.R \u00a7 416.924. An impairment or combination of impairments functionally equals a listed impairment if it causes a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in two of six areas of functioning or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one of those six areas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The six areas are (1) acquiring and using information, (2) attending and completing tasks, (3) interacting and relating with others, (4) moving about and manipulating objects, (5) caring for oneself, and (6) health and physical well-being. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The ALJ found that Denzel was not engaged in substantial gainful activity and that his three impairments were all severe. However, the ALJ also found that none of the impairments \u2014 whether on their own or in combination with one another \u2014 met, medically equaled, or functionally equaled a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Of Denzel\u2019s three impairments, there are only listings for asthma. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 3.03, 103.03. The ALJ found that Denzel\u2019s condition did not meet these listings, as there was no evidence of pulmonary-function testing, emergency room visits, inpatient hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, prolonged inhalation therapy, or chronic wheezing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Since there is no listing for exostoses, the ALJ analyzed whether Denzel\u2019s condition was medically equivalent to what he thought were the most analogous listed impairments \u2014 \u201cmajor dysfunction of a joint,\u201d \u201cfracture of the femur, tibia, pelvis, or one or more of the tarsal bones,\u201d and \u201cfracture of an upper extremity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1.02, 1.06, 1.07, 101.02, 101.06, 101.07. The ALJ concluded that Denzel\u2019s condition was not medically equivalent to any of these because, <em>inter alia, </em>he did not have the \u201cinability to ambulate effectively,\u201d which is a basic requirement for all listed musculo-skeletal impairments. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1.00(B)(2), 101.00(B)(2). As the regulations explain, the \u201cinability to ambulate effectively\u201d comprises \u201can extreme limitation of the ability to walk\u201d and is generally defined as \u201chaving insufficient lower extremity functioning to permit independent ambulation without the use of a hand-held assistive device(s) that limits the function of both upper extremities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ acknowledged that Denzel \u201cexperienced periods of difficulty walking of varying lengths, did receive home tutoring for a couple of months in 2003 as a result, has been provided with handicapped bus transportation for school, has been given a key to operate the elevator at school, and has received a special accommodation at school for fire drill evacuations.\u201d (App.25.) However, the ALJ found that these factors were outweighed by the fact that Denzel walked home from school (even though he had the option to take the handicapped bus) and generally participated in gym, including playing basketball, volleyball, and baseball.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The ALJ also compared Denzel\u2019s condition to the listings for mood and affective disorders, which he thought were the most analogous to reactive depression/dysthymic disorder. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 12.04, 102.04. The ALJ provided an extensive explanation for why Den-zel\u2019s condition was not medically equivalent to either listing, including a criterion-by-criterion analysis of why Denzel does not have a major depressive syndrome and why his depression does not limit his mental functioning to the degree required by \u00a7 12.04 and \u00a7 102.04. Among other things, the ALJ found it significant that Denzel enjoyed playing games, was interested in his school work and generally received good grades, had a few friends, was on student council, cared for his grooming and hygiene the same as other children his age, was generally cooperative during his periodic psychotherapy sessions, was able to self-cope, and had no difficulty concentrating, no fatigue, and no suicidal thoughts. Moreover, in March 2003, Den-zel\u2019s teacher could not identify any limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tion in the areas of interacting and relating with others or caring for oneself.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Finally, the ALJ determined that Den-zel\u2019s impairments were not functionally equivalent to any listed impairment. Specifically, he found that Denzel\u2019s impairments caused no limitation in the domains of acquiring and using information, attending and completing tasks, and caring for oneself, and caused less-than-marked limitations in the domains of interacting and relating with others, moving about and manipulating objects, and health and physical well-being. Once again, the ALJ provided a significant explanation for his conclusion, some of which referred back to his analysis of why Denzel\u2019s condition did not meet or medically equal any listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Throughout, the ALJ gave substantial weight to the opinions of the doctors from the state\u2019s Disability Determination Service (\u201cDDS\u201d), who thought that Denzel\u2019s exostoses and asthma did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal a listed impairment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Ms. Morrison makes a number of arguments on appeal. First, she contends that, in conducting his medical equivalence analysis, the ALJ compared Denzel\u2019s exostoses to the wrong condition. She maintains that the most similar listing was for \u201cdeficit of musculoskeletal function due to deformity or musculoskeletal disease,\u201d entailing \u201cwalking [that] is markedly reduced in speed or distance despite orthotic or prosthetic devices,\u201d and that Denzel\u2019s condition is medically equivalent to it. However, this is <em>former </em>listing 101.03, which was eliminated when the listings were amended in 2001. <em>See </em>Revised Medical Criteria for Determination of Disability, Musculoskele-tal System and Related Criteria, 66 Fed Reg. 58,010, 58,021 (2001). As discussed above, \u201cinability to ambulate effectively\u201d is now required for any musculoskeletal impairment. Given the fact that Denzel generally participated in gym and walked home from school, a reasonable mind could conclude that, despite his condition, Denzel did not meet this requirement. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Denzel was not unable to ambulate effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Ms. Morrison also argues that the ALJ failed to consider Denzel\u2019s three impairments in combination with one another and that we should therefore remand with instructions for him to do so. The ALJ, however, explicitly indicated a number of times that he was considering the impairments in combination. (App.25, 27, 28.) We see no reason not to believe him.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Finally, Ms. Morrison contends that the ALJ\u2019s functional equivalence analysis was conclusory and maintains that Denzel\u2019s condition is in fact functionally equivalent to the listings. Specifically, she asserts that Denzel suffers from marked limitations in four domains: relating with others, moving about and manipulating objects, caring for one\u2019s self, and health and well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s explanation of why Denzel had either no limitation or a less-than-marked limitation in each of these four domains was sufficient \u201cto permit meaningful review,\u201d <em>see Jones, </em>364 F.3d at 505, and, moreover, that his ultimate findings are supported by substantial evidence. Regarding the domain of interacting and relating with others, the ALJ referred back to his thorough analysis of why Denzel\u2019s condition was not medically equivalent to the listings for mood and affective disorders. Regarding the domain of moving about and manipulating objects, the ALJ referred back to his more-than-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>sufficient analyses of why Denzel\u2019s condition did not meet the listings for asthma and was not medically equivalent to analogous listings for musculoskeletal impairments. Regarding the domain of caring for oneself, the ALJ referred back again to his in-depth comparison of Denzel\u2019s condition to the listings for mood and affective disorders. Lastly, the domain of health and physical well-being contemplates \u201cthe cumulative physical effects of physical or mental impairments and their associated treatments or therapies on [the child\u2019s] functioning\u201d that were not considered under the domain of moving about and manipulating objects. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(l). Here, the ALJ referred once more to his prior discussion of why Denzel\u2019s condition neither met the listings for asthma nor medically equaled the listings for musculoskeletal impairments and, again, gave substantial weight to the DDS doctors\u2019 opinions. In explaining his conclusion, the ALJ acknowledged that pain caused by Denzel\u2019s exostoses sometimes wakes him up at night and has caused him to be absent from school for significant periods of time; however, the ALJ also highlighted the fact that special accommodations, including home-tutoring, have been provided to allow Denzel to continue to attend school and that the treatment he has received since February 2003 \u2014 a combination of physical therapy, rest, alcohol rubs, and occasional non-narcotic prescription medication \u2014 provide him with some relief from his pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">For the reasons discussed above, we will AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\">.
