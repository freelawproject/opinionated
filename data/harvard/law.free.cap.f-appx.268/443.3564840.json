BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In 1995, after 20 years of marriage, Frank Mandeville left his wife Janet. When Janet was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, Frank didn\u2019t return, didn\u2019t call, didn\u2019t write. For at least the last 18 months of Janet\u2019s life, Janet had no contact with Frank. But they never divorced, Janet never sought a court declaration that he had abandoned her, and Janet never replaced Frank as the beneficiary on her employment benefits plans. She had worked for Comerica, Inc. and Standard Federal Bank, and had survivor benefits from both.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Shortly before her impending death, Janet tried to direct all of her assets to her sister, Susan Tkachik, to prevent anything from going to her estranged husband Frank. Janet executed a trust and a will, and she signed forms attempting to change the beneficiary of her Comerica and Standard Federal benefits. After her death, Frank challenged the will and trust, but the Macomb County (Michigan) Probate Court denied his challenge on finding that he had intentionally abandoned Janet, and therefore, was not a \u201csurviving spouse,\u201d pursuant to M.C.L. \u00a7 700.2801(2)(e)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In the present case, Ms. Tkachik and Frank both claim Janet\u2019s non-testate benefits, and the simple fact is that, although she made some effort to do so, Janet did not do all of the things necessary to change the beneficiary before she died, so Frank remains the beneficiary. Ms. Tka-chik sued Comerica, Standard Federal, and Frank, to stop the distribution to Frank, but the district court rendered summary judgment against her as to all three defendants. On appeal, Ms. Tkachik reargues the same theories she raised to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">After carefully reviewing the record, the law, the briefs, and the arguments by counsel, we conclude that the district court\u2019s opinion correctly sets out the applicable law and correctly applies that law to the facts contained in the record. The issuance of a full written opinion by this court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
