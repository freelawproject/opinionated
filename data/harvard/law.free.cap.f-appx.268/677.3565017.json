We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>due process challenges to immigration decisions. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s asylum claim on the basis of an adverse credibility finding. Chen\u2019s documentary evidence was inconsistent with his testimony regarding matters that go to the heart of his claim, including whether he was detained by the family planning unit or the local police, and whether he was released from detention after paying a fine or instead escaped. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In his opening brief, Chen failed to raise, and therefore has waived, any challenge to the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determinations that he is ineligible for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chen filed a frivolous asylum application. <em>Cf. Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.20, and laying out criteria for finding an application is frivolously filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Chen\u2019s claim that the IJ violated his due process rights by denying his request for a continuance is denied because he fails to show prejudice. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Chen\u2019s claim that the IJ\u2019s questioning violated his due process rights also fails, because the Due Process Clause does not preclude an IJ from asking questions of witnesses, and because Chen has fails to show prejudice. <em>See Antonio-Cruz v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1129, 1131 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b701-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
