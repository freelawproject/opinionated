He contends that the district court erred in applying a sentencing adjustment for obstruction of justice. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d 815, 817 (5th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Even if Krezdorn were correct, the adjustment for obstruction of justice would be proper with respect to the bribery convictions from related case no. 2:04-CR-290 (bribery case), with which the instant offense was grouped for sentencing purposes and which formed the basis for the sentence in this case. He did not contend that the obstruction adjustment was erroneous in the bribery case, and we have already affirmed the sentence in that case. <em>United States v. Krezdorn, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -,---, 2007 WL 3230409, at *1-2 (5th Cir. Oct. 31, 2007). Thus, even if the adjustment for obstruction of justice were not properly applicable to the instant offense of conviction, the sentencing calculus under the applicable grouping provisions would not be affected. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
