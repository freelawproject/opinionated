He appeals the district court\u2019s judgment following a trial in the bankruptcy court declaring him liable to Huntington under Michigan law for breach of transfer and endorsement warranties. He also appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that his liability to Huntington constitutes debt that is non-discharge-able in bankruptcy. Huntington cross-appeals the district court\u2019s rejection of its racketeering claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Appellant McCann is a Texas dentist. From 2001 through 2002, McCann, through his Michigan connection Kenneth Vandenberg, deposited numerous checks into a Michigan account serviced by Huntington. These checks were subsequently returned to Huntington from the respective drawee banks as forged or altered. As the bankruptcy court would later determine, McCann somehow obtained checks payable to various third parties, added his name to the checks as an alternative payee, then sent them to Vandenberg in Michigan for deposit. McCann sent for deposit other checks that were not only altered but wholly counterfeit. McCann was able to withdraw significant funds from the Huntington account before the bank discovered the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">Huntington initially filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, claiming damages of almost $300,000. However, on June 25, 2004, McCann filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of Texas, thereby triggering an automatic stay of Huntington\u2019s Michigan suit under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. Huntington filed a complaint in McCann\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding, claiming McCann was liable for breach of various warranties established by Michigan statutes governing the exchange of negotiable instruments. Huntington also claimed that it was entitled to treble damages due to McCann\u2019s violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">The bankruptcy court found that McCann incurred liability under Michigan law as a transferor and endorser of the altered checks. The court also found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">(1) McCann \u201cknew that the checks ... he endorsed were counterfeit, forged, or altered and that he was not an authorized payee of the checks;\u201d (2) \u201cMcCann intended Huntington to rely\u201d on McCann\u2019s false representations; (3) \u201cHuntington did rely on those\u201d repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>sentations; and (4) Huntington suffered damages as a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">These findings, according to the bankruptcy court, triggered numerous provisions in the bankruptcy code each of which renders fraudulently incurred debt non-dischargea-ble.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In its final order, the bankruptcy court: (1) awarded Huntington $252,867.55 in damages for McCann\u2019s breach of transfer and endorsement warranties; (2) awarded Huntington $81,550 in attorney\u2019s fees; and (3) declared these awards to be non-dis-chargeable debt. The bankruptcy court, on jurisdictional grounds, severed Huntington\u2019s RICO claim for district court review. Notwithstanding its decision to defer adjudication of Huntington\u2019s RICO claim the bankruptcy court issued Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which it recommended to the district court a RICO judgment in Huntington\u2019s favor and an award of treble damages in the amount of $758,602.65. After withdrawing its reference of the case to bankruptcy court, the district court adopted the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings except for the proposed finding of McCann\u2019s liability under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">McCann, <em>pro se, </em>now argues that: (1) he is entitled to remand because the Western District of Michigan improperly exercised personal jurisdiction over him in Huntington\u2019s original suit; (2) the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings cannot withstand factual sufficiency review; (3) he was denied due process because the bankruptcy trustee refused to allow him access to records he claims were necessary for him to mount a meaningful defense; (4) the bankruptcy court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained by Huntington through a subpoena; and (5) the bankruptcy court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is \u201cexcessive and improper.\u201d Huntington cross-appeals the district court\u2019s ruling that it failed to establish McCann\u2019s liability under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">A. Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">McCann first argues that the Western District of Michigan, where Huntington filed its initial suit, lacked personal jurisdiction over him. McCann asserts that the financial distress he suffered as a result of having to initially defend against Huntington\u2019s claims in Michigan caused him to file for bankruptcy in the Southern District of Texas. His theory is that the Texas proceedings never would have commenced were it not for the Michigan suit. Thus, McCann urges the Court to consider whether the Western District of Michigan\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was proper, and, if it was not, conclude that such renders the entirely independent Texas proceedings unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">It is difficult to fathom McCann\u2019s argument that the lower Texas courts lacked jurisdiction over his person, given that he was the party who initiated the Texas proceeding. In any event, McCann did not assert lack of personal jurisdiction in the courts below, nor does he claim to have raised personal jurisdiction issues in the Western District of Michigan. Parties \u201cmay not advance on appeal new theories or raise new issues not properly [raised] before the district court.... \u201d <em>Little v. Liq</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>uid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1071 n. 1 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Even if McCann did have a plausible argument that the Western District of Michigan wrongfully exercised personal jurisdiction, he provides no support for the proposition that the tenuous causal relationship between the Michigan and Texas suits compromises the legitimacy of the latter. Thus, McCann has no valid personal jurisdiction argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">B. McCann\u2019s Evidentiary Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">McCann next argues that the district court\u2019s judgment lacks a factual basis. He also asserts an affirmative defense not timely raised in the courts below: that Huntington was negligent in failing to obtain the endorsements of all payees listed on the checks before accepting them for deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">An appellate court reviews \u201cthe decision of a district court, sitting as an appellate court, by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.\u201d <em>Nesco Acceptance Corp. v. Jay (In re Jay), </em>432 F.3d 323, 325 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Carrieri v. Jobs.com Inc., </em>393 F.3d 508, 517 (5th Cir.2004)). \u201cA bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error____\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>In re Missionary Baptist Found, of Am., </em>712 F.2d 206, 209 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Michigan has adopted the Uniform Commercial Code for purposes of establishing the various warranties that arise in the transfer of negotiable instruments such as checks. <em>See Starbrite Distrib. v. Excelda Mfg. Co., </em>454 Mich. 302, 306 n. 2, 562 N.W.2d 640 (Mich.1997). Michigan law provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">[a] person who transfers an instrument for consideration warrants to the transferee and, if the transfer is by endorsement, to any subsequent transferee ... (a) [t]hat the warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the instrument; (b) [t]hat all signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized; [and] (c) [t]hat the instrument has not been altered.... A person to whom the[se] warranties ... are made and who took the instrument in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atm-dedup-0\">Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 440.3416(1) \u2014 (2) (Lex-isNexis 2008) (hereinafter MCL). The bankruptcy court found that McCann breached various warranties to Huntington that arose upon endorsement and deposit of the altered checks because (1) McCann endorsed and transferred the checks to Huntington; and (2) he did so for consideration. Because McCann has never disputed these two findings, he relies solely on his affirmative defense of negligence, an argument premised on Huntington\u2019s failure to obtain the endorsements of all payees listed on the cheeks, rather than just McCann\u2019s, before accepting them for deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings, which amount to a prima facie case of McCann\u2019s liability, are supported by the record and therefore are not clearly erroneous. Further, McCann failed to raise his affirmative defense of Huntington\u2019s negligence at trial. It is therefore waived. <em>See Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1071 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">C. Dischargeability</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">McCann appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that his debt to Huntington is non-dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court held that McCann\u2019s debt to Huntington was non-dischargeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>for numerous reasons, one of which being that McCann incurred that debt through fraud. To that end, McCann devotes his entire dischargeability argument to attacking the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that he committed fraud against Huntington, wholly failing to address an independent ground the bankruptcy court invoked for denying discharge of all of McCann\u2019s debt, including his debt to Huntington: fraud upon the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The bankruptcy court found that McCann \u201cknowingly and fraudulently failed to schedule his assets and to disclose his income and other financial affairs\u201d to the court. Such deception supports a denial of discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(4). McCann fails to attack this finding on appeal. Accordingly, because the bankruptcy court\u2019s order is supported by an independent ground not challenged on appeal, the Court need not consider McCann\u2019s argument attacking the bankruptcy court\u2019s order on a wholly separate basis. <em>See LLEH, Inc. v. Wichita County, </em>289 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2002) (noting that this Court may affirm a lower court judgment for any reason supported by the record); <em>United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cIt has long been the rule in this circuit that any issues not briefed on appeal are waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">D. Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AP8\">1. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">McCann next argues that he was denied due process when he allegedly was refused access by the bankruptcy trustee to various records he needed to mount a meaningful defense. During discovery, McCann housed many of his important documents in a rented storage unit, which came under the control of the trustee upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. The trustee allegedly denied McCann access to those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Although he now proceeds <em>pro se, </em>McCann was represented by counsel during discovery in the bankruptcy proceeding. Neither McCann nor his attorney filed a discovery motion with the bankruptcy court or the district court seeking to compel access to the stored records. Indeed, McCann raised this \u201cdue process\u201d argument for the first time in his motion to vacate the judgment of the bankruptcy court. Because there is no evidence to indicate that McCann was denied access to the records, and because McCann never alleged such obstruction when he had the opportunity to do so, the argument is not properly before the Court. <em>See Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1071 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">2. Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">McCann next argues that the bankruptcy court erred in denying his motion to suppress. According to McCann, the government has been preparing a criminal case against him. Before trial, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) obtained a subpoena to search his records. McCann avers that the government sought a subpoena as a way of circumventing the probable cause requirement it must normally satisfy to justify a search in the criminal context. He further believes that Huntington was able to win at trial because the IRS \u201cturned over\u201d the records it obtained to Huntington for use in the latter\u2019s private suit. Under McCann\u2019s theory, the IRS\u2019s search without a warrant violated McCann\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, and therefore Huntington\u2019s receipt of the documents obtained in that search constituted \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The record undermines McCann\u2019s argument. Huntington did not obtain the aforementioned records from the IRS. Rather, Huntington obtained its own subpoena for McCann\u2019s records, which gave it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>access thereto independent of the IRS search.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Not only does McCann argue a Fourth Amendment violation, he also claims a denial of due process by way of the IRS\u2019s alleged failure to notify McCann of its subpoena before searching his documents. The IRS is not a party to this suit. Therefore, any issues relating to the conduct of the IRS are not properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">E. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">McCann argues that the bankruptcy court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Huntington in the amount of $81,550 is \u201cexcessive and improper\u201d because Huntington has \u201cdeep pockets.\u201d He also argues that there was insufficient evidence to show that he engaged in fraud. The statute establishing endorsement and transfer warranties in the exchange of negotiable instruments, MCL \u00a7 440.3416(2), provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees upon a finding of breach. Thus, even assuming insufficient evidence of fraud, McCann\u2019s argument fails because the bankruptcy court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was not predicated on its finding of fraud. Further, McCann cites no authority for his \u201cdeep pockets\u201d argument. Accordingly, McCann provides no basis on which to conclude that the award was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">F. RICO</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In addition to its successful breach of warranty claim, Huntington asserted a civil racketeering claim under RICO. The bankruptcy court severed Huntington\u2019s RICO claim for district court review but nevertheless issued Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law recommending a RICO verdict in Huntington\u2019s favor. The district court rejected the bankruptcy court\u2019s proposal, and concluded that Huntington failed to establish liability under RICO. Huntington cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">The district court did not indicate the basis for its ruling. The only asserted explanation for the ruling comes from Huntington, which states that, during a telephonic hearing the district court concluded that RICO liability was not established because Huntington failed to prove the existence of an \u201centerprise,\u201d a necessary element of a RICO claim. In response, Huntington devotes less than two pages of its brief to arguing that the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact prove a RICO \u201centerprise.\u201d The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Whether Huntington proved the existence of an \u201centerprise\u201d sufficient to satisfy RICO is purely a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 392 (5th Cir.2000). RICO expressly declares unlawful three distinct types of schemes, each of which may give rise to civil liability. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(a)-(c). Before the bankruptcy court, Huntington argued McCann\u2019s liability under paragraph (c), which provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person ... associated with any enterprise ... the activities of which affect interstate ... commerce, to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity....\u201d \u201cReduced to its three essentials, a civil RICO claim must involve: (1) a <em>person </em>who engages in (2) a <em>pattern of racketeering activity </em>(3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an <em>enterprise.\u201d Delta Truck &amp; Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., </em>855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">RICO defines an \u201centerprise\u201d as \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4). Thus, \u201c[a] RICO \u2018enterprise\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>can be either a legal entity or an \u2018association in fact\u2019 enterprise.\u201d <em>In re Burzynski, </em>989 F.2d 733, 743 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The bankruptcy court found that Van-denberg deposited the checks into accounts serviced by Huntington at the direction of McCann. Huntington argues that, at the time of the fraudulent deposits, those accounts were already open for use by Vandenberg\u2019s \u201cotherwise legitimate Michigan corporations.\u201d As such, Huntington asserted below that McCann, \u201cVan-denberg and ... Vandenberg\u2019s companies constitute[d][the] \u2018enterprise\u2019... in that they [were] a union or group of individuals and businesses associated in fact for the purpose of depositing the various checks....\u201d Thus, Huntington argues the existence not of a formal association, but of an \u201cassociation-in-fact\u201d under \u00a7 1961(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">This Court has previously declined the invitation to expansively define an association-in-fact enterprise as merely a scheme involving two or more people. <em>In re Bur-zynski, </em>989 F.2d at 743 (\u201cAn \u2018association-in-fact\u2019 enterprise perhaps could have been interpreted broadly to embrace any cooperative endeavor by two or more persons .... Mindful of the wisdom embodied in the federal structure of our nation, this circuit has eschewed this course.\u201d). Rather, to establish an \u201cassociation-in-fact\u201d ... a plaintiff must show \u201cevidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and ... evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981); <em>Shaffer v. Williams, </em>794 F.2d 1030, 1032 (5th Cir. 1986). The enterprise must be \u201can entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages,\u201d <em>Turkette, </em>452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, and the association must operate \u201cthrough a hierarchical or consensual decision-making structure,\u201d <em>Elliott v. Foufas, </em>867 F.2d 877, 881 (5th Cir.1989). Importantly, a plaintiff must also \u201cestablish that the association exists for purposes other than simply to commit the predicate acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., </em>818 F.2d 423, 427 (5th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In recommending a RICO finding in favor of Huntington, the bankruptcy court did not discuss whether the scheme in which McCann engaged specifically satisfied the above requirements. Rather, the factual premise laid by the bankruptcy court in support of its recommended conclusion that McCann engaged in a RICO enterprise was its finding that \u201cMcCann, Vandenberg, and the various companies created by Vandenberg ... [were] associated for the purpose of depositing the altered, counterfeit, or forged <em>checks....\u2019\u2019 </em>Nothing in the bankruptcy court\u2019s opinion or recommendation to the district court suggests that the relationship between Vandenberg, McCann, and the Michigan corporations existed for purposes other than simply to commit the predicate acts and reap the resultant rewards. A RICO enterprise cannot be \u201ca \u2018pattern of racketeering activity,\u2019 but must be \u2018an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Old Time Enters, v. Int\u2019l Coffee Corp., </em>862 F.2d 1213, 1217 (5th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Montesano, </em>818 F.2d at 427).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Nor does the record compel the conclusion that the relationship described by Huntington functioned as a \u201ccontinuing unit over time through a hierarchical or consensual decision-making structure.\u201d <em>See Elliott, </em>867 F.2d at 881. Rather, the evidence suggests that McCann and Van-denberg were merely partners in a scheme too unsophisticated to be labeled \u201corganized crime,\u201d which RICO was designed to combat. <em>See Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, </em>533 U.S. 158, 165, 121 S.Ct. 2087, 150 L.Ed.2d 198 (2001) (noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>RICO\u2019s goal is the \u201cundermining [of] organized crime\u2019s influence upon legitimate businesses.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Because the record fails to demonstrate that McCann committed fraud as part of an \u201cassociation-in-fact\u201d under \u00a7 1961(4), Huntington cannot, based on the evidence in the record, prove an \u201centerprise\u201d for purposes of RICO. Accordingly, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-12\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-17\">.

Additionally, because McCann '\u2018fraudulently failed to schedule his assets\u201d in the bankruptcy proceeding, the court, invoking 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(4), denied discharge as to all of McCann\u2019s debt, including his debt to Huntington.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
