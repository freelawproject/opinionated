Jun. 14, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 846 003 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, CT Apr. 30, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc). </em>However, the Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">The agency\u2019s burden findings are not supported by substantial evidence. With regard to Granados\u2019 imputed political opinion claim, the IJ determined that \u201c[tjhere has been no testimony and no documentary evidence that anyone ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>threatened the respondent because of her politics, her family\u2019s politics or her family\u2019s imputed politics or her imputed politics.\u201d However, Granados claimed that her family believed that by paying money to the FARC, they would be cooperating with terrorists, and that they did not want to cooperate with people who did not respect human life. Further, Granados described the FARC\u2019s seizure and destruction of her family\u2019s boat as a reprisal for non-cooperation, and later described her father\u2019s \u201cden[ial] to cooperate with the revolution\u201d as the reason for the persecution of her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We recently had occasion to consider a claim of imputed political opinion, wherein the petitioner had been kidnapped by the FARC because of her knowledge of computers, a reason unrelated to her political opinion, in <em>Delgado v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 702, 707 (2d Cir.2007). In <em>Delgado, </em>we found that although the petitioner was originally kidnaped because of a non-political reason, \u201cit did not necessarily follow that ... her refusal to provide further technological assistance did not support a well-founded fear of futui'e persecution on account of an imputed political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, while Granados\u2019 family may have initially been targeted because of their status as wealthy property and business owners, the agency failed to consider whether the confluence of their socio-eco-nomic class, their political affiliation, and their refusal to \u201ccooperate\u201d with the FARC, could have led the FARC to impute an anti-FARC political opinion to them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Second, we note the IJ\u2019s finding that, even if Granados were able to show a nexus, the threats, although \u201cvery serious,\u201d did not constitute past persecution. It is well established that past persecution may be sufficient, on its own, to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Matter of Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dee. 16, 18, 22 (BIA 1989). While we have generally rejected claims of past persecution based on unfulfilled threats alone, <em>see Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 2002), we have also found that \u201cnon-physical forms of harm\u201d may rise to the level of persecution. <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, a number of our sister Circuits have explicitly recognized that psychological harm may, in some circumstances, support a finding of past persecution. <em>See Ouk v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that \u201c[ujnder the right set of circumstances, a finding of past persecution might rest on a showing of psychological harm\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); Mas<em>hiri v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 1112, 1120 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cPersecution may be emotional or psychological, as well as physical.\u201d); <em>Abay v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 634, 642 (6th Cir.2004) (holding that the applicant was entitled to asylum \u201cbased on her fear that her daughter will be forced to undergo female genital mutilation\u201d because her \u201cfear of ... being forced to witness the pain and suffering of her daughter is well-founded\u201d). Further, the Ninth Circuit has held that \u201cunfulfilled threats\u201d can rise to the level of persecution if they are \u201cso menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm.\u201d <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">While we have never considered whether death threats that cause severe psychological harm rise to the level of persecution, the agency should have done so within the context of the required cumulative past persecution analysis of Grana-dos\u2019 claim. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 79-80 (2d Cir.2005). We have held that the difference between harassment and persecution is one of degree, which must be assessed with regard to the context in which the mistreatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>occurs. <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223 (2d Cir.2006). We have also suggested that psychological trauma suffered in the context of a war-torn society is also relevant to the past persecution determination. <em>Jorge-Tzoc v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 146, 150-51 (2d Cir.2006). Therefore, remand is also required where the agency failed to evaluate both the context in which the FARC made its threats against Granados, as well as the severe psychological harm that may have resulted from those threats, in making its past persecution determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">While past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, this presumption may be rebutted by a showing that an applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). Here, the IJ found that \u201c[t]here has been no testimony, credible or otherwise, that the respondent could not internally relocate to another part of Colombia,\u201d and that Granados \u201ctestified consistently that the times that she lived at her biological mother\u2019s apartment, which is a half-hour away by car from her father\u2019s house, that she was unharmed.\u201d However, Granados additionally testified that she could not live outside of Bogota \u201c[bjecause [the FARC] are all over in many places. They know a lot of people and they know how to find someone.\u201d In support of this position, she provided an INS Resource Information Center document in the record entitled \u201cColombia: Information on Prospects for Avoiding Threats from Armed Groups by Relocating in Country\u201d which describes the FARC as having a \u201cpresence in virtually all of the nations\u2019 32 departments and urban centers and has a country wide capability to harm.\u201d Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s finding that the record includes \u201cno testimony, credible or otherwise, that the respondent could not internally relocate to another part of Colombia,\u201d is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Jorge-Tzoc v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d at 150; <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 272-73 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Finally, we note that the IJ erred in requiring that Granados support her CAT claim with evidence \u201cthat the government of Colombia would torture her or an agent of the government of Colombia would torture her.\u201d We have emphasized that \u201ctorture\u201d under CAT is an \u201cact by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted ... when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>508 F.3d at 708 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)). We further specified that \u201c[acquiescence does not require official consent or approval; it requires only that government officials know of or remain willfully blind to an act and thereafter breach their legal responsibility to prevent it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 170-71 (2d Cir.2004)). Record evidence demonstrates that Granados\u2019 father went to the Colombian authorities for help, but that they determined that his case did not warrant special attention, and that it was \u201cnot possible [for the government] to assume the responsibility of giving guarantee to [his] life.\u201d The failure of the IJ to apply the proper standard and consider record evidence warrants remand. <em>See Delgado, </em>508 F.3d at 702 (noting that remand is required where the \u201cagency\u2019s application of the law with respect to government acquiescence in third-party actions does not seem to comport with our most recent rulings on that point\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
