Agnes Natan petitions for review of the denial of her applications for asylum and withholding of removal. In the alternative, she requests that Singapore not be designated as an alternative country for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">A. <em>Asylum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">An applicant may qualify for asylum either because she suffered past persecution or because she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). Natan, who is ethnic Chinese and Catholic, experienced harassment in Indonesia because of her race and religion. Persecution, however, is \u201can extreme concept\u201d and \u201c[discrimination on the basis of race or religion, as morally reprehensible as it may be, does not ordinarily amount to persecution within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 672 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that Natan did not suffer past persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">A well-founded fear of future persecution must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). Natan\u2019s credible testimony establishes that her fear of returning to Indonesia is subjectively genuine; however, that fear is objectively reasonable only if Natan: (1) established that \u201cthere is a pattern or practice of persecution against similarly situated individuals\u201d; or (2) introduced \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence that [she] faces an individualized risk of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">First, substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that there is no pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese Catholic women in Indonesia based upon Natan\u2019s own experience as a successful executive in Indonesia and evidence of improving country conditions reported in the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2000 Indonesia Country Report. <em>See Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1180-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-19\">Second, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Natan did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>establish an individualized risk of persecution if she returns to Indonesia. Natan\u2019s burden of demonstrating an individualized risk of persecution is comparatively lower because ethnic Chinese are a disfavored group in Indonesia. <em>See Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>886 F.3d 922, 927 (9th Cir.2004). Natan must nevertheless \u201cprove something more than [her] status as [a] female member[] of Indonesia\u2019s Chinese Christian community\u201d to be eligible for asylum. <em>Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1173 n. 6. Natan argues that the harassment she experienced is analogous to that in <em>Sael. </em>That case is distinguishable because of the individualized nature of the threats of violence and property damage in <em>Sael. See </em>386 F.3d at 927. Natan never suffered persecution directed at her personally; rather, she was threatened by actions directed indiscriminately at the ethnic Chinese community. Her home in a predominantly ethnic Chinese neighborhood, where her younger brother now lives, was safe from indigenous Indonesian rioters.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">B. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Because Natan failed to establish \u201ca well founded fear of persecution\u201d to be eligible for asylum she necessarily failed to establish the higher standard of \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d to be eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">C. <em>Alternate Country for Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The Immigration Judge properly designated Singapore as an alternative country for removal because Natan was born in that country. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(2)(E)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
