Stiltner contends that clearly established federal law was violated by the admission of his inculpato-ry statements and by the exclusion of statements regarding the victim\u2019s sexual conduct. The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-22\">For a prisoner whose case has been adjudicated on the merits in state court, a writ of habeas corpus should issue only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Our review of the state court\u2019s decision is thus limited and deferential. <em>Collier v. Norris, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>485 F.3d 415, 421 (8th Cir.2007). As for the district court, we review its findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. Bucklew v. Luebbers, </em>436 F.3d 1010, 1015 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Davis County Sheriff Monte Harsch contacted John Stiltner in March of 1998 to speak to him about his daughter\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse. Although Stiltner said that he would prefer to have his attorney present, Harsch told Stiltner that he would be arrested if he did not come in voluntarily. Unaccompanied by counsel, Stiltner showed up at the sheriffs office.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Harsch read Stiltner a <em>Miranda </em>warning and Stiltner signed a written <em>Miranda </em>form. On Part II of the form, Stiltner answered the question: \u201cDo you understand each of these rights as I have explained to you?\u201d with a verbal \u201cYes.\u201d In response to the second question, \u201cHaving these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to us now?,\u201d Stiltner answered \u201cAs much as I can.\u201d Harsch wrote Stiltner\u2019s answers on the printed form. Stiltner then made incriminating statements and was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Stiltner contends that he invoked his right to counsel such that the admission of the incriminating statements at trial was contrary to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We disagree. Under the <em>Miranda </em>rule, a suspect who is subject to custodial interrogation must unambiguously request counsel. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). Like the state trial court, we assume for the sake of argument that Stilt-ner was in custody at the time he made the incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\"><em>Miranda </em>requires the government to respect a suspect\u2019s affirmative request for an attorney. Stiltner\u2019s reference to an attorney was not sufficiently clear \u201cthat a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350. Although clarification is often a good practice, <em>Miranda </em>does not require the police to study the suspect\u2019s ambivalence and cajole him into a game-show-like \u201cfinal answer\u201d as to whether he desires counsel. Until the suspect clearly requests an attorney, police may continue their interrogation. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461-62, 114 S.Ct. 2350. The state court\u2019s decision to admit Stiltner\u2019s statements was consistent with clearly established federal law, as determined by Supreme Court precedent. Stiltner\u2019s claim for habeas relief was properly denied on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Stiltner next argues that the state court wrongly refused to admit the victim\u2019s statements that she had engaged in sexual activity with other children. Before evidence of specific instances of an alleged victim\u2019s past sexual behavior could be introduced, Iowa Rule of Evidence 412(c)(1) (now Rule 5.412) required a written motion no later than fifteen days before trial. The state courts found that the statements were properly excluded because Stiltner failed to comply with the procedural strictures of Rule 412. Federal courts may not grant habeas relief to a claim that a state court has disposed of on state procedural grounds. <em>Clemons v. Luebbers, </em>381 F.3d 744, 750 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Attempting to avoid this procedural default, Stiltner argues that the statements were false and should have been admitted for the purpose of impeachment. .The state courts found otherwise, and were not convinced the child\u2019s statements are actually false. Because this finding was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented, we deny Stiltner\u2019s claim for habeas relief on this issue. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-23\">.
