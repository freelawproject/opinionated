James was originally sentenced to a prison term of 66 months, and appealed to this Court. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Fagans, </em>406 F.3d 138 (2d Cir. 2005), we vacated that sentence and remanded for resentencing in conformity with <em>Booker. </em>Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On appeal, James now submits that a remand pursuant to <em>Fagans </em>required a full resentencing hearing, complete with a new opportunity for the defendant to present evidence on his behalf. Nothing in <em>Fa-gans </em>supports this argument. To the contrary, we held that \u201c[sjince the Guideline calculation was correct, but the compulsory use of the Guidelines was erroneous, and Fagans preserved his objection to that error, we remand to the District Court with instructions to vacate the sentence and resentence in conformity with <em>Booker </em>and this opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142. The same was true here. We remanded for resentencing without mandatory application of the Guidelines, and the district court resen-teneed accordingly, choosing to decrease Appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Having only sought (and received) a remand based on <em>Booker </em>in his first appeal, Appellant has not preserved any claim of error relating to the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
