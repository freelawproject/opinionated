Daves, Esq., USLA-Office of the U.S. Attorney Civil &amp; Tax Divisions, Los Angeles, CA, Cindy S.

Dec. 872 (BIA 1994), and does not disagree with any part of the IJ\u2019s decision, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision in its entirety. <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We therefore review the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cas if it were that of the BIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1039 (quoting <em>Hoque v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir. 2004)). Questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Kankamalage v. INS, </em>335 F.3d 858, 861-62 (9th Cir.2003). Factual findings, including credibility determinations, are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Ramos-Vasquez v. INS, </em>57 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir.1995). Under the substantial evidence standard, we reverse the IJ only if \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence. To make an adverse credibility finding, the agency must identify \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that are \u201csubstantial and legitimately connected to the finding.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Minor inconsistencies that do not relate to the basis of an applicant\u2019s fear of persecution, go to the heart of an asylum claim, or reveal anything about an applicant\u2019s fear for his safety cannot support an adverse credibility determination. <em>Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). None of the inconsistencies specified by the IJ and BIA go to the heart of Singh\u2019s asylum claim. Moreover, Singh\u2019s alleged vagueness cannot be grounds for an adverse credibility finding where the IJ did not ask for greater detail. <em>See Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1167 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The IJ\u2019s finding that Singh\u2019s identity is disputed is similarly unsupported by substantial evidence. Where, as here, no legitimate reason exists to question the applicant\u2019s credibility, \u201cwe must reverse a finding that the applicant failed to meet his burden of proof because he did not provide corroborating evidence.\u201d <em>Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1239 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Taking Singh\u2019s testimony to be true, a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to find that Singh suffered past persecution. The detentions and beatings he suffered, along with the burning of his restaurant, and threats from the police and militants cumulatively rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1203 (9th Cir.2004) (finding that two arrests and repeated beatings constituted persecution); <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that persecution \u201cmay be found by cumulative, specific instances of violence and harassment\u201d). This persecution was committed both by the government \u2014 the police \u2014 and individuals apparently uncontrolled by the government \u2014 militants. The persecution was, moreover, on account of an imputed political opinion because the police undertook their persecution believing Singh to be connected with the militants, and the militants undertook their persecution believing Singh to be connected with the police. <em>See Agbuya v. INS, </em>241 F.3d 1224, 1229 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Because Singh has established past persecution, he is entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution, which the government may rebut by showing a preponderance of evidence that changed circumstances or relocation within India would prevent future persecution. <em>See De-loso v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 858, 863-64 (9th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). Singh\u2019s demonstration of past persecution similarly creates a rebuttable presumption of a future threat to life or freedom for withholding of removal purposes. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i). We remand under <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam), to allow the BIA to determine whether this presumption of a well-founded fear is rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Singh has not shown that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d he would be tortured upon return to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">For the reasons stated, the petition is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
