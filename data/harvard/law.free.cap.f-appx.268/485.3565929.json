For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Reviewing de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>see Kenney v. Swift Transp., Inc., </em>347 F.3d 1041, 1044 (8th Cir.2003) (standard of review; facts are viewed in light most favorable to non-movant), we agree with the district court that Lin did not establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination on her claim that she was denied a teaching assistant position in violation of Title VII, because it was undisputed that she was not eligible for the position after being terminated from the doctoral program in the same department, <em>see Kobrin v. Univ. of Minn., </em>34 F.3d 698, 702 (8th Cir.1994) (prima facie case of gender discrimination under Title VII). As to the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law (JAML), we have reviewed it to the extent possible without a full transcript. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (discussing appellant\u2019s duty to order transcript); <em>Lam v. Curators of the Univ. of Mo., </em>122 F.3d 654, 656 (8th Cir. 1997) (JAML standard of review); <em>Schmid v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, </em>827 F.2d 384, 385-86 (8th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (court could not review evidentiary rulings without transcript). We agree with the district court that Lin could not succeed on her Title IX claim absent evidence that her dismissal, later successfully appealed, from a particular doctoral program was related to her gender, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a) (prohibiting gender discrimination by any education program receiving federal assistance), or that she was treated less favorably than any similarly situated male student, <em>see Saulsberry v. St. Mary\u2019s Univ. of Minn., </em>318 F.3d 862, 866-67 (8th Cir.2003) (assuming plaintiff established prima facie case, plaintiff had burden of proving others treated differently were similarly situated in all relevant respects). Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Lin\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See United States v. Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., </em>440 F.3d 930, 933-35 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">We affirm the judgment of the district court, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 47B, and deny as moot Lin\u2019s pending motion to amend.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-13\">. The Honorable F.A.
