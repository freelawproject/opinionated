(\u201cCyber-co\u201d) in which ePlus would acquire financing for computer equipment that ePlus would then make available to Cyberco through either an installment sale or a secured financing, according to the conflicting accounts of the parties. ePlus successfully secured financing from GMAC Commercial Finance LLC (\u201cGMAC\u201d) and Banc of America Vendor Finance, Inc. (which later became Banc of America Leasing &amp; Capital, LLC<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>). GMAC and BoA (the \u201cBanks\u201d), in turn, provided the financing, either directly to Teleservices Group, Inc. (\u201cTeleservices\u201d), or via ePlus, to pay for the transfer of the servers to Cyberco.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In three GMAC agreements consummated between March and October 2004, ePlus warrantied, <em>inter alia, </em>that it: (1) had fully paid for the computer equipment; (2) had clear title to that equipment; and (8) \u201cown[ed] and [wa]s assigning all of its rights, title, and interest in, to, and under the Agreement and the other Collateral to the Lender, free and clear of any liens, claims and encumbrances.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Eplus Group, Inc. v. Banc of Am. Leasing and Capital, LLC, </em>2006 WL 318863, <em>*2 </em>(S.D.N.Y.2006) (quotation marks omitted). According to Travelers, the agreements also provided that the computer equipment would serve as collateral for GMAC\u2019s loans to ePlus, providing GMAC with a security interest in the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In a separate agreement with BoA for the financing of other equipment, ePlus warrantied that: (1) it had title to the equipment; and (2) the equipment either (a) if it was new, was \u201cas described in the Contract, invoice and purchase order,\u201d or (b) if it was used, \u201cconform[ed] to applicable specifications and all warranties, whether express or implied; [and] ... [was] as described in the Contract, invoice and purchase order.... \u201d <em>See id. </em>at <em>*2 </em>(quotation marks omitted; first alteration in original). Travelers claims that as a result of this agreement, like the GMAC agreement, BoA received a security interest in the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Ultimately, following an alleged fraud by Cyberco and Teleservices, the loans went into default. After Travelers denied ePlus coverage under its insurance policy, ePlus sued GMAC, BoA, and Travelers, seeking a declaratory judgment that ePlus was not liable to the Banks or, in the alternative, coverage under the Travelers policy. GMAC and BoA sued ePlus in state courts in New York<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Virginia, respectively. Meanwhile, Travelers and ePlus both moved for summary judgment. The disposition of those motions led to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">From July 2003 to July 2004, ePlus was insured under a commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) insurance policy provided by Travelers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the terms of the policy, ePlus was <em>\u201ccovered\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., entitled to defense and indemnification \u2014 for \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201c \u2018property damage\u2019 ... caused by an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d The policy defined an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Even if covered, however, ePlus would not be entitled to defense and indemnification by Travelers if certain \u201cexclusions\u201d applied. For instance, ePlus would not be entitled to coverage if the \u201cproperty damage\u201d was to: (1) property that ePlus \u201cown[ed], rentfed], or occupied],\u201d <em>id. </em>at *2 (quotations omitted), or (2) \u201c \u2018[ePlus\u2019] product\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quotations omitted; alteration in original). The policy defined \u201cproduct\u201d to include \u201cgoods or products ... sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by\u201d ePlus, as well as \u201c[w]arranties or representations made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>at any time with respect to fitness, quality, durability, performance or use of [such] product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted; first alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">In its decision and order below, the district court concluded that ePlus was not \u201ccovered\u201d under the terms of its insurance agreement with Travelers, <em>id. </em>at *4, or, in the alternative, that ePlus was not entitled to coverage due to the \u201clikely\u201d application of relevant \u201cexclusions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *4-5. Because we agree that there was no occurrence, we affirm on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">New York courts have adopted the principle that \u201c[t]he purpose and intent of [a general liability] insurance policy is to protect the insured from liability for essentially accidental injury to the person or property of <em>another </em>rather than coverage for disputes between parties to a contractual undertaking.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Pep Boys </em>\u2014 Manny, <em>Moe &amp; Jack, </em>304 A.D.2d 218, 759 N.Y.S.2d 42, 45 (N.Y.App.Div.2003) (quoting <em>Redevelopment Auth. of Cambria County v. Int\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>454 Pa.Super. 374, 685 A.2d 581, 589 (1996)) (quotation marks omitted; alterations in original; emphasis added). But the injury or liability for which ePlus now seeks indemnification was to itself, rather than to another. That is to say ePlus\u2019s own acts or omissions precipitated the contract claims brought by the Banks against ePlus. ePlus was uniquely positioned to prevent its own liability \u2014 it could have done so by simply undertaking a proper inspection of the servers in support of its warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">It is not enough to claim, as ePlus does here, that Cyberco\u2019s fraud was unintended by ePlus, and therefore \u201caccidental.\u201d This clearly misses the point. An occurrence is an unintended event \u2014 an accident \u2014 that causes injury to <em>another </em>person or their property, for which the insured is held liable. Here, ePlus was clearly negligent \u2014 it failed to discover that the computer servers that were collateral for its debt were junk. The injury was not to another; it was to ePlus, for its own negligence caused it to breach its warranties to the Banks. To grant ePlus coverage under these circumstances would be to convert the CGL policy to a loan guarantee. This, we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-10\">. The distinction between Banc of America Leasing &amp; Capital, LLC and Banc of America Vendor Finance, Inc. is immaterial for present purposes. For convenience, we use \u201cBoA\u201d to refer to both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b142-11\">. The parties contest both who provided the equipment to Cyberco (Teleservices or ePlus), and who paid Teleservices (the Banks or ePlus). And, to complicate matters further, Teleservices was, according to ePlus, merely the alter ego of Cyberco. Travelers says that \"ePlus borrowed the funds to acquire computer equipment ... from Teleservices ... which equipment ePlus was to then lease to Cyberco----\" Appellee\u2019s Br. at 8. But ePlus contends that \u201d[t]he actual sale and purchase of the servers was accomplished among Teles-ervices, Cyberco, and the Banks with virtually no further involvement from ePlus. GMAC and BoA wired the payment for the servers to Teleservices, and the servers were delivered directly to Cyberco from Teleservices.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. <em>See also </em>Decl. of George Fox, in J.A. at 401 (\u201d[T]he lenders wired the cost of acquisition of the servers to Teleser-vices.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 402 (\"On each occasion, GMAC wired the funds for acquisition to Tel-eservices.\u201d). The exact nature of these transactions, and the degree to which ePlus's involvement in them may have \"triggered\u201d one of the insurance policy's exclusion provisions is a factual issue we see no need to resolve. Since we affirm the district court\u2019s opinion on different <em>grounds </em>\u2014 i.e., the absence of any \"occurrence\" that would have entitled ePlus to coverage \u2014 the possible application of the exclusions is immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">. ePlus evidendy made these warranties \u2014 as well as those conveyed to BoA, discussed below \u2014 without having satisfactorily inspected the equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\">. The GMAC suit has since been removed to federal district court in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\">. During the same time period, ePlus had a supplemental Excess Liability Insurance Policy from Travelers. In addition, ePlus had another Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy during the 2004 to 2005 period, and a companion Excess Liability Insurance Policy. Any differences among the policies are irrelevant to this appeal and for convenience, we refer simply to a single insurance agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
