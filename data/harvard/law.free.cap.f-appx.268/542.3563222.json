We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to affirm the ALJ and may reverse if we find that the \u201cdisability determination ... contains legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir.2007). We reverse and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Trotter contends that the ALJ wrongly discredited Trotter\u2019s testimony and the reports of two of her treating doctors, general practitioner Dr. Lang and psychiatrist Dr. Karim. The ALJ was required to provide \u201cspecific, cogent\u201d reasons that were \u201cclear and convincing\u201d to reject Trotter\u2019s testimony. <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, he was required to provide \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d to discredit the views of Drs. Lang and Karim, treating physicians whose opinions were contradicted by those of other doctors. <em>Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">1. The ALJ did not err in discrediting evidence of Trotter\u2019s physical disabilities and adopting a more moderate view of her physical impairments. Trotter\u2019s relatively unremarkable medical test results, combined with the mismatch between Dr. Lang\u2019s reports and the objective medical evidence, supported the ALJ\u2019s reasoning. We therefore do not disturb the ALJ\u2019s conclusions regarding Trotter\u2019s physical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">2. The ALJ improperly discredited Trotter\u2019s testimony with regard to her mental illness. The ALJ relied heavily on Trotter\u2019s supposed failure to describe her symptoms or to report them to other parties. The ALJ\u2019s reliance on this factor was not supported by substantial evidence. Trotter did not report drowsiness caused by her medications to her doctors, but that fact has limited relevance to the question of her underlying mental condition. Further, Trotter explained that she had not mentioned hearing voices or sought treatment earlier because she was afraid of losing her children and of being ridiculed, and she reported the voices once she be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>gan seeing a psychiatrist. Drs. Lang and Ross also noted increasing signs of anxiety and other mental problems, including Trotter\u2019s report that she felt like bugs were crawling all over her. Indeed, Trotter\u2019s first visit to Dr. Karim was precipitated by Dr. Lang\u2019s belief that Trotter was seriously mentally ill and not responding to treatment after suffering a breakdown. Moreover, Trotter has a history of suicide attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Finally, the fact that Trotter\u2019s lawyer did not mention the psychotic symptoms in her January 2001 brief or at a hearing that month means very little. That first hearing, the results of which were later vacated because it was held while Trotter was in the hospital, occurred when neither the ALJ nor Trotter\u2019s counsel had the benefit of all of her medical records. Moreover, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s impression, Dr. Kar-im provided her reports <em>after </em>the brief was due and after the hearing was held, so the lawyer could not have been expected to cite them.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In sum, the ALJ did not provide specific, cogent, record-supported reasons to discredit Trotter\u2019s mental health testimony. We therefore credit Trotter\u2019s testimony as true insofar as it establishes that she faced marked limitations in her activities of daily living and general ability to work due to depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms, at least as of November 2000, when she had a break-down and began to see a psychiatrist. <em>See Benecke v. Barnhart, </em>379 F.3d 587, 594 (9th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">3. The ALJ also erred in discrediting Dr. Karim\u2019s conclusions. Based on Trotter\u2019s driving record, the ALJ reasoned that Trotter must have deceived Dr. Kar-im about her literacy and, presumably, about her mental impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">But while her literacy is limited, she is not entirely illiterate. Moreover, there is nothing in the record showing that Trotter ever had a driver\u2019s license or, if she did, that she was required to pass a written driver\u2019s test, as opposed to taking the test in a way that accommodated her difficulty with reading. The ALJ\u2019s reasoning in this regard is untethered to any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Instead, the ALJ relied largely on the opinion of Dr. Bedrin. Dr. Bedrin\u2019s report is, at best, confused and, at worst, self-contradictory. Despite recording Trotter\u2019s account of her delusions and several suicide attempts, Dr. Bedrin nonetheless wrote that she denied suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms. His decision to minimize Trotter\u2019s symptoms is particularly questionable because he also noted that Trotter was, at that time, taking Serzone, an anti-depressant, BuSpar, an anti-anxiety drug, and Zyprexa, which is prescribed for bipolar disorder. Dr. Bedrin\u2019s examination report did not justify discrediting Dr. Karim.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">We therefore credit Dr. Karim\u2019s views regarding Trotter\u2019s serious mental illness and her assignment of a GAF score of 37. <em>See Benecke, </em>379 F.3d at 594. Having so concluded, we have discretion whether to remand for benefits or for further agency consideration. <em>See McCartey v. Massa-nari, </em>298 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2002). We will do the latter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Trotter\u2019s impairments have clearly lasted, but it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>entirely clear on the present record whether she was disabled at the time of her application. If, crediting Trotter and Dr. Karim as we have directed, the ALJ concludes that Trotter was disabled at the time of her application, she is eligible for benefits for the entire period; if not, she may be disabled for part of the disputed period.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">. Trotter\u2019s motion to supplement the record with documents relating to a later successful application is denied. No \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d are present here. <em>See Lowry v. Barnhart, </em>329 F.3d 1019, 1024-26 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">. Because the record, aside from Trotter's testimony, does not conclusively demonstrate the frequency of her anxiety attacks, we do not now credit her statement that she has attacks twice a week. The ALJ could, however, inquire further into that matter on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-13\">. We do not disturb the ALJ\u2019s findings at step four to the extent that they establish that Trotter cannot perform her past relevant work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
