Horn denying Anagarita\u2019s request for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>In re Anagarita, </em>No. A17-601-534 (B.I.A. Nov. 22, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A17-601-534 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 17, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-23\">Anagarita entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1968. In 1993 she was convicted following a guilty plea of criminal possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) under New York Penal Law section 220.18. After she served a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>period of incarceration, the government commenced removal proceedings under INA section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) based on her conviction \u201cof a violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). Anagarita did not contest her removability on this ground but instead requested a waiver of inadmissability. The IJ denied relief and the BIA affirmed. The BIA found that \u201cthe question of whether [Anagarita\u2019s] offense [wa]s an aggravated felony [wa]s not determinative of the outcome of th[e] case\u201d since the IJ would have denied section 212(c) relief regardless of whether Anagarita was considered an aggravated felon. With respect to section 212(c) relief, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Anagarita \u201cdid not demonstrate outstanding and unusual equities\u201d and, in any case, \u201cdid not establish that the positive factors in the record out-weighted] the serious negative factors.\u201d Anagarita moved to reopen and to reconsider the BIA\u2019s decision, which motion was denied. Anagarita appeals only from this denial of post-decision relief, and not from the underlying removal order and denial of section 212(c) relief. We assume familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The sole issue presented by this petition for review is whether the BIA abused its discretion by denying the motion to reopen and reconsider. \u201c[W]e are precluded from passing on the merits of the underlying [removal] proceedings\u201d where the petitioner appeals only the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001); <em>see Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam); <em>Kaur v. B.I.A., </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>see also Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The INA bars judicial review of decisions committed to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion, such as the discretionary denial of Anagarita\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Maiwand v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 101, 104 (2d Cir.2007). To the extent that the underlying order is made unreviewable by the jurisdiction-stripping provision in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), we accordingly lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider the underlying order. <em>See Santos-Salazar v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>400 F.3d 99, 103 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Durant v. INS, </em>393 F.3d 113, 115 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We do, however retain jurisdiction, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), to review colorable \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d such as the claim that \u201ca discretionary decision is ... an abuse of discretion because it was made without rational justification or based on a legally erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). Anagarita argues that she raises a colorable question of law on appeal. Specifically, she contends that in denying her motion to reopen and reconsider the BIA failed to address one of her legal arguments: that, if read in conjunction with <em>Matter of Sotelo, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 201 (BIA 2001), the intervening Supreme Court decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), which clarified the INA\u2019s use of the term \u201caggravated felony,\u201d mandated reconsideration of her application for section 212(c) relief under a different legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">We need not decide whether that issue confers jurisdiction. For the purposes of this order, we assume that we have jurisdiction, but we deny the petition because there is no merit in Anagarita\u2019s legal argument. In its affirmance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>IJ\u2019s denial of relief, the BIA expressly stated that \u201cthe question of whether [Ana-garita\u2019s] offense [wa]s an aggravated felony [wa]s not determinative of the outcome of the case.\u201d Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion on the motion to reopen/reconsider when it concluded that Anagari-ta\u2019s <em>Lopez </em>argument failed to identify a defect in the original decision. Although the IJ found that Anagarita did not demonstrate \u201cunusual or outstanding\u201d equities, the IJ nonetheless went on to apply a general balancing test, concluding that An-agarita did not establish that the positive factors in the record \u201coutweigh[ed] the ... overwhelming negative factors.\u201d The BIA affirmed on the same grounds. Thus, inasmuch as the IJ and the BIA had already applied the balancing test that Anagarita advocates, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to reopen and reconsider asking for application of that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
