The Honorable Brian M.

Straus ordering Petitioner removed to Pakistan as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">The issue on appeal is the denial of Petitioner\u2019s request to continue his removal proceedings during the pendency of his application for a labor certification under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court has \u201cjurisdiction to review an IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance, and ... we conduct that review under a highly deferential standard of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 549, 551 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">At the outset, the government raises the issues of waiver and exhaustion. Before the IJ, Petitioner requested a continuance to obtain a letter from the Islamic Association of Greater Hartford in support of his 1-360 religious worker petition. Before the BIA, however, Petitioner argued that the IJ abused his discretion in denying his request for a continuance during the adjudication of his labor certification. The government submits, and Petitioner concedes, that Petitioner waived any challenge to the religious worker continuance issue by failing to raise it in his brief before this Court. On the other hand, the government also argues that, by not specifically raising the labor certification issue, Petitioner failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies relating to this ground for a continuance. However, the BIA simply denied Petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201ccontinuance,\u201d without identifying the underlying basis for the continuance it was denying.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Our decision need not turn on this issue since Petitioner\u2019s substantive argument is directly foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Elbahja v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 125 (2d Cir.2007), where we held that \u201cit does not constitute an abuse of discretion for an IJ to decline to continue a removal proceeding in order to permit adjudication of a removable alien\u2019s pending labor certification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. Petitioner\u2019s valiant effort to distinguish <em>Elbahja </em>is unconvincing. The BIA noted that Petitioner was not \u201cpresently eligible for adjustment of status,\u201d reasoning accepted in <em>Elbahja. See id. </em>(\u201c[Elbahja\u2019s] eligibility for adjustment of status was ... speculative at best.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the petition is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-15\">. A labor certification is only the first step for a non-immigrant alien to apply for an adjustment to permanent resident status under \u00a7 1255(i). He must also be \"eligible to receive an immigrant visa and ... admissible to the United States for permanent residence,\u201d and \"an immigrant visa [must be] immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
