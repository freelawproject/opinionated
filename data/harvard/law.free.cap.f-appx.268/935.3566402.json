Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Ronald Swain\u2019s appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment in <em>Swain v. Nicholson, </em>05-2112, for lack of jurisdiction. Swain has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-24\">Swain sought review by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims of a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision that denied service connection for pes planus, claimed as fallen arches. The Board determined that Swain\u2019s pes planus existed prior to his entry into service and that the evidence did not establish that his pes planus was incurred in, or aggravated by, his period of active service. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed. Swain appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-25\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). This court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-26\">In his informal brief, Swain argues that the Board did not consider all the relevant facts in making its service connection determination. Swain only challenges the factual determinations in his case and the Board\u2019s application of law to the facts of his case. Because Swain fails to raise an issue within our jurisdiction, we must dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-27\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b959-28\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b959-29\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motions are granted. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-30\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
