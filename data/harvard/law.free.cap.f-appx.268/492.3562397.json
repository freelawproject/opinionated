Barnhart, </em>433 F.3d 575, 577 (8th Cir.2006). The Commissioner\u2019s decision must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support the commissioner\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Young v. Apfel, </em>221 F.3d 1065, 1068 (8th Cir.2000). The whole record is considered, \u201cincluding evidence that supports as well as detracts from the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and we will not reverse simply because some evidence may support the opposite conclusion.\u201d <em>Pelkey, </em>433 F.3d at 577. Further, this court will defer to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations as long as they are \u201csupported by good reasons and substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Guilliams v. Barnhart, </em>393 F.3d 798, 801 (8th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-22\">Hamm filed his initial application for Social Security disability benefits on January 17, 1995. While that application was pending, Hamm filed a second application for Social Security disability benefits on April 16, 2001, which was granted in August of 2002. Therefore, this court\u2019s review is limited to the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Hamm was not disabled as of January 17, 1995 through April 16, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-23\">On appeal, Hamm argues the Commissioner\u2019s decision regarding disability prior to April of 2001 is not supported by substantial evidence in the record because the hypothetical question posed by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) to the vocational expert did not accurately describe his limitations, particularly with respect to his chronic depression. Hamm further ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>gues that the ALJ improperly discounted the opinions of Hamm\u2019s treating and consulting physicians, as well as Hamm\u2019s own testimony. The court has considered the arguments of the parties and reviewed the administrative record in this matter. For the reasons set forth in Judge Moody\u2019s thorough opinion in the district court, we find that the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Hamm was not disabled prior to April 16, 2001 is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. The decision of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-24\">. The Honorable James M.
