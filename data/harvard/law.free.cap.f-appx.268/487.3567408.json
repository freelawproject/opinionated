Shabazz challenges the district court\u2019s rulings on several motions, and he argues that the court should have held a hearing to explore other options for injunctive relief against defendants. Having carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments and the record on appeal, we agree with the district court\u2019s rulings for the reasons stated by the court, we find no merit to Shabazz\u2019s argument that he was entitled to an additional hearing, and we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-19\">. The Honorable James M.
