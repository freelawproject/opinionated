Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b145-16\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Crockett appeals from the district court\u2019s January 8, 2007 order granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and affirming the administrative law judge\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d). We agree with the district court that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Crockett was not eligible for DIB was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. of New York v. N.L.R.B., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-18\">The district court held that the ALJ correctly found that Crockett\u2019s condition did not satisfy the statutory definition of a disability articulated in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d). Under \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A), it is not sufficient for one seeking DIB merely to be unable to perform their previous work. To have a \u201cdisability\u201d for DIB purposes, it must also be the case that the individual \u201ccannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). This does not describe Crockett\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-19\">The ALJ found that Crockett could not perform her prior work, but nevertheless concluded, in light of Crockett\u2019s \u201cresidual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>functional capacity,\u201d that there remained other jobs in the national economy that she could perform. Specifically, in conducting its five-step analysis pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4) and 416.920(a)(4), the ALJ concluded that Crockett: (1) was \u201cnot engaged in substantial gainful activity\u201d; (2) her \u201cimpairments ... are considered \u2018severe\u2019 \u201d; (3) her conditions neither met, nor were medically equivalent to, certain impairments in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulation No. 4; (4) she could not perform her past employment role; and (5) she still had enough \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d to be able to do other jobs available in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">As the district court noted, the ALJ reached this conclusion after evaluating the medical opinions of both treating and consulting physicians. And while Crockett\u2019s treating physician\u2019s opinion conflicted with the opinions of other consulting physicians, the treating physician\u2019s opinion was outweighed by substantial evidence. \u201cAlthough the treating physician rule generally requires deference to the medical opinion of a claimant\u2019s treating physician,\u201d we have pointed out that such an opinion \u201cis not afforded controlling weight where, as here, the treating physician issued opinions that are not consistent with other substantial evidence in the record, such as the opinions of other medical experts.\u201d <em>Halloran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d 28, 32 (2d Cir.2004). The substantial evidence that was contrary to the opinion of Crockett\u2019s treating physician included Crockett\u2019s own acknowledgment that she goes to movies and eats out and, if feeling well, participates in water aerobics as much as three or four times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the decision and order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
