Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b157-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b157-21\">Defendant-Appellant Ernest Varacalli appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on 5 July 24, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, following a resentencing before the Honorable Barbara S. Jones. Varacalli was originally sentenced to a total of 121 months imprisonment by the Honorable John S. Martin, then-United States District Judge, on December 13, 2002. By Order dated July 12, 2005, this Court remanded the case in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2005). On remand, the case was assigned to Judge Jones; Judge Martin had left the bench in the interim. On July 12, 2006, the District Court resentenced Varacalli to a total of 108 months imprisonment (a reduction of 13 months from his original sentence). Familiarity by the parties is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Varacalli\u2019s sole argument is that \u201cthe District Court erred in finding that it did not have [the] authority to re-sentence [him] <em>de novo </em>pursuant to the remand order of the Second Circuit,\u201d and, on that basis, he seeks only \u201can opportunity to be heard at a full re-sentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Varacal-li\u2019s argument appears to be premised on his allegation that Judge Jones rejected his argument that he had properly preserved a Sixth Amendment objection to an increased sentence based on judicial fact-finding at his initial sentencing proceeding and was thus entitled to an automatic re-sentencing under <em>United States v. Fagans, </em>406 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2005). Under <em>Fa-gans, </em>a defendant whose appeal was pending when the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>and who preserved his objection to sentencing enhancements based on facts found by a judge rather than a jury, is entitled to automatic resen-tencing unless the Government can show that the sentencing error caused by the mandatory use of the guidelines was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 142; <em>see also United States v. Lake, </em>419 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2005). Judge Jones did not reject Varacalli\u2019s <em>Fa-</em>gans-based argument, however. Instead, she noted that \u201cwhether or not Varacalli should have gotten automatic resentencing under <em>Fagans </em>is really academic,\u201d because she\u2019d already \u201cmade the decision to resen-tence him.\u201d She made explicit her \u201cin-tension] to ... review all of the materials, look at them and resentence.\u201d Judge Jones then proceeded to resentence Vara-calli <em>de novo. </em>She heard complete arguments on both of the contested guidelines issues (loss amount and criminal history) and \u201cmade <em>de novo </em>finding[s] on [them], which are the same as Judge Martin\u2019s assessment, having looked at all the facts.\u201d Finally, having \u201ctaken into account\u201d all of the relevant sentencing factors, Judge Jones decide to \u201creduce [Varacalli\u2019s] sentence by one year,\u201d because \u201che has a deteriorating medical condition ... that ... is going to make it increasingly difficult for him to spend time in prison.\u201d Thus, Varacalli has already received the \u201copportunity to be heard at a full re-sentencing\u201d that he now requests \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that he may not have been legally entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\">. In his statement of the issues, Varacalli also asks \u201c[w]hether the standard of reasonableness as applied to sentencing is Constitutional.\u201d However, Varacalli never mentions this issue again nor makes any argument related to it. In any case, \u201creasonableness\u201d is the standard of review that the Supreme Court instructed appellate courts to apply in <em>Booker, </em>and the Second Circuit has followed that in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>struction, as it must. <em>See Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 110-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
