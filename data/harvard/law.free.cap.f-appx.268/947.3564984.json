Nicholson, </em>No. 05-3609, 2007 WL 2301915 (Vet.App. July 31, 2007). Because we lack authority to review either \u201ca challenge to a factual determination\u201d or \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case\u201d absent a constitutional issue, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), we <em>dismiss </em>the portion of his appeal regarding the denial of retroactive vocational rehabilitation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The board did not reach the substance of his compensable rating claim for service-connected hypertensive vascular disease, because it remanded a threshold procedural issue \u2014 whether Parker\u2019s notice of disagreement to an April 13, 2000, Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office rating decision was timely filed in accordance with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105 and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 19.29, 19.30. Because the Veterans Court has jurisdiction only over final board decisions, it was correct to dismiss Parker\u2019s appeal with respect to his claim for service connection for hypertensive vascular disease. Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>that portion of the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
