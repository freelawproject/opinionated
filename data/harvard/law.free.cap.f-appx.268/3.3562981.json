It is</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">Appellant Keith Campbell (Campbell) pleaded guilty to two counts of a multi-count indictment charging Campbell and several unindicted co-conspirators with filing false federal, District of Columbia and Maryland individual income tax returns. On August 7, 2006, Campbell pleaded guilty to counts one (conspiracy to file false claims in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286) and thirteen (first degree theft in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-3211, 22-3212(a), 22-1805) and the Government agreed to dismiss the remaining charges. The parties also agreed to a stipulated sentence of 36 months pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">The Government submitted a sentencing memorandum urging the district court to accept the plea agreement. Although Campbell agreed that the district court should accept his plea, he requested that the court impose a sentence \u201cconcurrently with his previous Superior Court matter.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. in Aid of Sentencing U 2 (Nov. 24, 2006). At the time of his plea, Campbell was serving a five-year sentence after having pleaded guilty to unrelated charges of first degree fraud in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-382KA), 3822(A) and first degree theft in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3212 in D.C. Superior Court (involving Campbell\u2019s having uttered a forged check made out to his alias, \u201cGeorge Dyson\u201d). On December 11, 2006, the district court accepted the plea, including the stipulated 36-month sentence, and denied Campbell\u2019s request that the sentence run concurrently with his then-completed Superior Court sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-16\">Section 5G1.3(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) provides that \u201c [i]f ... a term of imprison-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>merit resulted from another offense that is <em>relevant conduct </em>to the instant offense of conviction ... the court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the <em>undischarged </em>term of imprisonment if the court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons[ ] and ... the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the <em>undischarged </em>term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) (emphases added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Campbell had completed his Superior Court sentence by the time the district court sentenced him, section 5G1.3 did not apply. The Guidelines indicate, however, that a court has discretion to make a sentence concurrent with an undischarged sentence if neither subsection (a) nor subsection (b) of section 5G1.3 applies. <em>See </em>5G1.3(c). <em>Cf </em>\u00a7 5K2.23 (downward departure may be appropriate if defendant completed term of imprisonment to which section 5G1.3 would have applied had that sentence not been completed at time of sentencing). The district court indicated that exercising its discretion to make Campbell\u2019s sentence concurrent would have been inconsistent with the stipulated sentence and that section 5Gl.3(b) would not have applied to the discharged sentence in any event because it was not served for an offense that constituted \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u201cRelevant conduct\u201d includes acts or omissions \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). We defer to the district court\u2019s determination of what constitutes the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d \u201c[bjecause the question of whether conduct in a given case constitutes a \u2018course of conduct\u2019 is inherently fact intensive.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>161 F.3d 24, 28 (D.C.Cir.1998). The district court concluded that Campbell\u2019s Superior Court charges did not qualify as relevant conduct. Campbell argued that those charges involved the \u201c \u2018same general type\u2019 \u201d of offense and the \u201csame societal harm\u201d of stealing money and that he used the same alias. Appellant\u2019s Br. 8-11 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n. 6). As the district court noted, however, the Superior Court charges involved Campbell\u2019s attempt \u201cto cash a single stolen check that he had forged and uttered\u201d which check was drawn on a private account whereas his conviction here was based on a conspiracy to file false income tax returns \u201cin order to get tax refunds from ... government entities\u201d and on his uttering of \u201ca DC government check issued for a tax return based on a false tax filing.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 15-16, Dec. 11, 2006. Giving due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts, <em>see Jackson, </em>161 F.3d at 28, we agree with its conclusion. <em>Compare Jackson, </em>161 F.3d at 30 (similar drug transactions between 1992 and 1996 between same parties and same Colombian intermediaries constituted relevant conduct), <em>United States v. Wishnefsky, </em>7 F.3d 254 (D.C.Cir.1993) (embezzlement occurring continuously from 1980 to 1990 constituted one course of conduct), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 9(B) (failure to file tax returns for three consecutive years constitutes course of conduct), <em>with United States v. Fermin, </em>32 F.3d 674, 681 (2d Cir.1994) (drug transactions in 1983-85 not relevant conduct to 1990-91 drug conspiracy), <em>abrogated in other respects by Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>S.Ct. 501, 138 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), <em>and United States v. Kappes, </em>936 F.2d 227, 231 (6th Cir.1991) (obtaining postal job under false pretenses in 1983 and making false statements on occupational injury form in 1989 not relevant conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Pursuant to D.C.

The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed.

The district court applied the 2003 version of section 5G1.3 of the Guidelines.
