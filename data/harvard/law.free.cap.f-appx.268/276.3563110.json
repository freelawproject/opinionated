We liberally construe the notice to include case number 2:03-CR-348-2, which concerns the sentence imposed following the revocation of his su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>pervised release, and in which a judgment was rendered at the same hearing at which the sentence was imposed in case number 2:06-CR-88-l. <em>See Trust Co. Bank v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>950 F.2d 1144, 1148 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Donju\u00e1n argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in failing to give oral or written reasons for sentencing him above the advisory guideline range for the revocation of his supervised release and for failing to consider the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements concerning the advisory guideline range. Because the district court stated that it had considered both the guideline policy statements and Donjuan\u2019s multiple supervised release law violations and because the record indicates that the district court considered the appropriate advisory guideline range, the district court did not commit plain error in sentencing Donju\u00e1n. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Montez, </em>952 F.2d 854, 860 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
