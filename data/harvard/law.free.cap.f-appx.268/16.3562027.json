Laws 3247, 3248, violated the fourth category of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>impermissible Ex Post Facto laws recognized in <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798) (laws that alter the legal rules of evidence). On February 18, 2004, judgment was entered dismissing his complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). DeGrijze appeals this judgment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) and construes \u201cthe complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). <em>See also Weinstein v. Albright, </em>261 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2001) (noting that courts are instructed, in particular, to construe liberally the claims of pro se litigants raising civil rights complaints). For substantially the reasons expressed in the opinions of the district court judge and magistrate judge, dated February 4, 2004, and August 15, 2002, respectively, we affirm the dismissal of DeGrijze\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We have considered all of Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
