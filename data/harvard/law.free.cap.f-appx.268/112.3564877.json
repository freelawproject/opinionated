Bun-denying Xie\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jian Lu Xie, </em>No. A 97 957 972 (B.I.A. June 19, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 957 972 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 29, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">We review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). The agency\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ reasonably found implausible that Xie: (1) became a Falun Gong instructor within four months of having learned the practice himself; (2) taught Falun Gong in a government hospital, when he acknowledged that he knew that Falun Gong had been outlawed by the Chinese government; and (3) taught Falun Gong to students at the school where he worked, after having been fired from his job at the hospital for the same reason. These findings were proper where the IJ developed the record such that the reasons for her incredulity were apparent. <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2007) (affirming when implausibility is \u201cviewed in the light of common sense and ordinary experience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">In addition, the IJ reasonably based her adverse credibility determination on her finding that Xie\u2019s asylum application and testimony were inconsistent regarding how he came to be fired from his job at the hospital. He testified that hospital officials discovered that he was teaching Falun Gong in the hospital, but made no such assertion in his asylum application. Because this inconsistency concerned the central element of Xie\u2019s claim, it was plainly \u201cmaterial to his claim of persecution,\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc), and substantial when measured against the record as a whole, <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). Therefore, the IJ properly relied on this inconsistency as a basis for her adverse credibility determination. Although Xie was given the opportunity to explain these inconsistencies and implausibilities, the IJ reasonably rejected his explanations. <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>less those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Lastly, the IJ did not err in finding that Xie\u2019s failure to submit evidence corroborating his claim rendered him unable to rehabilitate testimony that had already been cast in doubt. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">However, the IJ erred by basing her adverse credibility determination on her finding that Xie\u2019s testimony about his practice of Falun Gong was \u201clacking in detail\u201d where she did not ask him to provide additional details. <em>See Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the record did not support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding in the absence of additional probing).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">This error notwithstanding, remand would be futile because, based on the properly made findings outlined above, it can be \u201cconfidently predicted]\u201d that the IJ would reach the same decision on remand. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 339. The Id\u2019s adverse credibility determination was amply supported by her findings of inconsistencies and implausibilities that were material to Xie\u2019s claims, and his failure to rehabilitate his testimony with corroborating evidence. Accordingly, the IJ properly found that Xie failed to meet the burden of proof required for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT, where each of his claims was based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Xie further claims that the BIA violated his due process rights by declining to review the \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d evidence he submitted in support of his appeal to the BIA. Although Xie asserted in his appeal to the BIA that \u201c[i]n the alternative, this matter should be remanded to proper adjudication of the newly available evidence,\u201d he did not file a motion to remand as required by regulation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (providing that a \u201cparty asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further factfinding must file a motion for remand\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA did not violate Xie\u2019s due process rights by declining to consider the new evidence he submitted. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">. To the extent the IJ's finding can be read to question Xie's practice of Falun Gong by virtue of his lack of doctrinal knowledge, it was in error. <em>See Yose Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cBoth history and common sense make amply clear that people can identify with a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion\u2019s doctrinal tenets, and that those same people can be persecuted for their religious affiliation.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
