We conclude that jurisdiction is lacking. <em>See Specialty Mills, Inc. v. Citizens State Bank, </em>51 F.3d 770, 773 (8th Cir.1995) (court of appeals considers jurisdiction on its own motion). A section 3582(c)(2) motion is not a civil postconviction action, but a continuation of a criminal case. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Petty, </em>82 F.3d 809, 810 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (time limits for appealing in criminal cases apply to appeal from denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). A magistrate judge may enter judgment in a civil action with consent of the parties, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1), while a district judge may designate a magistrate judge to prepare proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition of applications for post-trial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
