R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b26-22\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed January 25, 2006, and April 19, 2006, be affirmed. Because no separate judgment was entered dismissing the complaint, and the document captioned \u201cPlaintiffs Application for Leave to Appeal In Forma Pauperis\u201d was received in this court on November 13, 2006, the appeal from the judgment was timely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a); <em>Hyland v. Roberts, </em>No. 07-5144 (D.C.Cir. Sept. 17, 2007) (per curiam). Appellant has failed to establish that the district court erred in holding that this case was barred by sovereign immunity, or in granting the government\u2019s motion to vacate default, denying appellant\u2019s motion for default judgment, and denying as moot appellant\u2019s remaining motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-23\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>hearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
