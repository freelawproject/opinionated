We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal, <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000), and we review for abuse of discretion the IJ\u2019s denial of humanitarian asylum, <em>Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the government rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution by the Guatemalan government because the IJ did an individualized analysis of changed country conditions in Guatemala that is supported by the record. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998-99 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Lucas-Perez\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution based on retaliation from a neighboring family in Guatemala lacks a nexus to a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Za-carias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">Because Lucas-Perez failed to satisfy the standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying humanitarian asylum where Lucas-Perez failed to show sufficiently severe past persecution or a reasonable possibility of other serious harm upon removal to Guatemala. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(in)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b698-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
