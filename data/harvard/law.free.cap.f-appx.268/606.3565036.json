The IJ denied relief on the grounds that Youssefs testimony was not credible, and Youssef had not met his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">This court has jurisdiction over petitions for review that raise colorable constitutional claims or question of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because the BIA issued its own decision adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews both decisions. <em>Andriasian v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 1033, 1040 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact [including adverse credibility findings] are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). This court reviews adverse credibility findings under a deferential \u201csubstantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cSo long as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of [the petitioner\u2019s] claim of persecution, we are bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">A petitioner must be afforded \u201ca reasonable opportunity to offer an explanation of any perceived inconsistencies that form the basis of a denial of asylum.\u201d <em>Compos-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999). An IJ needn\u2019t take a petitioner\u2019s explanations at face value, but must allow the petitioner the opportunity to offer them. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In explaining why Youssef was not credible, the IJ stated that it \u201cstrains credulity to believe ... [t]hat an attack by four grown men, hitting [Youssef] with chains, while he was running and hiding, could last for one hour.\u201d The alleged beating by Islamic extremists is central to Youssefs claim of persecution, and his inability to give a credible description of the beating is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding under this court\u2019s deferential standard of review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The IJ specifically questioned Youssef about his implausible description of the alleged beatings by Islamic extremists. However, when given the opportunity to elaborate upon or clarify his earlier description and address the IJ\u2019s doubts directly, Youssefs explanation became increasingly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Although some of the IJ\u2019s enumerated grounds for his credibility determination might not withstand scrutiny, his disbelief of Youssefs claim that he was beaten is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Moreover, the IJ gave Youssef a specific opportunity to address that basis and to offer an explanation for his earlier testimony\u2019s implausibility. Neither the initial testimony nor the increasingly vague explanation offered by Youssef compel this court to find Youssef credible. Therefore, this court defers to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Wang, </em>352 F.3d at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<em>ed </em>by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">. Petitioner argues that the IJ's determination on this issue was improper speculation and conjecture under <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000). In <em>Bandari, </em>this court found: \"The IJ's assertion that [Ban-dari's] account was unbelievable is based solely on her subjective view of when a person should bleed given her view of the severity of the flogging.\" <em>Id. </em>Although the IJ in this case questioned Youssef about the severity of his injuries, <em>Bandari </em>is distinguishable because the IJ based his adverse credibility finding on Youssefs unconvincing and increasingly evasive description of the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
