On May 30, 2006, the BIA denied Suparkana\u2019s requests for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), upholding the decision of an Immigration Judge (IJ). Because we are without jurisdiction to hear Suparkana\u2019s asylum claim, we must dismiss it. Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions regarding withholding of removal and CAT relief, we will deny these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-19\">The Attorney General may grant asylum to aliens who are \u201crefugees\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). To be eligible, an applicant must \u201cdemonstrate!] by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), unless the \u201calien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General ... extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). If the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>General determines that a petition was untimely filed, and that no extraordinary circumstances exist, Courts of Appeals are without jurisdiction to review this finding unless it raises a constitutional claim or a question of law. <em>Compare </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(8) (stripping courts of jurisdiction) <em>with </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (permitting judicial review over constitutional claims and questions of law); <em>see also Jarbough v. Attorney General, </em>488 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The Attorney General must grant withholding of removal if he \u201cdecides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened\u201d in the country of removal due to one of the five protected grounds. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The alien bears the burden of proving that she will more likely than not face persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Finally, an applicant for relief under the CAT bears the burden of establishing \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). This standard \u201chas no subjective component, but instead requires the alien to establish, by objective evidence that he is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Sev-oian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 175 (3d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have held that \u201ceven cruel and inhuman behavior by government officials may not implicate the torture regulations,\u201d <em>id., </em>because \u201c[tjorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Suparkana was born in 1974 and is a native and citizen of Indonesia. She is also a Catholic of Chinese descent. Supar-kana arrived in the United States on February 10, 2001 on a non-immigrant visa. On March 31, 2003, Suparkana filed her application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. The Department of Homeland Security issued Suparkana a Notice to Appear on May 28, 2003, charging her with being removable for overstaying her visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">On December 21, 2004, the IJ held a hearing on Suparkana\u2019s claims. Suparka-na argued that her asylum application should be considered, notwithstanding that she filed it outside of the one-year deadline, because the delay was caused by extraordinary circumstances. Specifically, Suparkana claimed that upon arrival in the United States, she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the psychological effects of her persecution, and this rendered her incapable of applying for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">To support this assertion, Suparkana proffered a psychiatric evaluation performed by Dr. Laura Sanchez, an Assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania (the Evaluation). After a one-hour examination performed on May 17, 2004, Dr. Sanchez had opined \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d that \u201cMs. Suparkana suffers from chronic [PTSD] ... as a result of traumatic events associated with the political situation\u201d in Indonesia. JA 110 (Evaluation at 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The government moved to exclude the Evaluation because it did not have a chance to cross-examine Dr. Sanchez. The IJ agreed, holding the Evaluation \u201cinadmissible in light of the briefness of the evaluation\u201d and \u201cthe fact that it is unsworn and the psychiatrist was not made available for either live or telephonic testimony.\u201d JA 22 (Dec. 21, 2004 Op. at 3). The IJ did, however, enter into the record an Assessment to Refer completed by the asylum officer who first interviewed Su-parkana. This Assessment indicated that Suparkana stated she had not applied for asylum on time because she did not know about it, not because of PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">After making these evidentiary findings, the IJ heard testimony. Suparkana was asked whether her ignorance of the asylum process was \u201cthe only reason that you did not timely file?\u201d JA 92 (Dec. 21, 2004 Hrg. Tr. at 62). Suparkana replied, \u201cYes, that\u2019s my position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the IJ asked why, if Suparkana was not mentally competent, she had not mentioned her incompetence to the asylum officer, Supar-kana replied that it was \u201c[b]ecause I didn\u2019t know what the political process [was.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The IJ held that Suparkana had not met her burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that her application was filed within one year after the date of her arrival in the United States, or that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d could toll the statute\u2019s application. <em>See </em>JA 22-23 (Dec. 21, 2004 Op. at 3-4); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The IJ relied, primarily, on Suparkana\u2019s own testimony at the December 21, 2004 hearing, which the IJ found to be overwhelming evidence that ignorance, and not PTSD, caused Suparka-na\u2019s filing delay. <em>See id. </em>The BIA upheld both the IJ\u2019s evidentiary findings and her asylum decision. <em>See </em>JA 4 (May 30, 2006 BIA Op. at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Suparkana now argues that the IJ\u2019s exclusion of the Evaluation and inclusion of the Assessment violated her due process rights by depriving her of a \u201cneutral and impartial hearing.\u201d Suparkana Br. at 8. According to Suparkana, the IJ\u2019s professed problems with the Dr. Sanchez Evaluation went to its credibility, not its admissibility, and the IJ\u2019s \u201creliance\u201d on the Assessment to Refer did not comport with an operating policy of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, \u201cwhich expressly prohibits the use of the Assessment to Refer in areas dealing with an alien\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">We are without jurisdiction to hear this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (a)(3). In <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2003), we explained that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201cclearly deprives us of jurisdiction to review an IJ\u2019s determination that an asylum petition was not filed within the one year limitations period, and that such period was not tolled by extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Although \u201c[t]he REAL ID Act of 2005 create[d] a narrow exception to this prohibition to permit judicial review over constitutional claims and questions of law raised in petitions for review,\u201d <em>Jarbough, </em>483 F.3d at 190, it is settled that \u201ccourts of appeals continue to have no jurisdiction to review discretionary ... determinations presented in petitions for review,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 188. We have held specifically that \u201carguments such as that an Immigration Judge ... failed to consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>er evidence ... are not questions of law under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. Therefore, Suparkana\u2019s claim that the IJ refused to consider certain evidence, and improperly considered other evidence, falls squarely into the category of claims over which we remain without jurisdiction. <em>See Jarbough, </em>483 F.3d at 189 (finding no jurisdiction over due process claim that IJ\u2019s extraordinary circumstances analysis \u201cignored certain evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We do have jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, based upon our ability to review final orders of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court applies the \u201cextremely deferential\u201d substantial evidence standard to the Attorney General\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 223 (3d Cir.2004). Accordingly, we will reverse the Attorney General\u2019s determinations on issues like past persecution, the likelihood of future persecution, and the likelihood of torture only if \u201cthe evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 484 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Suparkana asserts that she has been \u201csubjected to a life of harassment and discrimination because of my being a Chinese and a Christian[ ] in an Islamic country.\u201d JA 116 (1-589 at 5). She refers to a number of instances in which Muslim Indonesians derided her ethnicity and taunted her for being Chinese. She also claims that in 1991, she and her sister were robbed in a bakery. Although many Muslims were in the store, she and her sister were the only ones victimized. Finally, she refers to two incidents of inappropriate sexual contact: first, while in public elementary school, a group of five Muslim students touched her in sexual ways and stared at her body, which made her extremely self-conscious; and second, in 1993, as Suparkana and a friend walked into a public plaza, a group of Muslim men blocked their path and assaulted Suparka-na and her friend, touching and rubbing their hands \u201call over us, including our breasts and hips.\u201d JA 122 (1-589 at 12). Suparkana states that \u201cmany Chinese women were captured and ra[p]ed\u201d in anti-Chinese rioting that gripped Indonesia in May 1998, and she asserts that although she was neither captured nor raped, she \u201cfear[sj ... that they will catch me next time and rape me or perhaps kill me.\u201d JA 117 (1-589 at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The IJ decided that Suparkana had not met her burden of establishing a threat to her life or freedom by a clear probability. <em>See Jarbough, </em>483 F.3d at 190. The IJ first noted that in the May 2004 annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom\u2014 whose conclusions were stipulated to by the parties \u2014 religiously-motivated violence in Indonesia was limited largely to the Moluccan Islands and to Sulawesi, but Su-parkana showed \u201cno connection to any of these areas.\u201d JA 23 (Dec. 21, 2004 Op. at 4). Moreover, while the IJ sympathized with Suparkana\u2019s experiences of sexual harassment, the IJ decided that there had been no showing, either by Suparkana or by the 2003 Department of State Country Report for Indonesia, \u201cthat ethnic Chinese women are the only targets\u201d of rape and sexual harassment, or that Suparkana\u2019s tormentors were motivated \u201con account\u201d of any protected ground. Therefore, Su-parkana failed to show that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>clear probability that she would be persecuted if she returned to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Suparkana now argues that she has demonstrated her eligibility for withholding of removal based on \u201caggregated incidents of past mistreatment suffered in [her] home country.\u201d Suparkana Br. at 13-14. Suparkana analogizes her situation to that of the petitioner in <em>Matter of O-Z- &amp; I-Z- </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 23 (B.I.A.1998). In <em>Matter of 0-Z-, </em>a Jewish Ukranian national suffered numerous beatings, repeatedly received personalized anti-Semitic flyers and written threats at his home, and had his apartment broken into and his possessions destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 24. Further, his son was beaten and sexually humiliated in a manner designed to expose his Judaism. <em>Id. </em>The BIA found in favor of the petitioners, both because their injuries rose to the level of persecution and because petitioners had shown that \u201cin each instance, the persecutors were motivated by a desire to punish the respondent and his son on account of their Jewish nationality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The instant case is distinguishable. Suparkana has not alleged incidents similar in degree to those recounted in <em>In re 0-Z-. </em>Although Suparkana listed two incidents of sexual harassment and stated her fears of being raped, this is simply not the type of harm needed to compel a finding of persecution. <em>C.f. Fatin, </em>12 F.3d at 1240, 1243. More importantly, however, Suparkana makes no colorable showing that her tormentors \u2014 besides those who called her names \u2014 were motivated by anti-Christian or anti-Chinese animus. She therefore fails to demonstrate that her troubles were \u201con account of\u2019 her religion or ethnicity. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 132. Rather, Suparkana appears to have been the victim of ordinary criminal and harassing activity\u2014 unfortunate and humiliating, to be sure, but not persecution under applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Suparkana\u2019s brief does not provide any separate analysis of her CAT claim. Based on our review of the record, however, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Suparkana has not shown she is more likely than not to be tortured upon her return to Indonesia. <em>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182-83 (3d Cir.2003). Suparkana, therefore, cannot obtain CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss in part and deny in part Suparkana\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-11\">. Generally, a refugee is someone who demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to return to their prior country of residence \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d on account of one of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(42)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">. Past persecution requires proof of \"(1) one or more incidents rising to the level of persecution; (2) that is \u2018on account of' one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed either by the government or by forces that the government is either unable or unwilling to control.\" <em>Mulanga v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir.2003). We have defined persecution as \"an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1243 (3d Cir.1993). Instead, it encompasses only grave harms such as \"threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1240. A showing of past persecution creates a rebut-table presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">. On this issue, the BIA affirmed without an independently reviewable decision, and so we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Berishaj v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 314, 322 (3d Cir.2004) <em>(citing </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(e)(4)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
