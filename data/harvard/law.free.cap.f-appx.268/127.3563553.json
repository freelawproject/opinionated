The Honorable Brian M. Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b152-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">Defendant-Appellant Larry Brown appeals from an August 2, 2006, 442 F.Supp.2d 132, decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (McMahon, J.) denying him summary judgment on Plaintiffs-Ap-pellees Evarista Garcia and Michelle Merino\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The District Court found that Plaintiffs were entitled to a trial on their claim that Brown facilitated Defendant Tanya Parson\u2019s attack on them, which violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights to Due Process either as a result of the excessive force used by Parson, <em>see Hemphill v. Schott, </em>141 F.3d 412, 418 (2d Cir.1998), or as a result of Brown\u2019s failure to intervene, <em>see Dwares v. New York, </em>985 F.2d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1993). In so doing, the District Court rejected Brown\u2019s motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) and on the grounds of qualified immunity. Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">An order denying summary judgment is not usually an appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 524, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). However, there are exceptions when the doctrine of qualified immunity is invoked. <em>Salim v. Proulx, </em>93 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir.1996). An order denying summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity \u201cas a matter of law\u201d is appealable, but if a district court has identified genuinely disputed issues of material fact that must be resolved in order to adjudicate the immunity defense, the order remains unappealable. <em>Martinez v. City of Schenectady, </em>115 F.3d 111, 114 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The elements of a \u00a7 1983 claim are: (1) that the conduct in question deprived a person of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States, and (2) that the acts were attributable at least in part to a person acting under color of state law. <em>See Dwares, </em>985 F.2d at 98. In <em>Dwares, </em>this Court found that \u201ca prearranged official sanction of privately inflicted injury ... violated the victim\u2019s rights under the Due Process Clause\u201d and could thus form the basis of a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Id. </em>at 99. Here, the District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">If a reasonable jury believed Garcia\u2019s version of events ..., it could infer \u2014 by coupling the Brown-Parson [conversation before Parson\u2019s attack] ... with Brown\u2019s extraordinary and most unprofessional inaction during the subsequent attack on Garcia and her daughter \u2014 that Brown somehow communicated to Parson that she should proceed with her assault and he would not interfere. Based on Garcia\u2019s testimony that Officer Brown allowed Parson to attack her and her daughter while he looked on from his squad car \u2014 and that he refused to respond to two pleas for assistance directed to him \u2014 a reasonable jury could find that Brown\u2019s actions \u201cshocked the conscience,\u201d and thus were sufficient to create <em>Dwares </em>liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">On appeal, Brown couches all of his arguments as reasons why he is entitled to a defense of qualified immunity; in reality, most of his arguments \u2014 if accepted by this Court \u2014 are also reasons why he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>F.R.C.P. 56(c) (\u201cThe judgment sought should be rendered if ... there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">First, Brown argues that Plaintiffs fail to raise an issue of fact with regard to their claim that he pre-sanctioned Parson\u2019s attack, because he never had the conversation with Parsons during which Garcia and Merino allege that the sanction took place. We reject Brown\u2019s argument as his denial actually highlights the disputed issue of fact underlying Plaintiffs\u2019 Dwares-based \u00a7 1983 claim: Whether the conversation Garcia alleged she observed in her sworn deposition actually took place. <em>See also Fisher v. Shamburg, </em>624 F.2d 156, 162 (10th Cir.1980) (holding that where the issue of conspiracy must be resolved on the credibility of the witnesses, summary judgment is inappropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Second, Brown argues that the District Court must have determined that there was no conspiracy between Brown and Parson when it dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1985 claim for conspiracy to violate Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection rights because of Garcia\u2019s race. Thus, the District Court had to determine that Brown\u2019s alleged conversation with Parson before the assault was innocuous. We reject this claim. The District Court rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1985 claim on the grounds that \u201cthe record ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>contains no competent evidence of racial or ethnic animus on Brown\u2019s part,\u201d and specifically noted that: \u201cThis does not mean that the jury will not hear evidence ... related to the purported conspiracy. There is no requirement under \u00a7 1988 that a party be motivated by racial or ethnic animus.... So testimony about the conversation (or lack of any conversation) ... is still relevant [to] the <em>Dwares </em>claim.\u201d Finally, we reject Brown\u2019s claim that \u201ca reasonable jury could not find that the inaction of ... a police officer who did not find a playground bully fast enough\u201d \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d as required for a \u00a7 1983 claim. Brown again ignores disputed facts at issue (i.e., whether the conversation took place and whether Brown looked on while Garcia and her daughter were assaulted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">This Court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">Our analysis of a qualified immunity claim consists of a three step inquiry. First, we must determine whether plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right. Then we consider if the violated right was clearly established at the time of the conduct. Finally, if plaintiff had a clearly established, constitutionally protected right that was violated by the actions of the [defendants], he or she must demonstrate that defendants\u2019 actions were not objectively reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>Harhay v. Ellington Bd. of Educ., </em>323 F.3d 206, 211 (2d Cir.2003) (internal citations omitted). Though Brown claims that he is \u201centitled to qualified immunity because [Plaintiffs] did not clearly establish a constitutional right to Due Process,\u201d he offers no critique of the District Court\u2019s determination that <em>Dwares </em>clearly established an individual\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from the sort of officially pre-sanctioned violence Plaintiffs allege in this case. Rather, Brown argues that Plaintiffs cannot meet the third step of the qualified immunity inquiry \u2014 that his actions were not \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d The District Court found that if a jury credited Plaintiffs\u2019 testimony regarding the alleged conversation and Brown\u2019s inaction while observing Parson and the group of youngsters attacking Garcia and Merino, \u201cno reasonable police officer could have thought he was privileged to act (or not act) as Officer Brown did \u2014 especially a policeman who was aware, as Brown was, that Garcia had been assaulted by the same individuals only moments earlier.\u201d Brown\u2019s claim to the contrary \u2014 that his failure to find the suspect described by Garcia quickly enough was objectively reasonable \u2014 simply ignores an underlying disputed issue of fact once again (i.e., whether he pre-sanctioned Parson\u2019s assault) and is thus unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Brown also challenges the District Court\u2019s finding that Plaintiffs established another viable basis for their \u00a7 1983 claim: Parson\u2019s use of excessive force. In <em>Hemp-hill, </em>this Court found that \u201c[o]ne embodiment of [a] claim for relief from excessive force based in Due Process is the situation in which the state actor aids and abets a private party in subjecting a citizen to unwarranted physical harm.\u201d 141 F.3d at 418. The District Court found Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the \u201cforce used against them by Parson ought to be imputed against Officer Brown by virtue of their ... conspiracy\u201d in violation of \u00a7 1983\u2019s prohibition on excessive force to be viable under <em>Hemphill. </em>Brown\u2019s argument that the injuries suffered by Plaintiffs were not severe enough to implicate \u00a7 1983\u2019s prohibition on excessive force was not raised by Defendants below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if we were inclined to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>sider the argument, because Defendants did not challenge the severity of Plaintiffs\u2019 injury below, it is not apparent from the limited factual record before us how severe those injuries were.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Because Brown is not entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law and there are disputed issues of material fact that must be resolved in order to adjudicate his immunity defense, the District Court\u2019s order is not an appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Martinez, </em>115 F.3d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">. Though Brown claims to have briefed this argument below, the three parts of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that he cites for this proposition are: a few sentences in the procedural history section of his brief below indicating that Michelle Merino was not seriously injured in the attack; the two-page argument in his brief below that Brown himself did not use excessive force; and a nearly thirty page long section of the record containing declarations by several of plaintiffs' witnesses and plaintiffs\u2019 brief below. None of the these citations support Brown\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
