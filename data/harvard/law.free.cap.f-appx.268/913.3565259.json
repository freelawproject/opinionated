Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 99-761V (Fed.Cl. Jan. 30, 2007). Because we find nothing arbitrary or capricious about the special master\u2019s factual findings, we <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-24\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b937-25\">We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 review of a special master\u2019s decision without deference. <em>Walther v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>485 F.3d 1146, 1148 (Fed.Cir.2007). In that review, we affirm the special master\u2019s factual determinations unless \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and modify legal conclusions if we determine they are \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-26\">Marks pursued a claim for compensation for James\u2019s swelling or lymphangioma, an injury not appearing on the Vaccine Injury Table. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3. She therefore presents an off-Table claim, and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>prove, among other things, actual causation. <em>Walther, </em>485 F.3d at 1149. To prove actual causation, a petitioner must demonstrate \u201c(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect; and (3) a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The special master found that Marks\u2019s evidence of causation could not be found in the medical records. <em>Marks v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 99-761V, slip op. at 5-6 (June 2, 2006). The special master criticized Marks\u2019s evidence from Dr. Campbell as not amounting to an expert opinion and failing to prove causation, at least because it lacked a medical theory or any basis for his conclusions. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 6-7. Further, the special master considered the testimony of Terri Jarreau, who cared for James and Marks following James\u2019s birth, and concluded that Jar-reau\u2019s testimony cast doubt upon Marks\u2019s contention that James\u2019s leg was extremely swollen after the first shot. <em>Id,., </em>slip op. at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Highlighting medical records created at James\u2019s birth, the special master confirmed his earlier findings that the lym-phangioma pre-dated the vaccinations and that James received the first vaccination in his right leg \u2014 not the leg with the lym-phangioma. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 8. We find nothing arbitrary or capricious about the special master\u2019s factual findings. Dr. Campbell\u2019s letter does not amount to an opinion sufficient to prove causation, and the medical records from James\u2019s birth directly contradict a showing of causation by the vaccine. Accordingly, we affirm the decision by the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
