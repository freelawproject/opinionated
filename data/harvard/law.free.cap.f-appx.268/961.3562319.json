For the reasons set forth below, the Board\u2019s final decision is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-23\">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. On March 4, 2003, Peterson signed a memorandum acknowledging that his Firefighter position was a testing designated position for random drug testing in accord with the Navy\u2019s Drug-Free Workplace Program Handbook. The memorandum also stated that the penalty for a first-time drug offense ranged from reprimand to removal. On April 25, 2006, Peterson was informed that his urine had tested positive for THC, a metabolite of marijuana. In a June 12, 2006 meeting with Peterson\u2019s first line supervisor Lt. Joseph O\u2019Hara, Peterson admitted that he had attended a party, gotten drunk, and smoked marijuana. Peterson claimed that this was a one-time occurrence caused by impaired judgment stemming from his inebriation by alcohol. The agency does not contest Peterson\u2019s position that this was a one time occurrence. Lt. O\u2019Hara issued a Notice of Proposed Removal, which gave Peterson ten days to respond to the Deciding Official, Captain Richard P\u00f3stera. Cpt. P\u00f3stera met with Peterson and the union representative and subsequently is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>sued a Notice of Decision on July 12, 2006, removing Peterson from his employment by the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">This court\u2019s review of an agency\u2019s choice of penalty is extremely limited. <em>Stump v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>761 F.2d 680, 681 (Fed. Cir.1985). \u201c \u2018It is a well-established rule of civil service law that the penalty for employee misconduct is left to the sound discretion of the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lachance v. Devall, </em>178 F.3d 1246, 1251-52 (Fed.Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Miguel v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>727 F.2d 1081, 1083 (Fed.Cir.1984)). The agency is required to consider \u201call factors relevant to the case, such as the authorized range of penalties, the nature of the offense, its relation to the employee\u2019s duties, the effect of the offense on the agency\u2019s confidence in the employee, and possibly eight additional factors set forth in <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981).\u201d <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, 727 </em>F.2d 1535, 1540 (Fed.Cir.1984). While the agency must also balance the factors so that the penalty imposed is \u201creasonable in light of the sustained charges, our court has effectively defined reasonable in this context to mean merely that the agency\u2019s choice of penalty not be \u2018grossly disproportionate to the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Webster v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>911 F.2d 679, 686 (Fed.Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Miguel, 727 </em>F.2d at 1083). \u201cWhether this court would have chosen a different penalty is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hunt v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>758 F.2d 608, 611 (Fed.Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">On appeal, Peterson challenges the Board\u2019s decision on the grounds that it is unreasonable and, in the alternative, that it is not supported by substantial evidence. As part of rendering the Notice of Decision, Cpt. P\u00f3stera carefully documented his explicit consideration of each of the twelve <em>Douglas </em>factors, including the potential for Peterson\u2019s rehabilitation and the availability of alternative penalties, and concluded that removal was nevertheless appropriate. The Notice of Decision states that a firefighter\u2019s essential duties include rendering emergency medical assistance and fighting fires and that these duties require good judgment and a high level of public trust. Although harsh, the penalty of removal is not grossly dipropor-tionate to an offense of drug use by an emergency responder in the Naval Station\u2019s Department of Public Safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Board</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
