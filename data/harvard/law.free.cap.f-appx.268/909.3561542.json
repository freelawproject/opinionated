Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting that we review the BIA\u2019s decision; but \u201c[finsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>legal determinations of the BIA. <em>Id. </em>Factual determinations are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test; and we must \u201caffirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Therefore, a fact determination will be reversed only when the record compels, instead of merely supports, a reversal. <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">About asylum, Susilo argues that he established changed circumstances excusing his untimely application and otherwise posits that he demonstrated eligibility for asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government asserts that we do not have jurisdiction to review Susilo\u2019s asylum claims. We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). Here, we do not have jurisdiction to consider Susilo\u2019s asylum claims because the BIA concluded that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to demonstrate an exception to the filing deadline contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (we lack jurisdiction, under section 1158(a)(3), to review an IJ\u2019s timeliness ruling).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">We now address Susilo\u2019s withholding of removal claim. An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to his country because of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>membership in a particular social group. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). An alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. The alien may satisfy this burden by showing past persecution on account of a protected ground.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground. M; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Susilo asserted that he would be persecuted if he retened to Indonesia because he is a Christian and of Chinese descent. At his asylum hearing, he stated that he left Indonesia for the United States in 1998 after witnessing a riot in Jakarta. Though he personally never suffered harm when he lived in Indonesia, he feared returning there because of incidents that happened to his fam\u00fcy since the 2004 elections. About religion, Sus\u00fco testified that a Muslim neighborhood leader told his aunt and uncle to stop conducting a Christian worship service in their home. About ethnicity, Susilo testified that his sister, while disembarking public transportation, was told by the driver that she did not need to pay because \u201cin short time we will finish you off.\u201d Sus\u00fco also testified that Indonesia\u2019s new vice-president specifically directed threats of discrimination and persecution at Chinese-Indonesians and would \u201ctry to cleanse\u201d them from Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, explaining that Su-silo had provided insufficient evidence that he would be targeted for persecution on account of a protected ground. The BIA noted that the events Sus\u00fco recounted did not rise to the level of past persecution, he never physically was harmed in Indonesia, and his fam\u00fcy remained in Indonesia unharmed. On appeal, Susilo argues that he demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal based on country conditions in Indonesia, incidents that happened to his family, and his membership in two disfavored groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">After review, we conclude that the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Susilo was entitled to withholding of removal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sus\u00fco never personally suffered harm based on his race or religion when he lived in Indonesia. In his asylum application, he admitted that his family never had been harmed by anyone in Indonesia. And the two incidents that happened to his family since his departure did not involve physical harm and do not tend to indicate that Susilo is more likely than not to be persecuted or tortured upon return to Indonesia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, his fam\u00fcy remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>in Indonesia unharmed. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006) (an alien\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution was negated where the alien\u2019s family continued to live in Colombia without incident). Though the new vice president may have expressed anti-Chinese sentiments, other evidence submitted by Susilo indicates documented improvements in interreligious tolerance and progress by the Indonesian government in improving racial and ethnic tolerance. Accordingly, the record does not compel the conclusion that Susilo would more likely than not suffer persecution based on his race or religion if he returned to Indonesia.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-9\">. The decision also denied relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d) and voluntary departure. But, on appeal, Susilo does not make arguments on these claims; and thus, they are abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that a petitioner abandons an issue by failing to offer argument on that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-15\">. Susilo entered the United States in August 1998, and filed his asylum application in March 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b934-16\">. Susilo argues that the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he did not establish changed circumstances is a question of law over which we retain jurisdiction; but <em>Chacon-Botero </em>rejects this argument. <em>See id. </em>He also argues that the BIA decision raises a due process issue; but Susi-lo does not have a due process right to discretionary relief. <em>See Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1300 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b935-6\">. If the alien establishes past persecution in his country based on a protected ground, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country unless the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that, among other things, (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the alien\u2019s life or freedom no longer would be threatened; or (2) it would be reasonable for the alien to relocate to another part of the country. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b935-7\">. To the extent that Susilo argues that he is entitled to relief because he demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution, we note that the well-founded fear standard required for asylum is less stringent than the withholding of removal standard. <em>See Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 n. 1 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b935-13\"><em>. </em>We also note our agreement with the BIA\u2019s determination that these two incidents do not constitute past persecution. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that persecution is an \" \u2018extreme concept,' requiring \u2018more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation\u2019 \").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">. We reject Susilo's argument that he faces a future threat to his life based on his membership in two disfavored groups. Even if we adopted the theory that an alien may show a future threat to his life by proving he is a member of disfavored group, Susilo still has failed to prove that he likely is to be targeted as a member of that group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
