Petitioner challenges the adverse credibility finding on the basis of errors and omissions in the translation of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">There was no objection to the intermittent failure to translate, nor was the issue raised to the BIA. Petitioner therefore has waived the claim of denial of due process arising out of the translation. The procedural due process argument that the IJ was too domineering during the hearing and prevented the petitioner from favorably presenting his case, including interfering with adequate opportunity to present translations in the proceeding, was not raised before the BIA and was thus not exhausted. Our court thus lacks jurisdiction to consider that claim. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir. 2004) Moreover, it appears that the IJ made a conscientious effort to make sure nothing material was omitted from the record by reason of the lack of translation.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Paylyan also argues that the IJ failed to provide specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding, but the IJ cited inconsistencies between Paylyan\u2019s testimony and his asylum application as the reason for the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004). The adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Paylyan attempted to raise the translation problems and other issues before the BIA in a motion to reopen, claiming denial of effective assistance of counsel, but the reopening was not sought until two years after the BIA\u2019s decision. There was no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen. Although the ineffectiveness issue was raised in the original brief, the issue was not raised before the BIA and thus may not be decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
