Feb. 22, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 77 993 890 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 20, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). We will vacate and remand for new findings, however, if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>this Court concluded that the statutory scheme under \u00a7 601(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) \u201cunambiguously dictates that applicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d 494 F.3d at 308. Thus, as the Government correctly asserts, Lin was not entitled to asylum based solely on his girlfriend\u2019s forced abortion, regardless of their marital status. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">Moreover, the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Lin failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted under a coercive population control program. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Lin alleged only that family planning officials accused him of getting his girlfriend pregnant and threatened to sterilize him if they could not find her. The IJ properly found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the harm described by Lin did not amount to past persecution. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that to constitute persecution, the harm must rise above \u201cmere harassment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Furthermore, because Lin failed to challenge in his brief to this Court the IJ\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, we decline to review that issue. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (declining to address issues not sufficiently argued in the petitioner\u2019s brief). As such, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Because Lin was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim based on his own resistance to a coercive family planning policy, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). We therefore do not reach the IJ\u2019s alternative findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Last, because Lin has failed to challenge either the denial of his illegal departure claim or his application for relief under the CAT in his brief to this Court, we deem those claims waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-12\">.
