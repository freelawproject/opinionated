We rescind the grant of IFP status on appeal, and dismiss the appeal because Pennington is three-strikes barred and the record does not show that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time this appeal was filed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (in no event shall prisoner bring appeal if he has, on three or more prior occasions while imprisoned, brought action or appeal that was dismissed on grounds that it was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state claim, unless inmate is under imminent danger of serious physical injury); <em>Martin v. Shelton, </em>319 F.3d 1048, 1050 (8th Cir.2003) (requisite imminent danger must exist at time appeal is filed). We also deny all pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-16\">.
