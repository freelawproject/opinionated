Garcia contends that the district court\u2019s admission of tape recorded statements discussing his participation in the marijuana conspiracy violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. For the following reasons, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">1. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, Un<em>ited States v. Cheramie, </em>51 F.3d 538, 540 (5th Cir.1995), and alleged violations of the Confrontation Clause <em>de novo, United States v. Delgado, </em>401 F.3d 290, 299 (5th Cir. 2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">2. Oscar Palacios\u2019s statements were properly admitted to provide context for the statements of other co-conspirators, as opposed to for the truth of matter asserted in the statements. And \u201cbecause the Confrontation Clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d there was also no Sixth Amendment violation. <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>475 F.3d 677, 683 (5th Cir.2007). Furthermore, because Palacios was available to both parties to testify, there is not a Confrontation Clause problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
