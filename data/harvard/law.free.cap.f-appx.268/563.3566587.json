Neither woman was present at trial. One of the women had participated in a videotaped deposition that Williams did not attend, but that was played before the jury. The other woman had testified before a grand jury, and portions of that testimony were read at trial. Williams was convicted of all five charges, and this court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>116 Fed.Appx. 890 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">Williams then filed a Motion to Vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Williams contends that his conviction should be vacated on the grounds that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when: (1) his trial counsel failed to procure Williams\u2019s presence at the videotaped deposition of a material witness; and (2) his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>appellate counsel failed to contest on direct appeal the use of an unavailable witness\u2019s grand jury testimony. We reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019s Motion to Vacate. We remand, directing the district court to grant the motion and retry Williams on all counts. Although we find no error in the conduct of his trial counsel, Williams\u2019s attorney on direct appeal rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue that his client\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights were violated by the admission of an unavailable witness\u2019s grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that his attorney\u2019s representation was both deficient and prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A party \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate prejudice, a petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Under the Sixth Amendment, the prosecution may not admit the testimonial statements of an unavailable witness unless the accused has a meaningful opportunity to confront the witness. <em>United States v. Yida, </em>498 F.3d 945, 950 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements include \u201cprior testimony at a preliminary hearing, <em>before a grand jury, </em>or at a former trial....\u201d 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">On direct appeal, Williams\u2019s representation was deficient because his counsel failed to argue that the Confrontation Clause precluded the admission of an unavailable witness\u2019s grand jury statement. Under <em>Crawford, </em>the grand jury testimony used against Williams was clearly inadmissible. <em>See id.; see also Yida, </em>498 F.3d at 950. Williams\u2019s criminal trial concluded on June 20, 2003. The Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Crawford </em>on March 8, 2004. The direct appeal was submitted on September 14, 2004. Accordingly, appellate counsel had adequate time to take note of the <em>Crawford </em>decision and identify its significance in this case. Counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness because <em>Crawford </em>clearly established that the admission of the grand jury testimony violated the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Appellate counsel\u2019s error was prejudicial. In light of <em>Crawford, </em>Williams had a powerful argument that his conviction was obtained in part through a violation of his rights under the Confrontation Clause. The statements used from the grand jury proceedings tended to prove the elements of two of the crimes charged \u2014 transportation of a minor for prostitution and sex trafficking of children \u2014 but all of the charges brought against Williams were intertwined. The grand jury testimony also laid the foundation for use of an expert who testified at length about the behavior of prostitutes. Furthermore, both the expert and the grand jury testimony served to corroborate the other central piece of evidence in the case \u2014 the videotaped deposition of the adult prostitute. Without the expert or grand jury testimony, it would have been considerably more difficult for the government to sustain its burden of proof on all of the charges against Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Due to counsel\u2019s failure to argue this issue on direct appeal, this court then did not consider whether the admission of the grand jury testimony violated the Confron<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tation Clause. There is a reasonable probability that, if properly presented, this court would have found on direct appeal that the grand jury testimony was inadmissible after <em>Crawford. </em>In that case, Williams would have prevailed in his direct appeal. Accordingly, Williams was prejudiced by his appellate attorney\u2019s deficient performance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand, directing the district court to grant the Motion to Vacate so that Williams may face retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-15\">. We emphasize that Williams's trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance. The trial counsel acted reasonably in attempting to procure Williams\u2019s presence at the videotaped deposition. The error here lies with subsequent counsel who took on the direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
