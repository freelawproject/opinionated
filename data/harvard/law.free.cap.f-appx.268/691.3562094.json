MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">William Henry Sherratt, a Utah state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights suit. In a thorough order, the district court liberally construed Sherratt\u2019s vague complaint as mounting challenges to his state court prosecution and the resolution of his state court petition for post-conviction relief. The district court noted that the contents of Sherratt\u2019s civil rights complaint were nearly identical to a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition he had filed in federal district court shortly after the filing of the instant civil rights complaint. Given the timing and nearly identical content of the two suits, the district court concluded it was most likely the instant civil rights complaint was intended as a collateral attack on Sherratt\u2019s conviction. Because such relief was only available in a habeas petition, <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 480-82, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the district court determined Sher-ratt\u2019s complaint should be dismissed without prejudice. In the alternative, even assuming the complaint was intended solely to vindicate Sherratt\u2019s civil rights, the district court noted the resolution of the complaint in Sherratt\u2019s favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of Sherratt\u2019s conviction. Thus, <em>Heck </em>barred Sherratt\u2019s civil rights complaint absent a showing Sherratt\u2019s conviction had been overturned on direct appeal or in collateral proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 483-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Accordingly, the district court determined dismissal without prejudice of Sherratt\u2019s complaint was appropriate no matter how the complaint was construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-21\">This court has undertaken de novo review of the district court\u2019s resolution of Sherratt\u2019s position. <em>Perkins v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999) (reviewing de novo dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)). That review demonstrates the district court\u2019s resolution of Sherratt\u2019s civil rights complaint is clearly correct. Accordingly, we AFFIRM for substantially those reasons set out in the order of the district court dated July 11, 2007.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
