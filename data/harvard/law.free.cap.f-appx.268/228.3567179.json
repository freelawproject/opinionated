He was sentenced to 170 months on the \u00a7 841(a) conviction and a mandatory consecutive term of 60 months on the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Brown\u2019s sole argument on appeal, an objection he preserved below, is that the district court erred in failing to consider the disparate treatment of cocaine base and powder cocaine under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines in fashioning a sentence under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3558(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). On January 22, 2008, the parties filed in this court a \u201cJoint Motion For Remand to District Court for Re-Sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">After Brown\u2019s brief was filed, the Supreme Court decided in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>thus abrogated this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Euro, </em>440 F.3d 625, 634 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio cannot be the basis of a variance), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008). Because this case is before us on direct appeal, <em>Kimbrough </em>applies. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987) (\u201c[A] new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases ... pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">A sentence is reviewed for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This court has held that a sentence within a correctly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United </em>States,U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentence). However, in deciding not to depart or vary below the guideline range in this case, the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-22\">Accordingly, we vacate Brown\u2019s sentence and grant the joint motion to remand for resentencing to give the district court an opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-23\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
