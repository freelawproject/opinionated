Upon review of the administrative record, we also conclude that Continental\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">Elizabeth Rose previously worked as a psychotherapist and clinical social worker at the Medical Center Clinic, P.A., in Pensacola, Florida. In 1994, Rose began receiving long-term disability benefits due to the effects of chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic hepatitis C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rose\u2019s long-term disability policy (\u201cthe policy\u201d) was initially administered by Continental. Under the terms of the policy, which grants Continental discretionary authority to construe and interpret the policy, an employee is considered totally disabled and eligible for long-term disability benefits if, during an initial twenty-four month period, \u201cbecause of injury or sickness, he is continuously unable to perform the essential and/or majority of duties of his occupation.\u201d After the initial twenty-four month period, an employee is considered totally disabled if \u201cbecause of injury or sickness, he is continuously unable to perform the duties of any occupation for which he is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.\u201d Rose continued to receive long-term disability benefits after the initial twenty-four month period, and from time to time, Continental reviewed Rose\u2019s disability claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>When Continental reviewed Rose\u2019s claim in 2004 and 2005, it determined that Rose no longer satisfied the policy\u2019s definition of disability. Rose\u2019s long-term disability benefits were terminated on April 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">At the outset of Continental\u2019s evaluation of Rose\u2019s claim, the company requested that Rose complete a \u201cclaimant questionnaire.\u201d On the questionnaire, dated July 29, 2004, Rose noted that her current medical conditions included chronic hepatitis C, chronic fatigue syndrome,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> fibromyalgia,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> cognitive difficulties, and sleep problems. Rose explained that these conditions made it impossible for her to have a set schedule and that her friends and family helped her with shopping and home upkeep. She further noted that her condition had worsened in the past eighteen months: her fatigue had become more extreme, her fi-bromyalgia now affected her arms as well as her legs, her most recent liver biopsy showed an increase of fibrosis, and she was unable to stand for more than twenty to thirty minutes at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Continental also requested Rose\u2019s medical records from her physicians, Dr. Jeff Foxx, Dr. Mark Doughtery, and Dr. Martin Korkowsky. The records from Dr. Doughtery showed that Rose\u2019s last visit was on September 11, 2003, for a checkup regarding her hepatitis C. Dr. Doughtery diagnosed Rose with hepatitis C, fibro-myalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and depression. According to the records from Dr. Foxx, Rose\u2019s last visit occurred on January 13, 2004, for an examination regarding her fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. In the records, Dr. Foxx indicated that Rose had multiple sore fi-bromyalgia trigger points. Rose last visited Dr. Korkowsky on April 2, 2003, and the records from this visit noted diagnoses of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Additionally, Continental hired an investigative company to obtain surveillance footage of Rose in order to procure evidence of her level of functionality. An investigator videotaped Rose on Wednesday, August 4, 2004, and Thursday, August 5, 2004.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 4, Rose was observed walking around a convenience store, entering a veterinary clinic, and shopping at a grocery store. During the hour and a half Rose was away from her house, she repeatedly entered, exited, and operated her vehicle. At the grocery store, Rose pushed a shopping cart in a normal manner without any assistance. Rose repeatedly bent, turned, and reached, and she picked up a 37.5 pound bag of dog food and placed it in the lower part of her cart. After paying for her groceries, Rose pushed the \u201cvery full cart\u201d to her vehicle and unloaded it without assistance. On August 5, Rose was away from her house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>for approximately five hours, during which she visited a produce stand, two convenience stores, two retirement homes, and other businesses. The investigator observed Rose assisting an elderly woman enter and exit Rose\u2019s vehicle. At one point, Rose carried the elderly woman\u2019s walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">On January 6, 2005, a Continental investigator interviewed Rose at her home. During the interview, Rose walked and moved through her home without many noticeable limitations, although at times she limped slightly. While Rose did display pain indicators, such as wincing, moaning, flexing her ankles and legs, rubbing her elbow, and squirming while seated, the investigator noted that Rose had a good range of motion: she twisted in her seat, leaned, reached, swung one leg to push a dog, squatted to close a door, and wrestled with two of her dogs to pull them away from the door. The investigator did not observe any type of cognitive or concentration difficulties, except for Rose\u2019s reversal of a numerical pain scale. The investigator showed Rose the surveillance video, and Rose stated that the video represented her normal level of functionality on one of her best days.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">At the interview, the investigator took Rose\u2019s \u201ccontinuing disability statement.\u201d Rose explained that she cannot keep a schedule, that her cognitive issues are unacceptable for her profession, and that her nausea, fatigue, swollen leg muscles, and chronic pain prevent her from returning to work. Rose noted that she uses a cane 40% to 50% of the time and that she has used the cane more in the past six months. She described her maximum level of functionality on her best day: she can walk for a maximum time of 15 to 20 minutes; she has a slow and limping gait; she can shop for 30 minutes; she can stand for 10 minutes; she can lift and carry items that weigh a maximum of 3 to 4 pounds; she is able to sit for one hour; she can bend, twist, push, pull, and reach; she cannot squat; kneeling is painful; walking up stairs is difficult; she cannot concentrate; she has trouble sleeping; and she has difficulty getting in and out of her vehicle. She noted that she does not do two activities in the same day. However, she also explained that she tries to improve her condition by attempting to stay as physically active as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">When contacted by Continental, Rose\u2019s current treating physicians, Drs. Dought-ery and Foxx, did not wish to comment on her ability to work. Continental thus obtained an independent review of Rose\u2019s medical records from Dr. Harvey A. Popo-vich, a certified independent medical examiner, who concluded that Rose was capable of working full-time. In addition to reviewing Rose\u2019s records and the surveillance video, Dr. Popovich attempted to contact Drs. Doughtery and Foxx. Dr. Popovich was unable to speak with Dr. Doughtery, but he did converse with Dr. Foxx. Dr. Foxx apparently indicated that there was no great risk in Rose returning to work. However, after Dr. Popovich sent a letter to Dr. Foxx summarizing their conversation, Dr. Foxx responded in a letter that he was in disagreement with the summary and he was \u201cin no way at this point in time able to comment on [Rose\u2019s] disability\u201d or her ability to return to work. Dr. Popovich then informed Continental that Dr. Foxx\u2019s letter had no effect on his conclusion regarding Rose\u2019s ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Continental also conducted a vocational review to identify possible employment positions that Rose might obtain. The review identified several positions, including psychiatric social worker, substance abuse counselor, assistant manager of customer service, and customer service representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tive, that would be suitable for Rose\u2019s functional abilities and were available in Rose\u2019s geographic area.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">On the basis of its review of Rose\u2019s medical records, the surveillance footage, the interview, and the claimant questionnaire, Continental concluded that Rose no longer satisfied the definition of disability as stated in her policy and terminated Rose\u2019s long-term disability benefits on April 29, 2005. Continental notified Rose of its decision in a letter, which noted, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]he observations documented during surveillance efforts are disproportionate with the limitations you reported in the questionnaire that you completed and the representations made in your interview.\u201d The company also informed Rose that she could appeal the decision and submit additional information for Continental\u2019s consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Rose appealed Continental\u2019s decision. In a twenty-nine page letter dated September 80, 2005, Rose described her medical history and current level of functionality in detail. She explained that she has never been told to limit or restrict her activities by her doctors; rather, her doctors have encouraged her to exercise as much as possible. She asserted that her symptoms change from day to day, and, consequently, a videotape cannot adequately capture her health problems. Rose also submitted letters from her friends and neighbors detailing certain aspects of her disability. Additionally, Rose submitted a letter from her new treating physician, Dr. Joshua B. Huffman, who stated that Rose had a long history of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyal-gia, both of which are difficult to diagnose, understand, and treat. Dr. Huffman stated his examination of Rose revealed tender points consistent with fibromyalgia. Rose\u2019s appeal also contained her medical records from Dr. Huffman, which indicated that she had chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic hepatitis C, insomnia, and arrhythmia.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Upon Rose\u2019s appeal, Continental requested another medical review of Rose\u2019s records from a different physician, Dr. James Bress. Dr. Bress reviewed Rose\u2019s medical records and the surveillance video, and he contacted Dr. Huffman. In his discussion with Dr. Bress, Dr. Huffman opined that Rose\u2019s fatigue and pain, as reported by Rose, prevent her from functioning in any occupation. Dr. Huffman did, however, agree that all of Rose\u2019s symptoms are \u201csubjective with no objective findings.\u201d While Dr. Huffman acknowledged the activity on the surveillance video, .he also stated that it reflected one of Rose\u2019s best days. Dr. Huffman also noted that he tries to be a \u201cpatient advocate.\u201d On the basis of his review of Rose\u2019s file and his discussion with Dr. Huffman, Dr. Bress concluded that Rose is capable of full-time sedentary work, which consists of work that requires sitting six out of eight hours per workday, lifting no more than ten pounds occasionally, and frequently lifting small objects weighing less than ten pounds. On December 7, 2005, Continental informed Rose that it had reviewed her appeal and her benefits would not be reinstated, as the company had concluded that Rose could perform at least \u201csedentary work,\u201d as defined by the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">On April 20, 2006, Rose filed a complaint in Kentucky state court. Her case was removed to federal court on May 15, 2006. On March 8, 2007, the district court rendered a judgment on the administrative record. The district court determined that Continental\u2019s decision to terminate Rose\u2019s long-term disability benefits was not arbitrary and capricious. Rose filed this timely appeal on April 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In an ERISA benefits case, this court reviews the decision of the district court <em>de novo. Spangler v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc., </em>313 F.3d 356, 361 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing <em>Gatlin v. Nat\u2019l Healthcare Corp., </em>16 Fed.Appx. 283, 288 (6th Cir. 2001)). Where the benefit plan at issue gives the plan administrator the discretionary authority to construe and interpret the plan, as in the instant case, the plan administrator\u2019s decision is reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard. Id.; <em>Hunter v. Caliber Sys., Inc., </em>220 F.3d 702, 710 (6th Cir.2002). In the instant case, the parties do not dispute the applicability of the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201cThe arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action. When it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation, based on the evidence, for a particular outcome, that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Hunter, </em>220 F.3d at 710 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Under this deferential standard of review, an appellate court will uphold the plan administrator\u2019s decision if it is \u201crational in light of the plan\u2019s provisions.\u201d <em>Univ. Hosps. of Cleveland v. Emerson Elec. Co., </em>202 F.3d 839, 846 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Yeager v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>88 F.3d 376, 381 (6th Cir.1996)). Stated differently, if the decision \u201cis the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence,\u201d the decision will be upheld. <em>Elliott v. Metro. Life. Ins. Co., </em>473 F.3d 613, 617 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Glenn v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>461 F.3d 660, 666 (6th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">We are thus charged with determining whether Continental\u2019s decision that Rose is able to \u201cperform the duties of an[ ] occupation for which [s]he is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience\u201d was the result of a \u201cdeliberate, principled reasoning process\u201d and is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>Rose offers a number of arguments in support of her claim that Continental\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Rose correctly notes that a conflict of interest is present in this case: under Rose\u2019s policy, the insurer both decides whether the insured\u2019s claim is covered and pays the insured\u2019s benefits. Although the existence of a conflict of interest does not alter our standard of review, this court must take into consideration the conflict as a factor in determining whether Continental\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Calvert v. Firstar Fin., Inc., </em>409 F.3d 286, 292-93 (6th Cir.2005). Due to Continental\u2019s dual role in this situation, \u201cthe potential for self-interested decision-making is evident.\u201d <em>Evans v. UnumProvident Corp., </em>434 F.3d 866, 876 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Univ. Hosps. of Cleveland, </em>202 F.3d at 846 n. 4). However, in evaluating such a conflict of interest, the court must \u201clook to see if there is evidence that the conflict in any way influenced the plan administrator\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Carr v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>363 F.3d 604, 606 n. 2 (6th Cir.2004)). As Rose has provided no evidence that Continental\u2019s conflict of interest actually motivated its denial of benefits, the mere existence of this conflict does not render its decision arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Cooper v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>486 F.3d 157, 165 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Rose argues that Continental failed to give sufficient weight to the information</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>provided by her treating physicians. Indeed, Continental cannot \u201carbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant\u2019s reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician.\u201d <em>Smith v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>450 F.3d 253, 262 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003)). However, Continental noted in its letters to Rose that it had reviewed and taken into account the information proved by her treating physicians in considering her claim. As this court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">when a plan administrator chooses to rely upon the medical opinion of one doctor over that of another in determining whether a claimant is entitled to ERISA benefits, the plan administrator\u2019s decision cannot be said to have been arbitrary and capricious because it would be possible to offer a reasoned explanation, based upon the evidence, for the plan administrator\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afi-dedup-0\"><em>Evans, </em>434 F.3d at 877 (quoting <em>McDonald v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., </em>347 F.3d 161, 169 (6th Cir.2003)). In the instant case, neither Dr. Foxx nor Dr. Doughtery wished to comment on Rose\u2019s ability to work. Only Dr. Huffman, a physician Rose began to see after her benefits were terminated, opined on Rose\u2019s functional ability. In a letter to Continental, Dr. Huffman noted, \u201cMy limited experience with [Rose] tells me she is honest and her symptoms are real, her exam reveals tender points consistent with fibromyal-gia.\u201d Additionally, in a conversation with Dr. Bress, Dr. Huffman stated that, based on Rose\u2019s self-reported symptoms of fatigue and pain, she could not function in any occupation. Dr. Huffman also acknowledged that he tries to be a \u201cpatient advocate.\u201d Continental contends that Dr. Huffman\u2019s conclusory statement, which was based only on Rose\u2019s self-reported symptoms and was provided only after Rose was denied benefits, was simply unpersuasive, particularly in light of his self-described role as a \u201cpatient advocate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Continental appears to have provided a \u201creasoned explanation, based upon the evidence,\u201d for its decision to credit the opinions of the independent medical examiners over that of Dr. Huffman. <em>See id. </em>Two of Rose\u2019s doctors were unwilling to comment on her ability to work, and her third, most recently retained doctor offered only a conclusory statement that she could not work; in contrast, two independent medical examiners concluded that Rose was capable of performing sedentary work. Although Continental\u2019s decision to conduct file reviews of Rose\u2019s medical records\u2014 rather than a physical examination \u2014 is a factor that must be considered in determining whether Continental acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, there is \u201cnothing inherently objectionable about a file review by a qualified physician in the context of a benefits determination.\u201d <em>See Calvert, </em>409 F.3d at 296. In his file review, Dr. Popovich acknowledged Rose\u2019s fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and hepatitis C, but noted that Rose\u2019s medical records did not document any functional impairments with respect to Rose\u2019s upper extremities, lower extremities, or spine. Additionally, Dr. Popovich noted that Rose\u2019s medical conditions are well-controlled, as evidenced by the surveillance video demonstrating that Rose is capable of the activities of daily living, including traveling, walking, lifting, and carrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Without any knowledge of Dr. Popo-vich\u2019s assessment, Dr. Bress reviewed Rose\u2019s medical records, viewed the surveillance video, spoke with Dr. Huffman, and considered Rose\u2019s interview, her appeal letter, and the additional evidence submitted with her appeal. Dr. Bress noted that Rose was seated \u201creasonably comfortably\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>during her three-and-a-half-hour interview and observed the discrepancies between the surveillance video and Rose\u2019s reported level of functionality. Dr. Bress acknowledged that Dr. Huffman had opined that Rose could not work full-time, but noted that Dr. Huffman, in his own words, was a \u201cpatient advocate\u201d and was merely reflecting Rose\u2019s subjective complaints of fatigue and pain. Given that Dr. Huffman made only a conclusory statement as to Rose\u2019s ability to work, Dr. Bress\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201cno documented evidence that [Rose] cannot function at the sedentary level on a full-time basis\u201d was not unreasonable. <em>Cf. Jordan v. Northrop Grumman Corp. Welfare Benefit Plan, </em>370 F.3d 869, 878 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cWith a condition such as fibromyalgia, where the applicant\u2019s physicians depend entirely on the patient\u2019s pain reports for their diagnoses, their <em>ipse dixit </em>cannot be unchallengeable.... That the administrator ultimately rejects the applicant\u2019s physicians\u2019 views does not establish that it \u2018ignored\u2019 them.\u201d) Accordingly, Continental\u2019s reliance on the independent file reviews of Drs. Bress and Popovich was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Rose also claims that Continental did not give sufficient weight to the five letters submitted on her behalf by her friends and neighbors. In the letters, Rose\u2019s friends and neighbors explained that, due to Rose\u2019s medical condition, they helped her with yard work, home upkeep, and running errands. The letters noted Rose\u2019s honesty and opined that Rose was unable to work in any occupation. However, when Continental informed Rose of its decision to deny her claim on appeal, the company noted that it had considered her letter of appeal and the letters submitted on her behalf. Continental stated, \u201cYour friends and neighbors are not aware of your activity beyond your home and further are not clinicians that can provide documented medical data on physical/clinical examinations that would support your self-reported complaints and further that would support your inability to perform any work activity.\u201d Indeed, while it may be the case that Rose needs assistance with home maintenance and other tasks, as her neighbors attest, this does not prove that Rose is incapable of sedentary employment. As Continental notes, the individuals who wrote on behalf of Rose are not clinicians who have examined her functional capacity, and, consequently, Continental, quite logically, chose to credit the medical evaluations of Drs. Bress and Popovich rather than the comments of Rose\u2019s friends and neighbors. Continental did not \u201carbitrarily refuse to credit\u201d Rose\u2019s layperson evidence, <em>Smith, </em>450 F.3d at 262; rather, Continental considered the submitted letters and provided a reasoned explanation for its decision not to defer to this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Rose further contends that Continental placed too much emphasis on the surveillance video documenting her activities on August 4, 2004, and August 5, 2004. As the district court noted, however, Continental was not required to \u201cignore the inconsistencies between Rose\u2019s assessment of her level of activity and the videotape of her activities.\u201d In her January 2005 interview, Rose reported a level of functionality that was, to some degree, inconsistent with that shown in the surveillance video. For instance, in the interview Rose stated that she is unable to squat, but she was observed squatting in the grocery store on August 4 and, apparently, during the interview itself. Rose declared that she cannot lift more than three to four pounds; however, in the grocery store, she lifted a 37.5 pound bag of dog food, pushed a full shop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ping cart, and unloaded groceries into her vehicle. She stated that she has difficulty entering and exiting her vehicle but was observed doing so without apparent difficulty on the surveillance video. Although Rose claimed that she is unable to perform two activities on the same day, she was videotaped doing a number of activities, including grocery shopping and assisting an elderly woman with a walker, on two consecutive days.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Notwithstanding these discrepancies, Rose argues that the surveillance video fails to show the physical toll these two days of activity exacted upon her and, moreover, it does not demonstrate that she is capable of performing a full forty-hour workweek. Rose compares her situation to that of the plaintiff in <em>Carradine v. Barnhart, </em>a Seventh Circuit social security benefits case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">[Plaintiff] does not claim to be in wracking pain every minute of the day. When she feels better for a little while, she can drive, shop, do housework. It does not follow that she can maintain concentration and effort over the full course of the work week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">360 F.3d 751, 755-56 (7th Cir.2004). While Rose\u2019s point is well-taken, in Carradine\u2014 which is neither binding authority in this court nor an ERISA benefits case \u2014 the plaintiff did, in fact, present persuasive evidence of her disabling pain; for instance, the plaintiff underwent the surgical implantation of a catheter and spinal-cord simulator in order to ease her pain. <em>Id. </em>at 755. Here, Rose carries the burden of presenting evidence showing that she was disabled from performing any occupation for which she was reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience. <em>See Tracy v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Absence Payment Plan, </em>195 Fed.Appx. 511, 516 n. 4 (6th Cir.2006) (noting that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof in an ERISA benefits case). Rose produced very little such evidence; she offered merely the letters of her neighbors attesting to her need for assistance with home upkeep and other tasks, the conclusory statement of her newly retained doctor, and her own statement regarding her condition. While the surveillance video may not, by itself, prove that Rose is capable of working forty hours a week, Rose fails to appreciate that she bore the burden of producing evidence that she was disabled under the terms of the policy. Indeed, Rose\u2019s claim that Continental failed to consider her cognitive impairment suffers from a similar flaw: there is virtually no evidence in the administrative record regarding Rose\u2019s cognitive abilities. That Continental chose to disregard Rose\u2019s <em>ipse dixit </em>regarding her cognitive impairment cannot be deemed arbitrary and capricious.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Rose also contends that, while over-emphasizing the surveillance video, Continental ignored objective evidence of her disability documented by the investigator during her interview. The investigator noted that, during the interview, Rose displayed pain indicators, such as wincing, moaning, flexing her ankles and legs, rubbing her elbow, and squirming while seated. The investigator also stated that Rose had reversed the numerical pain scale in reporting her level of pain. To be sure, Continental did not acknowledge this evidence in the two letters in which it explained why the company was denying Rose\u2019s benefits. However, in his review of Rose\u2019s medical records, Dr. Bress did note Rose\u2019s display of pain during the interview but ultimately concluded that, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>her records as a whole, Rose could perform full-time sedentary work. Moreover, as Dr. Bress also noted, the investigator stated Rose had a good range of motion; during the interview, Rose twisted in her seat, leaned, reached, swung a leg to push a dog, and squatted to close a door. While it would have been desirable for Continental to explicitly acknowledge the pain Rose displayed during her interview, Continental\u2019s failure to do so does not render its decision arbitrary and capricious, particularly in light of Dr. Bress\u2019s consideration of Rose\u2019s pain in his review of her records.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Continental and Rose spar over the significance of the lack of objective evidence of Rose\u2019s disability in the administrative record. Continental does not dispute Rose\u2019s diagnoses of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and hepatitis C; however, the company asserts that Rose has failed to present objective evidence of any functional limitations resulting from these conditions. To this end, Continental argues for the adoption of the First Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Boardman v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, </em>337 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.2003). The <em>Boardman </em>court noted, \u201cWhile the diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves to objective clinical findings, the physical limitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses do lend themselves to objective analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17 n. 5. In <em>Boardman, </em>as in the instant case, the plaintiff claimed to suffer from, <em>inter alia, </em>fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. <em>Id. </em>at 13 n. 4. The <em>Boardman </em>court concluded that the insurer did not act arbitrarily in terminating the claimant\u2019s long-term disability benefits where the claimant\u2019s medical record did not indicate \u201cany limitations or restrictions, based on objective findings, that would preclude [the claimant] from performing any occupation for which she is suited,\u201d as required by the claimant\u2019s long-term disability policy. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Rose disagrees with Continental\u2019s assertion that she must present objective evidence of her level of functionality in order to qualify for long-term disability benefits under the policy. Citing <em>Torgeson v. Unum Life Insurance Co. of America, </em>466 F.Supp.2d 1096 (N.D.Iowa 2006), and <em>Pflu-ger v. U.S. Group Long-Term Disability Insurance Plan No. 505, </em>No. 03-C-0710, 2007 WL 130193 (E.D.Wis. Jan.16, 2007), Rose argues that objective evidence of functionality is not necessary because chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia are not capable of being objectively analyzed. Indeed, in both <em>Pfluger </em>and <em>Torge-son, </em>the district courts rejected the insurers\u2019 demands for objective evidence of functional limitations resulting from the claimants\u2019 conditions. <em>Torgeson, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 1131; <em>Pfluger, </em>2007 WL 130193, at *14.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">However, the case law of this court, to which this panel must adhere, suggests that it is entirely reasonable for an insurer to request objective evidence of a claimant\u2019s functional capacity. This court has held that \u201c[requiring a claimant to provide objective medical evidence of disability is not irrational or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>486 F.3d at 166 (citing <em>Spangler v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc., </em>313 F.3d 356, 361 (6th Cir.2002)). In <em>Cooper, </em>the court noted that objective medical evidence of the functional capacity of the claimant, who had a lower back injury, would have assisted the insurer in determining whether the claimant was capable of performing the duties of her occupation, as was required by her policy. <em>Id.; see also Oody v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. Pension Plan, </em>215 Fed.Appx. 447, 452 (6th Cir.2007) (holding that denial of disability benefits was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>arbitrary and capricious where claimant \u201cfailed to submit sufficient objective evidence to establish he was permanently and totally disabled, as defined by the Plan\u201d); <em>Nichols v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>192 Fed.Appx. 498, 504 (6th Cir.2006) (determining that insurer was not unreasonable in concluding that treating physician\u2019s assessment was \u201clargely based on her acceptance of [the claimant\u2019s] descriptions of her medical conditions, rather than based on an objective assessment of [the claimant\u2019s] medical history\u201d). While it would have been unreasonable for Continental to request objective evidence of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome \u2014 conditions that are diagnosed through an evaluation of an individual\u2019s subjective complaints of pain \u2014 Continental did not require such evidence. Rather, Continental based its decision on the lack of objective evidence of the effect Rose\u2019s conditions had on her functional capacity. <em>Cf. Boardman, </em>337 F.3d at 17 n. 5. Given this court\u2019s case law, as well as the persuasive reasoning of the First Circuit in <em>Boardman, </em>Continental did not act arbitrarily in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Rose briefly contends that Continental\u2019s decision to terminate her benefits was unreasonable given that she had been receiving benefits for eleven years and there was no evidence of a change in her condition that would have prompted a termination of benefits. As Continental notes, however, no right to receive long-term benefits indefinitely accrued to Rose upon Continental\u2019s initial determination that she was entitled to such benefits. <em>See Ellis v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 274 (5th Cir.2004). As the Fifth Circuit has noted, it would be illogical to prohibit an insurer from ever revisiting an insured\u2019s claim, particularly in light of newly discovered evidence calling into doubt an insured\u2019s disability. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, such a rule might discourage insurers from promptly granting benefits in the first place. <em>Id. </em>Thus, to the extent that Rose contends that Continental\u2019s termination of benefits eleven years after its initial grant of benefits renders its decision arbitrary and capricious, we find this argument to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-13\">. Rose was later diagnosed with fibromyalgia as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-14\">. Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., (\"Hartford\u201d) took over administration of Rose's policy prior to the termination of her benefits. Although Rose initially pursued her claim against both Hartford and Continental, on September 19, 2006, the parties entered into a stipulation voluntarily dismissing Hartford. The parties stipulated that Continental is the party responsible for paying disability benefits under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. Chronic fatigue syndrome is \"marked by incapacitating fatigue that rest does not relieve; it is frequently associated with decreased concentration, irritability, sleep disturbances, recurrent sore throats, low-grade temperatures, swollen glands, and bone or muscle aches.\u201d <em>Taber\u2019s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary </em>402 (19th ed.2001).
