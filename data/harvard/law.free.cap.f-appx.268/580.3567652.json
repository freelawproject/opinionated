Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history, we will not recount it here. We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">Where the BIA has adopted the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We review the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum or withholding of removal for substantial evidence. <em>See Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 884 (9th Cir.2004). Additionally, we review adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence and reverse \u201conly if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">None of the grounds upon which the IJ relied in making an adverse credibility finding as to Omondiagba\u2019s asylum claim can be sustained. The reasons given by the IJ involved speculation, minor inconsistencies that did not go to the heart of the asylum claim, or were not true inconsistencies at all. <em>Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">Omondiagba presented sufficient specific documentary evidence to establish past persecution independent of his testimony. <em>See Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1163 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that an asylum applicant \u201cmay establish facts that demonstrate ... his claim either \u2018through the production of specific documentary evidence <em>or </em>by credible and persuasive testimony\u201d\u2019). To establish an asylum claim, an applicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution either by proving past persecution, or \u201c \u2018good reason\u2019 to fear \u2018future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655-56 (9th Cir.2000). To demonstrate past persecution, \u201can applicant must show: (1) an incident, or incidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>that is \u2018on account of one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed by the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The Nigerian newspaper article Omondiagba provided demonstrated all three elements. It detailed the bombing of Omondiagba\u2019s house, which severely injured both of his parents, and it attributed the bombing to Nigerian government forces in retribution for Omondiagba\u2019s political activism. In short, Omondiagba established past persecution even without reference to his testimony. <em>Zahedi, </em>222 F.3d at 1166. Given that Omondiagba established past persecution, he is entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. The burden now shifts to the government to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that Omondiagba no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(1). We therefore remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">To be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that \u201c \u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 \u201d that he will be persecuted upon return. <em>See Zahedi, </em>222 F.3d at 1168. \u201cThis court has explained that a key factor in finding evidence sufficient for withholding of [removal] is whether harm or threats of harm were aimed against petitioner specifically.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the documentary evidence Omondiagba presented establishes that the Nigerian government \u201cwas actively pursuing him personally for his activities\u201d relating to the Ijaw Youth Movement. <em>Id. </em>We therefore remand for the grant of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Finally, because Omondiagba presented no evidence that he was tortured in Nigeria, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a) (defining \u201ctorture\u201d), the IJ reasonably concluded that Omondiagba had not demonstrated that he was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be subjected to torture if returned to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
