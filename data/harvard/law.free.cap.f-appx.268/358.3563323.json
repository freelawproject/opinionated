Parisie appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (CMS), PharmaCorr, L.L.C. (PharmaCorr), the dismissal of Dr. Juan Santos, and the dismissal of Parisie\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit. Parisie has also filed a motion to supplement his brief on appeal to add certain exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Parisie asserts that PharmaCorr was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by failing to timely refill his prescriptions and that CMS and its agent, Dr. Santos, also acted with deliberate indifference in failing to timely provide medical treatment. He asserts that he suffered substantial harm as a result of the defendants\u2019 acts of deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Our review of the record reveals no error in connection with the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of PharmaCorr and CMS. See <em>Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The record evidence does not show that PharmaCorr acted with deliberate indifference in failing to process Parisie\u2019s requests. Because Pari-sie does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that CMS cannot be vicariously liable for the actions of agents, he has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Further, the undisputed medical evidence does not demonstrate that Dr. Santos acted with deliberate indifference or that Parisie suffered any substantial harm as a result of the alleged delay in medical treatment. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993). The facts underlying Parisie\u2019s claim do not clearly evince the need for the medical care he claims Dr. Santos denied him. <em>See Johnson v. Treeu, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). Parisie has failed to show any error in connection with the district court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, that judgment is AFFIRMED. Parisie\u2019s motion to supplement his brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAjF\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
