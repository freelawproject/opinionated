Plaintiffs now appeal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-19\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the appellant and drawing all inferences in the appellant\u2019s favor. <em>See, e.g., Jeffreys v. City of New York, </em>426 F.3d 549, 553 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-20\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that he is \u201cdisabled\u201d under the meaning of the Act; that is, that he \u201c \u2018(i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of [his] major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (in) is regarded as having such an impairment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hosp., </em>32 F.3d 718, 722 (2d Cir.1994) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(8)(B)). \u201c[A] person is \u2018regarded as\u2019 disabled ... if a covered entity mistakenly believes that the person\u2019s actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d <em>Murphy v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 516, 521-22, 119 S.Ct. 2133, 144 L.Ed.2d 484 (1999). If the major life activity in question is working, a plaintiff must show that the covered entity regarded him as \u201cunable to perform a class of jobs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 119 S.Ct. 2133. Showing that the covered entity regarded a plaintiff as \u201cunable to perform only a particular job\u201d is insufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Plaintiffs have submitted evidence tending to establish that defendants regarded plaintiffs as unsuitable for the particular position of Court Security Officer. They have also submitted evidence tending to establish that the medical examiners who evaluated their physical condition regarded plaintiffs as unsuitable for positions in the area of law enforcement. Plaintiffs have not, however, submitted any evidence tending to establish that <em>defendants </em>regarded them as unsuitable for positions in the area of law enforcement. <em>Cf. Capo-bianco v. City of New York, </em>422 F.3d 47, 57 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that \u201c[a] \u2018regarded as\u2019 claim turns on the employer\u2019s perception of the employee\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, for substantially the same reasons articulated by the District Court, we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We therefore AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s orders of December 12, 2005 and February 7, 2006, granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
