Nicholson, </em>No. 04-2215. Eulogia S. Ligan responds.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Ligan appealed, through counsel, to the CAVC from a September 20, 2004 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that denied her claim for Department of Veterans Affairs dependency and indemnity compensation, accrued benefits, and death pension benefits. On appeal, Ligan argued only that the Board failed to ensure that the Secretary had complied with his notification requirements pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In its November 9, 2006 affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision, the CAVC reviewed the Board\u2019s determination regarding the adequacy of section 5103(a) notice under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. The CAVC determined that there was a plausible basis in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that a February 2002 letter informed Ligan what information and evidence was necessary to substantiate her claims. Ligan appealed, seeking review, inter alia, of whether the CAVC applied the appropriate standard of review to the Board\u2019s section 5103(a) determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The Secretary moves to summarily affirm the CAVC\u2019s decision on the ground that <em>Garrison v. Nicholson, </em>494 F.3d 1366 (Fed.Cir.2007) is controlling. Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">In <em>Garrison, </em>the court affirmed the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review when reviewing the Board\u2019s finding that the Secretary had complied with his section 5103(a) notification requirements. <em>Garrison, </em>494 F.3d at 1370. In light of <em>Garrison, </em>it is clear that the CAVC\u2019s decision was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to summarily affirm is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
