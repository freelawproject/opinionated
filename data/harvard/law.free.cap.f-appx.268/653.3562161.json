Ford, Jr. (\u201cFord\u201d) appeals his 12-count conviction related to two incidents in which he was apprehended bringing undocumented persons from Mexico into the United States. Counts 1-4 charged Ford with bringing illegal aliens into the country without presentation, and with aiding and abetting, in violation of Title 8, United States Code, section 1324(a)(2)(B)(iii) (\u201csection 1324(a)(2)(B)(iii)\u201d) and Title 18, United States Code, section 2 (\u201csection 2\u201d), in connection with his apprehension on January 11, 2006. Counts 5-12 related to Ford\u2019s January 14, 2006 arrest, and charged Ford with bringing in illegal aliens for financial gain, and aiding and abetting, in violation of Title 8, United States Code, Section 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) (\u201csection 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u201d) and section 2 (Counts 5, 7, 9, and 11), and bringing in illegal aliens without presentation and aiding and abetting in violation of section 1324(a)(2)(B)(iii) and section 2 (Counts 6, 8, 10, and 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history we do not include them here, except as necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\n<em>I. Ford\u2019s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on Counts 1-1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Ford argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on Counts 1-4, because, he argues, there was \u201cinsufficient evidence the persons brought into the United States were aliens or were the persons named in the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Because Ford failed to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence we review \u201conly to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice, or for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez-Valenzuela, </em>231 F.3d 1198, 1201 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cIf any rational trier of fact could have found the evidence sufficient, we must affirm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">To establish a violation of section 1324(a)(2)(B)(iii), the government was required to show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the four people found in Ford\u2019s vehicle were aliens who did not have prior authorization to enter or reside in the United States. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2). The government proved this through circumstantial evidence. <em>See United States v. Yoshida, </em>303 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir.2002) (finding evidence sufficient for a jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) because, \u201c[although the government\u2019s case consisted of largely circumstantial evidence and required the jury to make reasonable inferences, circumstantial evidence can form a sufficient basis for conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">We have reviewed the circumstantial evidence presented by the government and, drawing \u201call reasonable inferences ... in [its] favor\u201d we conclude that a \u201crational trier of fact could have found the evidence sufficient\u201d to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the four individuals found in the back of Ford\u2019s car on January 11, 2006, were aliens without permission to enter the United States. <em>See Alvarez-Valenzuela, </em>231 F.3d at 1201-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">Ford also argues that there was insufficient evidence that the persons brought into the United States were the persons named in Counts 1-4. We disagree. The government was not required to prove the actual names of the smuggled aliens, only that the individuals were aliens without permission to enter the United States. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2). The district court received Ford\u2019s attorney\u2019s specific approval prior to the addition of the names on each count of the jury form. The addition of the individual names to the jury form was not such an \u201cexceptional situation\u201d that reversal is necessary in order to \u201cpreserve the integrity of the judicial process or prevent a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Ahmad, </em>974 F.2d 1163, 1165 (9th Cir.1992) (reviewing alleged error of district court under doctrine of invited error when defense counsel specifically approved course of action taken by court).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Ford\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on Counts 1-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">\n<em>II. Duress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">Ford argues the district court erred in declining to instruct the jury on the defense of duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">\u201cWhere the parties dispute whether the evidence supports a proposed instruction, we review a district court\u2019s rejection of the instruction for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>United States v. Bello-Bahena, </em>411 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\u201cA defendant is not entitled to a duress instruction unless he establishes a prima facie case of three elements: (1) an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) a well-grounded fear that the threat will be carried out; and (3) lack of a reasonable opportunity to escape the threatened harm.\u201d <em>United States v. Becerra, </em>992 F.2d 960, 964 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Jennell, </em>749 F.2d 1302, 1305 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The district court properly found that Ford did not meet the element of immediacy because there was no evidence that the alleged \u201cthreat of injury was present, immediate, or impending. [A] veiled threat of future unspecified harm will not satisfy this requirement.\u201d <em>United States v. Con-tento-Pachon, </em>723 F.2d 691, 694 (9th Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court also properly found that Ford\u2019s alleged fear was not well-grounded, explaining that \u201cthere is no evidence to indicate that there was any ability to immediately carry out a threat.\u201d Finally, the district court properly found that Ford did not show he had no reasonable opportunity to escape. <em>See Jennell, </em>749 F.2d at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Ford did not establish a prima facie case of duress. Accordingly, he was not entitled to a jury instruction on that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\"><em>III. </em>Answer\u2022 <em>to Jury Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Ford argues the district court erred when, in response to a jury question about the relevance of Ford\u2019s mental condition, the court explained that \u201c[i]f the jury concludes the government has proven each element of a count and finds Mr. Ford guilty of one or more offenses, then the Court may consider mental health and other related matters at the time of sentencing.\u201d Ford contends that this statement was inaccurate and misleading because \u201c[t]he jury was left with the impression that any sentence Mr. Ford might receive would be reduced because of his mental health,\u201d and the jury was not aware that Ford would be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence if convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">Because Ford did not object to, but rather explicitly approved, the district court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Fagan, </em>996 F.2d 1009, 1016 (9th Cir. 1993). \u201cAn error is [among other considerations] plain if it is contrary to the law at the time of appeal.... \u201d <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">Notwithstanding the applicability of the mandatory minimum sentence, the district court could consider Ford\u2019s mental condition at the time of sentencing. The court lacked discretion to depart below the statutory mandatory minimum, but had discretion to impose a sentence <em>higher </em>than the mandatory minimum, so long as it did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1. In determining whether or not to impose a sentence higher than the mandatory minimum, the district court was free to consider, and in fact did consider, the defendant\u2019s mental condition. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5k2.13; <em>Ameline, </em>409 F.3d at 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Because the district court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question was not \u201ccontrary to the law,\u201d there was no error. <em>Ameline, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>409 F.3d at 1078; <em>see also Fagan, </em>996 F.2d at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b681-6\">WARDLAW, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AXM4\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">I concur in the disposition. I write separately to note that although the only defense pursued by trial counsel was that of duress, given Ford\u2019s history of brain injury and psychological issues, counsel\u2019s failure to argue other available defenses is troubling.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
