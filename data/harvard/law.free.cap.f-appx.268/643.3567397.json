We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The district court properly rejected the Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to assert the medical necessity defense. <em>See Raich v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 850, 861 (9th Cir.2007) (stating that the defense may be considered only when the medical marijuana user has been charged and faces criminal prosecution). The Fair Housing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and Rehabilitation Act all expressly exclude illegal drug use, and AHA did not have a duty to reasonably accommodate Assenberg\u2019s medical marijuana use. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3602(h), 12210(a); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">AHA did not violate the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (\u201cHUD\u201d) policy by automatically terminating the Plaintiffs\u2019 lease based on Assenberg\u2019s drug use without considering factors HUD listed in its September 24, 1999 memo. HUD does not mandate that public housing authorities consider the factors elucidated in its memo prior to terminating a lease based on illegal drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">Because the Plaintiffs\u2019 eviction is substantiated by Assenberg\u2019s illegal drug use, we need not address his claim that his snakes qualify as \u201cservice animals\u201d or whether AHA offered a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">The district court properly dismissed Assenberg\u2019s state law claims. Washington law requires only \u201creasonable\u201d accommodation. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 49.60.222(2)(b). Requiring public housing authorities to violate federal law would not be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
