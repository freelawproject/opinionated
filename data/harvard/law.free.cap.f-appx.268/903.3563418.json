The decision denied asylum and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). Qiu, who claims that he practices Falun Gong, challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-18\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the opinion of the IJ. <em>See Al Naj-jar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee\u201d: a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including membership in a particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder this highly deferential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Because credibility findings are factual determinations, we review them under the substantial evidence test; and we \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the [IJ].... \u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). We have discussed the review of credibility determinations made by an IJ in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al5i\">[T]he IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ame\"><em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (internal citations and quotations omitted). An alien\u2019s testimony \u2014 if credible \u2014 may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for asylum. <em>Id. </em>\u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Here, the IJ made an explicit adverse credibility finding about Qiu. The IJ gave specific, cogent reasons for his credibility determination, which is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of the many implausibilities and inconsistencies cited by the IJ, Qiu only discusses these determinations: (1) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility inference drawn from Qiu\u2019s testimony that he practiced Falun Gong in secret even before the Chinese government began its crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners in July 1999; (2) the IJ\u2019s finding that Qiu\u2019s explanations \u2014 that he practiced Falun Gong with schoolmates, that he practiced secretly, and that no one practiced Falun Gong in groups in his town\u2014 were inconsistent; and (3) Qiu\u2019s insufficient explanation about how his poor health led to his practice of Falun Gong, when the only health problem that Qiu described was past headaches. On the last reason, the IJ determined that Qiu\u2019s description of his headaches was vague and that Qiu otherwise failed to offer corroborating evidence that established past health problems.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>On appeal, Qiu argues that the IJ improperly speculated that people in China could openly practice Falun Gong before the government\u2019s crackdown. He also asserts that his testimony about practicing at home with classmates was entirely consistent with his explanation that his town lacked a group Falun Gong practice. In addition, Qiu contends that his testimony about his childhood headaches was specific and detailed and can be sufficient to support his claim for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Although Qiu\u2019s explanations might be plausible, we cannot say that the record in this case <em>compels </em>a conclusion different than the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary----\u201d); <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that \u201cfindings of fact made by administrative agencies ... may be reversed ... only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings\u201d). Therefore, we do not reverse the decision of the BIA in this case. <em>See Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1029 (\u201c[Ejven if the evidence could support multiple conclusions, we must affirm the agency\u2019s decision unless there is no reasonable basis for that decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">And even if we were to determine that the reasons raised by Qiu were unsupported by substantial evidence, the record does not compel reversal because many of the IJ\u2019s other enumerated reasons \u2014 which Qiu does not challenge on appeal \u2014 are specific, cogent, and supported by substantial evidence. In addition to the grounds already discussed, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on these reasons: (1) Qiu provided inconsistent information about when he completed school; (2) Qiu indicated on his asylum application that he had no siblings but testified that he had a brother who entered the United States illegally; (3) Qiu provided no plausible explanation for how his parents borrowed approximately $45,000 to pay a smuggler to take Qiu to the United States; (4) Qiu gave inconsistent testimony about whether he knew which countries he traveled through after he left China; and (5) Qiu\u2019s reason for staying in Argentina \u2014 where he lived for two years after leaving China so that he could learn Spanish as directed by his smuggler \u2014 was implausible. Even assuming that Qiu raised these claims before the BIA, he has abandoned them on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2 (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Qiu\u2019s testimony was not credible is supported by substantial evidence; and nothing in the record, including the evidence Qiu submitted in support of his asylum application, compels us to reverse the IJ\u2019s decision as affirmed by the BIA. Because we conclude Qiu did not meet his burden of establishing his eligibility for asylum, he also has failed to meet the more difficult standards for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. We deny Qiu\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-6\">. We note that the BIA rejected the IJ\u2019s discussion that Qiu was not credible because Qiu testified that he practiced Falun Gong with schoolmates during a period when Qiu no longer attended school. Although the BIA noted Qiu\u2019s later explanation that he practiced Falun Gong with <em>former </em>schoolmates, the BIA ultimately decided that the IJ's overall adverse credibility determination was not erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\">. In explaining her reasons for the adverse credibility finding on Qiu, the IJ also discussed that, when Qiu was asked during his credible fear interview about his current health status, Qiu failed to mention past chronic illnesses and instead reported good health. As Qiu argues, he was asked about his current health condition and not his past health. But even assuming that this particular reason offered by the IJ is not supported by substantial evidence, we will still consider \u2014 in the light of the many other reasons provided by the IJ \u2014 whether the record compels reversing the IJ's adverse credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
