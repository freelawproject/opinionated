The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on April 19, 2007. McPherson filed his notice of appeal, which was dated September 10, on September 17. In his notice of appeal, McPherson stated that he did not receive notice of the district court\u2019s judgment until September 10. Even giving McPherson the benefit of <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), his notice was untimely filed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">Under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(6), the district court may reopen the time to file an appeal if (1) the moving party did not receive notice of entry of judgment within twenty-one days after entry, (2) the motion is filed within 180 days of entry of judgment or within seven days of receiving notice from the court, whichever is earlier, and (3) no party would be prejudiced. We remand to the district court to determine whether McPherson is entitled to the benefit of Rule 4(a)(6) to reopen the time to file an appeal. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-21\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
