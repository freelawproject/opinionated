The plan administrator, on behalf of defendant-appellant The Limited Long-Term Disability Program (\u201cLLDP\u201d), denied her claim. The District Court reversed that decision and awarded benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">Addis began working as a manager for Victoria\u2019s Secret Stores, owned by The Limited, Inc., in 1997. Her duties included serving customers, managing payroll, monitoring inventory, and performing certain physical tasks, such as moving floor fixtures. After experiencing various symptoms, she began undergoing testing for multiple sclerosis in 1998 and received a diagnosis of MS by November 2000. According to Dr. Gabriel Tatarian, her treating neurologist, Addis\u2019s persistent symptoms included \u201cdifficulty walking, fatigure, poor concentration, difficulty with memory, bowel and bladder incontinence, visual symptoms including [sensitivity to] bright lights[,] and poor facial perception.\u201d Her more occasional symptoms include confusion, muscle spasms, tingling sensations in her limbs, headaches, rashes, and losses of balance resulting in falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">Addis stopped coming to work and applied for benefits on January 5, 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>MetLife, the claims administrator for LLDP (an ERISA plan funded by The Limited), approved her claim for a provisional two-month period until March 6, 2003. On March 11, 2003 (five days after the provisional deadline), Addis submitted documentation to support her continued inability to work, including notes from Dr. Tatarian and MRI results prepared by Dr. Norbertina Banson. After review by an \u201cindependent physician consultant,\u201d Met-Life rejected Addis\u2019s claim and terminated her benefits. MetLife found that her condition was not worsening and relied on Dr. Tatarian\u2019s statement that she could return to work once she determined herself to be medically fit. In mid-April 2003, Addis returned to work on a limited basis of twenty hours a week for \u201clight duty,\u201d but she stopped again after less than two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Meanwhile, Addis appealed MetLife\u2019s denial of benefits, submitting documentation of her continuing regular exams with Dr. Tatarian. A nurse consultant for Met-Life performed a second review of her case, after which MetLife denied the appeal. It argued that Addis\u2019s condition had not increased in severity since her initial claim and that she had submitted no additional clinical information. The information Addis submitted previously led to a denial of benefits. Therefore, MetLife concluded, without more clinical information it was compelled to deny her appeal as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Addis requested reconsideration. More medical documentation accompanied her request, including: (1) a longer history of her quarterly visits to Dr. Tatarian; (2) a summary letter from Dr. Tatarian referring to \u201ctimes of progressive symptoms\u201d and \u201cvarious exacerbations\u201d and recommending that she cease working; (3) past MRI results; (4) notes from her chiropractor, Dr. Ana Lavdas, reporting various symptoms over the course of two years; (5) her chemical and drug treatment records; and (6) notes from Dr. Nancy McCarel, a psychologist Addis consulted for a three-month period. Eventually, after she retained new counsel, MetLife agreed to reconsider her appeal. Addis then added three more pieces of evidence: (7) a new exam report from Dr. Tatarian, indicating \u201cno neurologic' problems\u201d but also noting tremors and fatigue; (8) part of her successful application for Social Security disability benefits, which were dated back to January 2003; and (9) a more recent MRI from December 2003, showing three or four brain lesions.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Despite these nine additional categories of documents, MetLife again denied benefits. A nurse consultant as well as an independent physician consultant, Dr. Gary Greenhood, reviewed the new body of evidence, but they did not examine Addis. Dr. Greenhood concluded that he was \u201cunable to confirm that there was an exacerbation of multiple sclerosis during the interval in question\u201d and found that Addis could work with some restrictions. Met-Life\u2019s case manager, Tammi Phillips, acknowledged Addis\u2019s diagnosis of MS but stated that \u201cthe MRI of your cervical spine dated January 4, 2003 showed no evidence of multiple sclerosis.\u201d Phillips mischarac-terized a finding of \u201cincreased tone\u201d in Addis\u2019s legs as a positive development.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>She listed every \u201cnormal\u201d finding in the record, such as evaluations of Addis\u2019s mental-health status. But Phillips did not explain why these non-findings outweighed the abnormal findings or the ailments Ad-dis consistently reported to multiple doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Addis next sued MetLife in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to recover benefits under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). As Met-Life only administers the Plan, LLDP, as the insurer, is the proper defendant. In June 2005 Addis amended her complaint to substitute LLDP as the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The District Court reversed the denial of benefits, granting Addis\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Finding procedural irregularities in MetLife\u2019s handling of Ad-dis\u2019s claim, the District Court applied a moderately heightened standard of review. The District Court found MetLife\u2019s assessment of the evidence to be selective and its denial of Addis\u2019s benefits to be improper. In light of these procedural irregularities and the evidence regarding Addis\u2019s condition, the District Court awarded long-term benefits to Addis directly, <em>ie. </em>without remand to the claims administrator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> LLDP appeals to our Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In ERISA cases brought under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the standard of review depends on the level of discretion given to the claims administrator. Here, the plan states that \u201c[t]he Claims Administrator shall have discretionary authority.\u201d Absent any question of a conflict of interest for the administrator, we would review for abuse of discretion. But, in the presence of an alleged conflict and alleged procedural irregularities, we must assess where on a sliding scale our standard of review should lie, \u201cgrant[ing] the administrator deference in accordance with the level of conflict.\u201d <em>Post v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>501 F.3d 154, 161 (3d Cir.2007). We explained the sliding-scale analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">To apply the approach, courts first consider the evidence that the administrator acted from an improper motive and heighten their level of scrutiny appropriately. Second, they review the merits of the decision and the evidence of impropriety together to determine whether the administrator properly exercised the discretion accorded it. If so, its decision stands; if not, the court steps into the shoes of the administrator and rules on the merits itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">At its best, the sliding scale reduces to making a common-sense decision based on the evidence whether the administrator appropriately exercised its discretion. This theme, rather than getting bogged down in trying to find the perfect point on the sliding scale, should be district courts\u2019 touchstone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 161-62 (citations omitted). We further explained that structural <em>factors </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the administrator has \u201cfinancial incentives to act against the participants\u2019 interest\u201d \u2014 and procedural <em>factors </em>\u2014 e.g., selectivity in reviewing the evidence \u2014 both can come into play. <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>In our case, Addis alleges that MetLife (mistakenly) thought that it funded the plan, rather than the Limited. \u201cAlthough MetLife did not, in fact, have a conflict of interest at the time it rendered its decision, it <em>believed </em>that it did.\u201d Addis\u2019s Opening Br. 16 (emphasis added). But one must engage in behavioral-economic speculation to argue that perceived rather than actual incentives determine claims administrators\u2019 behavior. Our Court has only recognized conflicts of interest \u201cwhen the administrator <em>has </em>a non-trivial financial incentive to act against the interests of the beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162 (emphasis added). Thus, in this case we decline to treat a perceived financial conflict like an actual one. That issue is reserved for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The kind of procedural irregularities that have led our Court to apply a heightened standard of review include, but are not limited to: \u201c(1) reversal of position without additional medical evidence; (2) self-serving selectivity in the use and interpretation of physicians\u2019 reports; (3) disregarding staff recommendations that benefits be awarded; and (4) requesting a medical examination when all of the evidence indicates disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-65 (citations omitted). The degree to which we raise the standard of review depends on our level of doubt regarding the claims administrator\u2019s neutrality that the irregularities create. For example, where we have seen \u201cnon-trivial evidence of procedural bias\u201d that was \u201cneither egregious nor coupled with evidence of structural bias, we heightened our scrutiny only a moderate amount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165 (citing <em>Ko-siba v. Merck &amp; Co., </em>384 F.3d 58, 68 (3d Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The District Court found in this case that no one familiar with MS reviewed Addis\u2019s case. MetLife\u2019s case managers are not physicians. MetLife\u2019s independent physician consultant, Dr. Greenhood, is an expert in infectious diseases. Typically, experts in neurology treat MS patients, since the disease attacks the central nervous system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court faulted Dr. Greenhood\u2019s writing style as willfully vague and cited phrases in his report that cast unwarranted aspersions on Addis\u2019s MS diagnosis. The Court found MetLife\u2019s reading of the evidence to be selective, taking positive comments out of context and ignoring \u2014 or even misunderstanding\u2014 negative diagnoses. It is true MetLife had no duty to defer to Addis\u2019s treating physicians in the context of ERISA (as opposed to Social Security). <em>See Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 829-30, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003). But, as the District Court found, MetLife provided no justification for failing to mention the opinion of Dr. Lavdas (Addis\u2019s treating chiropractor) or for giving more weight to the views of its own consultant than to Dr. Tatarian (Addis\u2019s treating physician). Finally, the District Court was right to criticize MetLife for failing to consider more than a six-month window of evidence (starting from the time Addis stopped working). There is no reason and no language in the plan that required or authorized MetLife to limit the scope of its inquiry in that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">In light of these procedural flaws, the District Court chose to apply the moderately heightened standard of review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>We agree that MetLife\u2019s decision involved a procedural irregularity, specifically a \u201cself-serving selectivity in the use and interpretation of physicians\u2019 reports.\u201d <em>Post, </em>501 F.3d at 165.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The MetLife\u2019s case managers\u2019 letters, along with Dr. Greenhood\u2019s report, support the District Court\u2019s criticisms along the lines of selectivity and questionable interpretation. Moreover, the flaws that the District Court identified qualify as \u201cserious, numerous, or regular,\u201d given the length of the list of problems. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the District Court was correct to apply the moderately heightened standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">III. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In this context, we affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that MetLife abused its discretion by denying Addis\u2019s benefits. LLDP argues that many pieces of evidence suggest that Addis\u2019s condition was not getting worse. But, as the District Court pointed out, those pieces of evidence required a selective reading, and occasional 180-degree misreading, of the medical record. Instead, everything in the medical record suggests that Addis suffered from various symptoms of MS, and that some of her symptoms had worsened. Moreover, the evidence that Addis returned to work for less than two months \u2014 after MetLife denied her benefits \u2014 is not enough to undercut her claims of disability. The denial of benefits itself spurred her to work. And it seems convincing that she could not continue working after a few weeks of trying, because her decision not to work caused her financial harm and uncertainty. She was not receiving benefits of any kind at that time; it would be another year until she was awarded Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Finally, LLDP\u2019s argument that the nurse consultant\u2019s and independent physician consultant\u2019s reports provide substantial evidence for MetLife\u2019s decision is unconvincing. For example, the nurse consultant\u2019s report, after noting the bulging disc in Addis\u2019s spine, immediately concludes: \u201cTherefore medical provided does not support a limit of function from the time period of 1/5/03 to 7/5/03.\u201d The nurse consultant failed to address why the bulging disc was or was not a problem, or why it was outweighed by other evidence. The independent physician consultant used dodgy <em>language </em>\u2014 e.g., \u201cunable to confirm,\u201d \u201cunable to substantiate\u201d \u2014 in the face of an administrative record that had grown quite large by the end of MetLife\u2019s second review on appeal. LLDP points out that MetLife was under no affirmative duty to pursue an independent medical opinion. <em>See Pinto v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>214 F.3d 377, 394 (3d Cir.2000). But that does not imply that Dr. Greenhood\u2019s review of evidence was sufficient to deny Addis\u2019s claim, or that other evidence existed to support such a decision. The bottom line is that we see no reason to disturb the District Court\u2019s well-reasoned conclusion that MetLife improperly used its discretion by denying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">IV. Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">LLDP argues that it would be unprecedented for the District Court to rule on Addis\u2019s \u201cany occupation\u201d benefits, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the claims administrator did not have a chance to rule on those benefits first. But the District Court pointed out that the six-month period that MetLife chose to review was arbitrary. In light of the procedural irregularities discussed above, it was legitimate for the District Court to \u201cstep[ ] into the shoes of the administrator and rule[ ] on the merits itself.\u201d <em>Post, </em>501 F.3d at 162.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">. To qualify for long-term benefits, a participant must demonstrate a \"Total Disability\u201d as defined under the plan. For the first twelve months of illness or injury, the participant must demonstrate that she can no longer perform her \"regular occupation\u201d; thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the participant must show that she \"cannot work at any gainful occupation\" for which she is \"reasonably qualified, or could become qualified, by education, experience or training.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-10\">. In this context, increased muscle tone refers to a symptom of MS. <em>See, e.g., </em>Jane Johnson &amp; Bernadette Porter, <em>Strategies and Challenges in Managing Spasticity, in </em>Advanced Concepts in Multiple Sclerosis Nursing Care 117, 118-19 (June Halper ed., 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">. Addis alleges that MetLife was unaware that it did not fund the plan, since it engaged in litigation for five months before pointing out that it was not the proper defendant. But LLDP argues that the plan documents made the Plan\u2019s funding source clear. See <em>infra </em>Part II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-15\">. The District Court awarded benefits under both the \"regular occupation\u201d and \"any gainful occupation\u201d standards. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b184-16\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1). We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>. </em>Many scientists do suspect that viruses play a role in the onset of MS. But the discovery of a specific viral cause or the precise relationship between viruses and the development of the disease remains at the research frontier. <em>See, e.g., </em>\"Research Reports on Multiple Sclerosis from B. Serafim and Colleagues Provide New Insights,\u201d Biotech L. Wkly., Mar. 7, 2008, at 3545.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b185-14\">. The District Court noted, however, that either a moderately heightened standard of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>view or a normal abuse-of-discretion standard would yield the same result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">. Another indicator of procedural irregularity mentioned in <em>Post </em>\u2014 \"reversal of position without additional medical evidence\u201d \u2014 does not appear to apply here. 501 F.3d at 164-65. MetLife's initial two-month award of disability benefits to Addis was provisional and not based on a review of the evidence. Thus, MetLife did not change its position on the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
