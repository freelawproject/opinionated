We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-20\">An asylum applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that he is a refugee, in that he is unable or unwilling to return to his country because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution <em>on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added) (defining the term \u201crefugee\u201d); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i) (placing the burden of proof on the asylum applicant to establish \u201crefugee\u201d status); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (same); <em>Deloso v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 858, 863 (9th Cir.2005). Mendoza-Matias has failed to establish that he has been persecuted, or has a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. He claims to have been persecuted by the forced recruitment efforts of both the Guatemalan army and a guerrilla group. The United States Supreme Court and this court have held that conscription alone is insufficient to constitute persecution on account of a protected asylum ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that attempted conscription by a Guatemalan guerrilla group did not constitute persecution on account of a political opinion where petitioner failed to show that the group was motivated by his political opinion); <em>Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.2000) (affirming denial of asylum petition where petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>failed to establish that either the Guatemalan army or a guerrilla group was interested in conscripting him for a reason other than his presence in a particular region of Guatemala). As a result, Mendoza-Mati-as\u2019s asylum claim fails, and the court does not reach Mendoza-Matias\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Mendoza-Matias abandoned his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT by failing to support them with argument in his opening brief. <em>See Rattlesnake Coalition v. EPA, </em>509 F.3d 1095, 1100 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Mendoza-Matias\u2019s Motion to Continue Oral Argument, filed February 1, 2008, is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b684-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
