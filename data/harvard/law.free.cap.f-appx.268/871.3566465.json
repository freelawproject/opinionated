Sheldon appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of her application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). She contends that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)(1) erred in finding that her orthopedic impairment could not reasonably be expected to produce pain, and (2) failed to provide adequate reasons for discrediting her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-21\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings with deference and legal conclusions with close scrutiny. <em>Doughty v. Ap-fel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We treat the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and, as here, the Appeals Council denies review. <em>Id. </em>We do not reweigh evidence presented to the ALJ or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ; instead, we review the entire record to determine if the decision reached is reasonable and is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Cornelius v. Sullivan, </em>936 F.2d 1143, 1145 (11th Cir.1991). Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a finding. <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278. \u201c[A] mere scintilla\u201d of evidence does not suffice. <em>Falge v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 1320, 1322 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-22\">A three-part \u201cpain standard\u201d applies when a claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. <em>Brown v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1233, 1236 (11th Cir. 1991). The standard requires (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (2) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition or (3) the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-23\">A \u201cclaimant\u2019s subjective testimony supported by medical evidence that satisfies the pain standard is itself sufficient to support a finding of disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIndeed, in certain situations, pain alone can be disabling, even when its existence is unsupported by objective evidence.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1561 (11th Cir.1995). If the ALJ decides not to credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>such testimony, he must do so explicitly, explaining why the testimony is not worthy of belief. <em>Brown, </em>921 F.2d at 1236. If the ALJ fails to articulate the reasons for discrediting the claimant\u2019s subjective pain testimony, the testimony must be accepted as true, as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>A claimant\u2019s daily activities may be considered in evaluating complaints of disabling pain. <em>Cf. Harwell v. Heckler, </em>735 F.2d 1292, 1293 (11th Cir.1984). A claimant\u2019s failure to seek medical treatment is also relevant in assessing credibility. <em>Watson v. Heckler, </em>738 F.2d 1169, 1173 (11th Cir.1984). A doctor\u2019s conservative medical treatment for a particular condition tends to negate a claim of disability. <em>Wolfe v. Chater, </em>86 F.3d 1072, 1078 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In this case, the ALJ articulated the reasons for discrediting Sheldon\u2019s testimony regarding her orthopedic impairments and her complaints of pain. Because substantial evidence fully supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
