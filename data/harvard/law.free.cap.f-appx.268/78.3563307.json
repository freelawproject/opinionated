Chew granting Chen\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Liyin Chen, </em>No. A 98 420 114 (B.I.A. July 11, 2007), <em>rev\u2019g </em>No. A 98 420 114 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 27, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">The BIA relied on its prior holdings in <em>Matter of J-H-S- </em>24. I. &amp; N. Dec. 196 (BIA 2007); <em>Matter of J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185 (BIA 2007); and <em>Matter of C-C-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 899 (BIA 2006), in finding that petitioner could not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution based upon the birth of his two children in the United States. In those cases, the BIA developed a three-part burden of proof for asylum applicants claiming a well-founded fear of persecution by Chinese family planning officials based on the birth of multiple children outside of China. The applicant must demonstrate: (1) the existence of a specific \u201cone-child\u201d policy in his local village, (2) that the applicant violated that policy, and (3) that the applicant\u2019s violation of the policy \u201cwould be punished in the local area in a way that would give rise to an objective fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Matter of J-H-S-</em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">Here, Chen has failed to present evidence that the birth of his children in the United States violated the family planning policy in his local area of residence, or that the implementation of sanctions resulting from any possible violation would rise to the level of persecution. <em>See id.; Matter of J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 192 (calling into question whether children born abroad are \u201ccounted\u201d for purposes of China\u2019s family planning policy); <em>Matter of C-C-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 901. While Chen did submit a statement from a neighbor in his home town indicating that she was forcibly sterilized after having two children, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that this anecdotal report \u201cdoes not indicate that such a practice is pervasive and that, as a result, the respondent has an objective reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>fear persecution\u201d is supported by substantial evidence, as no reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to reach a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Petitioner\u2019s claim that the BIA failed to consider all of the evidence he presented is without merit. The BIA explicitly discussed the Wu and Aird affidavits, concluding that their probative value was diminished by the fact that they were not specifically prepared for Chen\u2019s case. <em>See Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting relevance of Aird affidavit was \u201climited\u201d because \u201cit was not prepared specifically for petitioner and is not particularized as to his circumstances\u201d). Further, in contrast to our decision in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>there is no indication that the BIA failed to consider the statement from Chen\u2019s father. 463 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir.2006). Where, as in this case, the record does not \u201ccompellingly suggest\u201d that the BIA did not \u201ctake into account all of the evidence before [it],\u201d the Board is not required to address each piece of evidence in its ruling. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 337, n. 17 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to demonstrate a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of persecution in China. As such, the agency\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s asylum application was not error. Because Chen was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
