Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ing the course of his employment, Wang was allegedly denied access to Formosa\u2019s office before normal business hours and on weekends. Formosa terminated Wang on May 6, 2005, for reasons allegedly unrelated to Wang\u2019s complaints regarding use of company facilities \u2014 namely, for \u201cinsubordination,\u201d \u201cinappropriate and threatening comments to his manager,\u201d and \u201cbehaving in an inappropriate manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">On June 20, 2005, Wang filed an EEOC Charge of Discrimination (\u201cEEOC Charge\u201d), alleging that Formosa discriminated against him on the basis of race, sex, and age. Specifically, Wang wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">During the past three hundred days, I have been subjected to different terms and conditions of employment which I believe are based on my race, age, and sex. For example, I have been threatened by management regarding my ability to use the Flexible Time Leave policy; denied a key to the office; and segregated from employees who are not of my race. On March 1, 2005, I received a \u201cC\u201d performance evaluation. On May 11, 2005,1 was terminated from my position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">After receiving a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Wang-acting <em>pro </em>se-filed a form employment discrimination complaint in the Southern District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Although Wang\u2019s EEOC Charge asserted various instances of discriminatory practices and alleged discrimination based on his race, sex, and age, the allegations in his complaint were limited to sex discrimination based upon the use of company facilities. Specifically, Wang limited his claim to two instances of sex discrimination: (1) being denied a key to the office; and (2) being denied access to the office on weekends. Wang did <em>not </em>identify his discharge as a basis for his discrimination complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">On August 9, 2007, 2007 WL 2315220, the district court granted summary judgment for Formosa, finding that Wang failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. The district court held that Formosa\u2019s alleged failure to provide Wang with a key to the office and failure to permit him to work on weekends did not constitute adverse employment actions. Wang now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">As a preliminary matter, Wang does not dispute the district court\u2019s determination that his claims regarding the use of company facilities did not constitute actionable adverse employment actions. Wang has, therefore, waived any such argument. <em>In re Tex. Mortgage Servs. Carp., </em>761 F.2d 1068, 1073-74 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Instead, Wang\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that he sufficiently alleged that Formosa terminated him on the basis of his gender, and, therefore, he alleged an adverse employment action precluding summary judgment. It is clear, however, that Wang has not preserved this argument for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Wang\u2019s complaint only asserts sex discrimination based upon the use of company facilities. Wang nowhere identifies or intimates in his complaint that his discharge was a result of sex discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact that Wang\u2019s EEOC Charge \u2014 attached to his complaint \u2014 can be read to allege that his termination was based on impermissible discrimination does little to help Wang\u2019s argument. The EEOC Charge contains numerous allegations of discrimination, which Wang chose not to include in his complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Furthermore, Wang never asserted any claim based on his termination during litigation. In his deposition, Wang testified that the sole basis of his sex discrimination complaint involved the use of company facilities. Moreover, in its Motion for Summary Judgment, Formosa specifically asserted that Wang was not claiming that his discharge was discriminatory, and Wang\u2014 in his response \u2014 did not contest this fact and did not claim that he was asserting a discriminatory discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We recognize that Wang acted <em>pro se </em>before the district court and that we liberally construe the pleadings and briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>Clayton v. Shaw, </em>548 F.2d 1155, 1156 (5th Cir.1977) (per cu-riam). However, Wang utterly failed to present his discriminatory discharge claim before the district court, and we will, therefore, not consider it on appeal. <em>FDIC v. Mijalis, </em>15 F.8d 1314, 1327 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cIf an argument is not raised to such a degree that the district court has an opportunity to rule on it, we will not address it on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">. Notably, on Wang's form complaint, Wang did not check the box marked \"terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment\u201d as a basis for his complaint and did not identify his discharge as an example of \"[w]hen and how the defendant has discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\">. For instance, in his EEOC Charge, Wang also alleged race and age discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>and asserted that such discrimination resulted in threats regarding his use of Formosa's Flexible Time Leave policy, segregation from employees of different races, and a poor performance evaluation, in addition to termination and denial of use of company facilities. Wang ostensibly chose not to include many of these allegations in his complaint, including the allegation regarding his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
