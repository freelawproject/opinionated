Under attack is a conviction had in the Criminal District Court of Harris County, Texas, wherein appellant was sentenced to ninety-nine years imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ment for the unlawful possession of a narcotic drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">A quantity of heroin was seized from appellant\u2019s possession as the result of a search conducted pursuant to a search warrant issued in accordance with then existing Texas law. The warrant was practically identical to the one condemned by the Supreme Court in Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964). Appellant contends that the warrant was invalid, that the evidence obtained from the search was improperly received in evidence and that, therefore, the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">As stated in the recent decision of Davis v. Beto, 368 F.2d 999 (5th Cir. 1966), <em>Aguilar </em>is not to be applied retroactively. Furthermore, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) requiring the exclusion by state courts of evidence obtained in violation of the search and seizure provisions of the Constitution, is not retrospective in nature. Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). Appellant\u2019s conviction having become final as early as March 28, 1960, long before the rendition of the decisions in <em>Mapp </em>and <em>Aguilar, </em>no grounds are presented to this Court upon which habeas corpus relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The appellant raises another point which merits some consideration. He contends that his conviction should be set aside because even prior to <em>Mapp </em>Texas statutory law specifically excluded in state court proceedings evidence seized in violation of the United States Constitution. Art. 727a, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Code of Criminal Procedure (now Art. 38.23, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, 1966).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Texas has repeatedly construed the Aguilar-type search warrant to be valid under Texas law and not contrary to federal constitutional standards. Aguillar v. State, 1962, 172 Tex.Cr.R. 629, 362 S.W.2d 111. Cf. Chapin v. State, 1927, 107 Tex.Cr.R. 477, 296 S.W. 1095; 23 Tex.Jur.2d \u00a7 147, p. 225, n. 4. See also Hebert v. State, 1952, 157 Tex.Cr.R. 504, 249 S.W.2d 925, 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">It is now admitted that the Texas courts erroneously interpreted those federal cases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> holding that the Aguilar-type search warrant did not meet federal constitutional standards. Several state courts did consider search warrants like that one involved here to be contrary to a constitutional mandate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The pivotal question is whether Texas\u2019 erroneous construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>federal constitutional standards requires our setting aside convictions infected by this error. The proper answer does not necessitate a decision on the retroactive effect of <em>Aguilar. </em>A federal question may arise when a state buttresses its legislation on federal standards or relationships.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The existence of a federal question is one of the grounds giving the federal courts jurisdiction to hear a case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Conceivably, the involvement of a federal question because of state reliance upon the United States Constitution and laws would be an adequate ground for the Supreme Court to grant a writ of certiorari. Such question, however, does not permit a collateral attack on a state conviction. The appropriate statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (3), specifically limits the granting of a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner, \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\"<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prior to Mapp v. Ohio, 1961, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, a state was free to adopt or reject the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Convictions relying on illegally seized evidence were not prior to <em>Mapp </em>considered as contrary to the Constitution. Texas\u2019 misinterpretation of federal standards may have been reviewable by the United States Supreme Court, but the conviction and resulting confinement cannot be said to have resulted from a violation of constitutional principles. The erroneous understanding of the Texas courts does not permit a collateral attack pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(c) (3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. \u201cNo evidence obtained by an officer or other person in violation of any provisions of the Constitution or laws of the State of Texas, or of the Constitution or laws of the United States of America, shall be admitted in evidence against the accused on the trial of any criminal case.\u201d Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Art. 38.23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">.
