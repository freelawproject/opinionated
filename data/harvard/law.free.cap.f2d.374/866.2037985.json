The Board also found that respondent discriminatorily laid off employees Greene, Fox and Vanderhoof, constructively fired Greene for filing charges against the company and failed to rehire employees Greene, Vanderhoof, Fox and Dykman in violation of section 8(a) (4), (3) and (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">The Board ordered, so far as relevant here, respondent, its officers, etc., to cease and desist from the unlawful activities, to offer employees Dykman and Greene \u201cimmediate and full\u201d reinstatement to their former or equivalent positions without loss of seniority and to make them and Vanderhoof and Fox \u201cwhole\u201d for any loss of pay due to respondent\u2019s discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We find it unnecessary, in considering the section 8(a) (1) issue, to pass on the question whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support findings that employees Vanetta and Stoughtenger are \u201csupervisors,\u201d or that Vice President and Director Steiner acted as respondent\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d in relation to employee Greene. The record justifies the Board\u2019s conclusion of the section 8(a) (1) violation upon the basis of the conduct of President and General Manager Gabower alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">We hold that the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings that the layoffs of Greene, Vanderhoof and Fox on June 16, 1964, were not for economic reasons but for their union activities, and that the failure to reemploy them and Dykman was because of their \u201corganizing activities\u201d or alternatively because they filed charges against the company. These findings support the conclusion of violation of section 8(a) (4), (3) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">We also hold that the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that employee Greene\u2019s \"quitting\u201d employment with respondent was due to Gabower\u2019s discriminatory conduct toward her. The Board was not required to find on this record that her reason for \u201cquitting\u201d was her part-time employment with another employer a few days before she quit. The conclusion of constructive discharge, in violation of section 8(a) (4), (3) and (1), was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">The court orders enforcement of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">I concur in the foregoing opinion with this exception:</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">I dissent as to employee Dykman.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">SCHNACKENBERG, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-25\">. 61 Stat. 136 (1947), as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 et seq.
