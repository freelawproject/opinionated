Additionally, it is contended that the expense of operation of the farm was an ordinary expense incident to Monette\u2019s individual business as a manufacturers\u2019 agent, despite the fact that all the gross receipts from that business were allocated by him among his numerous corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\"> Whether or not the farm was a business or a hobby is essentially a question of fact. Some of the subordinate facts point in one direction, while others point in the opposite. We think the Tax Court\u2019s ultimate finding of fact is not clearly erroneous, for the reasons stated by it. We accept it, while rejecting the alternative theory that the operation of the farm is deductible by Monette on his individual return as an ordinary business expense of the manufacturers\u2019 agent\u2019s business, none of the gross receipts of which were received by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-25\">.
