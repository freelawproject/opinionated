Therefore, we again look at the totality of the circumstances including all four proceedings heretofore reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">The alleged tainted search resulted in the seizure of evidence contained in a locker provided in bus depots for the temporary deposit of travelers\u2019 baggage. The specific locker here involved had been plugged by a bus depot employee for \u25a0overdue rental.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the contents of the locker may have been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">The relationship between the locker owner and the appellant is of little significance, however, because, in order to gain access to the seized evidence, the consent of the locker owner to remove the plug had to be obtained, not the consent of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Furthermore, the identification, during the process of booking of defendant, of a baggage locker key as part of personal property, with the added statement, \u201cgo see for yourself,\u201d cannot be challenged as not voluntary merely because the appellant\u2019s father was not called before appellant was booked; nor can the failure to take appellant before a Justice of the Peace before he was booked affect the voluntariness of the identification of his personal belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">We conclude that the totality of circumstances supports the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-15\">. The decision contained the language, \u201cWe conclude that the totality of circumstances is such as to support the trial court\u2019s finding.\u201d Hubbard v. Tinsley, 350 F.2d 397, 398 (10 Cir. 1965).
