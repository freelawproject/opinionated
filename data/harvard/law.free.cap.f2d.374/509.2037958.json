The District Court granted petitioner the right to file a notice of appeal without prepayment of costs and to proceed in forma pauperis. It appears from the record that the District Court did not grant a certificate of probable cause, and, in fact, no such certificate was requested of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-23\">A certificate of probable cause is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal as provided by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-24\">\u201cAn appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court, unless the justice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akd\">The District Court has not issued a certificate of probable cause and we, therefore, grant respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-25\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
