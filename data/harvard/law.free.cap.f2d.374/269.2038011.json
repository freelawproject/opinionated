Since 1946, appellant has been the certified representative of the craft or class of clerical, office and related employees of Pan American World Airways, Inc. In August of 1965 the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, also an appellee, and hereafter referred to as the Teamsters, filed an application with the Board claiming that the employees desired to be represented by the Teamsters. Acting pursuant to Section 2, Ninth of the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Ninth], the Board conducted an investigation of the Teamsters\u2019 application and in due course ordered that a representation election be conducted on the property of Pan American among the class of employees involved, by mail ballots to be mailed out on August 8, 1966, returnable on or before September 7, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">Appellant Clerks decided to keep its name off the election ballot. As explained by counsel it sought in this way to resist the \u201craid\u201d of the Teamsters, in the thought that under the Board\u2019s rules, the Teamsters could not supplant the Clerks unless more than half of the eligible employees cast a ballot. The Board's ballot contained the name of the Teamsters and a blank place for a write-in vote. While the election was in progress, appellant discovered that all eligible employees had been sent two forged communications urging them to \u201cwrite in\u201d the Clerks\u2019 name on the ballot. One purported to be a letter on the office stationery of, and signed by, Mr. George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO. The other purported to be a circular from the Clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-20\">On August 25, 1966, appellant filed a petition with the Board calling the Board\u2019s attention to the fraud and forgery described above, and requesting the Board to investigate promptly these acts, and, pending the results of the investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tion, to impound the ballots. On September 2,1966, appellant called to the Board\u2019s attention another fraudulent letter to the same effect circulated in San Francisco, purportedly written and signed by the president of the San Francisco local of the Clerks. The Teamsters opposed appellant\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Appellant\u2019s prayer for impounding the ballots and investigation of the election<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was granted when the Board, by letters dated October 6,1966, notified the parties that at an executive session on October 4, it had decided to set aside the purported election and order a new election. The Board\u2019s letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">Information had come to the Board's attention of sufficient gravity as to create a serious doubt whether the balloting in this case had been conducted in an atmosphere which would enable the employees of Pan American World Airways, Inc., to exercise a free choice concerning representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In a petition filed October 10, 1966, the Clerks requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board hold in abeyance the second election until a free, fair and uncoerced election could be held. The petition embraces two thoughts: that the elapsed time was too short to eradicate the taint of the objectionable interferences with a free election, and that the only way the atmosphere could be cleared up was to wait until the Federal agencies investigating the situation determined who was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The petition was denied October 13. The Clerks presented a petition for reconsideration and oral argument (October 21) and a supporting memorandum (October 24). The Board then scheduled oral argument which was heard on October 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">On November 2, 1966, the Board granted the petition for reconsideration, but adhered to its decision to proceed with the second election. However, it rescheduled that election so as to validate ballots mailed between November 14 and December 12, 1966. The Board also ordered that a communication, reprinted in the Appendix hereto, be sent to all Pan American employees eligible to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">On November 10, appellants brought this action in the District Court. For convenience we defer recital of the grounds for relief. The relief sought included (1) a permanent injunction restraining the Board from holding the second election until proper steps are taken to insure that the taint of fraud and other improprieties invalidating the first election are not carried over to the second; and (2) a permanent injunction to prevent the Board from certifying anyone as a result of the election now in progress. A temporary injunction pendente lite was also sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">The District Court on December 1 granted the motions of defendant Board and intervenor Teamsters to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, on the ground that the Board was exercising its discretion in performing its duty under the Railway Labor Act to investigate a representation dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">It is well settled that the jurisdiction of the courts in employee representation proceedings before the National Mediation Board is extremely limited. Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America v. National Mediation Board, 320 U.S. 297, 64 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed. 61 (1943); Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees v. Association for Benefit of Non-Contract Employees, 380 U.S. 650, 85 S.Ct. 1192, 14 L.Ed.2d 133 (1965); Flight Engineers\u2019 International Association v. National Mediation Board et al., 119 U.S.App.D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>171, 338 F.2d 280 (1964). The principle of these decisions requires dismissal, without consideration of the merits, of the appellants\u2019 claim for relief on the ground that the Board scheduled a second election without permitting enough time to elapse to eradicate the taint or prejudice of the frauds which required setting aside the first election. The Board did delay the second election to some extent\u2014 albeit at least in part for the purpose of assuring that the holding of the election would not be interfering with the appropriate Government agencies conducting an investigation of the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board apparently concluded that the delay already ordered was sufficient to permit a second election that was fair and free. It also rejected appellants\u2019 claims either that assignment of responsibility for the forgery and unauthorized mailing was a necessary condition of a fair second election, or that the absence of ascertainment of responsibility required a longer intervening time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In his oral opinion the District Judge noted that he found a great deal of merit in the Clerks\u2019 contention that the delay was too short to forget the message of the forged letters, but that the court was without power to substitute its view for that of the Board. We share his concern and we share his conclusion. The questions involved here are of the kind committed by the Railway Labor Act to the Mediation Board and not the courts. The Board may rightly have assigned weight to the employees\u2019 interest in representation by a union of their own choice, and at the earliest feasible time. Although the record does suggest that the Board has not been sufficiently concerned with the importance of doing its utmost to scrape away all stain of the fraud, we hesitate to conclude that the Board\u2019s action was so gross as to invest the court with jurisdiction. We are a shade more hesitant to intrude since the matter is before us on injunctive relief rather than the merits, and granting of stay traditionally calls for a determination that there is a \u201cprobability\u201d that applicants will be successful on the merits. Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Association v. Federal Power Commission, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 106, 259 F.2d 921 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\"> Appellants have another contention, however, which requires further reflection. They say that for reasons explored further below, the Board\u2019s letter of November 2, 1966, to Pan American employees eligible to vote was such as to mislead them affirmatively as to a material matter underlying the election. In a case of a demonstrably false and misleading statement in the Board\u2019s announcement of the new election the courts are not without jurisdiction. The right to a fair and free election is plain under the Act, and although this is generally committed to the Mediation Board for protection and vindication, a demonstration that the Board has launched an election with recourse to false statements is a basis for invoking the jurisdiction of the courts as a necessity for preserving the rights involved. It would take an explicit mandate to compel a contrary conclusion. We see no such mandate either in the statute or the decisions of the Supreme Court. On the contrary, this type of exceptional jurisdiction is within the contemplation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>case (see particularly 320 U.S. at 300-301, 64 S.Ct. 95).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">To invoke this exceptional jurisdiction of the courts more is required, however, than bare or conclusory allegations of false statements. We turn to the specifics of appellants\u2019 complaint, said to show the presence of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The Clerks begin by stressing the fact that the Board\u2019s announcement of October 6 did not state the reasons for its decision to set aside the first election. The Teamsters exploited the Board\u2019s omission of reasons by circulating among the employees, in the second election campaign, a document captioned:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">THE REAL REASON\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">FOR A SECOND VOTE BRC Admitting Defeat</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">As Lies, Smears Backfire.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The Clerks protest the opportunity given the Teamsters to circulate a document which, they aver and with some reason, \u201cattributed the Board\u2019s action in vacating the election to violations of Federal law\u201d \u2014on the part of the Clerks !<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Clerks allege that they called this document to the attention of the Board, but they do not say exactly when.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Moreover, claim the Clerks, the Board\u2019s sin of omission was capped by sins of commission. They refer particularly to two paragraphs in the Board\u2019s letter of November 2, 1966, to the Pan American employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">However, it was called to the Board\u2019s attention that certain additional campaign tactics over-stepped the bounds of propriety and in fact some representations made to voters were fraudulent. The Board received evidence that letters were sent to voters allegedly over the signatures of the President of the AFL-CIO and the President of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks which were unauthorized. These letters were also written on what was represented to be official stationery or authorized letterheads of these respective organizations. Other communications issued and inducements offered to eligible voters were the basis of additional objections filed with this Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">All eligible voters are now on notice that certain letters and communications which you received during the course of the first balloting period were not authorized nor sent by George Meany, President of the AFL-CIO; and C. L. Dennis, President of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, respectively, and the positions attributed to them in those communications does not reflect their views. This Board has been officially informed that the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks \u2014 Airline Division wishes to remain off the ballot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">This letter presents some problems. It states that unauthorized letters were sent out over the signature of the Clerks\u2019 president, but does not state which ones were unauthorized. The Clerks did send out other communications that were consistent with its stay-away approach. However, some indication of which letters were unauthorized is provided by two factors: (1) only one letter purported to be signed by Mr. Meany; (2) the second quoted paragraph, specifically referring to the sending of unauthorized letters, immediately states that the Clerks wish to remain off the ballot. Even so, the letter was hardly felicitous, as Board counsel admits. The Board would have done better to say outright that the Clerks do not want a write-in campaign, and that letters to the contrary were unauthorized. Such forthrightness would have been a sharper and cleaner surgery to remove the cancer. But there was no misrepresentation in what the Board said and we cannot say that confusion was so compounded that the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>could not honorably and conscientiously have concluded that this was a reasonable effort to wipe the slate clean.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">More troublesome is the basic cast of the letter, and particularly the first of the paragraphs quoted. The letter as written tends to lend support to the Teamsters\u2019 contention that it was the Clerks\u2019 dereliction by way of which inducements to the employees may have been the cause for voiding the first election. In this aspect the letter may be plagued by a misstatement. Counsel for the Clerks points out that inducements by the Clerks were not the basis of objections filed with the Board, at least in the' sense of objections to the holding of the first election. The alleged \u201cbooze party\u201d inducements were <em>cited </em>\u2014 after the Board voided the first election \u2014 in support of a Teamster letter request to hold the election by ballot-boxes rather than by mail. That point apparently cut no ice with the Board, as the request was promptly denied. At oral argument Board counsel stated that objections had been lodged informally with the Board, and therefore its statement was not inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">A difficulty arises whether the Board\u2019s letter, however accurate literally, was not misleading in substance. The problem arises out of the Board\u2019s lack of specificity concerning the fraudulent communications. We are concerned that the Board may have cast its statement so blandly, perhaps in an overzealous effort to maintain the appearance of impartiality, as to be confusing where it should have been clarifying. It will not do to say that both candidates have been accused of wrong when the fact is that one has been indicted for murder, and the other has only received a parking ticket. Impartiality in fact may require a specific statement of the Board\u2019s reasons for its action, which labels the fraud as a major violation requiring a clean slate, and does not confuse or conceal this central point in a quest for even-handed verbiage.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">However it seems to us that appellant did not focus before the Board on the more narrow problems now emphasized before us. So far as appears from the papers filed in court, what was stressed before the Board was a prayer for delay, not a prayer for further clarification in an election to be held expeditiously. While the Board\u2019s letter was unfortunate and even vexing, and reflected faults that could have been avoided if composed with more care and forthrightness, we cannot say at this juncture that it is probable that this court could determine that appellant made allegations in its complaint of the kind of misstatement that provides a predicate for the court\u2019s exceptional jurisdiction discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">As already noted there is an interest in prompt elections. The Board made some effort to wipe out the fraud. A stay pending appeal is always an extraordinary remedy, and it is no less so when extraordinary jurisdiction must be asserted as a prerequisite. This is offset to some extent by the practical consideration that in a case like this the application for a stay is often the battle and more than a mere skirmish. On the other hand there is at least a possibility that if the second election is stained, due to the persisting impact of the forgery and/or of confusion engendered by the Board\u2019s letter, corrective relief may be available.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the most careful consideration, we conclude the stay requested of us should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\">. The prayer of the August 25 petition was reiterated in two additional petitions of the Clerks alleging improper activities by Pan American (by urging employees interested in the Clerks to vote for the Clerks rather than abstain), and by a third Union (the Transport Workers Union of America, violating the AFL-OJO constitution by embarking on its own \u201cwrite-in\u201d campaign although it had not filed cards with the Board).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-5\">. Filed in support of the Board\u2019s motion, in the alternative, for summary judgment, was the affidavit of the Board\u2019s executive secretary who stated that in early September 1966, following receipt of the Clerks\u2019 petition alleging fraud, the Board postponed count of the ballots in the first election and referred the matter to both the Post Office and Justice Departments. On September 27, the Justice Department advised the Board that it could proceed with the election without jeopardizing further investigation by the Justice Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\">. The Teamsters\u2019 circular noted that the Board had not given its reasons for its action announced October 6, and stated in bold face type:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">No one will ever know which of the BRC\u2019s charges brought the decision- \u2014 \u25a0 or whether, perhaps, the Board acted because of irregularities by the BRC itself. There was, for example, the widely publicized free booze party at Cocoa Beach, Florida, at which ballots were collected at the door. This was a clear violation of Federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">BRC refers, of course, to the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\">. It should be noted that in response to a question at argument Board counsel asserted that if developments lead the Board to conclude the second election was tainted by fraud, it has authority to set aside the election even though the ballots have been counted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b339-10\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2CS\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">I agree that our jurisdiction is narrow and limited but I cannot quite agree that the Board\u2019s action falls short of calling for our intervention by means of a stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of governmental action. The Board\u2019s curative efforts here were extraordinarily feeble when considered alongside the blatant fraud and forgery by persons advocating the cause of the Teamsters Union. The Board\u2019s complacency has a clear tendency to encourage the shocking conduct which it purports to chide. If such tactics succeed, the victory of the Teamsters will be the fruit of gross fraud, forgery and chicanery. Except for the adjective \u201cgross\u201d, which I think valid, it seems to me we all agree on the vice of conduct complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">I refrain from recording a dissent only because of the likelihood that Appellants may take steps to set aside the election, should it be adverse to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">APPENDIX NATIONAL MEDIATION BOARD Washington, D.
