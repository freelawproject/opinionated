He pulled from his pocket a package of cigarettes. The customs inspector noticed folded white papers in among the cigarettes. He found four of these. On weighing and testing, these were found to contain 1.6 grams of heroin hydrochloride, a derivative of opium. The possession and whereabouts of the drug was adequately traced from appellant through the weighing and testing facilities of the customs officials whose identifications and descriptions were adequate. The contentions here made as to insufficiency of evidence are without any foundation whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Another contention made is that the court erred in rejecting appellant\u2019s motion to disclose the identity of the Government\u2019s informer. There is no basis whatever for that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">It appears from the testimony of agent Washington that he may have received some information to the effect that appellant and his companion were on the Mexican side of the boundary on the day when the arrest was made. The witness was being asked when he saw appellant there on that date. The complete statement was as follows: \u201cQ. And how do you know the time of thi&amp;? A. I received a call about 4:00 P.M., a few minutes after 4:00, that two Americans \u2014 \u201d, the answer ended there. If it be assumed that this means that some one informed Washington that appellant and his companion were in Mexico, the claim that appellant was improperly denied the name of some assumed informer is completely frivolous. It does not appear that the name of any informer was known.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">But, even assuming that there was such a person and his name was known, there is no duty to disclose any such informer. The Government has no duty of disclosure in such a case. The rule was stated in Velarde-Villarreal v. United States, 9 Cir., 354 F.2d 9, 14, (dissenting opinion) as follows: \u201cIt is established that the Government is not required to reveal to an accused the identity of one who furnishes \u2018information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law\u2019 \u201d, (citing Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 59, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, which in turn cites Scher v. United States, 305 U.S. 251, 254, 59 S.Ct. 174, 83 L.Ed. 151.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">A rule that any person who merely informs the officers of the commission of a crime must be disclosed to the accused as the one responsible for his arrest would serve to encourage the criminal to wreak his vengeance on the informer. Such information might be hard to come by; and such a rule would seriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>hamper accepted police investigative techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">If there was an informer in this case, there is nothing to show that he was more than a mere observer, not a participant. As the appellant puts it in his brief: \u201cThe facts in this case simply have not been developed to a point where a finding of fact can be made.\u201d It would be unthinkable to call for a reversal here in the complete absence of facts to support appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Approximately two weeks before the trial date appellant filed a \u201cmotion to disclose identity of informer.\u201d It contained a \u201cMemorandum in support\u201d of the motion. The motion was not supported by any affidavit or other proof. The memorandum simply asserted: \u201cPetitioner\u2019s counsel must have the informer\u2019s name to show that (1) informer possibly put the illegal heroin in the package of cigarettes; (2) that the informer possessed the cigarette package for approximately two hours; (3) that the informer had access to heroin; (4) that petitioner forcibly took cigarettes from the informer; (5) that the package of cigarettes originally belonged to petitioner; (6) that the petitioner had no knowledge of the fact that heroin was in the cigarette package. * * * But from the facts as ascertained by petitioner\u2019s counsel, we feel that the above mentioned person called informer must have been the person who notified the Border authorities.\u201d Appellant testified. His attempted defense below, and here, was that he had two or more packs of Pall Mall cigarettes when he went into Mexico on the day in question. Appellant and his friend Jackson were driving in Jackson\u2019s automobile. They met two Mexican men from whom they bought some jewelry. Appellant gave each of the Mexicans a pack of cigarettes. Later a quarrel ensued between appellant and Jackson on the one hand and the two Mexicans on the other, which arose out of the Mexican\u2019s failure to produce some marijuana cigarettes for which appellant had paid them. Then appellant forcibly took back from one of the Mexicans the open cigarette pack he had been given. Appellant\u2019s defense was that the Mexican must have inserted the parcels of heroin in the pack while he had possession of it, and that when defendant recovered the pack, and put it in his pocket, he had no knowledge that these parcels had been inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Neither defendant nor Jackson named these Mexicans. They disclaimed knowledge of their names. So far as the record shows, the customs agents had even less knowledge of who they were, or even whether there were any such persons. Appellant\u2019s motion asserts that he forcibly took the cigarettes from the \u201cinformer\u201d, thus suggesting that the Mexican about whom he testified was the-informer. There is not the slightest, showing that such was the case. Significantly, appellant made no effort whatever to ascertain whether that was. true, or possible. Three of the customs-inspectors who participated in the search, and arrest were called and testified. They were cross-examined by defense-counsel. None were asked by such counsel whether there was an informer, or, if so, who he was.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">It is not unlikely that the defense-wished to be able to argue its theory to-the jury, based on defendant\u2019s testimony, but carefully refrained from asking the-agents about an informant, knowing that, the answer might well have exploded the defense, \u2014 such as that the information, came through an anonymous telephone call, from a station on the American side-of the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">We find no error. The judgment is. affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-16\">. Appellant overlooks the distinction noted in United States v. Conforti, 7 Cir., 200 F.2d 365, 367, as follows: \u201cThis distinction between one who plays a part in a criminal transaction and one who is a mere informer is well illustrated in Sorrentino v. United States, 9 Cir., 163 F. 2d 627. [The court there stated at p. 628]: \u2018If the person whom Grady called an informer had been an informer and nothing more, appellant would not have been entitled to have his identity disclosed; but the person whom Grady called an informer was something more. He was the person to whom appellant was said to have sold and dispensed the opium described in the indictment. Information as to this person\u2019s identity was therefore material to appellant\u2019s defense, and appellant was entitled to a disclosure thereof.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-12\">. There was no question, \u201cDid you know who was informing? Did he speak with a Mexican accent?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
