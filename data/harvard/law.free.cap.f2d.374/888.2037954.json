Appellant urges error in that (a) there should have been an instruction given, sua sponte, on entrapment (though none was offered), (b) there was error in the action of the Government counsel in allegedly exhibiting an alleged \u201cmake sheet\u201d on defendant so that the jury \u201cmay\u201d have observed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">The defense in the court below was mistaken identity \u2014 not entrapment. A defense lawyer relying on mistaken identity, as a matter of trial strategy, would not ordinarily favor the giving of an instruction by a judge, on his own motion, on entrapment. No instruction on entrapment was offered, and none required.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">The trial court disposed of counsel\u2019s second alleged error. No record was made sufficient to raise the question on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
