The petition is resisted mainly on the ground that the evidence before the Board was insufficient to support its factual determination that the respondent was guilty of conduct which violated Sections 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3). We cannot agree. The findings of fact stated .in the Intermediate Report of the Examiner, and adopted by the Board, were supported by ample evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">The respondent objects to that portion of the order which directs that an appropriate notice be posted in its place of business in Dover, Delaware, the situs of the unfair labor practices. We can find nothing oppressive in this remedial provision. It must be remembered that it is the function of the Board, and not that of the courts, to fashion the remedies to effectuate the policies of the Act. Section 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(c); National Labor Relations Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 346, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953); N. L. R. B. v. Buitoni Foods Corp., 298 F.2d 169, 175 (3rd Cir. 1961). The remedy prescribed by the Board \u201cshould stand unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 319 U.S. 533, 540, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 1218, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943). There is no such showing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">A decree for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order may be submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
