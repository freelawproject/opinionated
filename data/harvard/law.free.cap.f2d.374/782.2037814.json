During that day he described to Roosevelt Smith, the driver of the truck, a method by which he could remove the contents of cartons of one of the shippers, National Togs, without breaking them open, and indicated to Smith that he had previously stolen goods in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">The next day the truck made several deliveries of interstate shipments and then was parked for lunch at 11th Avenue and 42nd Street. While the cartons in the body of the truck were being rearranged for afternoon delivery Smith saw Padilla trying to get his hand into a sealed National Togs carton. When he was unable to do so Padilla worked his way into a second carton and pulled out two pairs of women\u2019s slacks. He hid the slacks in the front of the body of the truck and placed several cartons on top of the carton from which he had taken them. This was done over Smith\u2019s protests and Padilla asked him to keep quiet about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Nevertheless Smith telephoned his boss, Bell, who arrived shortly with two F. B. I. agents. Smith and Padilla were in the front seat of the truck. Smith, who had keys to the back of the truck (which Padilla did not), unlocked the rear doors. Smith pointed out the carton which had been broken into and the place where the slacks were hidden. The agents took the slacks from their hiding place. Later Padilla was arrested and charged with the theft. There was evidence that after the arrest Padilla had offered inducements to Smith to persuade Smith not to testify against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Padilla took the stand in his own defense and denied taking the slacks or trying to persuade Smith not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Section 659 of Title 18, in relevant part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">\u201cWhoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully takes, carries away, or conceals, or by fraud or deception obtains from any railroad car, wagon, motor-truck or other vehicle, or from any station, station house, platform or depot or from any steamboat, vessel, or wharf, or from any aircraft, air terminal, airport, aircraft terminal or air navigation facility with intent to convert to his own use any goods or chattels moving as or which are a part of or which constitute an interstate or foreign shipment of freight * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The information charged that Padilla \u201cwith intent to convert to his own use, did embezzle, steal, take and carry away from a City Carriers, Inc. Mortortruck [sic] * * * two pairs of women\u2019s slacks, which were moving as, were part of and constituted an interstate shipment of freight and express from New York, New York, to Chicago, Illinois,\u201d in violation of \u00a7 659.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Padilla contends that to establish the charged violation of \u00a7 659 it was necessary for the Government to show that he had physically removed the slacks from\u2014 that is to say out of \u2014 the truck in which they were being transported. His theory is that the phrase in \u00a7 659 \u201cfrom any * * * motortruck'\u201d coming after the words \u201csteals, or unlawfully takes\u201d must be construed to require such proof before a crime can be said to have been committed. He therefore urges that since he had merely hidden the slacks taken from the carton in the body of the truck where they remained until the agents found them, and had at no time taken them out of the vehicle, proof of an essential element of the crime charged was lacking and he should have been acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">We see no merit in this contention. We hold that a theft or unlawful taking under \u00a7 659 was complete when Padilla removed the slacks from the carton in the body of the truck and reduced them to his possession and control with the intent to convert them to his own use. Hiding the slacks in the front of the body of the truck after he had acquired dominion over them, with a view to disposing of them later, was additional evidence of his intent to convert them to his own use and of the completion of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">There are three elements of the crime defined in \u00a7 659 as charged in the information. It must be proved (1) that the slacks were stolen or unlawfully taken by the accused with intent to convert them to his own use; (2) that the slacks were \u201cpart of an interstate * * * shipment of freight\u201d; and (3) that the slacks were stolen or unlawfully taken \u201cfrom\u201d the City Carriers\u2019 motortruck.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">It is the last of these three elements which Padilla contends was not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">However, the phrase \u201cfrom any * * motortruck\u201d as used in the context of the statute does not, as Padilla contends, require that the goods be physically removed from the vehicle \u2014 that is to say actually taken out of it \u2014 before the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>of theft or unlawful taking from interstate commerce can occur. While the preposition \u201cfrom\u201d may be used to indicate physical removal or asportation it is not so used here. An ordinary and usual meaning of \u201cfrom\u201d is to indicate a starting point. Webster\u2019s International Dictionary 1012 (2d ed. 1953); The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 754 (3d ed. 1955). That is the sense in which it is used in \u00a7 659 \u2014 to indicate the facility in which the theft or taking from interstate commerce must initiate in order to have the statute apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Moreover, the construction for which Padilla contends would do violence to other language in the statute. While it might be argued that \u201csteals, or unlawfully takes, * * * from any\u201d of the enumerated facilities could be literally read to imply a requirement of actual removal from the facility, that could scarcely be true when the phrase \u201cfrom any\u201d facility is applied to the word \u201cconceals.\u201d To \u201cconceal from * * * any motor-truck\u201d makes little sense unless \u201cfrom\u201d be read as indicating the starting point of the act charged \u2014 that is to say the facility in which the goods were located when the act began.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">This is in substance the construction of the statute adopted by this Court in United States v. De Normand, 149 F.2d 622 (2d Cir. 1945), cert, den., 326 U.S. 756, 66 S.Ct. 89, 90 L.Ed. 454 (1945). There the defendants were charged with stealing merchandise moving in interstate commerce from trailer trucks in violation of then 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 409,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the predecessor of \u00a7 659. The driver of one of the trucks had taken it from the terminal and parked it in the street while he went for a cup of coffee. As the driver was returning to the parked truck he was held up by defendants at gunpoint before he reached the truck, was taken to the terminal and was placed bound and gagged inside an empty truck there. Defendants were arrested as they left the terminal and before they reached the parked truck. The truck remained sealed. The defendants had not moved any of its contents or even touched it.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The Court rejected the contention that \u00a7 409 had not been violated \u201cbecause there was no asportation of the truck or any of its contents.\u201d It held that the stealing or unlawful taking contemplated by the statute was complete when the defendants by seizing the driver took over dominion or control of the truck from the carrier. Defendants thus acquired at least constructive possession of the truck and its contents and this was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">In this aspect the case at bar is, if anything, stronger than <em>De Normand. </em>Here Padilla actually reduced the slacks to his physical possession, exercised dominion over them with intent to convert them to his own use and hid them for later disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\"><em>De Normand </em>makes it clear that the enumeration of the specific interstate transportation facilities \u201cfrom\u201d which goods must be abstracted does not import physical removal of the goods out of or away from one of the enumerated facilities or even asportation in the common law larceny sense. The phrase merely limits the proscription of the statute to takings which initiate or occur at the types of interstate transportation facilities specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">While the statute as it read when <em>De Normand </em>was decided was amended in 1946 and was reworded on recodification in 1948, no meaningful change was made which would alter the essential object of the statute or require any different construction than we have given it.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>The statute was first enacted in 1913 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because of the difficulties being encountered in prosecutions in the state courts for the increasing number of thefts from interstate commerce which were having a disruptive effect on the interstate flow of goods. It was thought that by supplementing state jurisdiction by federal legislation venue and other problems which were plaguing state authorities in cases of this nature would be minimized. See Senate Rep.No.1732, 62d Cong., 3d Sess. (1913); 49 Cong. Rec. 1780-82, 2480-81 (1913) (Senate debates).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Thus, to close the gap the 1913 act provided two bases of federal jurisdiction\u2014 (1) that the goods taken be part of an interstate shipment, and (2) that the taking be \u201cfrom\u201d \u2014 that is to say occur at \u2014 particular interstate transportation facilities which were enumerated. See O\u2019Kelley v. United States, 116 F.2d 966, 968 (8th Cir. 1941); United States v. Moynihan, 258 F. 529 (3d Cir. 1919); cf. Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 218, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960) (construing the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951). At that time, of course, interstate commerce was conducted largely by railroad and vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">By 1925, however, the use of automotive vehicles in interstate transportation had vastly increased. Some courts had been reluctant to construe the jurisdictional reach of the statute to include such vehicles. It therefore became necessary, in order to close this loophole, to amend the act so as to add motor vehicles and their transfer and storage facilities to the interstate transportation facilities enumerated from which the proscribed thefts or takings must occur. Act of Jan. 28, 1925, ch. 102, 43 Stat. 793; see Senate Rep.No. 814, 68th Cong., 2d Sess. (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">The 1946 amendment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> like the prior amendment was made to close loopholes in the act, this time by combining \u201cthe crime'of embezzlement with that of larceny and making the entire act applicable to air transportation.\u201d House Rep.No. 1116, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1946); see United States v. O\u2019Connell, 165 F.2d 697, 699 and n. 5 (2d Cir. 1948). We see nothing in that amendment which could be said to limit or restrict the coverage of the act as it stood when <em>De Normand </em>was decided or to make the holding of that case no longer applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-19\">Such cases as United States v. Manuszak, 234 F.2d 421 (3d Cir. 1956) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>United States v. Wora, 246 F.2d 283 (2d Cir. 1957), both decided after the statute had been amended, do not lead to any different conclusion. <em>Manuszak </em>merely held that the failure of an indictment under \u00a7 659 to specify the place or facility from which the goods were taken was a fatal defect which required reversal of a conviction under that section. <em>Wora, </em>while agreeing that in order to convict it had to be shown that the goods had been taken from one of the enumerated facilities, declined to follow <em>Manuszak </em>to the extent that it held the absence of such an allegation in the indictment to be fatal. Neither of these cases held directly or by implication that the phrase \u201cfrom any * * * motortruck, etc.\u201d in the statute as it presently reads, requires that the goods stolen or taken be physically removed from the truck or other enumerated facility before the crime defined in \u00a7 659 can be said to have taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">In United States v. Berger, 338 F.2d 485 (2d Cir. 1964) this court in affirming a conviction under \u00a7 659, refused to read narrowly the words \u201cinterstate shipment of freight and express\u201d in the statute and said (p. 487) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">\u201c[W]e must also be mindful that Congress has here undertaken to protect and promote the flow of goods in interstate commerce, and that this undertaking is not to be hampered by technical legal conceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Unduly narrow reading of that and other language of the statute has been rejected in a number of other cases in this and other circuits. E. g., United States v. De Fina, 315 F.2d 362 (2d Cir. 1963); United States v. D\u2019Antonio, 342 F.2d 667 (7th Cir. 1965); Sterling v. United States, 333 F.2d 443 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">In White v. United States, 273 F. 517, 518 (2d Cir. 1921) the object of this statute was said by Judge Hough (quoted with approval in <em>De </em>Normand) to be \u201cto create, define, and punish the offense of abstracting or unlawfully having in possession goods while in interstate or foreign transit, and thereby interfering with interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d The Supreme Court in United States v. Cook, 384 U.S. 257, 86 S.Ct. 1412, 16 L.Ed.2d 516 (1966) has recently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax2\">\u201cWe are mindful of the maxim that penal statutes should be strictly construed. But that canon \u2018is not an inexorable command to override common sense and evident statutory purpose/ United States v. Brown, 333 U.S. 18, 25 [68 S.Ct. 376, 380, 92 L.Ed. 442,] and does not \u2018require that the act be given the \u201cnarrowest meaning.\u201d It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accordance with the evident intent of Congress.\u2019 \u201d 384 U.S. at 262-263, 86 S.Ct. at 1415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">See also United States v. Turley, 352 U.S. 407, 417, 77 S.Ct. 397, 1 L.Ed.2d 430 (1957) dealing with the term \u201cstolen\u201d as used in the Dyer Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">We have construed the language of the statute before us in accordance with these precepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">Finally, it has been suggested that Padilla\u2019s conduct had not gone far enough to constitute a completed theft as distinguished from an attempt to steal and that therefore conviction under \u00a7 659 was unwarranted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Under the view we have taken of the statute this is not a valid suggestion. As was said in <em>De Normand, </em>149 F.2d at 624, \u201c * * * the statute is not framed in terms merely of larceny and its prohibition should not be restricted to technical common law larceny * *</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In any event, the evidence clearly showed that Padilla took physical possession of the slacks, exercised dominion over them to the exclusion of the owner and then hid them some distance away from where he took them. This would be sufficient to satisfy even common law larceny requirements. Michael and Weehsler, Criminal Law and Its Administration 415 (1940); see People v. Ash-worth, 220 App.Div. 498, 222 N.Y.S. 24 (4th Dept. 1927); Harrison v. New York, 50 N.Y. 518 (1872). Padilla\u2019s conduct clearly had crossed the somewhat elusive line between an attempt to steal and a completed theft. See American Law Institute, Model Penal Code \u00a7 223-2(1) (Proposed Official Draft 1962), and comment on this section in Tent. Draft No. 1, at 65 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-18\">.

The changes made on recodification of the Criminal Code of 1948, when \u00a7 409 was combined with other sections to form \u00a7 659, were not meant to change existing law in any respect. See United States v. Cook, 384 U.S. 257, 260, 86 S.Ct. 1412,16 L.Ed.2d 516 (1966); House Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. (1948); Holtzoff, Preface to Title 18 U.S.C.A. (1950 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-22\">The Act of May 24, 1949, ch. 139, 63 Stat. 91, made slight changes in the second and fourth paragraphs of \u00a7 659, which are not involved in the present case. The purpose of these changes was \u201cto restore the language of the original from which such section was derived.\u201d House Rep. No. 352, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">. Padilla could not have been convicted of an attempt to violate \u00a7 659. Buie 31(c), F.B.Cr.P., provides that \u201c[t]he defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offense charged or an offense necessarily included therein <em>if the attempt is an offense.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, unlike many state criminal codes, see, e. g., Calif.Pen.Code \u00a7 663 (Deering 1959); N.Y.Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 40, \u00a7 260; N.Y.Proposed Pen.Law \u00a7 110.00; Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.01 (Prop.Official Draft 1962), federal criminal statutes contain no general attempt provision. An attempt to commit a federal crime is punishable only where the section defining the crime specifically includes an attempt within its proscription. See United States v. Lucas, 6 E.2d 327 (W.D.Wash.1925); Michael and Wechsler, Criminal Law and Its Administration 584 n. 3 (1940). A number of fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>eral criminal statutes specifically mention attempts. See, e. g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (\u201cWhoever enters or attempts to enter\u201d) ; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 546 (\u201cfor the purpose of smuggling, or attempting to smuggle\u201d) ; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 (\u201cattempts to commit murder or manslaughter\u201d). \u00a7 659 does not refer to an attempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b852-6\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AGS\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 told in Judge Bryan\u2019s thorough opinion, although, as so often is the case, it was not developed at all by counsel, is an interesting example how draftsmen and revisers can create problems as to the meaning of statutes without busy legislators having any notion what is occurring. Cf. People of State of N. Y. v. Galamison, 342 F.2d 255, 260-261, 8 A.L.R.3d 263 (2 Cir.), cert, denied, 380 U.S. 977, 85 S.Ct. 1342, 14 L.Ed.2d 272 (1965). It seems clear to me as a matter of the natural meaning of language that when the statute was enacted, see fn. 4 to Judge Bryan\u2019s opinion, and as it stood when United States v. De Normand, 149 F.2d 622 (2 Cir. 1945), was decided, the \u201cfrom\u201d phrase related solely to cases where the charge was that the defendant had \u201cby fraud or deception obtain[ed],\u201d with the other verbs applying to <em>any </em>goods or chattels constituting interstate or foreign shipments of freight or express. The comma before the words \u201cwith intent to convert\u201d etc. effectively insulated the \u201cby fraud or deception obtain\u201d phrase. That, I think, was the precise basis for Judge Swan\u2019s holding in <em>De Normand, </em>149 F.2d at 624, as well as for what Judge Hough said in White v. United States, 273 F. 517, 518 (2 Cir. 1921). It is equally clear to me that, as the statute stood between the Act of July 24, 1946, see fn. 5 to Judge Bryan\u2019s opinion, and the 1948 codification, the reading my brothers give the present act would have been so contrary to the ordinary meaning of language as to be impermissible in the construction of a penal statute where, despite such decisions as United States v. Turley, 352 U.S. 407, 417, 77 S.Ct. 397, 1 L.Ed.2d 430 (1957) and United States v. Cook, 384 U.S. 257, 86 S.Ct. 1412, 16 L.Ed.2d 516 (1966), we encounter the opposite pull of the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 83-84, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955) \u2014 although I agree that almost certainly Congress was unaware of the change the draftsman had wrought. Then came the 1948 codification which, asserting its purpose to preserve throughout \u201cthe original intent of Congress,\u201d S.Rep.No.1620, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1, gave this statute a form that was neither what it had originally been nor what it had unintentionally become.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">I am content to join my brothers in following the legislative zig with a judicial zag, first narrowing the statute from its \u201cur\u201d form by making the \u201cfrom any station\u201d etc. language apply to all the verbs and then broadening it by reading \u201cfrom\u201d to include \u201cin\u201d \u2014 although it would not take much to persuade me that Congress might have been content to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>allow such minor offenses as Padilla\u2019s to be handled by the states rather than to invoke against them the mighty apparatus of the federal criminal law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
