The court on May 28, 1965, imposed a suspended sentence of one to three years imprisonment, conditioned upon satisfactory completion of three years on probation. On July 16 of the same year a United States Probation Officer requested of the court a bench warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest as a probation violator. A hearing was held, followed by revocation of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal to this court we remanded the case to the District Court for the preparation if possible of a statement of evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 75(n), the reporter\u2019s notes of the hearing being unavailable. The parties were unable to reconstruct such a statement. Accordingly a de novo hearing was held, and the sentencing judge reaffirmed the revocation of probation. The present appeal is from this action. Revocation of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>bation lies within the sound discretion of the District Court. Burns v.
