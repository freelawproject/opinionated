The Commission granted appellant time to appeal and to seek a stay of its order. Appeal was taken, and this court granted appellant a stay pending the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Appellant contends that the Commission\u2019s order is invalid because (1) appellant began operations on March 4, 1966, in reliance upon the public notice of the Commission issued February 15, 1966, which announced that rules applicable to CATV operations would be forthcoming, and which appellant alleges was so worded as to lead it to believe its operations would not be within the ambit of the rules, which were thereafter released March 8, 1966; and (2) even if wrong about the foregoing, the circumstances of appellant\u2019s case, advanced as equitable considerations, and our decision in C. J. Community Services, Inc. v. FCC, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 379, 246 F. 2d 660, entitled appellant to a hearing on its request that Section 74.1107 of the Commission\u2019s rules <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>be waived notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s insistence that appellant\u2019s violations be discontinued before such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The issues presented to this court by appellant were carefully considered and decided by the Commission in its decision of July 18, 1966. We are of the opinion, for the reasons there set forth on these issues, that the order of the Commission is valid. We accordingly affirm it and dissolve the stay heretofore entered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-20\">. 31 Fed.Reg. 4572.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
