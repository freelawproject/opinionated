To succeed in this contention, taxpayer has the burden to establish that the distribution was paid \u201con account of the employee\u2019s separation from the service\u201d of his employer. Section 165 (b), Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 165(b) (1952 ed.). The district court sitting without a jury found as a fact that the distribution was paid by reason of a ruling by the Commissioner that the pension plan no longer qualified for exemption and not by reason of the employee\u2019s separation from the service ; accordingly, taxpayer\u2019s claim for refund was denied. 218 F.Supp. 845 (E.D. La.1963). After a careful review of the record, we are convinced such a finding is not clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
