The automobile had been stolen in Blytheville on the evening of June 27th. The circumstances antedating appellant\u2019s arrest and apprehension strongly indicate that he actually stole the automobile, and were sufficient to establish the element of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-20\">Appellant\u2019s sole claim of error is that he was effectively deprived of a fair trial by the admission into evidence, over objection, of the following testimony of the arresting officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-21\">\u201cQ. Had you received a report that the defendant was armed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-22\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-23\">(Following a colloquy between Court and counsel, the examination continued :)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-24\">\u201cQ. Officer, you arrested Joseph Thomas Gresham, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-25\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-26\">\u201cQ. At the time of the arrest you didn\u2019t find a gun on him, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-27\">\u201cA. Not on the first search I did-n't.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Appellant\u2019s basic premise seems to be that this was a \u201cclose case\u201d, and that the mere reference to a gun depicted the appellant as an \u201carmed man.\u201d It is contended such characterization swung the balance in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We disagree. Having considered the questioned testimony in context, we are not persuaded that its admission constituted error. But even if we were to indulge in that assumption, we are convinced the error was harmless. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, this was not a weak case. The evidence of guilt was strong and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., provides that any error which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded. The Courts have uniformly held that prejudicial error must be shown before a reversal is justified. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-765 (1946); Tucker v. United States, 375 F.2d 363 (8th Cir. March, 1967); Osborne v. United States, 351 F.2d 111, 117 (8th Cir. 1965); Evenson v. United States, 316 F.2d 94, 95 (8th Cir. 1963). The strength of the Government\u2019s case is an important factor in determining the existence of prejudicial error. Patterson v. United States, 361 F.2d 632, 636 (8th Cir. 1966); Jacobson v. United States, 356 F.2d 685, 689 (8th Cir. 1966); Brown v. United States, 283 F.2d 792, 797-798 (8th Cir. 1960); Thomas v. United States, 281 F.2d 132, 136 (8th Cir. 1960), cert, denied, 364 U.S. 904, 81 S.Ct. 239, 5 L.Ed.2d 196 (1960); Homan v. United States, 279 F.2d 767, 770-771 (8th Cir. 1960), cert, denied, 364 U.S. 866, 81 S.Ct. 110, 5 L.Ed.2d 88 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We have carefully examined the entire record and are satisfied that the impropriety complained of had no prejudicial effect upon the jury. Appellant received a fair trial, and the judgment should be and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-14\">. Appellant has had a proclivity for stealing automobiles. During the hearing before the court, prior to the imposition of sentence, appellant admitted that between 1945 and 1963 he had been convicted at least five times for Dyer Act violations or for thefts of various automobiles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-29\">. Defendant did not testify in his own behalf or offer any evidence during the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
