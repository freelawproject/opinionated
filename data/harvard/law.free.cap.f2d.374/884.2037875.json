He is serving a life sentence for the murder of a fellow prison inmate. He was convicted in 1933 and now claims that he was denied a fair trial at the time in three respects. First, all of his witnesses were intimidated to the extent that they refused to testify; second, he was deprived of certain defenses by being tried with three co-defendants; and third, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because there was a conflict of interest between his own representation and that of his co-defendants. The District Court ruled against appellant in every respect and that ruling is amply supported by the facts and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
