He owned a panel truck which he leased to his employer. At about 6:00 p. m. on June 23, 1965, after the company had closed for the day, the defendant was observed returning to the company\u2019s place of business in his automobile. He parked the car next to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>truck, which was backed against a loading platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The defendant began to move in and around the truck. He ascended the loading dock, parted a tarpaulin hanging at the rear of the truck, and thrust his head inside for a moment. He retreated from this position, climbed into the cab of the truck, and drove the truck to the company\u2019s office thirty feet from the loading dock. The defendant again appeared to look into the back of the truck. He entered the office, reappeared a few minutes later, and returned the truck to its original position.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">At this point, two federal agents who had been observing the defendant made their presence known. After identifying themselves and warning the defendant of his rights, the agents asked the defendant what he was doing on the premises. The defendant replied that he was just \u201changing around\u201d and that he had returned to have his truck serviced. In response to another question, the defendant stated that the truck was empty and invited the agents to look for themselves. When the tarpaulin was parted,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant expressed surprise at the presence, in plain sight not more than two feet away, of several clearly-marked shipping cartons containing clothing and other materials. Many of the containers had been opened, revealing their contents. The cartons later proved to have been recently stolen from interstate shipments. The defendant admitted that the \u201cstuff looks hot\u201d and that \u201cit looks like it is stolen.\u201d Shortly thereafter, he explained that he was in the habit of selling merchandise purchased on Maxwell Street. He stated that he had intended to appropriate a portion of the goods in the truck for sale as \u201cseconds,\u201d but that \u201csomeone beat [him] to it.\u201d The defendant later remarked that \u201cit looks pretty bad. It looks like I am caught with the stuff.\u201d He added, \u201cCan\u2019t I do something to help myself?\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">From this evidence the district judge could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in possession of goods known to have been stolen from interstate commerce. The defendant\u2019s ownership of the truck and his exercise of control and authority over it immediately prior to the discovery of the stolen merchandise by the agents establish his possession of the goods. United States v. Spatuzza, 331 F.2d 214, 216 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 379 U.S. 829, 85 S.Ct. 58,13 L.Ed.2d 38 (1964). His actions in twice looking into the rear of the truck, the markings on the shipping containers, and his statements to the agents, plus the inference arising from his unexplained possession of recently stolen goods, United States v. Casalinuovo, 350 F.2d 207, 211 (2d Cir. 1965), are sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the goods were stolen from interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-14\">. The defendant was tried by the district court sitting without a jury. He received a sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-16\">. At other times, and at the trial, the defendant contended that he was a victim of a \u201cframe.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
