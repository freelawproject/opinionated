Rodriguez was identified as having been with Ruiz in two of the lounges at times when Ruiz passed counterfeit bills. Rodriguez himself was found guilty of passing one counterfeit bill, and evidence was also introduced tending to show passage of another. Furthermore, one of the counterfeit ten dollar bills passed by Ruiz was tendered only after the bartender refused, because of lack of change, a twenty offered by Rodriguez. All of the bills passed by the appellants were of ten and twenty dollar denominations, and each passage was made in payment of a small item \u2014 a single drink or a six pack of beer or carbonated beverages. There is also evidence that Ruiz removed several counterfeit twenty dollar bills from his person shortly before he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Mere passage of a counterfeit bill does not give rise to an inference of guilty knowledge. It has been held, however, that rapid and repetitious passage of counterfeit currency is evidence of knowledge of the counterfeit nature of the currency,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> especially where passage is made at several different establishments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Evidence of repeated use of large counterfeit bills rather than of change received from earlier purchases is also relevant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Probably the strongest evidence of guilty knowledge is an attempt to abandon counterfeit currency when detection is feared.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">A close review of the record and the case law convinces us that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer the requisite guilty knowledge on the part of both Ruiz and Rodriguez. Feeling that the other points raised by appellants are without merit, we</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">Affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-29\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b683-30\">Whoever, with intent to defraud, passes, utters, publishes, or sells, or attempts to pass, utter, publish, or sell, or with like intent brings into the United States or keeps in possession or conceals any falsely made, forged, counterfeited, or altered obligation or other security of the United States, shall be fined not more than $5,-000 or imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\">.
