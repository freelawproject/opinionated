The application of intervenor was filed with the Commission on March 2, 1961, appellant\u2019s petition to deny or designate the application for hearing was filed approximately a year later, and the Commission\u2019s appealed-from orders were issued on April 20, 1966 and July 20, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Having initially through its own inadvertences deprived appellant of the opportunity to respond to three amendments filed by Voice, the Commission reviewed appellant\u2019s substantive arguments, set forth in its petition for reconsideration, regarding the materials in the amendments, \u201cin the same manner as if they had been received\u201d before the Commission\u2019s original decision. Following such review the Commission denied the petition for reconsideration. The Commission\u2019s corrective action also adequately disposes of appellant\u2019s attack upon specific procedural rules of the Commission, challenged for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Upon consideration of all the pleadings and data set forth by appellant on other issues, we agree with the Commission\u2019s reconsidered determination that no evidentiary hearing was required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
