McAllister and Catlett were jointly engaged in picking pears. Immediately before the accident, Catlett was standing near the top of a ladder propped against the tree. Catlett\u2019s testimony suggested that Mc-Allister was standing on the ground, but medical record histories introduced into evidence placed McAllister on one of the lower rungs of the ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-21\">Appellant bases his appeal on two principal grounds: (1) the medical records indicating that McAllister had been standing on the ladder should not have been admitted into evidence, and (2) the trial court should have directed a verdict in his favor because the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, as applied to the facts of the case, permits no conclusion other than that McAllister\u2019s injuries were caused by Catlett\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-23\">The trial court held, and we agree, that the medical records were admissible and that the recitals in the histories presented a jury question on the issue of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>The records in question fall clearly within the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732, which provides for the admissibility of business records. Circumstances concerning the making of the records may affect the weight to be given to them, but not their admissibility. Appellant argues, however, that since appellee testified that appellant had been on the ground prior to the accident, he was foreclosed from introducing evidence tending to contradict this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">In Bolam v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., 295 F.2d 809 (6th Cir. 1961), we recognized that there are situations in which a party will not be allowed to contradict his own testimony which defeats his right to a verdict. We noted there that this rule applies in Kentucky, the state of the trial court in the instant case. See Bell v. Harmon, Ky., 284 S.W.2d 812 (1955). We also stated, however, that the testimony involved in Bolam</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">\u201cwas not inadvertent, but was definite and unequivocal, stated several times on both direct and cross-examination, with no attempt made later to withdraw it, modify it, or explain it away.\u201d 295 F.2d at 812.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The Kentucky Court of Appeals held in Bell v. Harmon, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">\u201cThe rule should be applied with caution because of the variable nature of testimony and because of the ever-present possibility of honest mistake. A judicial admission of this kind should in essence contain the elements of waiver.\u201d 284 S.W.2d at 815.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The record shows that the following colloquy took place when Catlett was being questioned by McAllister\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-9\">\u201cQ. Was there a time when both of you were on the ladder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-10\">\u201cA. There was a time, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-11\">\u201cQ. Tell that to the jury and the Court, will you, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-12\">\u201cA. A. J. picked pears around on the lower limbs and he asked me, said, \u2018Ray, you think it will hurt if I get on the ladder,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Why, I don\u2019t think it will hurt if you get on the ladder.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-13\">\u201cQ. And did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-14\">\u201cA. He got on the ladder, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-15\">\u201cQ. How long did he remain on the ladder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-16\">\u201cA. Just a few minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-17\">\u201cQ. Then did he get down off the ladder ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-18\">\u201cA. I suppose he did, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\">When questioned by his own attorney shortly thereafter, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-20\">\u201cQ. Do you actually know where Mr. McAllister was at the time you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-21\">\u201cA. Well, all I know is when I picked him up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-22\">\u201cQ. All you know is you picked him up on the ground ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-23\">\u201cA. Near the base of the ladder; yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-24\">\u201cQ. And you hit his shoulder, I think you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-25\">\u201cA. Hit him right behind the shoulders, like, is where I hit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-26\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t see him or know where he was before you fell ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-27\">\u201cA. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-28\">The testimony of Catlett here was not of so unequivocal a nature that he should have been foreclosed from presenting evidence tending to show McAllister\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-29\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
