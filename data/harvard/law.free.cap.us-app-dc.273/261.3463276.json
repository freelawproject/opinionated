The taking of a vote thereon was requested. Thereafter, a majority of the judges of the Court in regular active service did not vote in favor of the suggestion. Upon consideration of the foregoing it is</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">ORDERED, by the Court <em>en banc, </em>that the suggestion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">A dissenting statement of Circuit Judge STARR, joined by Circuit Judges WILLIAMS, D.H. GINSBURG and SENTELLE, is attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Circuit Judge SILBERMAN did not participate in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">STARR, Circuit Judge, joined by WILLIAMS, D.H. GINSBURG, and SENTELLE, Circuit Judges, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>drawing upon Judge Williams\u2019 dissent, enumerates several points of error said to merit the attention of the full court. I write to emphasize two issues which clearly should command <em>en banc </em>attention. Those issues concern the \u201csubstantially justified\u201d inquiry and the requirement of allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-19\">Whether or not UCS \u201cprevailed\u201d in this litigation, it cannot be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees if the Government demonstrates that its position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, however, the panel majority abdicated its responsibility to undertake the prescribed legal analysis. Instead, the panel focused broadly on the court\u2019s rejection of NRC\u2019s position. This approach, in effect, collapses the analysis required under the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d prong of the test into the \u201cprevailing party\u201d analysis. This is troubling as a general proposition, but all the more so where, as here, telling indications abound in the merits opinion that the agency\u2019s position <em>was </em>substantially justified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-20\">But, even if the Government could not succeed in showing that its position was, in whole or in part, substantially justified, there remains for the panel the heretofore well-established duty to assess the extent of success achieved by UCS. Under the prescribed analysis, the court is obliged to weigh the relief the merits panel actually granted against the relief the challenger sought. If the challenger goes for a home run but succeeds only in hitting a single, the award of fees must reflect that less dramatic achievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In most regulatory cases, there is a range of possible outcomes. Thus, to have determined that UCS was a prevailing party simply cannot end the analysis. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[t]hat the plaintiff is a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 ... may say little about whether the expenditure of counsel\u2019s time was reasonable in relation to the success achieved.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Where the plaintiff advances a series of discrete claims, the court is to award fees only with respect to claims on which the plaintiff was successful. Where the lawsuit cannot be viewed as a series of separate claims, the court must instead \u201cfocus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435,103 S.Ct. at 1940. Thus, the Supreme Court has explicitly instructed that in assessing the amount of fees to be awarded, the court must ask: \u201c[D]id the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 103 S.Ct. at 1940.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If not, the court must make an allocation based on the level of success.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">To be sure, in laying down these criteria for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, the Court cautioned that \u201c[a] request for attorney\u2019s fees should not result in a second major litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941. But at the same time the Court warned that \u201cthe ... court should make clear that it has considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained.\u201d <em>Id. Specifically, a statement by the court of its reasons for rejecting an allocation is a critical process-check on the court\u2019s exercise of discretion. </em>And it is a vital function of this court sitting <em>en banc </em>to assure that the various panels through which this court performs its labors remain faithful to the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In this case, there is nothing to indicate that the panel has even considered the Government\u2019s claim that the award was excessive in light of the results achieved. Under these circumstances, the panel has failed to engage in the process required under Supreme Court precedent and the law of this circuit, namely a reasonable effort of allocation or an explanation of why allocation is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">To make the point even more clearly: the panel\u2019s disposition conflicts flatly with the action we took <em>en banc </em>in <em>Kennecott Corp. v. EPA, </em>804 F.2d 763 (D.C.Cir.1986) (rehearing by reconstituted panel). There, the original panel had approved in its entirety an attorneys\u2019 fees request by a challenger to agency regulations, even though some of the challenges fell far short of the realm of \u201csuccessful.\u201d By virtue of the panel\u2019s failure, the court <em>en banc </em>directed the panel to make an allocation or, in the alternative, to explain why the full amount was being awarded notwithstanding the failure of some of the challenger\u2019s arguments. It is that Kennecott-mandated course which, for reasons that remain unstated, the panel here has failed to follow. And now the full court blinks at the very violation that had moved it to act <em>en banc </em>in <em>Kennecott. </em>We thus have the singularly unacceptable situation of two panels succumbing to the identical procedural flaw, but with the more recent panel spared the chastening reminder of what settled law requires. This is arbitrariness and caprice, the very stuff of this court\u2019s day-to-day labors. The bar and the District Court are thus left with the implicit message that they should do as we say but not as we do.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">That this remarkable result stands uncorrected is, as best I can divine, attributable only to this court\u2019s reluctance to provide any case <em>en banc </em>review. I should have thought that <em>en banc </em>review, for all its burdens and discomfort, would at least remain in service for the purpose of assur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ing consistency in circuit law. For my part, this case should be treated in precisely the manner as <em>Kennecott, </em>and the panel directed either to engage in the allocation process or to provide an explanation why that process is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-14\">. In making that determination, the court must compare its ultimate disposition with the position the agency took before it. Where, as here, the case is primarily one of statutory interpretation, the \"focus is primarily on the legal merits of the government's arguments.\u201d <em>Cinciarelli v. Reagan, </em>729 F.2d 801, 805 (D.C.Cir.1984). The agency's position is \"substantially justified\" if its actions in the underlying litigation were based on an interpretation of the statute that \"is justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\" <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-17\">. Without purporting definitively to decide the point, I observe simply that the merits panel acknowledged that \"[w]e conceivably could read the terms of [the NRC\u2019s] rule to comply with the statutory scheme we have described above.\u201d <em>Union of Concerned Scientists v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Com'n, </em>824 F.2d 108, 119 (D.C.Cir.1987). Nevertheless, the court believed the \"vulnerability of the rule to ... impermissible interpretations\u201d warranted remand to the agency for further clarification. <em>Id. </em>Since the agency professed to agree with the interpretation of the statute that the court itself settled upon, its litigating posture in defending against the broader challenges advanced by UCS would seem eminently reasonable. <em>See </em>Respondent NRC\u2019s Opposition to Petitioner's Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses at 9 (filed Sept. 30, 1987) (\"the Court's overall opinion on the circumstances in which cost may be considered regarding adequate levels of safety was totally in accord ... with the way the Commission had always interpreted the rule\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b299-5\">. Although the Court in <em>Hensley </em>canvassed the criteria for the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 \u2014 a statute that, unlike EAJA, includes an explicit requirement that only \"reasonable\" fees are recoverable \u2014 the Court made clear that \u201d[t]he standards set forth in [its] opinion are generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a 'prevailing party.'\u201d 461 U.S. at 433 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. at 1939 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
