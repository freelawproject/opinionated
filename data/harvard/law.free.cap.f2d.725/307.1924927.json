Despite the code\u2019s phenomenal size and detail, courts must still contend with a particularly persistent and pesterous ambiguity. The problem lies not in separating the seed from the chaff, but in telling debt from equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Debt-equity questions commonly involve a corporation and its shareholders \u2014 the issue being whether monies advanced by the shareholder to the corporation constitute a loan or a contribution to capital. Because classification of such advances as either debt or equity can produce significant tax consequences, courts frequently have to go beyond the form and into the substance of the particular transaction. As a consequence, courts have developed a set of factors to which they look in resolving debt-equity controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Today we deal with a close cousin of the debt-equity ambiguity. This case poses the same, \u201cloan versus contribution to capital\u201d question present in the shareholder-corporation context. We must decide whether ad-vanees by one non-profit corporation to another separate, yet closely linked non-profit corporation constitute loans or contributions to capital. The government disagrees with the contributing corporation\u2019s characterization of the transaction as a loan and the corporation\u2019s deduction of the unrepaid advances as a bad debt. Fortunately, the precedent derived from debt-equity cases supplies an effective pesticide to eliminate ambiguity in the instant case. Taking guidance from past judicial solutions to debt-equity puzzles, we conclude that the advances in question constituted contributions to capital and not loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">Taxpayer, the Texas Farm Bureau (\u201cTFB\u201d) is a non-profit corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas. TFB\u2019s primary purpose is to provide goods and services, including educational benefits, political lobbying services, life and property insurance, and product marketing services, to people engaged or interested in agriculture. These services are generally provided through several TFB affiliates which TFB has established over the years. TFB generates funds for its operations through individual membership dues and management fees charged to its affiliates. This case involves transactions between TFB and one of its affiliates, Texas Agricultural Marketing Development Association (\u201cTAMDA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">Incorporated in 1961 pursuant to the Cooperative Marketing Act of the State of Texas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> TAMDA was created to furnish cooperative marketing services for its members who produce livestock and other agricultural goods. From its inception TAM-DA\u2019s board of directors has consisted of individuals holding corresponding offices on TFB\u2019s board. Membership in TFB constitutes a prerequisite for membership in TAMDA. Formed with no capital stock, TAMDA has relied on membership fees of $5.00 per member and advances from TFB to meet operating and organizational expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The advances from TFB were made pursuant to an April 26, 1961, agreement between TFB and TAMDA (\u201cthe agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement was signed on behalf of each party by J.H. West, president of both organizations. It- provided that TFB would supply all management and clerical services for TAMDA. In return, TAMDA agreed to reimburse TFB for expenditures made on TAMDA\u2019s behalf and to pay TFB a \u201creasonable management fee.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The following schedule sets out the yearly totals of TFB\u2019s advances to TAMDA:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Fiscal Year Ending October 31_ Amount Advanced by Texas Farm Bureau_ Cumulative Total</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">1961 $ 1,398.10 $ 1,398.10</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">1962 1,482.37 2,880.47</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">1963 3,133.97 6,014.44</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">1964 3,399.35 9,413.79</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">1965 6,461.77 15,875.56</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">1966 1,690.41 17,565.97</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">1967 65,128.85 82.694.82</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">1968 0 82.694.82</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">1969 80,000.00 162,694.82</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">1970 4,251.20 166,946.02</p>\n<p id=\"b421-24\">Promissory notes, bearing a 7 percent interest rate but with no fixed maturity dates, evidenced $50,000 of the 1967 advance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The notes are not part of the record, however, as they have been either lost or destroyed. The parties never established any fixed repayment schedule, and TAMDA never paid any interest on the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-26\">Other than the $50,000 advance in the 1967 fiscal year, none of the advances made to TAMDA were evidenced by a note, bond, or other obligation. Furthermore, the parties made no provision for payment of interest on any of this \u201cnonevidenced indebtedness.\u201d Except for the partial payment of a management fee assessment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a $3,000 payment made October 26, 1966, TAMDA made no payments towards the management fees or in repayment of advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-27\">TFB advanced TAMDA an additional $84,351.20 during the 1969 and 1970 fiscal years, despite a 1968 write off of $48,933.28 in management fees owed by TAMDA. Then, in its return for fiscal 1970, TFB deducted as an uncollectable bad debt $164,-118.13, representing unrepaid TAMDA advances made from 1961 through 1970. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>court action by TFB against TAMDA preceded the write-off. TAMDA never ceased to do business during the 1969-1970 period and was operating at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">On audit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied the bad debt deduction. Taking the position that the $164,118.13 in advances constituted contributions to capital that did not become wholly worthless in 1970, he concluded that the advances did not create a bona fide debt. Accordingly, the Commissioner assessed deficiencies. TFB paid the amounts assessed and, following denial of its refund claims, sued for a refund in district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">II. PROCEDURE BELOW AND ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The case was tried before a jury. At the close of TFB\u2019s case the government moved for a directed verdict. The government argued that because the parties\u2019 stipulations resolved any conflict regarding \u201coperative facts,\u201d the court should determine as a matter of law whether the advances constituted debt or contributions to capital. The court denied the motion. Subsequently, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the taxpayer, finding that the advances were loans, that TFB held a reasonable expectation of repayment when the advances were made, and that 98% of the debts became worthless in fiscal year 1970. The court denied a government motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">On appeal, the government argues that the trial court erred in submitting to the jury the issue of whether the advances constituted capital contributions or loans. Rather, as a question of law, the issue should have been decided by the court. In addition, the government contends that given the stipulated facts, the court erred in not holding the advances to be capital contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">As we noted above, the issues in this case closely correspond with those arising in common debt-equity cases \u2014 cases involving advances from a shareholder to a corporation. Loan transactions between a corporation and its shareholders require special scrutiny primarily because of the lender/shareholder\u2019s dual interest in the corporation. <em>See Tomlinson v. 1161 Corporation, </em>377 F.2d 291, 296 (5th Cir.1967). One manifestation of this dual interest is that, depending on how an advance is structured, the lender\u2019s ownership of stock may, in itself, effect a return of capital. Allowing the- lender to write off what is essentially an equity interest as a bad debt produces a deduction that corresponds with no real loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The advance in the case at bar, however, did not run from shareholder to corporation. Rather, TFB, one non-profit corporation made advances to TAMDA, a separate nonprofit corporation. Nevertheless, the circumstances here move us to draw an analogy to profit corporations and their shareholders. In this case, one of the parties seeks tax advantages through the same technique used by shareholders and profit corporations \u2014 proclaiming in words but not in deeds that money put into the corporation constitutes debt rather than capital contributions. TFB holds a substantial interest in TAMDA \u2014 one comparable to the interest of shareholders in a profit corporation. Specifically, TAMDA was formed to meet the needs of certain of TFB\u2019s members. Record, Vol. I, p. 229; Trial Transcript, p. 26. The same individuals sit on both boards of directors. TAMDA\u2019s members, the analogs of shareholders in a profit corporation, are a subgroup of TFB\u2019s members. To the extent that the TFB advances make up part of TAMDA\u2019s financial structure, and to the extent that TAMDA\u2019s members benefit financially from TAM-DA\u2019s success, a portion of TFB\u2019s member<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ship also benefits. Therefore TFB, functioning as an organizational proxy for its members, possesses an interest in TAMDA very similar to an equity or shareholder interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Given such an interest, the transaction at issue demands the kind of scrutiny regularly given debt-equity controversies. In resolving such controversies courts have looked to the circumstances surrounding the purported loan transaction. Attempts to make this process more rational and consistent have produced a list of specific factors commonly relevant to debt-equity determinations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">(1) the names given to the certificates evidencing the indebtedness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">(2) the presence or absence of a fixed maturity date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">(3) the source of payments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">(4) the right to enforce payment of principal and interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">(5) participation in management flowing as a result;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">(6) the status of the contribution in relation to regular corporate creditors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">(7) the intent of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-13\">(8) \u201cthin\u201d or adequate capitalization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-14\">(9) identity of interest between creditor and stockholder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-15\">(10) source of interest payments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-16\">(11) the ability of the corporation to obtain loans from outside lending institutions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-19\">(12) the extent to which the advance was used to acquire capital assets; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-20\">(13) the failure of the debtor to repay on the due date or to seek a postponement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-21\"><em>Estate of Mixon v. United States, supra, </em>464 F.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-22\">Many of these factors are relevant in this case. Rather than being tailored only to contrast debt with equity in profit corporations, most of the factors focus on the definition of debt under the tax code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They transcend the differences between a shareholder\u2019s equity interest and TFB\u2019s interest in TAMDA. While we exclude consideration of certain factors in this case because of the particulars of the transaction, such would be the procedure in most debt-equity cases. Even with respect to traditional debt-equity cases, consideration of the factors requires not a simple counting process, but an evaluation. <em>Tyler v. Tomlinson, supra, </em>414 F.2d at 848, <em>Slappey Drive Ind. Park v. United States, supra, </em>561 F.2d at 581. Depending on the particular facts of a case, different factors come to the fore. <em>Slappey, </em>561 F.2d 'at 581; <em>Curry </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>396 F.2d at 633-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-23\">A. <em>Debt or Capital Contribution </em>\u2014 a <em>Question of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-24\">Courts generally bear responsibility for applying debt-equity factors; characteriza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tion of an advance as either debt or contribution to capital presents primarily a question of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Estate of Mixon v. United States, supra, </em>464 F.2d at 402; see also <em>Slappey Drive Industrial Park, supra, </em>561 F.2d at 582, n. 17; <em>Tyler v. Tomlinson, </em>414 F.2d at 850. We perceive no reason to deviate from this general rule under the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The only exception to debt-capital contribution determination as a matter of law arises when a court must rely on the parties\u2019 subjective intent, factor number seven. Issues of intent pose questions of \u201cpure fact.\u201d <em>Byram v. United States, </em>705 F.2d 1418 (5th Cir.1983); see also <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). But, reliance on subjective intent and the submission of the debt-capital contribution question to a jury becomes necessary only when a court\u2019s analysis of other, objective factors fails to provide clear signals. The <em>Mixon </em>court stated that where \u201cthe objective facts of the case are ambiguous and do not result in a clear manifestation of objective intent, then subjective intent is relevant on the issue.\u201d <em>Mixon, supra, </em>464 F.2d at 407. The court, though, in <em>Tyler v. Tomlinson, supra, </em>414 F.2d 844, pointed out that reliance on subjective intent should indeed be the exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">Tax law requires that creditorship have genuine existentiality (citation omitted). This requires more than a declaration of intention to create an indebtedness and more than the existence of corporate paper encrusted with the appropriate nomenclature captions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">If appellants mean to say that a mere showing of an intent to create an indebtedness and the existence of something called \u201cnotes\u201d is sufficient to take their case to the jury, we must disagree. If that were true, every debt-equity case would require a jury verdict no matter how transparent the attempt at tax avoidance. We, therefore, look not to mere labels or to the self-serving declarations of the parties, but to the more reliable criteria of the circumstances surrounding the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">414 F.2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">TFB argues that the instant case falls within the exception where consideration of subjective intent is necessary. Maintaining that the facts stipulated to in the trial court left substantial ambiguity as to the import of the relevant, objective, debt-equity factors, TFB argues that the issue of intent was properly submitted to the jury. Determination of this first issue, therefore, requires an analysis of the relevant, objective factors surrounding TFB\u2019s advances to TAMDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">B. <em>Debt or Capital Contribution </em>\u2014 the <em>Objective Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Turning to that analysis, we note that three factors point weakly towards debt. Factor one, the names given to the certificates evidencing the indebtedness, suggests debt with respect to $50,000 of the advances. \u201cNotes\u201d evidenced that amount of the $166,946.02 total.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This indicator has little force, however. After the original notes were either lost or destroyed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the parties never issued new notes to replace them. In addition, of the twelve \u201cobjective\u201d <em>Mixon </em>factors, factor one has the largest subjective content. The parties\u2019 decision to call the certificates \u201cnotes\u201d sheds little light on the transaction\u2019s real substance. In any case, to the limited extent that factor one indicates debt, we find other factors overriding.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Factor nine, identity of interest between creditor and shareholder, also weighs lightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>in the instant analysis. It applies specifically to the situation where shareholders have advanced funds to their corporation. The focus is on whether a contributing shareholder owns the same proportion of the company\u2019s stock as he does of the purported debt. If \u201cproportionality\u201d exists, how the contributor breaks down the advance between debt and equity will not affect control of the company. <em>See Slappey Drive Ind. Park </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>561 F.2d at 583. In such circumstances tax considerations may well be the primary force in the contributor\u2019s characterization of the transaction. Strictly speaking, the factor does not apply to the case at bar, one involving an advance between two nonprofit corporations. The underlying notion of identity of interest does have relevance, however. A complete identity of interests would exist between TFB as creditor and TFB as representative of TAMDA\u2019s members if the two organizations had identical memberships. Because TAMDA\u2019s members comprise only a subgroup of TFB\u2019s members, symmetry of interests is incomplete. The factor thus cuts somewhat in favor of a finding of debt. But, even its limited significance fades in the light of the other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Next we observe that the agreement between TFB and TAMDA established a fixed due date for repayment of the advances. Again, however, the circumstances of this case negate this factor\u2019s importance. Although the agreement between TAMDA and TFB required repayment of the advances within 30 days of the close of each year, that provision was a dead letter. TFB advanced money to TAMDA year after year, despite TAMDA\u2019s failure to comply with the repayment provision. Moreover, the very limited outside financial resources of TFB,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> coupled with the complete identity between the two organizations\u2019 board of directors, makes illusory the notes\u2019 payment on demand provisions. <em>See Tyler v. Tomlinson, supra, </em>414 F.2d at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Turning to the remaining, relevant factors,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we find that they unwaveringly indicate that the advances were not debt. TAMDA\u2019s dependence on its earnings to repay TFB\u2019s advances is one illustration. The only documented nonearnings source for repayment of TFB lay in dues paid by TAMDA members. But, given a yearly dues income of only $3,000,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> TAMDA would have to look elsewhere to repay TFB \u2014i.e., to the commissions it charged for marketing services. Record Vol. I, p. 104. The dependence on membership dues also raises the factor of inadequate capitalization. With such limited resources, TAMDA could hardly have been more thinly capitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">TFB\u2019s \u201cright to enforce payment of principal and interest\u201d was only a mirage. The agreement signed at TAMDA\u2019s inception gave TFB a contractual right to repayment. In actuality, however, repayment fell within TAMDA/TFB management discretion. The complete overlap in the boards of TFB and its affiliate precluded any arms-length relationship \u2014 any realistic expectation that a demand for payment would be made or legal enforcement actions would be taken. TFB stipulated in the trial court that it never took \u201cformal collection actions\u201d against TAMDA despite TAMDA\u2019s repeated failures to meet the annual due dates. Record, Vol. I, p. 104. In addition, the advances were <em>de facto </em>subordinated to TAMDA\u2019s corporate debt. TAMDA failed to meet its obligations to TFB while still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>meeting all of its obligations to other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">TAMDA\u2019s <em>use </em>of the advances also leads us to conclude that they were not debt. TAMDA spent the advances on basic operating costs such as rent, supplies, travel, etc. While the advances were not used to obtain capital assets, the organization wholly depended on the advances to begin functioning. Purchase of such \u201cnecessary first assets\u201d points us away from a finding of debt. <em>Slappey Drive Industrial Park, supra, </em>561 F.2d at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">A particularly important indicator in distinguishing debt from capital contributions focuses on interest payments. As this court stated in <em>Curry v. United States, supra, </em>396 F.2d 634, \u201ca true lender is concerned with interest.\u201d In this case, the agreement under which TFB advanced $114,118.13 did not call for payment of interest. Even with respect to the interest-bearing $50,000 notes, TAMDA never made a single interest payment. Failure to insist on interest payments clearly demonstrates that TFB was not concerned with interest income. Rather like an equity holder, TFB cared more about the continued operation and growth of TAMDA. <em>See id.; Estate of Mixon v. United States, supra, </em>464 F.2d at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\"><em>Slappey Drive, supra, </em>articulated the essential difference separating lenders and holders of an equity interest: \u201cshareholders place their money \u2018at the risk of the business\u2019 while lenders seek a more reliable return.\u201d 561 F.2d at 581, <em>see also Midland Distributors, Inc. v. United States, </em>481 F.2d 730, 733 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Dillin v. United States, supra, </em>433 F.2d at 1103. Self-serving assertions that payment was expected cannot be substituted for some concrete demonstration of the actual existence of such expectations. We have analyzed the laundry list of objective factors relevant to whether the relationship at issue was one of a debtor and creditor. We can find no maimed creditor. The absence of fixed, realistic dates for repayment, the failure to provide for meaningful enforcement mechanisms, the dependence of TAMDA upon its earnings to repay the advances, the <em>de facto </em>subordination of the TFB debt to other debt, the use of the advances for initial operating expenses, and the lack of emphasis on interest cut strongly against the notion that the advances were debt. Analysis of these factors shows us the true and unambiguous nature of TFB\u2019s advances to its affiliate. TFB hoped to profit by its relationship with TAMDA and furnished the capital to keep it going. No other scenario can be reeled out. The district court erred in not finding that the advances were, as a matter of law, contributions to capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The problem of distinguishing debt from capital contributions has been with us and will likely remain with us for a long time. Primary reliance upon subjective indications of intent is simply not an effective way of resolving that problem. In a land of hard economic facts, we cannot root important decisions in parties\u2019 pious declarations of intent. Awarding the government its rightful harvest, we hold that TFB\u2019s advances to TAMDA were not loans and therefore were not deductible as bad debts. The ruling of the district court is,</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-12\">. Currently codified at Tex.Agric.Code Ann. \u00a7 52.001 et seq.

The $65,128.85 advanced during the 1967 fiscal year included $50,000 furnished to establish a custodial account, as required by the United States Packers and Stockyard Act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181-229.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b421-36\">. <em>See supra, </em>n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. The suit seeks a refund for the years 1967, 1868 and 1970. Although I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(5) exempts TFB from the regular corporate income tax, the organization remains subject to tax on unrelated business income under I.R.C. \u00a7 511. TFB\u2019s bad debt deductions eliminated its 1970 unrelated business income liability and generated net operating loss carrybacks to 1967 and 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b423-17\">.

Generally, these criteria are designed to disclose the real nature of the transaction in question \u2014 that is whether it exhibits the characteristics of a bona-fide loan to the corporation which is expected, indeed, may be compelled, to be repaid in full at some future date, or whether as a formalized attempt to achieve the desired tax result while lacking in necessary substances, it merely parades under the false colors of such a transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-26\">377 F.2d at 295.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">.

Two of the <em>Mixon </em>factors have no bearing on the instant case. Factor five, whether' the source of the advances took an increased management role in the recipient, cuts neither way because of the complete identity among management personnel in TAMDA and TFB. No increase in management role was possible for TFB. Ability to obtain loans from outside lending institutions, factor eleven, provides no help either. Unless TFB or its individual members guaranteed the debt, TAMDA never attempted to secure credit from outside sources.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\">.
