Pursuant to the Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission revoked his registration because of his convictions. He has nevertheless continued to publish and sell newsletters containing investment advice, in violation of the Act\u2019s requirement of registration. The interesting, if not altogether unique, question presented by this case is whether the publication of such advice is protected by the First Amendment so as to preclude the SEC from seeking to enjoin its continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">Christopher L. Lowe is the president of the three corporate entities involved in this case: Lowe Management Corp., Lowe Publishing Corp., and Lowe Stock Chart Service, Inc. Between March, 1974, and May, 1981, Lowe Management was registered with the SEC as an investment adviser pursuant to Section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-3(c) (1976). As such it published investment advice and managed and had custody of the funds of its clients on a discretionary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">In 1977, Lowe was convicted of two New York misdemeanors relating to his investment advisory business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He pleaded guilty to making false representations to a client that $2,200 had been invested for his benefit and a 27% return earned, when in fact Lowe had misappropriated the funds for his own use. He also pleaded guilty to failing to register in New York State as an investment advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-18\">In 1978 Lowe was convicted of two New York felonies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He pleaded guilty to tampering with physical evidence, involving the alteration of a copy of a $10 money order to have it appear to be for the amount of $10,000. In addition, he pleaded guilty to third degree larceny for fraudulently drawing checks on an account to which worthless checks had been deposited. For these convictions Lowe received a prison sentence and was ordered to make restitution to the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-19\">As a result of these convictions the SEC instituted administrative proceedings under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-3(e) &amp; (f) (1976), against Lowe and Lowe Management. The Commission found that Lowe had aided and abetted willful violations of the antifraud provisions of the Act, violated the reporting provisions of the Act, and failed to amend Lowe Management\u2019s investment advisory registration form to report the convictions which related to his conduct as an investment adviser. In assessing sanctions the Commission found that Lowe\u2019s conduct \u201ccould hardly be more serious[,] ... reflecting] a callous disregard\u201d for the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>fiduciary standards required of an investment adviser, and that the criminal conduct \u201cclearly demonstrate!/!] his total lack of fitness to remain in \u2018an occupation which can cause havoc unless engaged in by those with appropriate background standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Lowe Management Corp., </em>SEC Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 759 (May 11, 1981) (quoting <em>Marketlines, Inc. v. SEC, </em>384 F.2d 264, 267 (2d Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 947, 88 S.Ct. 1033, 19 L.Ed.2d 1137 (1968)). The Commission rejected the argument that sanctions were unnecessary because Lowe and his advisory corporation no longer handled clients\u2019 funds or securities, but only provided investment advice by publication. Noting that even these activities \u201cafford numerous \u2018opportunities for dishonesty and self-dealing,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 5, the Commission revoked the registration of Lowe Management as an investment adviser and barred Lowe from association with any investment adviser. Lowe did not seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Lowe\u2019s criminal activities did not end here, however. In 1982 he pleaded guilty to two charges under New Jersey law of theft by deception in the third degree,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for fraudulently misrepresenting that checks drawn on his personal and one of Lowe Publishing\u2019s accounts were good and negotiable. For these activities he was sentenced to a three-year prison term and probation, and ordered to make restitution of over $27,000 to the defrauded banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Despite the Commission\u2019s order of May 11, 1981, revoking Lowe\u2019s registration as an investment adviser and barring him from association with any investment adviser, Lowe has published and distributed two investment advisory services, the <em>Lowe Investment and Financial Letter </em>and the <em>Lowe Stock Advisory, </em>and solicited subscriptions for a third one, the <em>Lowe Stock Chart Service. </em>He is president, research chairman, and editor of all three services, and his corporations, Lowe Management, Lowe Publishing, and Lowe Service were the publishers of the newsletters. In addition, Lowe has offered a recorded telephone \u201chot-line\u201d service to subscribers of six months or more. Despite these activities, he has not applied to register either himself or any of the corporations as an investment adviser.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">The <em>Lowe Letter </em>has had from 3,000 to 19,000 clients, with an average of about 5,000. Subscriptions cost $39 for one year or $79 for three years. A typical <em>Lowe Investment and Financial Letter </em>gives a short-term and long-term forecast. It offers advice on the relative desirability of investing in, among other things, stocks, Treasury bills, and money market funds, and describes rather generally the state of the market. It recommends particular stocks and groups of stocks for purchase or sale, discusses precious metals, and announces special reports and the telephone hot-line service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">The <em>Lowe Stock Advisory </em>has only a few hundred subscribers and a number of readers who receive complimentary subscriptions. Subscriptions cost the same as do those to the <em>Lowe Investment and Financial Letter. </em>The <em>Stock Advisory </em>is typically somewhat more specific, however, with a brief introductory examination of general market trends followed by specific purchase, sale, and hold recommendations, particularly for low-priced stocks. The <em>Lowe Stock Chart Service </em>has solicited subscriptions, but has never been published.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">No contention is made that any of the information published in the advisory services has been false or materially misleading. Nor is it alleged that Lowe himself, unlike the investment adviser in <em>SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., </em>375 U.S. 180, 84 S.Ct. 275, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963), has profited through personal or corporate investments from the investment advice rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">THE DECISION OF THE DISTRICT COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Jack B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Weinstein, Chief Judge, believed that the Investment Advisers Act could not be construed to permit the SEC to revoke Lowe\u2019s registration as an investment adviser, and thus to bar him from publishing his newsletters, without violating the First Amendment. The court first analyzed the case on the assumption that the Lowe publications constituted commercial speech and thus were not entitled to the full protection of the First Amendment. <em>See In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 200-01, 102 S.Ct. 929, 935-986, 71 L.Ed.2d 64 (1982) (advertising by lawyers). It found, nevertheless, that \u201cthe censorship that the SEC would impose on Lowe is more extreme than necessary to effectuate the congressional goal of a confident and informed investing public,\u201d and amounted to an unconstitutional prior restraint on the basis of \u201cspeculative assessments.\u201d In reaching this conclusion the court apparently thought that the fact of Lowe\u2019s past misconduct was not in itself enough to make his future speech \u201cpotentially misleading\u201d and consequently subject to restraint. <em>See Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 557, 563-64, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 2350, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The court went on to suggest, however, that the case actually fell \u201coutside the rubric of commercial speech.\u201d Although recognizing that the Supreme Court had never explicitly so held, Judge Weinstein stated that commercial speech consisted only of advertising, citing <em>Ad World, Inc. v. Township of Doylestown, </em>672 F.2d 1136, 1140 (3d Cir.1982) (citing <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, </em>413 U.S. 376, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973)), <em>cert. denied, 456 </em>U.S. 975, 102 S.Ct. 2240, 72 L.Ed.2d 850 (1982). As a result, he believed that Lowe\u2019s newsletters were fully protected by the First Amendment, and that their \u201ccombination of fact, economic and political analyses, conjecture, and recommendation characteristic of investment newsletters ... raises unanswered questions concerning the conditions, if any, under which an absolute restraint may constitutionally be imposed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Rather than rule the Act unconstitutional, however, the district court construed the Act\u2019s definition of an \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d so as to avoid possible infringement on freedom of the press. It did so by distinguishing personal or \u201cperson-to-person\u201d advice from \u201cimpersonal\u201d investment advice given in publications. The court evidently reasoned that \u201cstrong sanctions in the way of prior restraints\u201d may be invoked against persons providing \u201cpersonal\u201d investment advice since that activity involves \u201cdelegations of trust and responsibility,\u201d but may not be invoked when the investment advice is provided by publication or writing. Accordingly, the court entered a limited injunction enjoining defendants from rendering personal investment advice \u201cby telephone, individual letter or in person.\u201d As to \u201cimpersonal\u201d advice, the court believed that disclosure, rather than denial or revocation of registration, was the only constitutionally permissible means of protecting the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">In effect the court construed the Act so as to deny the SEC the authority to revoke a publisher\u2019s registration solely on the basis of past misconduct. Under this interpretation, a person whose registration is otherwise revoked may nevertheless remain registered as an investment adviser for the limited purpose of publishing so long as the publication is done \u201cimpersonally.\u201d A letter to several people rather than to an individual is thus differentiated. Somewhat inconsistently, perhaps, the district court treated Lowe\u2019s recorded hot-line telephone message as rendering \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than \u201cimpersonal\u201d advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">We do not believe that the Investment Advisers Act may be rewritten as the district court would rewrite it. The Act does not distinguish between \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cimpersonal\u201d advice, but rather between publications or writings \u201cas to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities,\u201d on the one hand, and \u201cbona fide newspapers], news magazine[s], or business or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>financial publication^] of general and regular circulation,\u201d on the other. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(ll) (1976). The SEC quite properly determined that the Lowe advisory letters and services were the former, and that Lowe and his corporations were \u201cengag[ing] in the business of advising others, either directly or through [such] publications or writings.... \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The statute specifically grants the SEC the power to revoke the registration of any investment adviser convicted of certain crimes, among these the crimes for which Lowe was convicted. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-3(e)(2). Accordingly, we believe that the SEC was well within its statutory authority when it revoked Lowe\u2019s registration. Unlike the district court, we do not believe that this statutory authority violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">\n<em>The Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was \u201cthe last in a series of Acts designed to eliminate certain abuses in the securities industry, abuses which were found to have contributed to the stock market crash of 1929 and the Depression of the 1930\u2019s.\u201d <em>SEC v. Capital Gains Bureau, </em>375 U.S. 180, 186, 84 S.Ct. 275, 280, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963). The Act was the result of a study undertaken by the SEC at the direction of Congress to investigate \u201cthe functions and activities of investment trusts and investment companies.... \u201d Section 30 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79z-4 (1976). The SEC submitted to Congress a memorandum questioning \u201cthe good faith of some of the less reputable of these generalized investment services.\u201d Hearings on S. 3580 Before a Subcommittee of a Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 47 (1940) at 1008. It emphasized the potential for abuse if persons in the business of publishing investment advice were willing to \u201clend[] themselves to the use of stock market promoters and manipulators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Twentieth Century Fund, Inc., The Security Markets </em>692 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">On the basis of the SEC\u2019s report and other information before it, Congress found that investment advisers were \u201cof national concern\u201d and that \u201ctheir advice, counsel, <em>publications, writings, analyses, and reports . .. </em>occur in such volume as substantially to affect interstate commerce, national securities exchanges, and other securities markets, the national banking system and the national economy.\u201d Section 201 of the Investment Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-l (emphasis added). In so finding, Congress hearkened back to Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, in which it prohibited the publication of any letter or investment service which describes a security without disclosing that the publisher has been compensated for such publicity, and to concerns expressed in the Senate Report accompanying the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(b) (1976) and S.Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">The Investment Advisers Act makes it unlawful for an unregistered investment adviser to make use of the mails or any means of interstate commerce in connection with his or its business as an investment adviser. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-3(a). The Act defines \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d broadly to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-12\">any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others, either directly <em>or through publications or writings, </em>as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, or who, for compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or <em>promulgates </em>analyses or reports containing securities....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(11) (emphasis added). The section exempts from the definition of an investment adviser \u201cthe publisher of any bona fide newspaper, news magazine or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 203 provides for registration of investment advisers and gives the SEC powers of censure, denial, or suspension of registration. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-3(e). The SEC can censure an investment adviser, or suspend or revoke his registration if the adviser or any person associated with him has been convicted within ten years of certain felonies or mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>demeanors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The SEC invoked this statutory scheme to revoke the registration of Lowe Management and bar Christopher Lowe from publishing investment advice or associating with an investment adviser.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">\n<em>The Act\u2019s Application to the Lowe Newsletters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The first step in our analysis of this case is determining whether Lowe\u2019s newsletters are within the statutory definition of investment adviser and thus subject to the registration requirement, or whether they are \u201cbona fide newspapers\u201d and thus exempt from the requirement. The leading case construing the exclusion for bona fide newspapers is this circuit\u2019s <em>SEC v. Wall Street Transcript Corp., </em>422 F.2d 1371 (2d Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 958, 90 S.Ct. 2170, 26 L.Ed.2d 542 (1970). The <em>Wall Street Transcript was </em>a weekly tabloid which sold for $5 an issue or $180 per year. The <em>Transcript </em>consisted primarily of reports on specific securities, each of which was identified with the name and address of a broker/dealer firm. It also printed some management speeches, miscellaneous personnel announcements, editorials, and advertisements. This court held that the <em>Transcript </em>was not per se a \u201cbona fide newspaper\u201d or \u201cfinancial publication of general and regular circulation\u201d so as to be excluded from the definition of investment adviser. It stated that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018bona fide\u2019 newspaper ... means those publications which do not deviate from customary newspaper activities to such an extent that there is a likelihood that the wrongdoing which the Act was designed to prevent has occurred.\u201d 422 F.2d at 1377. Rather than looking to the purely formal \u201cindicia\u201d of a newspaper, the court examined the substance and content of the publication and found that \u201c[m]ost of its published material consists of reprinted reports assessing various securities issues.\u201d 422 F.2d at 1378. It held that \u201c[t]his characteristic emphasis on particular issues and companies at the very least raises doubt about whether the <em>Transcript </em>is outside the exclusion \u2014 a suspicion which we believe that the S.E.C. should be allowed to investigate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">The <em>Wall Street Transcript </em>presented a much closer case for. exclusion under the Act than does the <em>Lowe Investment and Financial Letter </em>or the <em>Lowe Stock Advisory. </em>Lowe\u2019s newsletters quite clearly are \u201cengagefd] in the business of advising others ... as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities .... \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(11). Under the test of <em>Wall Street Transcript, </em>it is equally clear that Lowe\u2019s publications are not engaged primarily in \u201ccustomary newspaper activities,\u201d but rather in the activities that the Investment Adviser Act is intended to regulate. Thus, we hold that the SEC properly determined the registration requirements of the Act to be applicable to Lowe\u2019s newsletters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">\n<em>First Amendment Concerns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\"><em>Wall Street Transcript </em>held that the Investment Advisers Act does not on its face abridge freedom of the press. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-14\">it is not necessary to enlarge the category of \u201cbona fide\u201d newspapers into an exclusion for all publications which could conceivably be brought within the term \u201ctypical newspaper\u201d in order to avoid the \u201cseeds of a constitutional controversy\u201d which the appellee argues would result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>from an attempt to regulate the conduct of any newspaper publisher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">422 F.2d at 1378-79. Nor did the court believe that it had \u201cto base a construction of the Act on the assumption that the activities involved in giving commercial investment advice are entitled to the identical constitutional protection provided for certain forms of social, political or religious expression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1379. Instead, the court reasoned that it need only delineate \u201ca boundary between the special type of \u2018merchandising\u2019 activities which must lead to registration and the publication of expression which lies beyond the Act\u2019s regulatory purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reaching this conclusion, the court cited comments by Justice Harlan in <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967). <em>See </em>422 F.2d at 1379. In that case, Justice Harlan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-6\">A business \u201cis not immune from regulation because it is an agency of the press. The publisher of a newspaper has no special immunity from the application of general laws .... \u201d Federal securities regulation, mail fraud statutes, and common-law actions for deceit and misrepresentation are only some examples of our understanding that the right to communicate information of public interest is not \u201cunconditional.\u201d (Citations and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">388 U.S. 130, 150, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1989, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967). Accordingly, the court held that the registration provisions of the Investment Advisers Act did not violate the First Amendment. 422 F.2d at 1379-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The appellees argue that <em>Wall Street Transcript </em>is inapplicable to this case because it was decided prior to <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976). In <em>Virginia Pharmacy, </em>the Court invalidated a Virginia statute prohibiting pharmacists from advertising their prices, pointing out that the right to distribute and receive information affecting decisions to buy and sell must be protected in a free society. \u201c[T]he free flow of commercial information is indispensable ... to the proper allocation of resources in a free enterprise system ... [and] to the formation of intelligent opinions as to how that system ought to be regulated or altered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765, 96 S.Ct. at 1827. <em>See also Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 557, 562, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 2349, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980) (rejecting \u201cthe \u2018highly paternalistic\u2019 view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech\u201d), and <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U.S. 350, 383, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2708-2709, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977) (advertising by attorneys not subject to \u201cblanket suppression,\u201d though false, deceptive, or misleading advertising may be suppressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">We believe that <em>Wall Street Transcript </em>still states good law. Indeed, the Supreme Court has affirmed its essential rationale since its decision in <em>Virginia Pharmacy. </em>In <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, </em>for example, the Court stated that government \u201cdoes not lose its power to regulate <em>commercial activity </em>deemed harmful to the public whenever speech is a component of that activity.\u201d 436 U.S. 447, 456, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1919, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978) (emphasis added). The Court noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a5i-dedup-0\">[n]umerous examples ... of communication that are regulated without offending the First Amendment, such as the exchange of information about securities, <em>SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., </em>401 F.2d 833 (CA2 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 976 [89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756] (1969), corporate proxy statements, <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375 [90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593] (1970), the exchange of price and production information among competitors, <em>American Column &amp; Lumber Co. v.

FTC, </em>598 F.2d 1244, 1252 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 980, 100 S.Ct. 481, 62 L.Ed.2d 406 (1979); and Note, <em>Peaceful Labor Picketing and the First Amendment, </em>82 Colum.L.Rev. 1469, 1484-88 (1982). Thus, considered in light of <em>Virginia Pharmacy </em>and its progeny, we believe that the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act at issue here are precisely the kind of regulation of commercial activity permissible under the First Amendment. Accordingly, we believe that the holding of <em>Wall Street Transcript </em>controls this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">We find additional support for our conclusion in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Savage v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, </em>548 F.2d 192 (7th Cir.1977) (opinion by Moore, J., of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation). Decided after Virginia <em>Pharmacy, Savage </em>nevertheless hewed to the <em>Curtis Publishing Co./Wall Street Transcript </em>viewpoint that a business is not immune from regulation merely because it is an agency of the press. <em>Id. </em>at 197. On facts closely analogous to those presented by this case, the court held that the publisher of the <em>Commodity Exchange Bulletin, </em>a newsletter containing views on the commodity market, was not entitled to registration under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act as a commodity trading adviser in view of his previous convictions for securities fraud and mail fraud arising out of the operations of a securities company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The appellees would distinguish <em>Savage </em>on the basis that there the publisher erroneously argued that his commodities newsletter had only the limited protection of commercial speech. They contend that <em>Savage </em>was decided before the Supreme Court \u201cclearly indicated\u201d in <em>Central Hudson Gas </em>that commercial speech refers only to commercial advertising. They argue that under <em>Central Hudson Gas </em>\u201ccommercial speech\u201d includes only direct product or service advertising and a seller\u2019s indirect or informational advertising. Since Lowe and his companies \u201cdo not sell investments [but] report and comment on the investments offered by others,\u201d the argument runs, newsletters are not commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">In our view, this argument is unconvincing. Unlike the Third Circuit in <em>Ad World, Inc. v. Township of Doylestown, </em>672 F.2d 1136 (3rd Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 975, 102 S.Ct. 2240, 72 L.Ed.2d 850 (1982), and the court below, we do not believe that the Supreme Court has limited commercial speech solely to product or service advertising. In <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>the Court said that \u201c[i]f commercial speech is to be distinguished, \u2018it must be distinguished by its content,\u2019 \u201d not its form, 433 U.S. 350, 363, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2699, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977) (quoting <em>Virginia Pharmacy, </em>425 U.S. at 761, 96 S.Ct. at 1825). Although <em>Central Hudson Gas </em>stated that \u201c[t]he First Amendment\u2019s concern for commercial speech is based on the informational function of advertising,\u201d 447 U.S. at 563, 100 S.Ct. at 2350, the Court did not define commercial speech in these terms. Rather it defined commercial speech as \u201cexpression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 100 S.Ct. at 2349. Similarly, in <em>Friedman v. Rogers, </em>the Court stated \u201c[b]y definition, commercial speech is linked inextricably to commercial activity .... \u201d 440 U.S. 1, 10 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. 887, 894 n. 9, 59 L.Ed.2d 100 (1979). <em>Cf. Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, n. 14, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 2880-2881, n. 14, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983) (expressing \u201cno opinion as to whether reference to any particular product or service is a necessary element of commercial speech\u201d). These definitions do not limit commercial speech to advertising and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>broad enough to encompass Lowe\u2019s publications. Thus, although we think it preferable to analyze this case as one involving the permissible regulation of economic activity, we believe that the Investment Advisers Act withstands constitutional scrutiny under First Amendment doctrine relating to commercial speech as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Lowe and his companies argue that in view of the fact that the Commission has never challenged any of the substantive material contained in any of their publications, it may not \u201crely on the mere possibility of future deception as a ground for the outright prohibition of the publications even under a commercial speech analysis.\u201d In essence, they charge the SEC with impermissible prior restraint. Whether we approach this case emphasizing its aspect of the regulation of a profession or view its principal thrust as pertaining to commercial speech, this argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Before the SEC may revoke an adviser\u2019s registration, the Investment Advisers Act requires a finding of misconduct reflecting adversely on the honesty of the adviser, an essential attribute of a person entrusted to deal with intangible products which have numerous, intricate facets as securities do. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-3(e)(2). The appellees rely on such cases as <em>Natco Theaters, Inc. v. Ratner, </em>463 F.Supp. 1124 (S.D.N.Y.1979), in arguing that a finding of past misconduct may not serve as the basis for revoking an investment adviser\u2019s license. But the regulation of advisory publishers is properly compared, we believe, not to the licensing of theater operators, but rather to the licensing of professionals. <em>See, e.g., Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, </em>436 U.S. at 460, 98 S.Ct. at 1920-1921; <em>Watson v. Maryland, </em>218 U.S. 173, 177-78, 30 S.Ct. 644, 646-647, 54 L.Ed. 987 (1910); <em>Dent v. West Virginia, </em>129 U.S. 114, 121-23, 9 S.Ct. 231, 233-234, 32 L.Ed. 623 (1889). The denial of a professional license for criminal conduct has been a traditional, and perhaps necessary, aspect of this type of regulation. <em>Barsky v. Board of Regents, </em>347 U.S. 442, 451, 74 S.Ct. 650, 655, 98 L.Ed. 829 (1954); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>606 F.2d 1226, 1239 n. 51 (D.C.Cir.1979). Thus, we believe that the SEC may bar Lowe from the profession of investment adviser because of his past criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">That commercial speech is involved leads to no different result. In <em>Friedman v. Rogers, </em>the Supreme Court found it irrelevant that the use of a trade name was \u201cnot in fact misleading\u201d since it was a type of speech which \u201cenhances the opportunity for misleading practices.\u201d 440 U.S. at 15, 99 S.Ct. at 897. As this court noted in <em>Jay Norris, Inc. v. FTC, </em>\u201c[t]he prohibition in <em>Friedman </em>was a total ban on a business practice or form of advertising because of the <em>potential </em>for deception .... \u201d 598 F.2d at 1252 (emphasis added). Just as the potential for deception may justify the regulation of a profession, <em>see, e.g., Ohralik, </em>436 U.S. at 461-62, 98 S.Ct. at 1921-1922, so, too, the potential for deception permits government to ban potentially deceptive commercial speech. <em>See Friedman, </em>440 U.S. at 15, 99 S.Ct. at 897; <em>Central Hudson Gas, </em>447 U.S. at 563-64, 100 S.Ct. at 2350. In light of Lowe\u2019s history of deceptive, criminal conduct as an investment adviser, his publications may fairly be characterized as potentially deceptive commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">The appellees would have the SEC wait until Lowe had committed further violations of the securities laws and then somehow punish him while apparently permitting him to continue publishing. Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>remedy would hardly be effective redress for the affected public. The regulation of professions is intended to prevent harm to the public before it occurs, not after it is done. Saying that appellees may not sell their views as to the purchase, sale, or holding of certain securities is no different from saying that a disbarred lawyer may not sell legal advice. Thus, we hold that the authority to revoke Lowe\u2019s registration as an investment adviser, and as a result to bar him from publishing his newsletters, does not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Finally, we note what this holding does not entail. Lowe is not prohibited from publishing or stating his views as to any matter of current interest, economic or otherwise, such as the likelihood of war, the trend in interest rates, whether the next election will affect market conditions, or whether future enforcement of the Anti-Dumping Act to protect basic American smokestack industry from foreign competition is likely. He is not prohibited from publishing a newspaper of general interest and circulation. Nor is he prohibited from publishing recommendations in somebody else\u2019s bona fide newspaper as an employee, editor, or writer. What he is prohibited from doing is selling to clients advice and counsel, analysis and reports as to the value of specific securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling or holding specific securities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">.

This view necessarily leads us to reject the appellees\u2019 contention that the Act violates equal protection by subjecting investment newsletters, but not bona fide newsletters, to regulation. In holding that the publication of investment advice is regulable commercial activity, we necessarily hold also that such newsletters may be treated differently from other publications. This court previously reached the same conclusion in <em>Wall Street Transcript, </em>422 F.2d at 1378-79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">. Recent Supreme Court decisions suggest that a similar \u201cmiddle level\u201d protection is appropriate for certain kinds of speech, for example, in cases of regulation of commercial advertising <em>(Virginia Pharmacy, </em>425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976)); zoning of theaters which play \u201cadult,\u201d but not obscene, films <em>(Young v.

Thus, whether we view this case as one involving commercial speech or the regulation of the professions, the Investment Advisers Act does not conflict with the First Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">. We leave to another day the question whether a publication dealing only with market indicators generally or making recommendations only as to groups of securities (e.g., air transport, beverages-brewers, mobile homes) could be barred on facts such as those of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1014-6\">VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AN7\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Although, ordinarily, I would be content simply to concur in Judge Oakes\u2019 thoughtful and well-reasoned opinion, the strong protest registered in Judge Brieant\u2019s dissent prompts me to pen this brief concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">At the outset, I agree with Judge Oakes that, if a doctor must be licensed to write prescriptions and a lawyer to argue appeals, there is no reason why, in the public interest, an investment adviser should not be required to register before he can give investment advice. Where the standard for the granting of a license is \u201cpublic interest, convenience, or necessity,\u201d the denial of a license on that ground, if provided for by statute, is not a denial of free speech. <em>See National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 190, 226-27, 63 S.Ct. 997, 1014, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943). It is now settled beyond dispute that, in performing its assigned duties, the SEC acts as a \u201cstatutory guardian charged with safeguarding the public interest in enforcing the securities laws.\u201d <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Management Dynamics, Inc., </em>515 F.2d 801, 808 (2d Cir.1975). .</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Congress was sufficiently concerned about violations of the Investment Advisers Act that it provided severe criminal penalties for willful violations thereof. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-17. The fact that the prohibited acts involve speech does not make them any the less unlawful. \u201cThe use of a printed message to a bank teller requesting money coupled with a threat of violence, the placing of a false representation in a written contract, the forging of a check, and the false statement to a government official, are all familiar acts which constitute crimes despite the use of speech as an instrumentality for the commission thereof.\u201d <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>667 F.2d 835, 842 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">If the giving of investment advice by an unregistered investment adviser is unlawful, a court, after proper hearing, should be able to prohibit it, especially where the prohibited acts constitute a continuation of conduct already found to be unlawful. <em>See Village of Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 496, 102 S.Ct. 1186 (1982); <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec.

A good illustration of the exercise of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>constitutional power can be found in the use of injunctions to restrain unlawful trade practices. <em>See National Soc. of Prof. Engineers v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 697, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 1368, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978). As the Court said in <em>Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 143, 156, 72 S.Ct. 181, 187-188, 96 L.Ed. 162 (1951), \u201cInjunctive relief under \u00a7 4 of the Sherman Act is as appropriate a means of enforcing the Act against newspapers as it is against others.\u201d In short, if, as the dissent agrees, \u201cLowe may not practice as ... an investment adviser,\u201d he should not be permitted to give investment advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Judge Brieant\u2019s concern about the terms of the injunction to be issued by the district court is, I suggest, premature and fails to take into account the skill and ingenuity of Judge Brieant\u2019s colleagues in the district court. The activities of an investment adviser which Lowe unlawfully has been carrying on are described in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(ll). Although, as a general rule, a district court should not content itself with issuing an \u201cobey the law\u201d injunction, it quite properly may frame the injunction in terms of the specific statutory provision which the court concludes has been violated. <em>SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., </em>458 F.2d 1082, 1103 (2d Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>588 F.2d 1256, 1261 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 947, 99 S.Ct. 1426, 59 L.Ed.2d 636 (1979). I have no doubt that, upon remand, the district court can frame an injunction so that Mr. Lowe \u201cwill know what the court intends to forbid.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1015-6\">BRIEANT, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"anl-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">I interpret the majority opinions as commanding the district court, without balancing the equities, to impose an injunction upon appellee Lowe and his affiliates which, at best, will be illusory and unenforceable, and at worst, constitutes a prior judicial restraint upon the publication of regularly issued journals of fact and opinion, \u201cinvestment newsletters,\u201d therein described. Because I regard this prior restraint on publication as inappropriate; neither constitutional in light of the First Amendment; nor required by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cthe Act\u201d); nor justified by our prior decisions; I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">I agree that Lowe may not practice as, nor hold himself out to be, a registered investment adviser under the Act, nor may he engage in any fraudulent activity in connection with his publications. <em>Cf. SEC v. Capital Gains Research Inc., </em>375 U.S. 180, 84 S.Ct. 275, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963); <em>Courtland </em>v. <em>Walston &amp; Co., </em>340 F.Supp. 1076 (S.D.N.Y.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">Lowe\u2019s investment newsletters, fairly described by the majority, are publications of the sort issued on a schedule, rather than timed for release attuned to specific market events. Delivered by mail, they are several days old when read, and convey the same facts and opinion to all readers. Typically such newsletters accept any subscriber who wishes to become such and is willing to pay the standard annual subscriber\u2019s fee. The expression of opinion by that means is poles apart from the traditional giving of investment advice; just as remote as a health care publication <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cPrevention Magazine\u201d) is from the practice of medicine, or a book advising how to avoid probate is remote from the practice of law. The latter require a medical or law degree and a license, while the former are protected First Amendment expression. <em>See New York County Lawyers Association v. Dacey, </em>21 N.Y.2d 694, 287 N.Y.S.2d 422, 234 N.E.2d 459 <em>rev'g., </em>28 A.D.2d 161, 283 N.Y.S.2d 984 (1967); Elman, Commr., <em>dissenting </em>in Rodale <em>Press, Inc., et a1. v.

By reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>of its clandestine or .confidential character, such advice is particularly susceptible to fraud or manipulation. However, the contents of a newspaper are public when published, and the counsel so given is immediately known to all, including the watchful eyes of the SEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Discussion of the issue of so-called \u201ccommercial speech\u201d by the majority is of great interest, but little assistance to the resolution of this case. In my view these newsletters are not \u201ccommercial speech,\u201d any more than our most respected daily newspaper is \u201ccommercial speech.\u201d Lowe is not selling securities or advertising investment advice; he is selling his publications themselves, and his editorial expression of the facts and opinions therein set forth. Like all publishers, Lowe charges subscription fees for his publications. I concede that the readers (subscribers) are seeking opinion and information to aid in their investment decisions, and Lowe intends this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">When readers seek health information, they subscribe to health oriented publications, for spiritual advice they read religious tracts, and for astrology they read sidereal almanacs. Freedom of the press is not limited to the pamphleteer who hands out his tracts free of charge, nor is the right to write, and publish about investments without license limited to \u201cbona fide publications of general and regular circulation,\u201d if those words found in the Act are to be read restrictively so as to exclude any paper eligible to be entered at the post office as second class mail matter. <em>See H. W. Wilson Co. v. United States Postal Service, </em>438 F.Supp. 326 (S.D.N.Y.1977), <em>affd. </em>580 F.2d 33 (2d Cir.1978) (construing prior statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">With characteristic understatement, the court below termed \u201cquestionable\u201d the SEC\u2019s contention that these publications constituted \u201ccommercial speech,\u201d 556 F.Supp. at 1366, and suggested that commercial speech is confined properly to instances of service or product advertising. On appeal, the SEC takes issue with this view, and the majority now rejects it as well, holding that commercial speech is sufficiently broad in scope to encompass the sale of a journal of fact and opinion to paid subscribers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Our attention is directed to the several recent articulations of what constitutes \u201ccommercial speech,\u201d which are said to establish that \u201ccommercial speech\u201d is not confined to advertising, but extends to all \u201cexpression related solely to the economic interest of the speaker and its audience.\u201d <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec.

A fair consideration of recent Supreme Court learning suggests that <em>SEC v.

Ohio State Bar Association, </em>436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978); <em>In re Primus, </em>436 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 1893, 56 L.Ed.2d 417 (1978); Matter <em>of R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 102 S.Ct. 929, 71 L.Ed.2d 64 (1982)]; a ban on the use of \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs by sellers of residential property <em>[Linmark Associates Inc. v. Willingboro, </em>431 U.S. 85, 97 S.Ct. 1614, 52 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977)]; restrictions on the use of trade names by optometrists <em>[Friedman v. Rogers, </em>440 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 887, 59 L.Ed.2d 100 (1979) ]; a ban on advertising by a public utility <em>[Central Hudson Gas, </em>supra]; and, most recently, a federal statutory restriction on advertising mixed with expressions of opinion by manufacturers of prophylactics <em>[Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983)]. See also <em>Metromedia Inc. v. San Diego, </em>453 U.S. 490, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (restrictions on commercial and non-commercial billboard advertising).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">That each of the cases in which the Court has sought to clarify the \u201ccommercial speech\u201d doctrine has arisen in the context of attempts to regulate or prohibit advertising, while significant, does not, standing alone, demonstrate conclusively that commercial speech is restricted to advertising and equivalent economic promotional activities. However, examination of the characteristics of commercial speech which have caused the Supreme Court to accord to it a lesser degree of First Amendment protection demonstrate that since 1976 all speech so considered has been inextricably intertwined with advertising. Thus, in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, supra, </em>reference to commercial speech is in the context of a discussion of advertising, and the interests of both the advertiser and the consumer in the flow of commercial information. Support for the argument that commercial speech essentially comprises some sort of advertising or equivalent economic promotional activity is also found in <em>Central Hudson Gas, supra, </em>in which the Court invalidated a New York State regulation prohibiting the promotion of electricity consumption through advertising. The Court in that case addressed the interests served by commercial expression: \u201cIn applying the First Amendment to this area, we have rejected the \u2018highly paternalistic\u2019 view that government has the complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech .... Even when advertising communicates only an incomplete version of the relevant facts, the First Amendment presumes that some accurate information is better than no information at all.\u201d 447 U.S. at 562, 100 S.Ct. at 2350 (citations omitted). Significantly, the Court in <em>Central Hudson Gas </em>states that the very basis of the First Amendment\u2019s concern for commercial speech is the <em>\u201cinformational function of advertising.\u201d Id. </em>at 563, 100 S.Ct. at 2350, emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">Of greatest interest, probably because it is most recent, is <em>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., supra, </em>where the Court unanimously invalidated a Postal Service prohibition of unsolicited mailings, one of which conveyed \u201ctruthful information relevant to important social issues such as family planning and the prevention of venereal disease.\u201d (Marshall, J. \u2014U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2882). The Court noted that some content-based restrictions on commercial speech are justified in light of the \u201cgreater potential for deception or confusion in the context of certain advertising messages\u201d (at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2879), but also held that \u201cthe mere fact that these pamphlets are conceded to be advertise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>ments clearly does not compel the conclusion that they are commercial speech,\u201d citing <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 265-66, 84 S.Ct. 710, 718-719, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), <em>id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2880.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">I conclude that in the wake of <em>Bolger, </em>commercial speech which goes beyond mere advertising, so as to include expression of fact and opinion implicating (as does an investment newsletter or a health newsletter, or even a racetrack tout sheet), \u201csubstantial individual and societal interests\u201d <em>(id. </em>at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2881), now enjoys full First Amendment protection, at least insofar as prior restraint is concerned. In short, even if these newsletters were commercial speech, which they are not, I believe they would be entitled to full First Amendment protection from prior restraint. As Justice Rehnquist, concurring in <em>Bolger </em>observed, \u201cthe First Amendment, which was designed to prevent the government from suppressing information, requires us \u2018to assume that this information is not in itself harmful, that people will perceive their own interests if only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close them,\u2019 [citation omitted].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2887.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">In explaining why commercial speech should be entitled to a lesser degree of First Amendment protection than other communication, the Court, both in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board </em>and <em>Central Hudson Gas, supra, </em>relied on two aspects of commercial speech which set it apart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-11\">\u201cFirst, commercial speakers have extensive knowledge of <em>both </em>the market <em>and their products. </em>Thus, they are well situated to evaluate the accuracy of their \u25a0 messages and the unlawfulness of the underlying activity. In addition, commercial speech, the offspring of economic self-interest, is a hardy breed of expression that is not particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation.\u201d <em>Central Hudson Gas, </em>447 U.S. at 564, n. 6, 100 S.Ct. at 2350, n. 6, citations omitted, emphasis added. <em>See also Virginia Pharmacy, </em>425 U.S. at 771-72, n. 24, 96 S.Ct. at 1830, n. 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">The difference between such \u201ccommercial speakers\u201d mentioned in <em>Central Hudson Gas </em>and Lowe are readily apparent. The publishers here are not selling their own investments, nor are they urging their subscribers to invest in a business in which the defendants have a financial stake. Lowe\u2019s publications do not comment about <em>his own products; </em>they analyze and evaluate the securities offered by third parties. In this respect, the investment newsletters do not differ in principle from well-known periodicals such as <em>Barron\u2019s, Forbes, </em>or <em>Consumer Reports. </em>Presumably, the majority would not contend that insofar as these publications of general circulation perform a similar function, they would become subject to similar licensure or prior restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">In addition to linking advertising to commercial speech, the Court in <em>Virginia Pharmacy </em>reiterated an earlier definition of commercial speech as expression which does <em>\u201cno more than </em>propose a commercial transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762, 96 S.Ct. at 1825, quoting <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Commission, </em>413 U.S. 376, 385, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2558-2559, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973) (emphasis added). Enough has been said concerning the contents of the Lowe newsletters to demonstrate that they do more than \u201cpropose commercial transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">Finding commercial speech to be \u201csquarely\u201d presented in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, </em>the Court stated that this was because the pharmacist challenging the Commonwealth\u2019s restrictions on his advertising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>\u201cdoes not wish to editorialize on any subject, cultural, philosophical or political. He does not wish to report any particularly newsworthy fact, or to make generalized observations even about commercial matters. The \u2018idea\u2019 he wishes to communicate is simply this: T will sell you X prescription drug at the Y price.\u2019 \u201d 425 U.S. at 761, 96 S.Ct. at 1825.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Here, in contrast, the appellees <em>do </em>seek to report \u201cnewsworthy facts\u201d and make \u201cgeneralized observations\u201d about economic and financial conditions as well as recommending stocks and issuers, the latter inextricably entwined with the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">We address here not the power to regulate, or punish fraud after publication, but the power to impose prior restraint. Investment opinion, in my opinion, is as much speech protected from prior restraint as is political opinion, philosophy or gibberish. Not only for the Zengers, the Patrick Hen-rys and the Ellsbergs was this basic freedom secured, but also for an ex-convict whom the majority assumes to be motivated towards recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">A judicial system which will not enjoin a libel <em>[Brandreth v. Lance, </em>8 Paige Ch. 24 (N.Y.1839) ], and will not enjoin publication of the Pentagon Papers [New <em>York Times Co. v. United States, </em>403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d. 822 (1971)], should not countenance a prior restraint on publication of a regularly issued newsletter containing fact and investment opinion. Even if Lowe\u2019s publications constitute commercial speech, the prior restraint sought to be imposed is unconstitutional. In <em>Central Hudson Gas, supra, </em>the Court held that restraints will be upheld only if \u201cthe regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,\u201d and \u201cit is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\u201d 447 U.S. at 566, 100 S.Ct. at 2351. These restraints do not qualify. See <em>infra, </em>p. 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Any prior restraint comes to Court with a \u201cheavy presumption against its constitutional validity.\u201d <em>Bantam Books v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631, 639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). This results from the devastating impact prior restraints have on the exercise of First Amendment rights, far exceeding a mere \u201cchill\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-12\">\u201cPrior restraints fall on speech with a brutality and a finality all their own. Even if they are ultimately lifted they cause irremediable loss \u2014 a loss in the immediacy, the impact, of speech. They differ from the imposition of criminal liability in significant procedural respects as well, which in turn have their substantive consequences. The violator of a pri- or restraint may be assured of being held in contempt; the violator of a statute punishing speech criminally knows that he will go before a jury, and may be willing to take his chance, counting on a possible acquittal. A prior restraint, therefore, stops more speech more effectively. A criminal statute chills, prior restraint freezes. Indeed it is the hypothesis of the First Amendment that injury is inflicted on our society when we stifle the immediacy of speech.\u201d Bickel, <em>The Morality of Consent, </em>61 (1975), quoted with approval in <em>Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 559, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 2802-2803, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">Because of this devastating effect on freedom of speech, previous restraints will be upheld only in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases, <em>e.g., </em>the \u201cthreat of a grave and immediate danger to the security of the United States,\u201d <em>United States v. New York Times Co., </em>444 F.2d 544 (2d Cir.1971), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822; see also Brennan, J. concurring in <em>New York Times, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 726, 91 S.Ct. at 2147.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">To affirm the trial court here, it is not necessary, in my view, to hold that the Act is facially unconstitutional as a press licensing scheme. Certainly it was not so intended; Congress understood about the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Amendment. Its legislative product should not lightly be construed as intended to effect an unconstitutional result nor to impose an undue or useless degree of regulation upon a constitutionally protected activity. However, if the provision of the Act which exempts a \u201cbona fide [publication] of general and regular circulation,\u201d found at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(11) (1976), is to be read as literally and narrowly as the majority would have it, this means to me that some judge, at the instance of the SEC, will be called upon to adjudicate the <em>bona fide vei male fide </em>of a newspaper, to determine if it is to be subject to prior restraint should it contain investment opinion or \u201crecommend\u201d a security. This leaves a dangerous editorial evaluation in hands not to be trusted with such a decision, and requires a determination for which no satisfactory objective standard is provided. We have held \u201cCourts should be chary of deciding what is and what is not news\u201d [Meskill, J. dissenting in <em>Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, </em>723 F.2d 195, at 215 (2d Cir.1983), a view adopted by majority op. at 194]. I suggest we must be even more chary in undertaking to determine when or whether a publication is \u201cbona fide,\u201d unless such words are regarded as broad enough to comprise <em>all </em>regularly issued publications containing fact and opinion and available to all who would subscribe, as Lowe\u2019s newsletters are.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The Act, as construed by the majority seems both under and over inclusive. In theory, Lowe\u2019s entire expression of views could appear in our favorite local newspaper without official hindrance. Suppose following remand, Lowe should transfer stock ownership of his corporations to a friend and add to his newsletters a tideta-ble, a list of ship arrivals, Ann Landers, a crossword puzzle and selections reprinted from <em>Areopagitical </em>Would his newsletters now be <em>bona fide </em>newspapers, in the eyes of the majority? I submit that on First Amendment and prudential grounds a decision that they would not be is beyond the power of any court to make. In short, I do not question the power of government to license lawyers, doctors, accountants, registered representatives employed by stockbrokers and those giving individualized investment advice or holding themselves out as investment advisers, and similar professionals. However, the right to licensure, and the concomitant power to restrict entry into the licensed occupation, does not in America extend to writers or publishers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Licensing of the press was abandoned in England in 1694, but the memories of this imposition upon the natural rights of man lingered sufficiently to lead to the enactment of the First Amendment almost a century later. An intention to disregard this vital Constitutional imperative should not lightly be imputed to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">I would construe the Act essentially as did the court below. In this connection, I am puzzled by the provision in the majority opinion (At 902), which provides that Lowe is \u201cnot prohibited from publishing a newspaper of general interest and circulation, nor is he prohibited from publishing [investment] recommendations in <em>somebody else\u2019s bona fide </em>newspaper as an employee, editor or writer.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">I fail to see how it can be adjudged that Lowe can exercise his First Amendment protected expressions as to investments, but only so long as he is not himself the owner or proprietor of the publication in which his views appear. Such a distinction must assume that the owner or proprietor of a <em>bona fide </em>newspaper will exercise some control over Lowe\u2019s writings so as to prevent fraud. There is no assurance that this would be so. And I am appalled by the thought that in order to enforce the injunction to be granted on remand, the trial court may be required to snoop into the corporate records of a publication to find out whether it is directly or indirectly owned by Lowe, in order to make the adjudication as to whether or not it is <em>\u201csomebody else\u2019s </em>bona fide newspaper.\u201d A court of equity should not utter an injunction which might give rise to such intrusions in a First Amendment protected area such as a newspaper office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">There are prudential reasons apart from the Constitutional issues heretofore discussed, which militate against the granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>of injunctive relief in the form directed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">I cannot express a better description of a typical investment newsletter than that found in the majority opinion; whether in recommending specific stocks or predicting near and long term market trends, Lowe, and the typical investment newsletter writer is in effect \u201cpublishing or stating his views as to any matter of current interest, economic or otherwise, such as the likelihood of war, the trend in interest rates, whether the next election will affect market conditions, or whether future enforcement of the Anti-Dumping Act to protect basic American smokestack industry from foreign competition is likely.\u201d (Majority at 902). Yet that is what the majority says Lowe is <em>not, </em>on remand, to be prohibited from doing. He will become a criminal contemnor if, but only if, he writes and publishes \u201cas to the value of specific securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling or holding specific securities.\u201d (At 902). While footnote 7 of the opinion purports to reserve decision <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cleave to another day\u201d) as to whether Lowe may publish \u201cdealing with market indicators generally,\u201d and \u201cmaking recommendations only as to groups of securities,\u201d (at 902, n. 7), no logical basis is presented for the court on remand to allow the recommendation of groups of securities but not individual stocks. Faced with the necessity of framing an injunction which preserves Lowe\u2019s conceded right to express his views as to the effect of current events on market conditions, and yet prevents any \u201crecommendation\u201d of specific securities, the district judge will be confronted with extreme difficulty. The injunctive decree of a court of equity must be intelligible and practical; it must draw a bright line, and should produce benefits at least equal to its social burdens. Equity requires that those enjoined receive \u201cexplicit notice of precisely what conduct is allowed.\u201d <em>Schmidt v. Lessard, </em>414 U.S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 38 L.Ed.2d 661 (1974). In <em>Diapulse Corp. of America v. Carba Ltd., </em>626 F.2d 1108, 1111 (2d Cir. 1980) we held, per Judge Van Graafeiland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-6\">\u201cA court is required to frame its orders so that those who must obey them will know what the Court intends to forbid .... It is for this reason that Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d), like its predecessor, provides that every order granting an injunction shall be specific in terms and describe in reasonable detail the acts sought to be restrained. An order which does not satisfy the requirement of specificity and definiteness will not withstand appellate scrutiny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Xz\"><em>See also, United States v. Charmer Industries, Inc., </em>722 F.2d 1073 (2d Cir.1983) <em>(Charmer II) Schurr v. Austin Galleries of Illinois, Inc., </em>719 F.2d 571 (2d Cir.1983) (Van Graafeiland, J. concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">This requirement is especially important where First Amendment freedoms are implicated. <em>Organization For a Better Austin v. Keefe, </em>402 U.S. 415, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971); <em>Near v. Minnesota, </em>283 U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931). The injunction which the majority commands cannot be framed in compliance with the directions given, so as to insure that constitutionally protected expression will not be stifled, along with the investment advice on specific issues which the Court finds Lowe may no longer express.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">In a ease involving an attempt to enjoin the showing of motion pictures, the Fifth Circuit noted the difficulty inherent in attempting to enjoin future expression on the basis of unprotected past conduct, where a statute permitted the closing for one year of any theatre which had exhibited an obscene film:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-11\">\u201cThus, [under the statute] future conduct that may fall within the purview of the first amendment is absolutely prohibited after a finding of unprotected present conduct. It was precisely this practice that was condemned by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of <em>Near v. Minnesota.\u201d Universal Amusement Co., Inc. v. Vance, </em>587 F.2d 159, 165 (5th Cir. 1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">While stated in the context of an attempt to prevent obscenity, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning is applicable to this case as well. In light of the difficulty of framing an injunction which would prevent Lowe from recommending specific securities, while at the same time preserving his right to comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>on \u201cany matter of current interest,\u201d any injunction issued will have the effect of stifling constitutionally protected expression, thus amounting to an impermissible prior restraint on publications which have not yet been found to constitute \u201cinvestment advice.\u201d <em>Cf. Universal Amusement Co., Inc., supra </em>at 169. Lowe\u2019s difficulty in knowing what will violate the terms of an injunction formulated according to this Court\u2019s directive will result in \u201cself-censorship, a particularly subtle and most insidious form of the malady\u201d of prior restraint. <em>Universal Amusement Co., Inc., supra </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Probably, following remand, this articulate litigant will demonstrate what a panel of this Court has previously described as an \u201cability to improvise and [a] flair for the creative\u201d and bring about the same difficulty encountered when, in response to an overly broad injunction, oenologist Walter S. Taylor began to refer to himself as \u201cWalter S. Xxxxxx,\u201d and depict himself on his wine bottles in a \u201cLone Ranger\u201d type mask. <em>See Taylor Wine Co., Inc. v. Bully Hill Vineyards, Inc., </em>590 F.2d 701, 702-03 (2d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Injunctions which are unclear or easily set at naught should not be issued in the first place. There exists already more than adequate statutory protection, both penal and civil, against mail fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in writing about investments. An injunction of this sort, particularly because of its illusory character, will add little to the protection of the public. This is especially true in this case because the majority will apparently allow Lowe to express his opinions freely and without limitation \u201cin somebody else\u2019s bona fide newspaper as an employee, editor, or writer\u201d (At 902).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Any balancing of the equities, essential before any injunction is granted, should weigh the benefit to the public (nil in this case because of the injunction\u2019s vague, subjective and illusory nature) against the burdens on those enjoined, severe in this case because free expression may be enjoyed only at great personal risk to Lowe, or his potential news publishing employers who might have to prove they are <em>bona fide </em>and not indirectly owned by Lowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">This is not to mention the impossible burden of enforcement imposed on the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">And for what is all this great effort? I agree with Chief Judge Weinstein below that \u201cthe censorship that the SEC would impose on Lowe is more extreme than necessary to effectuate the congressional goal of a confident and informed investing public,\u201d (556 F.Supp. at 1366) and therefore a balancing of the equities requires that no injunction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Essentially for the foregoing reasons, as well as those expressed by Chief Judge Weinstein in his opinion below, I believe that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">. It must be noted that <em>Wall Street Transcript </em>was a \u201cchilling\u201d case, not a prior restraint case. When a contention is advanced that First Amendment rights are being chilled by official action, a Court is required only to balance the interest being served by the governmental action against the degree of chill. <em>See Waterfront Commission v. Local 1814, Longshoremen, etc., </em>667 F.2d 267 (2d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">Similarly, <em>Savage v. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, </em>548 F.2d 192 (7th Cir. 1977) relied on by the majority, is distinguishable. In <em>Savage, </em>Judge Moore was concerned only with the question of whether the Commission\u2019s order refusing petitioner\u2019s registration as a commodity trading adviser should be reversed. Although petitioner so argued, prior restraint of the press was not an issue in that case. The gist of <em>Savage may be </em>found in the comment by the Court that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">\u201c[I]t has long been recognized that the [First] Amendment does not remove a business engaged in the communication of information from general laws regulating business practices.\u201d Citing <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v.

But see, <em>SEC v. Blavin, </em>557 F.Supp. 1304, 1310 (E.D.Mich.1983) in which, in addition to protecting the right to publish, the Court required the SEC to grant defendant registration as an investment adviser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">. One of the pamphlets in <em>Bolger </em>purported to be an expression of fact and opinion rather than an advertisement.

See n. 4, <em>Bolger, supra, </em>at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2879.
