The District Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after considering conflicting evidence on whether use of CB radios would promote public safety, held that the statute violated the Interstate Commerce Clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that it was preempted by federal law and issued a permanent injunction against its enforcement. Since we agree that Congress has preempted state regulation in this area, we affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-19\">In the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-261, 96 Stat. 1102, Congress undertook to \u201creduce unnecessary and burdensome Government regulation\u201d of the intercity bus industry, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2, in order to promote \u201ca safe, sound, competitive, and fuel-efficient motor bus system,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3. As part of its focus on safety, Congress, in \u00a7 25 of the Act, addressed the question whether bus drivers should be allowed to use CB radios. After considering evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>in favor of allowing the use of CB\u2019s and noting that three federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, had adopted a policy to encourage CB\u2019s, see H.R.Rep. No. 334, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 48-49 (1981), Congress nonetheless declined to pass a bill that would have required bus companies to allow CB radios<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and decided that further study was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Section 25 directs the Secretary of Transportation to commission a study by the National Academy of Sciences and, after receiving the Academy\u2019s report and recommendations, to initiate a rulemaking proceeding. In accordance with this scheme, \u00a7 25(d)(1) added a new section to the United States Code, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11111 (West Supp.1983), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u00a7 11111. Use of citizen band radios on buses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">(a) (1) A motor carrier of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under sub-chapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall allow the operator of any motor vehicle providing such transportation to temporarily install and operate a citizen band radio in such vehicle <em>if </em>the Secretary of Transportation issues a rule or regulation which recommends that operators of such vehicles be allowed to temporarily install and operate such radios in such vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">(2) Citizen band radios installed and operated in motor vehicles providing transportation of passengers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be installed and operated in accordance with the guidelines established by the Secretary of Transportation under section 25(c) of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">(b) The Commission shall issue such regulations as it considers necessary to carry out this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">The language of \u00a7 11111, standing alone, indicates that Congress intended to vest sole authority in the Secretary of Transportation to determine whether requiring bus companies to allow their drivers to use CB radios would promote public safety. The clear implication is that unless the Secretary issues a rule or regulation permitting it, such use is prohibited. We are also persuaded by Congress\u2019s evident intent to alleviate the problem of nonuniform state regulation in general. Congress found \u201cthat State regulation of the motor bus industry has, in certain circumstances, unreasonably burdened interstate commerce .. .. \u201d Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, \u00a7 3, 96 Stat. 1102, 1102. Representative Clausen, the ranking minority member of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, elaborated on this point during floor debates in the House:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-15\">[I]t is important to recognize that the intercity bus industry is part of a national transportation system and to the degree it is regulated, it should be treated as such .... Otherwise, transportation service becomes balkanized ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">127 Cong.Rec. H8588 (daily ed. Nov. 19, 1981). No state other than Missouri regulates the use of CB radios on interstate passenger buses.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">The State concedes that \u00a7 11111 gives the Secretary of Transportation authority to regulate the use of CB radios, but argues, relying on <em>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>435 U.S. 151, 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 988, 1001, 55 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978), that since the Secretary has not yet addressed and acted upon the question, the Missouri law is not preempted. However, in <em>Ray </em>the authorizing statute was silent as to the effect of the Secretary\u2019s failure to regulate. Here, in contrast, \u00a7 11111 requires companies to allow bus drivers to use CB radios only \u201cif\u201d the Secretary makes the recommendation. The Court in <em>Ray </em>recognized that when Congress entrusts the Secretary with authority to determine whether a practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>would promote public safety, \u201cCongress intend[s] uniform national standards ... that would foreclose the imposition of different ... state requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 98 S.Ct. at 997. Here, as in <em>Ray, </em>\u201c[enforcement of the state requirements would at least frustrate what seems to us to be the evident congressional intention to establish a uniform federal regime\u201d regarding the use of CB radios. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 98 S.Ct. at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 11111 preempts the Missouri statute and affirm the grant of the injunction against its enforcement. We direct the District Court, however, to retain jurisdiction pending the outcome of the rulemaking proceeding prescribed by \u00a7 11111 and, if necessary, to vacate or modify the injunction to correspond with the Secretary\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Affirmed with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\">. The statute reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">A bus transportation company shall allow the driver or operator of a bus to temporarily install and operate in the bus a citizens band radio, technically limited to transmit and receive frequency of 27.065 megahertz and 27.-185 megahertz, including earphones, antenna and any necessary equipment purchased and installed by the licensed driver or operator of the bus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-11\">. The Hon. Joseph E. Stevens, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri. The District Court\u2019s opinion is not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-20\">. U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-21\">. The District Court held that the Missouri statute was impliedly preempted by the Department of Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (1976) (current version at 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101 (West Supp.1983)) and by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, 49 C.F.R. pts. 390-397 (1982). Our holding, on the other hand, rests on 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11111 (West Supp. 1983), and we affirm on that basis. See, <em>e.g., Brown v. St. Louis Police Dep\u2019t, </em>691 F.2d 393, 396 (8th Cir.1982). We find it unnecessary to decide whether the Missouri statute is preempted by the federal laws relied upon by the District Court, as well, or to decide whether the statute violates the Interstate Commerce Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b569-13\">.
