Green, J., granting federal defendants\u2019 motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>cate that court\u2019s previously issued injunction. The injunction barred defendants from authorizing the export of bobcats until guidelines were issued satisfying the requirements this court set out in <em>Defenders of Wildlife v. ESSA, </em>659 F.2d 168 (D.C.Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>454 U.S. 963, 102 S.Ct. 503, 70 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) <em>(\u201cDefenders </em>I\u201d). Judge Green ruled that Congress, in a subsequent amendment to the Endangered Species Act, Pub.L. No. 97-304, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1537a, overruled the decision in <em>Defenders I, </em>thereby removing the basis for the injunction. Accordingly, she vacated the injunction under Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 60(b)(5). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The bobcat (lynx rufus) is found throughout the United States in sufficient numbers that it is not listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531-1543 (1982). International trade in bobcats, however, is governed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, <em>opened for signature </em>March 3, 1973, 27 U.S.T. 1087, T.I.A.S. No. 8249 (\u201cCITES\u201d). By virtue of its membership in the cat family, the bobcat is included in Appendix II of CITES as a species \u201cwhich although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation.\u201d Under Article IV, Sec. 2 of CITES, exports of Appendix II animals are authorized only to the extent that each nation\u2019s \u201cScientific Authority\u201d determines that \u201csuch export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species... . \u201d Currently, the Fish and Wildlife Service, an arm of the Department of Interior, through its Office of Scientific Authority, is the United States agency for purposes of making \u201cno detriment\u201d findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">CITES deals solely with international trade in the listed species. Neither CITES nor the Endangered Species Act, which implemented CITES,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> deals with the actual killing of bobcats. Primary responsibility for the protection, management, and regulation of killing of bobcats in this country rests with the states. Although CITES requires \u201cno detriment\u201d findings from each nation as a whole, the Fish and Wildlife Service summarizes data collected by the states, and issues its findings on a state by state basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">In 1979, Defenders of Wildlife brought suit challenging the federal findings of \u201cno detriment\u201d for thirty-five states and the Navajo Nation for the 1979-80 season, and the guidelines under which those findings were made. Those guidelines, which were based on the recommendations of a Working Group composed of scientists and wildlife managers, measure detriment primarily by population trend data. This court held those guidelines invalid on the ground that they failed to consider total bobcat population in each state or the number to be killed in a particular season in each state, and required the Scientific Authority to await the development of that additional data before authorizing the export of bobcats. 659 F.2d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">On remand, the district court, on April 23, 1981, permanently enjoined defendants \u201cfrom authorizing export of bobcats taken or killed subsequently to July 1, 1981, until they promulgate guidelines consistent with the Court of Appeals decision and make findings on the basis of those guidelines.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>On October 13, 1982, the Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-403, were signed into law. Section 5(1) of those amendments (\u201cthe amendment\u201d) added paragraph c(2) to Section 8A of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1537a (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">The Secretary<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> shall base the determinations and advice given by him under Article IV of the Convention <em>[i.e., </em>CITES] with respect to wildlife upon the best available biological information derived from professionally accepted wildlife management practices; but is not required to make, or require any state to make, estimates of population size in making such determinations or giving such advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In addition, Congress provided that this paragraph was effective from January 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">This appeal concerns the extent to which Congress overruled <em>Defenders I. </em>Appellant argues that Congress eliminated only the need for population data, and that information on projected kill levels from each state is still necessary before a \u201cno detriment\u201d finding can be issued for that state. Thus, they argue that the district court\u2019s injunction should have been modified, not vacated. Judge Green held that Congress overruled both requirements set forth in <em>Defenders I, </em>thereby removing the basis for the injunction. Based on our reading of the language and legislative history of the amendment, we agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Our objective is to \u201cascertain the Congressional intent and give effect to the legislative will.\u201d <em>Philbrook v. Glodgett, </em>421 U.S. 707, 713, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44 L.Ed.2d 525 (1975). The starting point in interpreting a statute, of course, is the language of the provision. <em>E.g., Consumer Product Safety Commn. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 107, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2055, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). Appellant relies principally on the negative implication of the second clause of the amendment, which reads \u201cbut [the Secretary] is not required to make, or require any state to make, estimates of population size in making such determinations or giving such advice.\u201d Appellant argues that since Congress expressly stated that the Secretary need not generate, or require state authorities to generate, population estimates before making \u201cno detriment\u201d findings, but was silent in regard to projected kill levels, Congress left intact the part of <em>Defenders I </em>requiring the Secretary to consider kill levels. As support for this argument, appellant points out that language which would have allowed the Secretary discretion to require the establishment of target kill levels was dropped from the final version of the amendment. <em>See </em>section 4 of H.R. 6133, as adopted by the House Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife Conservation and the Environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s reading of the language of the amendment. In <em>Defenders I, </em>the court stated the appropriate methodology to be used in making \u201cno detriment\u201d findings. Rejecting the Working Group\u2019s recommendation that population trend data be used instead of absolute population figures, the court stated that \u201c[w]e do not see how, without adequate information on total bobcat population and the number to be killed in a particular season, the Scientific Authority can make a valid determination of \u2018no detriment\u2019.\u201d 659 F.2d at 177. Defenders of Wildlife erroneously reads that language as mandating that each requirement be considered independently of the other. On the contrary, the opinion concluded that \u201c[t]he two factors \u2014 population and number to be killed \u2014 are so interrelated that a valid finding of \u2018no detriment\u2019 cannot be made without adequate data about both of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, even if Congress\u2019s only action were to remove the population requirement, we could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>accept the argument that Congress, by its silence, intended to preserve the kill level requirement since, as this court said, that requirement is meaningless by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Congress, however, did not merely remove the population level requirement. We need only look to the first clause of the amendment, which appellant\u2019s brief ignores, to see that Congress affirmatively replaced the <em>Defenders I </em>methodology with a different approach: the Secretary shall now use \u201cthe best available biological information derived from professionally accepted wildlife management practices\u201d in making \u201cno detriment\u201d findings. At oral argument, appellant conceded that had the amendment stopped there, its argument about selective overruling would fail. We do not read the second clause with a negative implication, as we must for appellant to prevail. Instead, we view it as emphasizing that, while information on population levels may be relevant, it is not so essential that it must be generated by the federal government if unavailable from state wildlife authorities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The legislative history of the amendment supports our conclusion, based on our reading of the statutory language, that Congress did not selectively overrule <em>Defenders I. </em>The House, Senate, and Conference Reports all mention <em>Defenders </em>J, and state that the amended section 8A \u201coverrules\u201d that decision. H.R.Rep. No. 97-567, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1982) (House Report); S. Rep. No. 97-418, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1982) (Senate Report); H.Conf.Rep. No. 97-835, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1982), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, 2807. Appellant quotes one House member who interprets the amendment as \u201cselectively\u201d overruling that portion of our opinion that requires reliable population estimates. 128 Cong.Rec.H. 3248 (daily ed. June 8, 1982) (remarks by Rep. Schneider). We do not consider the remarks of a single member of Congress as particularly weighty, particularly since none of the Reports uses the term \u201cselectively\u201d when describing the effect of the amendment upon our prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The Reports evidence a clear rejection of the methodology stated in <em>Defenders I. </em>They state that \u201cthe ruling of the court is not based on sound wildlife management.\u201d House Report at 29; Senate Report at 22, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, at 2829. The House Report states that the court\u2019s \u201cfinding has caused serious concern in the professional wildlife community,\u201d noting in particular the population and kill level requirement. House Report at 16-17, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, at 2816. The House Report then goes on to describe the testimony given by wildlife managers to the effect that it is virtually impossible to establish reliable population estimates for an elusive species like bobcat, House Report at 16-17; and that it is also unnecessary to do so in view of the fact that estimates of population trends, readily ascertainable from \u201chabitat information, in-dices of population size, age and sex structure, and harvest information\u201d are equally reliable indicators of the condition of a population. House Report at 29; Senate Report at 22, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, at 2829.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Furthermore, both the House and Senate Reports contain identical language expressly addressing kill level data which lends support to our conclusion that such data is not required: \u201cIn making his CITES findings, the Secretary <em>may </em>require the establishment of target harvest levels and tagging procedures to ensure that export of any species . .. will not be detrimental to the survival of the species.\u201d House Report at 30, Senate Report at 23 (emphasis added), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, at 2830. Appellant points to the fact that this language appeared in an earlier version of the bill but was dropped as evidence of congressional intent to leave the kill level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>requirement intact. We disagree. First, that the language was dropped from the text of the bill, remaining only in the Reports, indicates to us nothing more than that the language was deemed unnecessary since the \u201cbest available information\u201d standard already allowed use of kill data at the discretion of the Secretary. Second, we think it highly unlikely that language giving the Secretary discretion to require the use of kill levels would survive in both Reports if in fact Congress intended to mandate their use. Thus, nothing in the language or legislative history of the amendment gives us any reason to doubt the statements in House, Senate, and Conference Committee Reports that Congress \u201coverruled\u201d <em>Defenders I.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That being so, we agree with the district court\u2019s holding that the basis for its injunction had been statutorily removed, and affirm the vacation of its injunction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Appellant contends that, even if the district court was correct in vacating its injunction, it should have retained jurisdiction so that it could monitor federal defendants\u2019 conduct for at least one complete season. Appellant points to the observation in <em>Defenders I </em>that \u201cthe Scientific Authority often seemed primarily concerned with an acceptable basis for authorizing bobcat exports despite the absence of convincing factual grounds for making no detriment findings,\u201d 659 F.2d at 178, and the district court\u2019s statement that defendants\u2019 subsequent guidelines for the 1981-82 season, which were rejected as not satisfying <em>Defenders I, </em>\u201cdemonstrate an unchanged attitude.\u201d December 15, 1981 Mem. Op. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">We agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action. Congress, through the amendments to the Endangered Species Act, has announced a new standard for the federal defendants to follow. Thus, plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the prior guidelines as violative of the old <em>Defenders I </em>standard is now moot. While a court may retain jurisdiction over an action despite the voluntary cessation of illegal activity if it suspects that \u201cthe wrong may be repeated,\u201d <em>De Funis v. Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 318, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 1707, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974) (per curiam); <em>United States v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>345 U.S. 629, 632-33, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897-98, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953), in this case the entire basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction has been removed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">The federal defendants have responsibility in the first instance to incorporate Congress\u2019s mandate into guidelines and to make findings pursuant to those guidelines using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>\u201cthe best available biological information derived from professionally accepted practices used in wildlife management.\u201d On April 18,1983, the Fish and Wildlife Service published its final 1982-83 guidelines and findings of \u201cno detriment\u201d for exports of bobcat from 37 states, the Klamath Tribe and the Navajo Nation. 48 Fed.Reg. 16,494, 16,496. As the district court held, any challenge to the guidelines and findings constitutes a new case or controversy, and must come in the form of a new action. <em>Center for National Policy v. Richardson, </em>534 F.2d 351 (D.C.Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Because the district court correctly held that 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1537a removed the basis for its injunction, and any further challenge to the federal defendants\u2019 compliance with bobcat export regulations must be brought in a subsequent action, the opinion of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ai_v\">. Federal defendant appellees are the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) and the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ment of Interior. When this lawsuit was initiated in 1979, ESSA was the Scientific Authority and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service was the Management Authority under the Convention. In December, 1979, Congress amended the Endangered Species Act, and directed the Fish and Wildlife Service to perform both functions. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1537a (Supp. III 1979). Subsequently, the Fish and Wildlife Service created the office of Scientific Authority to perform the duties of the Scientific Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Defendant-Intervenors include the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which represents state wildlife authorities, the Fur Conservation Institute of America, and various individual fur trappers and buyers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-12\">. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-13\">. <em>Defenders of Wildlife v.

It is true, as appellant argues, that the Reports concentrate on explaining why population estimates are not needed, and say little about estimates of kill levels. However, we think that lop-sided treatment is readily explained by the former requirement being the more burdensome of the two requirements established in <em>Defenders I, </em>and by Congress\u2019s feeling the need to stress that while exact population figures may be the best <em>possible </em>data, they are not always the best <em>available </em>data. In any event, we decline to infer from it that Congress meant to concentrate on the former requirement to the exclusion of the later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. Appellants contend that the district court\u2019s vacation of its injunction created a conflict with our obligations under CITES. They argue that after Defenders <em>I, </em>the Secretary was required, as a matter of treaty obligation, to obtain population and kill level data before making \u201cno detriment\u201d findings. While Congress can, as a matter of domestic law, abrogate treaty obligations, it must do so clearly, <em>e.g., Menominee Tribe v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 404, 412-13, 88 S.Ct. 1705, 1710-11, 20 L.Ed.2d 697 (1969) quoting <em>Pigeon River Co. v. Cox Co., </em>291 U.S. 138, 160, 54 S.Ct. 361, 367, 78 L.Ed. 695 (1934). Appellants argue that since Congress was silent on the kill level requirement, that requirement remains in force as a matter of treaty obligation. Since we find, however, that Congress clearly overruled <em>Defenders I, </em>we need not address appellant\u2019s argument concerning the force of <em>Defenders I </em>in creating treaty obligations. The district court\u2019s vacation of its injunction, allowing for implementation of the \u201cbest available biological information\u201d standard, then, creates no conflict with our obligations under CITES.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b843-14\">. Even if the case were not moot, there is no reason to believe that the FWS would show hostility toward enforcing the new standard, since it squares with the approach the FWS has advocated throughout this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
