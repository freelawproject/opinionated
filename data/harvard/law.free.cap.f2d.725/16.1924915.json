Elfvin, Judge) denying his motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in a suit brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1982). Kuzma, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>had obtained a judgment ordering the United States Postal Service and the Chief Postal Inspector to disclose four pages of material concerning an investigation of himself and his business. Judge Elfvin rejected the Service\u2019s claim of an investigatory records\u2019 exemption based on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">In <em>Crooker v. United States Department of the Treasury, </em>634 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1980), we ruled that the attorney\u2019s fee provision of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), did not authorize recovery of an attorney\u2019s fee by a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner who had prevailed in his FOIA lawsuit. We held out the possibility that a <em>pro se </em>litigant might be entitled to some fee award if he could show that he had forgone an opportunity to earn \u201cregular income for a day or more in order to prepare and pursue a <em>pro se </em>suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. Kuzma makes no claim that his <em>pro se </em>activity in this lawsuit caused him the loss of any such opportunity. Instead, he contends that Crookeds denial of a <em>pro se </em>attorney\u2019s fee should be limited to prisoners. We see no basis for any distinction between prisoners and all other <em>pro se </em>litigants with respect to FOIA attorney\u2019s fees. All but one of the circuits considering the issue have denied such fees to all <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>Clarkson v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>678 F.2d 1368 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Federal Bureau of Investigation, </em>664 F.2d 383 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Crooker v. United States Department of Justice, </em>632 F.2d 916 (1st Cir.1980); <em>Burke v. United States Department of Justice, </em>559 F.2d 1182 (10th Cir.1977); <em>see Barrett v. Bureau of Customs, </em>651 F.2d 1087 (5th Cir.1981) (construing similar fee provision of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(3)(B) (1982)), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 950, 102 S.Ct. 1454, 71 L.Ed.2d 665 (1982); <em>contra, Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, </em>553 F.2d 1360 (D.C.Cir.1977) (allowing fee to lawyer acting <em>pro se </em>and approving <em>Holly v. Acree, </em>72 F.R.D. 115 (D.D.C.1976) (non-lawyer <em>pro </em>se), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Holly v. Chasen, </em>569 F.2d 160 (D.C.Cir.1977) (table)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">Kuzma\u2019s claim for an attorney\u2019s fee of $1,000 was properly denied. The Government informed us at oral argument that it has no objection to Kuzma\u2019s claim for costs and disbursements totaling $110.04. Accordingly, the order is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause remanded for entry of an order allowing Kuzma $110.04. Since Kuzma has not prevailed on his claim for an attorney\u2019s fee and has secured only 10% of the total amount he sought in the District Court, we decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>allow him the costs of this appeal.
